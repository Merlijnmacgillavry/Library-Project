It requires a rigorous transition of the global energy system in a very short time span. Though, the published energy scenarios that focus on 1.5 ̊C are limited (Peters, 2016). In this thesis, a backcasting study is conducted to develop a global energy transition scenario to stay within 1.5 ̊C, reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The backcasting framework comprises of six different steps of analysing: 1) goals and constraints, 2) current production and consumption, 3) future demand for energy services, 4) final energy demand, 5) outline the energy supply, 6) describe the implications. The growing population and economy are expected to come with an increase in demand for energy services in the coming decades. Especially in developing countries, a catch up is foreseen. Efficiency improvements and use of more efficient technologies nevertheless enable a decrease of total primary energy supply between 2014 and 2050 (-21%). Furthermore, the final electricity demand triples in this scenario (up to 241 EJ by 2050) of which 73% is met by photovoltaics and wind. Electricity should be derived from 100% renewable sources by as soon as 2040. Despite the rapid decarbonization, the carbon budget for 1.5 ̊C is exceeded. In total, 680 Gt CO2 is emitted from fossil fuel combustion and cement between 2014 and 2050, of which more than 78% is emitted between 2014 and 2030. Total additional negative emissions would still be required of between 370 and 587 Gt CO2 by the end of this century. A potential pitfall of the proposed transition is that the unilateral focus on mitigating climate change could result in new environmental problems such as intoxication of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (UNEP, 2016). Integrated research is required to understand the implications and make trade-offs more explicit.","energy transition; Climate Mitigation; 1.5 degrees; energy; backcasting; Scenario planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

However these studies do not reveal anything on the flow behaviour around the body. In the recent past, various flow visualization techniques have been applied to investigate the flow behaviour around bobsleighs. Even though these studies have highlighted the qualitative flow features, there is a lack of a deep insight into the wake flow topology and the behaviour of the flow structures that are formed in the highly three-dimensional flow. Additionally, when the bobsleigh moves in a curvilinear path, the front cowling rotates with respect to the rear cowling, causing an increase in the frontal area exposed to the wind and in turn a higher drag. However, this perception is not quite straightforward and requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and sources of drag generation, in particular at different front cowling angles.<br/><br/>Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry has been used to study the near-wake flow topology of a scaled bobsleigh model. From the velocity field information obtained from PIV, the pressure field in the wake of the bobsleigh model is determined from the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE) using the methodology outlined by Oudheusden [41]. With the knowledge of the velocity and the pressure fields, the aerodynamic drag is computed using the control volume approach on a wake plane which is at approximately two diameters from the model. The drag obtained from PIV is compared to that obtained from balance measurements. The effects of different bobsleigh configurations on the aerodynamic drag is observed. Secondly, uncertainty quantification of the aerodynamic drag is performed. Finally, a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis is performed for the velocity fluctuations in order to gain an insight on the motion of the flow structures formed in the wake.<br/><br/>The investigation of the near wake flow topology of the bobsleigh reveals the presence of two counter-rotating vortices with a significant downwash between them in case of the reference configuration. The motion and behaviour of these vortices is obtained by performing the PIV analysis on multiple vertical wake planes. The investigation of the effect of the front cowling misalignment on the drag reveals that there is a reduction of drag for smaller misalignment angles (upto 5°) and a marginal increase in drag for further increase of misalignment (from 5° to 20°). From the analysis of aerodynamic drag conducted on a vertical plane that is approximately two diameters behind the model, it can be seen that the momentum deficit is the highest contributor to the aerodynamic drag (88%) followed by the Reynolds stresses (9%) and pressure (3%). It is also observed that the aerodynamic drag obtained is in good agreement with the results obtained from the balance measurements with a variation of only 2 to 3%. The uncertainty analysis of drag shows that among the different flow variables which affect the drag, the average pressure has the maximum uncertainty. Finally, the POD analysis of the velocity fluctuations shows that the first two fluctuating modes which are the most energetic are not perfectly correlated to each other due to the highly three-dimensional nature of the flow.","Bobsleigh; Aerodynamic drag; PIV; Wind Tunnel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

It is almost uncontestable common knowledge that migration is an indispensable factor to propel difference and change, thus ensuring genetic variation, and ultimately evolution for all life forms. For most species migration is the rule, not the exception. Yet, when referring to human migration, the discussions suddenly turn highly controversial. Underpinning the expected arguments that tie these discussions to human exceptionalism and speciesism, one encounters the deeply rooted links of sedentarism to diverse projects of State formation, the construction of society and its cultural and territorial arrangements into bounded, legible schemes and models. <br/>Arguably, a narrowing vision, which simultaneously claims to capture and organize an otherwise complex and messy reality, is a necessary and effective frame to focus on particular forms of knowledge over and against others. Nevertheless, as is increasingly evident, such narrow frames not only simplify, but also reduce reality, offering static, fixed and schematic falsifications of it, removed as it were, from the actual phenomena to which they allude. Human migration is especially prone to the effects of such simplification, leading to a reduced understanding of the migration phenomenon itself, the multiple agents which emerge from it and that shape it, and their relationality as constitutive of a milieu, or metabolism. For migration, this has a paralyzing effect, as it limits and compartamentalizes the capacity to act in relation to it. <br/>Other discursive schemes (of subject formation) that allow us to think and act differently, creatively and critically in relation to migration are paramount, especially if the intentionality is to physically intervene within it. In other words, migration and migrant agents, when liberated from the grasp of conventionally reductive and simplifying frames, reveal their intricate participation in an ecology that not only engenders the becoming of form, space, matter and subjectivity, but which also shapes specifically human practices and relations. In short, understanding migration as a complex assemblage driven by desire and other, previously unseen forces is to regard it as a process of becoming. Seen from this angle, concepts conventionally associated to human migration –from migrating subjects, territories, borders, to structures and systems-, become fields of latent potentiality and productive possibilities. It is at this juncture when –perhaps appropriately so- we may begin exercising different forms of nomadic thought when dealing with migration.<br/>The proposal departs from the premise that different theoretical and discursive frameworks are necessary to rethink and act upon the very urgent problem of human migration from a metabolic, relational and systemic point of view. It will do so by introducing and explaining an unconventional approach in which three different ‘logics’ will encounter each other in an attempt to recalibrate the reach of the spatial disciplines and material practices, in particular architecture, within the phenomenon of contemporary human migration: population thinking, intensive thinking and topological thinking.","Ecology; Relational; Morphogenesis; Migration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The human activities produce both direct and indirect carbon emission that is contributing to the climate change. The construction industry itself contributes around 30 percent of total carbon emissions in the world. Thus, the challenge is to solve the problem of meeting the increasing needs and expectations of a growing population while at the same time modifying the current production and consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable development model. Based on this, the need for the sustainable structural element is inevitable. Extending the exploitation life of the structural element is one of the solutions that should be looked. Reusing instead of recycling the structural element is one of the ways to extend the exploitation life which can reduce the carbon emission. Therefore the innovation in the structural design to reduce the carbon emission is important.<br/>The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of a conceptual design of demountable structural system. On the first part of the thesis, it investigated the structural behaviour of a composite floor beam that consists of steel beam, prefabricated concrete deck and a single embedded nut bolt shear connector in the SLS condition. To accommodate fabrication tolerance and construction process, the bolt shear connector must have enough clearance. Various bolt-hole gap in bolt shear connector is applied to see the effect on structural performance of composite floor beam in SLS. The study of demountable composite floor beam is performed by mean of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that the bolt-hole gap clearance influences the deflection of composite floor beam due to partial interaction between prefabricated concrete deck and steel beam which leads to incomplete interaction of composite floor beam. The bigger hole clearance, the higher deflection occurs on composite floor beam.<br/>The second part of the thesis explores the conceptual design of plug and play beam-column connection. The purpose of developing a plug and play beam-column connection is to reduce the construction time so that it is easy to be mounted and demounted. Two conceptual designs have been developed and were evaluated through FEA. The resistance of those two conceptual designs is found to be higher than fin-plate connection while the rotational stiffness of this plug-play connection can be classified as a nominally pinned joint.<br/>The last part of the thesis aims to see the possibility of having a non-symmetrical column splice connection on the column. This is interesting for the architect as it provides aesthetic benefit for the façade. The non-symmetrical column splice connection located on the corner is evaluated by FEA. The connection is a combination of end-plate and cover plate splice column connection. Due to unsymmetrical nature of the connection, the resistance and failure mode of the connection is different in a different orientation of the loading.","Demountable structure; Sustainability; Beam-column connection; steel structures; structural engineering; column-splice connection; composite beam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A relatively new manufacturing technique made it possible to print nylon, reinforced with continuous unidirectional carbon fibres on a layer-by-layer basis and praised itself for making materials as strong as Aluminium 6061-T6. In this study, several coupons were 3D printed and tested in tensile, compression and three point bending mode to determine the material properties. When loaded in the direction of the fibres, the material did not live up to the upper limit of the rule of mixtures for fibre reinforced composites, which is mainly due to the amount of voids in the material. These voids were discovered when studying the micro-structure of the material and were both in between the layers, as well as in the layers themselves.<br/>The mechanical tests were performed to validate constructed finite element models, simulated in Abaqus/CAE. The simulation results showed some mismatches with the mechanical test results, which were caused by the assumptions made to simplify the models. Finally, an air plane chair bracket, which has as task to transfer loads from the back seat panel to the chair, was modelled, simulated and designed. Major issues in the designing process were the limitations of the printer, such as not being able to choose which exact areas to reinforce in a specific layer. The final design of the chair bracket was manufactured and was tested to see if it could withstand a load of 375 N. The part did not fracture under the load, but a high displacement of the back seat was observed, as well as damage occurring at other locations than the simulations indicated.<br/> <br/>The study showed that this 3D printing technique is able to print structural aerospace parts, given that the part is not too complex and that it is loaded in a static nature. More freedom in the design software of the 3D printer could allow the user to successfully design more complex structural aerospace parts. Since the constructed parts were only tested under static loading, further research has to be conduction into dynamic loading of these parts before it is possible to actually implement these in air planes.<br","3D printing; FDM; carbon fiber; Composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In previous literature a variety of measurement systems have been presented; one such system included the instrumented klapskate developed at the Delft University of Technology. Alongside the implementation of this new instrumented klapskate, a simplified piezo-resistive pressure sensor system has been applied with high performance Dutch speed skaters; however, to this point the best application of such a system has not been shown. This research examined the potential ways in which this simplified system may provide valuable feedback to a skater, with consideration for the feedback currently available within the sport. Through a combination of bench and on-ice testing, the system was evaluated for its ability to predict skating forces (normal, lateral, and absolute), the center of pressure of force application, peak stroke force, and finally, contact time for individual strokes. Despite an inability to generate a full profile of skating force, the PRPS system provided reasonable estimations of peak stroke normal (RMSE = 50.2 N) and absolute (RMSE =50.5 N) forces in the straights, while in the curve, peak normal (RMSE = 129.4) and absolute (RMSE = 131.5 N) force estimates were less accurate. Stroke timing was predicted with accuracy, giving minor underestimation in both the straight (RMSE = 0.0671 s) and curves (RMSE = 0.0474 s). Center of pressure measurement was largely unsuccessful when attempted on the bench using a tensile load cell, however estimations applied to on-ice data yielded trends in center of pressure position consistent with previous literature, suggesting future viability as a feedback parameter. For future work, a larger sample size and further on-ice testing would be recommended for verification and improved development of this prototype system.","speed skating; measurement system; force measurements; stroke time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

These farms are usually installed in offshore environments since limitations of space can be encountered or due to public pressure against the visual disruption that farms can cause in urban areas. These offshore wind turbines are commonly founded on monopiles, which have been traditionally installed in shallow waters. Nevertheless, current trends show preference towards turbines of greater capacity which are installed in deeper waters. This trend poses uncertainties and new challenges to the offshore industry since most of the gained experience lies on the installation of monopiles in shallow waters. The hydromechanical response of soil and soil-structure interaction during the installation is complex and far from being fully understood yet. Thus, research projects involving advanced physical and numerical modelling techniques could be proposed as a first step to gain a better insight in the impact pile driving technique and how different soil conditions can influence the installation procedure of such monopiles. The current study is part of a project lead by Royal IHC, which has been developed at Delft University of Technology.This numerical study aims to study the dynamic behaviour of saturated sand and pile response by means of numerical simulations of a series of centrifuge tests using the finite element method in the time domain. These experiments were going to be performed in open-ended piles using the centrifuge facility of Delft University of Technology as part of a separate research project. Special attention has been given to the prediction of boundary effects in the centrifuge experiments since limitations of space are present in the facility. Two types of drainage conditions have been considered, i.e. fully drained and fully undrained. Two relative densities have been chosen to cope with loose and dense sand response, i.e. RD = 30% to 90%, respectively. A hypoplastic model has been used to model the surrounding soil, while soil-structure interaction has been addressed using a zone of degraded material properties as a continuum.Numerical predictions have shown that boundary effects may be usually stronger in denser soil conditions. In addition, liquefaction has been predicted to take place in the surroundings of the pile when driven into loose sand. In this regard, the effects of an initial soil liquefaction triggering event have been predicted to not influence in a significant manner pile drivability. In general, boundary effects have been shown to be problem dependent, i.e. on the geometry, stress state and soil packing state. In addition, drainage conditions and the amount of degradation of strength and stiffness properties have shown to play a role on numerical predictions of impact pile driving response. In addition, a numerical validation has been performed by comparison with preliminary centrifuge test results on dry dense sand. Finally, it has been concluded that the use of lateral viscous boundaries may be a suitable strategy to mitigate boundary effects in impact pile driving centrifuge tests. A first estimation of the damping demand of these Soft Boundaries (SB) has been presented in this study. Future studies should aim in exploring different numerical techniques in the sake of improving the predicting capabilities, e.g. by considering particle based methods such as MPM to extend the current research findings within multiple-blow centrifuge tests and by incorporating more complexities within the simulation of the hammer impact.","Dynamic Finite Element Analysis; Centrifugal Modelling; Pile Driving; Boundary Effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-01","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Most rivers have a natural tendency for continuous change of alignment, e.g. meandering and braiding rivers. Construction of bridges, towns, berths, etc. have required fixation of the river alignment at many places, changing the natural morphology of the rivers. This might lead to bank erosion, erosion around bridge pillars, sedimentation of navigation channels, etc. Adequate measures against this requires a reliable prediction of the morphological changes.<br/>For simulating the morphological effects in bends there are two different major factors involved that have been described by several scientists: bed slope effects and spiral flow. For modelling morphological development of a river bend several tests have been done on two different cases that have been researched in a laboratory flume (Delft Hydraulics Laboratory (DHL) and Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics (LFM)) in the 80s. In this research the effects of the major characteristics on the bed development of the bend are examined. This has been done by varying the different input parameters that have influence on the secondary flow and the bed slope effects. Subsequently the varied input files are used to model the same bend with Delft3D 4 Suite, D-Flow FM with an unstructured grid and D-Flow FM with a structured grid. In this way the differences are shown between the different kinds of modelling of the same input parameters.<br/><br/>The parameters that have been tuned are Ash, Bsh and Csh for the bedload transport factor that is influencing the bed slope effect. The other parameter is Espir that influence the amount of spiral flow in a bend. The last is αcal that is a multiplication factor in the sediment transport formula from Engelund-Hansen in Delft3D 4 Suite. After optimising these parameters it was not possible to reproduce the flume experiments. Reason for this is probably a simplification in the numerical calculation because with similar parameters of Struiksmas modulation [6] in 1985, which reproduce the flume well, it was still not possible.<br/>To improve the reliability of the model it is recommended to study the following aspects:<br/>• Improvement of the inflow boundary conditions, to improve the way in which water and sediment flows into the system.<br/>• Improvement of the numerical modelling, to create a model that can simulate the characteristics of the river bed in a better way.<br/>• Look for test cases which are close to reality to see if the updates in the model are truly simulating the reality.<br/><br/>By improving these points, the morphological changes might be predicted in a better way than it is in the current situation. Also it will be possible to have less crashes during the run of simulations.","Delft3D; Delft3D-FM; river bend morphology","en","student report","","","","","","Additional master thesis","","","","","","","",""

To build permanent structures, enough bearing capacity is needed to provide sufficient support for these structures. However, Holocene (soft) soils typically do not provide sufficient support. In the western part of the country, the soft soils from the Holocene overlay the stiffer Pleistocene soils. To still be able to construct at locations where soft soils are found, pile foundations are needed to transfer the loads through the soft soil onto the stiff soil in order to provide for sufficient bearing capacity. The normativemethod for determining pile bearing capacity in the Netherlands uses a relatively straightforward semi-empirical approach known as the 4D/8D or the Dutch method. This method was based on the work of [vanMierlo and Koppejan, 1952] who introduce the logarithmic spiral theory. Apart from small modifications and elaborations, the method has been used ever since. To get to a reasoned solution on how to calculate and design pile foundations the Eurocode [Normcommissie 351 006 ’Geotechniek’, 2017a] was introduced. One of the (original) aims of the Eurocode was to harmonise rules and regulations regarding, amongst others, pile foundations. To prepare this harmonisation, Belgium, France and the Netherlands took a closer look into their calculation methods. For the Netherlands this research was performed by a committee who presented their findings in CUR 229 - “Axiaal belaste palen” [CUR B&amp;I, 2010]. From CUR 229 it was found the pile tip capacity was overestimated. In other words, the calculated pile tip capacity was higher than the measured pile tip capacity. This overestimation led to a reduction of ®p of 30% starting on the 1st of January 2017. (®p is the factor which reduces the pile tip resistance for different pile types, see Appendix A.) A point of interest is the overestimation of the pile tip capacity, which seems to become more prominent when the pile goes deeper into a non-cohesive soil. It was even found, a lower ®p is not required for piles installed less than 8D into the bearing layer. The reduction of ®p seems to contradict with practice, because no cases of damage are known regarding the bearing capacity of pile foundations. Several explanations for this might be valid. For example, hidden safeties may prevent overall safety issues to arise. In addition, errors may occur in the determination of the pile capacity from pile load tests or in the Dutch method for calculating pile tip capacity. This leads to the two main subjects for this thesis. On the one hand, the hidden mechanism of residual loads is considered and on the other hand, the zone of influence at the pile tip during failure is analysed. To analyse the above-named subjects, the 4D/8D method was put under scrutiny. First, it was compared to other (international) analytical methods, which determine the bearing capacity directly from CPT data. Furthermore, the zone of influence around the pile tip is considered inmore detail by analysing the analytical approach and comparing this to the results of numerical models. This led to the conclusion that the observed overestimation can partly be explained by the inaccuracy of the assumed zone of influence around the pile tip, especially regarding the extent of this zone above the pile tip (8D). As this extent is too large, the 4D/8D method results in a too low average cone resistance in the 8D zone (for piles installed less than 8D into the bearing soil layer). In combination with the ‘old’ ®p , this leads to a reasonably accurate estimation of the pile tip capacity compared to the measured tip capacity. However, the observed extent of the zone of influence above the pile tip, in the FEMmodels, is in the order of 1 to 1.5D. The average cone resistance in this zone will in most cases be higher than in a zone extending 8D above the pile tip. The hidden mechanism of residual loads is implemented in a numerical model, with the use of a static load on top of the pile. The residual loads are caused by the installation of the pile and so, they are considered to be installation effects. No analytical or numerical models or procedures were found in literature to quantify the xiii xiv 0. Abstract residual load. Residual loads were implemented using a procedure defined in this thesis, taking into account the maximum pile tip capacity as indicator for the order of magnitude for the residual load. This is done, because a drawback of FEM models is; they are not able to calculate large strains, which occur during installation of a pile. Therefore the installations effects (like residual loads) have to be implemented indirectly. The horizontal compression due to installation is modelled as an installation effect according to the procedure of [Broere and van Tol, 2006]. Both installation effects are validated using data from CUR 229 and they are subjected to a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the softening or peak behaviour of soils might have a significant influence on the zone of influence around the pile and on the residual loads, as for both cases, the soil is loaded up to failure. Most regular constitutive models do not take into account this behaviour. Due to the fact the Hypo Plasticity (HP) model takes into account this peak behaviour, it was used to performthe FEM analysis. During the final stages of this thesis, scaled pile load tests were performed. The results of these tests were analysed to find the presence and order of magnitude of the residual load in a pile. However, as the test results were incomplete, only first assumptions were made that indicated the presence of residual loads. No substantiated conclusion could be drawn regarding the magnitude. Due to the observed importance of residual loads in this thesis, the residual loads should be measured during load tests more extensively using Osterberg cells or fibre optics. The installation effects are modelled in the Hypo Plasticity model with reasonable confidence, but future research is needed on models that can model the installation process (for example theMaterial PointMethod). Furthermore, the small strain parameters of the HP model should be taken into account. This thesis questions the 4D/8D method and shows some of its inaccuracies. However, more extensive research should be done considering the extent of the zone of influence and the limiting value defined by in the Dutchmethod. Also, the interaction between the shaft and the pile tip resistance has to be evaluated, as this thesis indicates they interfere with each other if the Dutch method is considered. Besides the zone of influence and the residual loads, the failure criterion stated by NEN 9997-1 is questioned. Failure of a pile happens when the pile tip has moved 10%D [Normcommissie 351 006 ’Geotechniek’, 2017a], but the FEM models show more displacements at failure, where failure is defined by themoment the models cannot stabilise anymore and therefore fail to calculate for a certain load step.","pile foundations; failure surface; alpha_p; residual loads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Adaptive reuse, as a concept of reusing pre-existing structures for new purposes, has become an increasingly appealing option. Not only because of the recognition of the effects on climate change by the built environment, but also the realization that adaptive reuse can make a considerable contribution to the formulation of strategies for sustainable, future-proof cities. A growing interest in adaptive reuse can also be identified in the public sector. It is now recognized by public organisations, like municipalities, that real estate cannot merely be managed and preserved by simple maintenance. The uniqueness of every adaptive reuse project however contributes vastly to the complexity and it appears that many municipalities are currently not equipped to deal with these kinds of projects. Moreover, it is arguable whether they should execute the adaptive reuse themselves at all, because of all the involved risks and commitments and the fact that they are dealing with public money. But how should they then act whenever dealing with an object within their portfolio that is eligible for adaptive reuse? A concise strategy is needed to provide municipalities with the means to make a fitted decision that can be properly justified to the other stakeholders. In general, one could argue that there are several alternative options, but what option would be the best for that specific situation? Therefore, the main research question is: “What criteria need to be considered when deciding upon adaptive reuse within the real estate portfolio of municipalities?” The result of this research is a tool in which the identified criteria are implemented in a comparison matrix which is used to discuss and assess the different alternatives. The comparison matrix is integrated into a step-by-step plan subdivided into two phases. The developed tool provides the municipalities with a structured decision-making process, which can be used to maximise transparency, stimulate critical thinking, optimise MREM and initiate the right discussion.","Adaptive reuse; Municipal real estate management; Decision-making; Public real estate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The subject of this paper looks into designing high density residential architecture that enables certain qualities, in order to improve the livability and perception of the design. A parametric design approach was chosen for this project in order to enable these qualities. First, several important conditions and criteria for this project were formed. These form guiding principles for the parametric models. This is important, since parametric modeling software can often lead to reflexive design criteria and unnecessary complexity. In order to avoid this, relation to context and social relevance become important guiding criteria. View, daylight, orientation and privacy are all guiding criteria that contribute to this social relevance.<br/>The first Grasshopper model was then created. By switching between different domains (or design aspects) within a design process, and combining their results, a qualitative design can eventually be created. The first Grasshopper model, however, forms a more linear process, in which every step within the created model is placed within one continuous code. A second Grasshopper model was then created. This model showed promise by allowing better differentiation between de different design domains. However, by basing the input parameters of the second Grasshopper model on a gradient image, the input parameters became in a way fixed within this model. With the help of parametric form-finding, the architect can create a certain kind of differentiation of elements within his design, giving him more freedom in the composition of the design within the design process. However, parametric codes are created with a certain algorithmic logic. This can be limiting the creative freedom of the designer and a design could then possibly lose its human-touch. Therefore, the designer should always be in control over the parametric code he created, changing the role of the designer from a physical designer to a more virtual designer, a programmer, who is in control of all the aspects of parametric design (input, algorithmic process and output).<br/>By reflecting on each Grasshopper model, in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses, the complexity of the design process of designing high density housing itself could be made more understandable and rationalized. However, according to certain Literature (Simon 1973; Lawson 1980) the design process can never be fully rationalized. This is because the design process can also be described as ill-structured. Understanding the advantages of the computer in well-structured problems and its disadvantages in ill-structured problems, is also important for understanding the need for heuristics within the parametric design approach. Rowe (1982) states that the architectural design process is inherent heuristic. This means that the further a design process advances, more conditions become clear and therefore, the better the design process could be rationalized by the designer or architect. Within the design and development of the parametric tool itself, this would mean that perhaps a parametric code / program could be designed in such a way, that it can rewrite itself according to what it has learned. In languages that support Object Oriented Programming (OOP) an object can be seen as a structure that contains both data and procedures. Understanding these procedures will enable the designer to reflect on the input and output data, making a cooperative and iterative trial-and-error process possible between the computer and the designer.","graduation project; Graduation project; high density housing; parametric approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Intecture","The Cob",""

One method is tidal range by the use of tidal lagoons, which operates on principles akin to hydropower. The lagoon is essentially an enclosed reservoir near the coast, which can maintain the inside water level while the outside rises and falls with the tide. When a sufficient head difference between the inside and outside water level is achieved, the turbine gates open and the flow drive the turbines.<br/><br/>This thesis explores a novel modelling approach consisting of a 1D channel based on the inertial form of the Saint-Venant Equations, coupled with 0D tidal lagoons. The model was built in Modelica. The 1D channel subsystem was modelled first, and validated by comparison with tidal constituents at multiple measuring stations in the domain. The channel model’s accuracy was deemed sufficient, with root-mean-square deviations ranging from 0.29 to 0.67 m. With the model validated, the nature of the tidal resonance in the channel was investigated, where the natural period was determined to be located between 7-8 hours. It was shown that the natural period is heavily dependent on the tidal wave propagation velocity, which is in accordance with the quarter-wavelength resonance theory.<br/><br/>The 0D tidal lagoon subsystem was coupled with the 1D channel and validated by considering the proposed Swansea lagoon design by Tidal Lagoon Power and comparing the results with the current literature. The lagoon was found to be operating as expected in dual generation, and the annual energy generation was 425 GWh. The energy production is slightly conservative compared to literature, but within reason. The lagoons' impact on the channel hydrodynamics were also investigated, and it was found to have a significant effect, particularly in the narrow section of the estuary. The influence of the lagoon-channel coupling on energy generation was also explored: As the hydrodynamic impact increases, the energy generation from the system as a whole decreases. <br/><br/>A 2D model was also utilised to explore the higher-order and near-field effects that would potentially be lost in a 1D model, like localised dips in water elevation, reduced circulation zones, jets and more. The 2D results indicate that consideration of the localised effects is crucial when designing tidal lagoons. <br/><br/>The tidal lagoons were also implemented, and the Swansea lagoon had an annual energy generation of 408 GWh, closely matching the 1D model. Three larger tidal lagoons were also implemented, however not successfully scaled to match the 1D model due to time constraints. Operational tidal lagoons were also shown to have a tremendous influence on the water elevation in the channel.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the 1D modelling approach is potentially as a powerful tool to supplement more detailed 2D models, and it can potentially replace the 0D models ordinarily used for optimisation and sensitivity analyses in the preliminary investigations.<br","Tidal energy; numerical modelling; Bristol Channel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van Geer, B.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Yachts are built to provide guests with a unique experience. In order to provide this experience, yachts are often anchored at special locations. Captains prefer to use a single bow anchor when they moor the vessel. Problems are reported with respect to the availability while yachts are at anchor. These are caused by environmental forces. Availability is the yachting term for the operability of a yacht. The comfort on board and the availability of activities are the main aspects playing a role in the overall availability. <br/><br/>Horizontal motions and accelerations of the vessel, respectively caused by wind and waves, are the main issues at anchor. These undesired accelerations can be reduced by controlling the yacht’s heading, ensuring optimal wave interaction. The objective of this research is to improve the availability while at anchor by suppressing the horizontal motions and controlling the heading of the vessel. Previous research suggests that using thrusters is a feasible solution for this. The research performed in this thesis provides a design proposition based on a quasi static analysis. For that reason, mathematical models are developed which are embedded in engineering tools.<br/>When these tools are defined, the first step is a parameter study. This has been performed to examine what, theoretically, is the preferred anchor support system. In this study, the required power and mooring force is calculated for a predefined capability. The capability is the environmental condition at which the system is able to be stationary. Based on the results can be concluded that the mooring line has to be located close to the pivot point of the vessel and that the thrusters have to be located with a large distance to the pivot point opposite to the mooring line location. Using multiple thrusters is often preferable because the same thrust can be delivered with less power. However, the thruster located the closest to the mooring line and pivot point delivers little thrust compared to the other thruster located further away. The usage of a tunnel thruster or an azimuth thruster is preferred. The difference between these two is limited because the azimuth thruster operates at an angle θ of 90 degrees.<br/><br/>The theoretical solutions found neglect practical aspects which have to be taken into account for implementation; e.g. the layout of the vessel and the range of the required headings. To consider these aspects, multiple assessment criteria have been defined. The design study has been performed with various design cases. The capability of these cases has been calculated with the developed model in terms of wind speed. When the used power is reduced, the comfort with respect to noise is increased. However, this reduces the capability as well because less thrust can be delivered. The reduction of the capability is related to the power margin to the power 1/3, when the thrusters are operating at maximum allowable power. For each design case, the dynamic positioning capability has been calculated to investigate whether including a mooring line influences the capability. As a result of this research can be concluded that the capability of the anchor support systems is higher than the capability of the DP systems and that the anchor support system requires less power to do so. The DP system uses twice as much power for the required range of headings. <br/><br/>The design proposition is determined based on the results of the quasi static calculations supported by a multi-criteria analysis. The preferred anchor support system for a yacht has an azimuth stern thruster in front of the platforms at the stern. Placing a thruster below these platforms causes safety issues and reduces the comfort. The yacht is equipped with an azimuth thruster in the bow because such a thruster can provide the same amount of thrust with less power and provides better controllability. The mooring line location is situated in the bow and is located on the centreline, thus an underwater anchor is required. <br/><br/>The used approach and developed tools are provided to Feadship which allow them to consider the capability of anchor support system in the early design phase of the new yachts. This gives Feadship the opportunity to build yachts with a higher availability at anchor. As a result, the guests will be able to enjoy an even more unique experience due to the control of horizontal motions.<br","Yacht; Feadship; Anchor; Availability; Comfort; Horizontal motions; quasi static; design; design analysis; operability; Availability at anchor; Motion control; Thrusters; fishtailing","en","master thesis","","","","","","Confidential thesis - Abstract only.","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The road has a long history as being bo a landscape structuring lane and the main road infrastructure between the cities of Utrecht, Arnhem, and Zutphen, and the estates in the areas between those cities. The structuring properties used to derive from the continuous lane profile and its embedded qualities. The road is at risk of losing its landscape structuring function through the now strongly fragmented road profile. At the same time, demands of the Dutch road network are changing through the upswing of new forms of mobility and the need for climate change-adaptive designs. What is the future value of such provincial roads? What can be learnt from lanes as an example of best-practice road design? How can lane design principles help develop a strategy for integral sustainable road design? The Golden Green research-bydesign focusses on the following main question: How can lane design principles be used to create an integral sustainable road design strategy? The area of the Utrechtseweg is used as a field laboratory, in which the past and present designs inform the design strategy through the application of a road quality assessment tool. The design strategy is based on the outcome of the assessment. The new design aims for a future scenario in which both the lost cultural identity is regained and current issues on safety, speed, and sustainable road design are addressed. Landscapes in general and road networks in particular are defined as a constellation of spatial, socio-economic, and mental aspects. Lanes are defined as a type of road, lined with trees or other natural objects within a specific pattern and functioning as a type of boundary between the road and the landscape. There are different lane typologies, each with their own spatial, socio-economic, and mental aspects. The road quality assessment tool is based on these aspects, providing an integral view on the road design. The assessment is conducted on three different spatial scales: detail or micro scale, the individual experience; local or meso scale, the impact on the location; regional or macroscale, the impact of the design strategy on a larger scale. The resulting design strategy re-envisions the Utrechtseweg as a lane, now with a safe place on the road for each road user (pedestrian, bike, e-bike, car). The Utrechtseweg can again function as a backbone for the area with the new lane profile, activating the existing rich programme along the road. The design evaluation points towards the potential of the design strategy in connecting cultural heritage with modern road design and the creation and connection of biotopes. Application of the design strategy on different roads can improve the over-all spatial quality and experience of those roads, while staying true to the traditional lane design principles.","lanes; landscape structuring roads; integral sustainable road design; landscape quality assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

Therefore, Chinese multinational enterprises (MNEs) have high global ambitions to expand their reach into the foreign markets as an important role in contributing to the rising economic power of China. They are establishing greenfield subsidiaries from the ground up to penetrate into foreign markets. On the other hand, service offerings and service solutions are becoming the popular options for the consumption of our daily life. It has a huge potential for company to increase the customer engagement and “lock in” the customers. The term “servitization” is going viral nowadays which refers to an organizational transformation of companies from being a product-centered organization to being a service provider for customers. However, given the more and more integrated world economy, the servitization difficulties that are faced by companies, especially Chinese MNEs, are even more complex due to the changing environment and the involvement of different stakeholders in a global environment. This problem of servitization, especially for the greenfield subsidiaries of the Chinese MNEs, gets even difficult to be handled.<br/><br/>This research explains the reasons of why the Chinese MNE greenfield subsidiaries are facing many obstacles. By looking into the characteristics of the organization, this research suggested that the performance of the servitization is correlated to the organizational features. Using agent-based model OperA to study the servitization in the organization is served as an exploration of a new approach to study the servitization. The insights that are explored from this approach is able to assist the future studies of other research problems regarding the servitization. On the other hand, people in the industries of different countries could be aware of the challenges of the globalization of Chinese MNEs, as well as the issues that they are facing. Understanding their problems will be helpful to establish better business cooperation and networking connections with the Chinese MNEs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

When soil response differs from the expected, the notion of inverse analysis becomes relevant; back-calculating the parameter set able to reproduce the monitored observations. Accordingly, its application attempts to clarify the effective soil conditions and allows for an update of the design based on in-situ measurements. The main goal of this thesis is assessing the adaption of available inverse analysis concepts in geotechnical engineering, as well as evaluating the reliability of their outcome. Specifically, the methods are employed on a slope construction problem in order to exhibit their function, compare their efficiency and point out the obstacles encountered in their application.<br/>After selecting the three most competitive approaches (namely: the Markov Chain Monte Carlo, the Genetic Algorithm and the Regularized Particle Filter), a synthetic case of RFEM model simulating a staged slope excavation is composed to test them, thus includes both soil heterogeneity and a pseudo-time scheme. Horizontal displacements at specified mesh points, mimicking the readings of inclinometers, act as the observations. Subsequently, the soil parameters to be identified are the undrained shear strength and the Young's modulus, as they yield the heaviest impact on displacement generation. Essentially, the objective of the inverse analysis is to minimize the error between observations and their RFEM-simulated counterpart. Furthermore, since all methods produce stochastically defined approximations of the parameter fields, a reliability analysis is suitable for their appraisal. Utilizing a Monte Carlo framework, the confidence curves of the results are plotted and judged. In an effort to comply with modern design standards, the reliability level of 95% acts as one of the evaluation criteria. Moreover, a practice-driven example employs the reliability concept in predicting the displacements of the next stage.<br/>Inverse methods are evaluated according to their computational performance, their efficiency in identifying soil parameters, as well as their behavior in the reliability analysis. In this study, the Genetic Algorithm is proven to be the most competent inverse analysis approach. It easily adapts to the problem, requires fewer RFEM runs and provides accurate and reliable results. Additionally, in the course of the project two main hindrances where encountered: the approximation of the strength field when applying a Linearly Elastic – Perfectly Plastic constitutive model and the combination of the Regularized Particle Filter with the RFEM model. Both are thoroughly analyzed and the conditions required for their mitigation are presented with numerical examples. Ultimately the thesis delivers on its research goals by providing insight on inverse method applications. It includes an RFEM setting, that employs authentic elements, and also addresses some practice-related aspects. All in all, this is an effort towards the development of the numerical inverse analysis and hopefully its adoption as part of an integrated geotechnical design.<br","Inverse Analysis; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Genetic Algorithm; Particle Filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The main focus of this thesis is the binary mixtures of methane with various n-alkanes and the binary mixture of methane and toluene, at temperatures ranging from 400 to 650 K and pressures ranging from 2 MPa to 50 MPa. Despite the currently increased importance of these asymmetric binary mixtures of methane and long n-alkanes due to Enhanced Oil Recovery technologies and depletion of old, easily accessible and highly profitable hydrocarbon reservoirs, the available vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data from experiments are scarce or unknown.Currently, the most common practice for volumetric and phase behavior calculations in the industry is based on different cubic, such as Peng-Robinson, SRK or on higher order equations of state like PC-SAFT . However, the predicted data by equations of state are not accurate enough, due to the lack of experimental data. This is more pronounced for high temperature and pressure conditions or in the vicinity of the critical point. This thesis aims to produce vapor-liquid phase equilibrium data for binary mixtures of methane with various long n-alkanes by performing Monte Carlo molecular simulations in the Gibbs ensemble with TraPPE force field. The simulation results are used to validate the applied TraPPE force field by comparing its results to available experimental data. At extrapolated conditions, the new data are compared to PC-SAFT predictions in order to assess the performance of the CBMC technique and to highlight the deviations between the CBMC and PC-SAFT results.

This paper investigates an approach in analyzing truth data to help in possibly minimizing the errors associated with generated TLEs. The current resulting positioning errors are permissible for general tracking of satellites and pass scheduling; however, the errors that result from SGP4 alone can cause some limitations if used in other applications. This is not necessarily a challenge for large satellites that can afford to include certain instruments to help keep positioning errors low, but due to the power, volume, and cost limitations of small satellites, this can become problematic as there are not as many sensors that can fit within the small form factor. Therefore, shadow time characteristics for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites will be examined to hopefully improve TLE accuracies by incorporating measured shadow time.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-18","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jarquin Laguna, A. (mentor); Herman, Sergio (mentor); van den Hoogen, Frank (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","During offshore installations in harsh sea conditions, the involved gangway system must satisfy rigorous requirements in terms of safety and accuracy. The forces resulting from the vessel motion have an extensive effect on the overall gangway structure and its lifetime. Moreover, vessel motion handicaps the operator during fine positioning of the gangway during connection to a platform. Hence, an active motion compensation system for the gangway is used. An impression of the gangway structure can be seen in Figure 1 below. In this thesis, a 2D-model for the gangway system is developed in order to simulate the Active Motion Compensation (AMC) required to compensate wave induced vessel motions. The model can be used to estimate the power required by the system, needed to compensate the motions in order to minimize the movements of the connection point. The model is developed using software Matlab Simscape.<br/>The gangway is capable of performing single stage telescoping motion, activated by a winch that pulls the telescoping section back and forth, luffing motion by activating of the hydraulic cylinders and slewing motions by means of a slewing bearing. In order to develop an as accurate as possible model, the whole gangway system is divided in three sub-systems: the mechanical, the hydraulic and the control sub-system. The main outputs of the mechanical sub-system are the movements, velocities and accelerations of the gangway system relative to its mass and center of gravity and based on the RAO’s of the vessel. For the hydraulic luffing system, all relevant hydraulic components are modeled. A directional proportional (control) valve in the hydraulic sub-system is used to regulate the amount of flow through the system. In order to compensate the gangway tip, a feedback on the position and a feedforward on the velocity of the compensation point is applied. The inputs from the MRU, which are the imposed ship motions (heave, sway and roll), are converted to the motion of the tip of the gangway by a PLC controller. These converted signals are used to determine the control set points for the luffing and telescoping actuators. A basic proportional controller is used for the Active Motion Compensation system of the gangway.<br/>In order to validate the numerical model, the simulation results are compared with experimental results from quayside tests. During these tests, different sinusoidal signals are applied for the 3 possible motions: translation in vertical direction which mimics the heave motion, translation in the horizontal direction which mimics the sway motion and a rotation around the main hinge which mimics the roll motion of the vessel. When applying only the roll motion or the sway motion, the luffing function and the telescoping function respectively could be assessed separately. Besides these three signals, combinations of this motions are also provided to assess the total performance of the system. Several variables are logged during the tests of which the compensation error, the measured set points, and pressures in the hydraulic cylinder are analyzed thoroughly and compared with the simulation results. It is observed that the simulation results show important similarities in the dynamic response of the gangway on the imposed ship motions. <br/>The current model provides a good insight in the behavior of the gangway system and can be used to simulate offshore tests in different virtual weather windows before testing the real gangway offshore. This is the main advantage compared to the case before this thesis is conducted. It is recommended to extend the 2D simulation into a 3D simulation by adding the slewing function. It’s also recommended to further study the controller design in order to improve the AMC performance.<br","Active; Motion; Compensation; Simulation; Control; Gangway; Offshore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","","","","","",""

Both can be done using techniques like Fourier or wavelet analysis, however, analysts from this field experience a threshold to use wavelet analysis instead of their current methods, often Fourier-based. This is due to the lack of guidelines in the many choices accompanied by applying wavelets. This thesis investigates the added value of wavelet analysis in the field of coastal engineering. There are two wavelet transform types: continuous and discrete. The first one is most often used for time-frequency analysis. The range of signals that can be analysed more accurately has been increased by adding different signal extension methods and a method to quantify the effect of missing data points, based on the wavelets energy distribution. This allows a more accurate time-frequency analysis of time-series that cannot be assessed in the Fourier domain. The continuous wavelet coefficients can also be used for separating incident and reflected waves. Because the wave number of a wave is dependent on its frequency, the wavelet-based method performs equally well or worse for stationary signals than the current Fourier coefficient based method. For coastal engineering time-series with a changing mean water level, the time-dependency of the wavelet transform results in better separation than the Fourier coefficient based case. The discrete wavelet transform is mostly deployed in digital signal processing. Filtering in the discrete wavelet domain allows for better justification of the filtering of different signal elements such as noise and transients for signals that behave non-stationary, like measurements of impacts. The difference with the standard time or frequency domain methods lies within this justification, instead of a 'gut feeling' often used. Different algorithms to determine thresholds for use in noise filters have been tested. The soft applied universal threshold was the most effective of the compared algorithms in filtering noise from a non-stationary signal. In stationary signal cases, the low-pass filter showed better performance. The discrete wavelet decomposition offers many signal processing opportunities due to the wide range of wavelets that can be chosen.","coastal engineering; wavelet analysis; time-series analysis; incident and reflected waves; noise filter; discrete wavelet transform; continuous wavelet transform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It aims at extracting useful state representations directly from raw data. In deep learning, state representations are usually used for classification or inferences. For example, image embedding that provides similarity metrics can be used for face recognition. Recent success on deep learning has stimulated the interest of applying state representation learning to control. This problem is very different from deep learning in computer visions and language modelling. Control tasks usually require pose information about the task relevant object in the scene. Applying state representation learning to control requires such features to be embedded. This is a difficult problem since there is generally no explicit supervision for extracting pose information from the data.<br/><br/>A problem of state representation learning for control is that raw data can contain much irrelevant information for the control task. For example, colors, textures and shapes of task-relevant objects are not as important as poses of objects. This suggests that the appearance and pose information should be disentangled in learned representations and the pose representations should be used for the control task. Furthermore, we usually need a system dynamic model in order to perform model-based optimal control. The prediction ability of the model is crucial for planning since it has to evaluate future trajectories and optimizes the actions. Thus we need to learn a decent dynamic model on extracted representations.<br/><br/>To address these problems, we first propose to use Variational Auto-encoders to disentangle the pose and appearance representations. The benefit of preserving both appearance and pose representations is that we can predict pose representations conditioned on actions. From appearance and predicted pose representations, we can reconstruct and predict future image frames. For this purpose, we introduce the Long Short-Term Memory network to learn a prediction model on the pose representations. We further intend to apply multi-modal state representation learning for control. Leveraging the idea of sensor fusions, we want to verify whether multi-modal sensory data lead to better representations for control.<br/><br/>To test our hypothesis, an object poking simulation is prepared in the Gazebo simulator where training and testing data-sets are collected. We validate disentangled representations and prediction performances with a few baseline models. Experiment results show that information disentangling can be achieved without explicit supervisions. The prediction model can effectively predict future frames a few steps ahead conditioned on poking actions. For multi-modal learning, we apply a Siamese network for inverse planning on the object poking task. We test multi-modal representations with the Siamese network and report improvements in online simulations.","State representation learning; model-based control; multi-modal learning; information disentangling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reach these climate goals, offshore wind energy is regarded as one of the main technologies that can contribute to a full transition towards a fossil-free electricity system. Furthermore, 230 Gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind is projected to be necessary within the EU. Additionally, the EU has the objective to further integrate electricity markets within its member states. This further integration will therefore need a substantial increase in interconnection capacity between the current electricity markets. Both the increase in offshore wind energy and the increase in interconnection capacity will require offshore electricity transmission infrastructure. <br/><br/>Currently, offshore wind generation is connected through individual (radial) offshore grid connections and interconnection capacity used for cross border trade is still developed through point-to-point interconnection. However, a meshed offshore grid (MOG) can combine the aforementioned functions of evacuating offshore wind and interconnect electricity markets. Additionally, a MOG is expected to provide additional economic benefits compared with the individual development of offshore wind farms (OWF) grid connections and the interconnection capacity between electricity markets. While a MOG can provide potential economic benefits, current development of a MOG is still lacking, caused by a variety of economic and regulatory knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. One of these knowledge gaps is which governance model, that allocates the responsibilities regarding the ownership and operation of such a MOG, is preferable for coordinated offshore grid developments. This research project is therefore focussing on this knowledge gap. <br/><br/>In order to address this gap, an analytical framework is created through a literature review and desk research that provides both a foundation to conceptually develop the design space of a governance model, while also providing the tools to analyse the expected performance of a governance model. Additionally, a quantitative comparative analysis of currently applied governance models for individual OWF grid connections is performed to provide input for the analysis of governance models that can be applied for a MOG. <br/><br/>Through the design space, four different governance models were constructed and analysed, based on the analytical framework. Three of the constructed governance models rely on long-term contracts and further unbundling of electricity grid activities (being electricity transmission and system operation), while one governance model (the TSO model) relies on regulation and bundling of the electricity grid activities. The analysis of these governance models shows that there is no optimal governance model. However, to facilitate the efficient deployment of a MOG, the TSO model is considered most preferable, as this governance model is able to facilitate the gradual development of a MOG, while also facilitating efficient operation by limiting coordination issues that can arise due to unbundling. This model will rely on current owners of the TSOs to provide the necessary investment capital and it remains to be seen whether these owners have the willingness to do so, provided the enormous scale of investments to reach EU climate goals.<br","Governance models; Regulation; Offshore Grid; Electricity transmission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

There is no simple answer as to why households do not adopt energy efficiency sufficiently. This is because the adoption of energy efficient technologies can be described as a complex adaptive system. The decision making of households is dependent on complex attitudes, preferences, perceptions and needs. Nevertheless, policy makers try to influence the adoption decisions of households through the use of multiple policy measures.

The shear strength of an interface is significant in experimental projects that for instance address the containment and propagation analysis of hydraulic fractures.<br/>A discontinuity can be defined as any type of interruption in mechanical and structural properties of a rock layer. The samples used in this project are mechanically discontinuous at the interface. These samples consist of 3 different sandstones, one granite and one monzodiorite samples. These samples were prepared to fit a certain casket that was specially designed for this project. The mechanical contrast between pairings of these samples were obtained through calculations for difference in unconfined compressive strength between the rock types. The samples were then placed in a direct shear box and sheared against each other to obtain shear force and vertical displacement profiles while under a specific normal load.<br/>In three different sets of experiments, specific pairings of samples were analysed and processed. Each pairing showed a unique set of results which were then compared with one another. Each experiment set focused on a certain aspect. The first set of experiments focused on the effect of mechanical contrast. The second experiment set focused on the change in surface roughness caused by shearing at higher loads. The third set focused on the effect of predetermined changes on surface roughnesses and how this would affect the shear stress profiles.<br/>The values obtained through these experiments were then mathematically processed and shear stresses and normal stresses were plotted against each other. From these plots the friction coefficients and angles of friction were calculated.<br/>The results show that mechanical contrast has a direct effect on the shear stress profiles. A constant mechanical contrast of two different pairings of samples results in the same trend no matter what rock types were used. In other words, if two different pairs are sheared against each other with each pair having the same mechanical contrast, the shear stress profiles will have the same friction coefficient. The surface roughness also directly effects the shear stress profiles. The results showed that the higher the measure of surface roughness, the higher the shear stress will be. The predetermined surface roughnesses of the samples were 125 and 75 μm.","Shear Strength; Rock Discontinuities; Interface Strength; Shear Box; Direct Shear Box","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the strong increase of intermittent renewable sources, (solar, wind) the key feature for the operational excellence of combined cycle power stations is flexibility. In particular, the capability to start an installation quickly and efficiently after a shutdown period leads to lower operational cost and a higher capacity factor. However, most of existing thermal power stations worldwide are designed for continuous operation, with no special focus on an efficient start-up process.<br/><br/>In most current start-up procedures the GT controls ensure maximum heat flow to the HRSG, without feedback from the steam cycle. The steam cycle start-up controls work independently, with as main control parameter: the limitation of the thermal stresses in the steam turbine rotor. In this paper, a novel philosophy for the start-up optimization of an existing 200 MW CCGT power station is presented. In this new start-up procedure, a feedback loop is established between the steam turbine, the boiler and the gas turbine start-up controls. This feedback loop ensures that the steam turbine can be started up more quickly together with a significant reduction in stresses. <br/><br/>The methodology implied the creation of a flexible and accurate dynamic model in the Simulink$^{TM}$ environment. The full detailed model consists of more than 100 component blocks (heat exchangers, valves, meters and sensors, turbines, controls etc). The mathematical submodels in the component blocks are mainly based on physical models and for a lesser part on experimental correlations. This makes the model generally applicable to other power plant installations. The model was validated against real process data related to the three start-up types (cold start, warm start, hot start). The start up model was extended in order to establish feedback loops between the steam cycle, boiler and gas turbine start-up controls. These feedback loops control for example the exit temperature of the gas turbine based on the actual steam turbine housing temperature, resulting in a smoother heating up of the steam turbine. <br/><br/>The extended model was used to define the optimal trends for the most important operating variables for cold and warm start-up types. These optimization actions were tested real power station start-ups, leading to a start-up time reduction of more than 30%, and a reduction in thermal stresses above 10% for cold starts.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-30","","","","","",""

The concept of sail-assisted propulsion of modern ships is a major step in that direction. It basically adds the natural advantage of direction-dependent wind force to the conventional primary drive in the form of a diesel engine. The idea of using sails and natural wind as a means of transport is richly derived from maritime history. An effective combination with modern technology would massively help in economic ship transportation with largely reduced carbon footprints. <br/>This thesis is a step closer to that goal. The focus here is to describe the added wave resistance acting on a sail-assisted ship model, Ecoliner. There are two major technical aspects to this general situation:<br/><br/> 1) description of the hydrostatic stability and response of sails to winds<br/> <br/> 2) the hydrodynamic investigation of loads effects on the hull<br/><br/>Point 2 is the obvious focus of attention in this work. This thesis is a follow-up of an experiment done at TU Delft, November 2013 to determine the influence of heel and leeway on added wave resistance on the said ship model.<br/>Diffraction method based numerical analyses have been carried out to establish the added resistance for three different ship heel angles and three leeway angles over two different sailing speeds. Validation of the performed experiment is done as well as new findings regarding the sensitivity of the model variables are reported.<br/>The highest leeway angle of 9 degrees, in particular, is seen to have a significant effect in the increasing the added resistance. This effect was previously not captured by experiments and helps give an overview on which parameters the Ecoliner ship’s performance is more sensitive to. Effect of constraining or allowing roll is also found to be an especially important parameter. The margin of difference between analysis and experiment results improves by about 20 to 25\% after a proper analysis of roll hydrodynamics and putting that factor in.<br/>This work will hopefully be a stepping stone in further research endeavours in this field concerning optimizing Ecoliner as an end market product. Recommendations are given in this report for specific follow-up work in both the analytical as well as the experimental domain for the hull-related study.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

By converting low temperature energy sources in electricity, they are suitable for the exploitation of renewable sources (as solar and geothermal) and industrial waste heat. One of the most critical components in ORCs is the gas turbine, which usually has a radial inflow and one single expansion stage. The difficulties of the turbine design are related to real gas effects of the working fluids (organic compounds)<br/>and high expansion ratios, which lead to a supersonic flow at the turbine exit.<br/>The objective of this work is to develop a blade design methodology for a transonic turbine rotor. This is done by setting the focus on the blade passage and shaping it as a rotating nozzle. First, theory of rotating nozzles is developed, assuming the flow to be one dimensional and isentropic. Relations with respect to chocked conditions and the analytic solution to the flowfield are derived. Afterwards, the blade designmethodology is developed based on the rotating nozzle theory. Inputs of the methodology are total conditions, mass flowand static pressure at the rotor inlet, static pressure at the rotor outlet. Both the theory developed and the blade design methodology are validated. The relations derived for a one dimensional flow through an isentropic nozzle are valid for an ideal gas, while validation for real gas is not carried out. The location of the physical throat and its cross sectional area are determined and the analytic solution method of the flow field is proved to be precise. The blade design methodology is based on a one dimensional approximation and represents a first step towards a more precise blade design: the flow conditions along the nozzle mid line follow the expected trend. However, the boundary conditions are not respected and the flow varies considerably far from the mid line. Additional levels of complexity (as 2D approximation) have to be implemented in future work.","organic rankine cycle; rotating nozzle; inertial frame; centripetal flow; radial flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-30","","","","","",""

This not only requires a more detailed analyze of the joint itself, but also of the total behavior of the tunnel and its interaction with the subsoil.<br/>Conventional deterministic designing procedure is based on average soil characteristics with sensitivity analyses including upper and lower boundaries of soil stiffness. The mentioned above trend of larger structures requires a more sophisticated probabilistic approach with deeper understanding of uncertainties and insight in probability of exceedance of requirements in serviceability limit state.<br/>In this paper, a probabilistic analysis approach has been implemented to understand the shear behavior of tunnel joints. The biggest contributor for tunnel joints shear behavior is differential settlement between adjacent parts of the tunnel structure. Two probabilistic methods, Point Estimate Method and Monte Carlo Simulation are performed on settlement determination. The former is more efficient and with a considerable accuracy while, the latter is extremely accurate with high computational costs. For simple cases, Monte Carlo Simulations are commonly used to solve soil structure interaction problems due to its straightforward process and easily understandable theory. While for large and complex soil-structure interaction problem, it is computationally intensive to complete even a single run.

Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, storage of excess energy during its availability is vital. Energy storage, especially on the large scale, has recently received a lot of attention from the scientific world and ammonia has been identified as a<br/>promising energy storage medium suitable for this application. Factors like high energy density, potential to have minimal carbon footprint and ready existence of suitable infrastructure for handling and transport especially make it an attractive choice. Moreover, ammonia is a bulk feedstock in the chemical and fertiliser industry making it a valuable commodity.<br/>A generic model has been developed in MATLAB to assess the economic feasibility of producing ammonia from varying availability of electric power. The model estimates the optimum plant capacity at which levelised production cost is minimum thereby resulting in minimum energy storage cost. Steel industries like Tata Steel produce electric power to satisfy the plant’s operational<br/>demand using by-product gases (termed as work arising gases) evolved during the steel making process. An intermittent availability of surplus electric power has been reported at Tata Steel, IJmuiden.<br/>The economic feasibility of utilising ammonia to store the surplus available electric power using the developed MATLAB model has been assessed in this study. It has been found that the variable cost due to electric power consumption, the fixed cost of the system and capital cost of the electrolyser<br/>significantly influence the production cost of ammonia. The minimum levelised production cost estimated in this study is €997/ton which is almost three times the current market price of ammonia. The system shows potential to produce ammonia at a competitive price when sufficient electric power is continuously available at an electricity price of €10/MWh or lower. Utilising part of the hydrogen produced from the work arising gases in the ammonia production process helps to lower the levelised production cost to around €913/ton. Availability of sufficient hydrogen simplifies the system and it may be possible to produce ammonia at a competitive price when hydrogen price is lower than €1.26/kg.<br/>The power to ammonia process shows an efficiency of around 50%. Using gas turbines to produce electricity from ammonia are expected to result in roundtrip efficiencies of around 15%-25%. Research and pilot plants have shown good potential of using ammonia as a fuel in combustion engines and commercial applications are expected to be realised in the near future.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-30","","","","","",""

Data scientists program their solutions of their KDD challenges in data mining programming scripts. Data mining programming scripts contain multiple or all steps of the KDD process. In other words, these scripts start with data and end with knowledge. Learning from the knowledge and experience documented in the scripts would be beneficial, but till know a formalized sharing of this information between Data Scientist is missing. This is partly because there is now formalized model to share it and partly due to Intellectual property of companies on the solution of their employed Data Scientist. In this thesis, we describe an open source repository of data mining scripts in order to find out how data mining solutions are constructed. Gaining knowledge on these solutions and making it possible to share this knowledge. <br/><br/>The scripts are described by an adapted KDD process model. This model extends the existing models, while these existing models were too conceptual and abstract to describe and classify data mining scripts. The extension of the current models consists of an additional layer of Methods that connects the abstract models and the data mining scripts. This additional layer has been constructed by combining various KDD ontologies.<br/><br/>After the modelling, the script lines are labelled with the methods from the adapted KDD process model. Which is achieved by going through the different steps of a KDD process. During the transformation from text to numbers, required for training an automatic classifier, word embedding techniques are applied. Hereby, the implemented Word2Vec algorithm learns what the semantically similar words are within the code. Script lines with semantically similar words get a similar vector. This makes it possible to train a supervised classifier that assigns labels to script lines. This results in a list of labels per script describing the KDD process of the script.<br/>These lists of labels have been analysed in various ways. First, it can be demonstrated that data scientists usually use two or more script lines to perform a Step or Task. Furthermore, we analyse which Methods are often used together. This makes it possible to recommend appropriate Methods during a future process. Lastly, we studied the transitions in the scripts from Step to Step, Task to Task and Method to Method, of the adapted KDD model. Here we see that the conceptual process model is indeed reflected in the scripts. In addition, we see that the scripts, like the process, are cyclic and iterative, often returning to an earlier step. Lastly commonly used transitions in the script are visualized and describes.<br/><br/>The description of scripts gives insight into the choices Data Scientist make to solve their KDD challenges. This is useful information if you want to contribute towards solving newly encountered KDD challenges.

Conventional rail welding processes include aluminothermic/thermite welding and flash-butt welding. Both welding processes result in a large width of the weld and heat affected zone (HAZ). The weld and HAZ show irregularities along the rail surface including hardness variations, microstructural disturbances and/or inclusions. This makes welds in particular susceptible to damage. Laser welding of rails is proposed to create welds with a smaller weld and HAZ width.<br/><br/>This thesis investigates the feasibility of laser welding for rails. The evolution of microstructures in R260Mn rail steel has been studied using x-ray fluorescence, dilatometry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and hardness measurements. From the data obtained from these experiments and thermal models that have been constructed, an appropriate set of welding conditions was determined and used for laser welding. The welding conditions considered are laser power, welding speed and pre-heating temperature. The main focus was put on welding speed and pre-heating.<br/><br/>Preliminary welds consisted of a mainly martensitic and thus unacceptable microstructure. By selecting the welding conditions accordingly, the cooling rate could be decreased to form a pearlitic microstructure instead. Especially pre-heating was found to be a valuable method to reduce cooling rate and achieve an acceptable weld in terms of microstructure. The welded samples did contain welding defects like solidication cracking and porosity. The amount of welding defects is observed to decrease for higher welding speeds.<br/><br/>It can be concluded that laser welding can be used to achieve an acceptable weld in terms of microstructure, especially when a pre-heating is applied to the rails. Further optimisation of the welding conditions may resolve welding defects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because once the barrier is closed, the upstream flow cannot flow out to the Galveston Bay, there is the potential to cause the flooding behind the barrier when the closure time is long and upstream discharge is large enough.

These vibrations have a record of negative consequences. The most important cause of vibrations is self-excitation. This is a mechanism in which the forces acting on the hydraulic gate are amplified by the movement of the hydraulic gate itself which then further increases the vibration intensity. This mechanism potentially results in structural failure of hydraulic gates. Therefore, prevention of this type of excitations should be priority number one in the design stage of hydraulic gates One of the vertical self-excitation mechanisms is the galloping-type vibration and is addressed in this thesis. In this research the possible occurrence of galloping-type vibrations of a dynamic one degree of freedom system is simulated.<br/><br/>CFD computations were used to obtain a force matrix that served as an input for the simulation of vertical vibrations of the one degree of freedom system. This research has shown that the force matrix, obtained using CFD software, can used to derive the hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to flow and hydrodynamic stiffness coefficients due to flow and buoyancy for a range of combinations of opening heights and accompanying vertical velocities of the hydraulic gate.<br/><br/>The damping coefficient that was required to obtain a fully stable situation for all initial opening heights complied with the results found by determining the negative hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to flow. Therefore, this research has shown that the stability to galloping-type vibrations and the required external damping coefficient can be derived from the force matrix obtained using CFD.<br/><br/>The research performed has shown that the hydraulic gate, designed as an FRP laminate experienced roughly twice as high negative hydrodynamic damping values than a typical steel hydraulic gate consisting of a plate stiffened with ribs. This means that the FRP laminate requires twice as much external damping to neutralise the significantly higher negative hydrodynamic damping due to flow. The steel hydraulic gate experiences a larger range of negative hydrodynamic damping albeit with much lower negative hydrodynamic damping coefficients than the FRP laminate hydraulic gate.<br/><br/>Concluding this research, results show that FRP hydraulic gates are more susceptible to galloping-type vibrations than traditional steel hydraulic gates, meaning that either the design of the hydraulic gate has to be altered or much more external damping, in this case twice as much, is required to compensate for the negative hydrodynamic damping due to flow, with respect to steel hydraulic gates.<br","Flow-Induced Vibrations; Fibre-Reinforced Polymer; Galloping-type vibrations; Self-excitation; Negative hydrodynamic damping; CFD computations; Hydraulic Gates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Natte kunstwerken van de toekomst",""

Despite the progress on electrification ratio, there are still about 238 out of 433 villages which do not have electricity access (PLN, 2017). It is because some of these villages are located in remote areas which have limited access to infrastructures, such as roads and grid access. Currently, the rural households in Sumba Island use fossil fuel to provide their electricity needs. However, the use of fossil fuel is considered polluting, noisy, and expensive. Thus, renewable energy-based power generation needs to be introduced. While wind and hydropower could be very attractive for grid-connected options, off-grid solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems stand out as the best solution for off-grid electrification because of Sumba’s dispersed population and limited infrastructure. Several off-grid PV projects have been carried out by the government as well as private institutions. However, the adoption of off-grid PV technologies for Sumba’s rural areas remains very slow. From the literature, it is known that the role of business model to overcome challenges of the adoption of off-grid PV electrification in rural areas is considered important. However, there is still no literature which explains how a sustainable business model helps to overcome the barriers faced by PV projects in the rural energy market. An exploratory study using desk research and cases study from seven different PV companies are used to understand how PV companies choose types of business models to address the challenges in the rural energy market. Then, this insight will be used to develop advices on business models for PV companies who want to operate their business in the rural energy market in Sumba Island, Indonesia. In this study, We developed a framework which explains the linkage between the barriers faced by PV companies in rural areas in developing countries and how the business model could help the companies to overcome these barriers. By using this framework, we discovered suitable business models which could be implemented by PV companies in rural areas in Sumba Island. Firstly, it is the distributor model which offers various PV products. Secondly, it is the distributor model which offers electricity services delivered by a microgrid. Finally, study limitations and recommended future studies were offered to improve the framework developed from this study.<br","Photovoltaic; Business model; Developing countries; Rural electrification; off-grid; Bottom of Pyramid; Indonesia; Sumba Island","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","-9.6993"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The world’s greenhouse gas emissions have steadily increased as a result of the continued use of fossil fuels, causing climate change. Nevertheless, sustainable energy technologies implementation has increased steadily in the last decade as society attempts to transition to a sustainable, zero emission energy system. The consequences of climate change are plentiful and represent a huge challenge for the whole world, but for islands they represent a threat to their existence.<br/><br/>Islands rely on expensive imported fossil fuels for their energy supply, which not only contribute to climate change but represent a threat in terms of energy security. Nonetheless, they also have all the possibilities and incentives to become the world's leading example on how to transition to sustainable energy systems. Generally, islands possess abundant renewable resources which can be exploited and have smaller (less complex) systems compared to mainland grids. Moreover, many islands have set targets for renewable energy integration.<br/>However, in order for a transition to a sustainable energy system to happen there are multiple challenges that need to be overcome. One of the most important is lack of knowledge on the global potential of various sustainable energy technologies and their potential impact on the energy system. <br/><br/>This thesis has investigated the potential effect that different conditions on power supply and electricity demand have on the cost-optimal configurations of hybrid renewable energy systems of islands. This was done by studying the roles of various generating technologies (PV, Wind, OTEC, tidal, WEC and biodiesel) on the supply side and scenarios regarding residential heat electrification and commercial cooling on the demand side. For this purpose, a general model was developed on which the proposed loads and the power system performance was evaluated. The system was optimized using multiobjective optimization with economic (LCOE) and renewable integration (coverage) objective functions by means of a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Eleven islands spread throughout the world were used as case studies. <br/><br/>It was found that there is a strong business case for renewable energy on islands as LCOE decreases with their implementation. Mature technologies such as wind and PV often have an important role in the first stages of the transition with wind always being part of the cost-optimal configurations and favoured in the 0%-50% range of renewable integration and PV starting at 30\% and up to 70%. At higher levels their deployment is limited by the cost of storage and required overcapacities. Ocean technologies, particularly OTEC due to its baseload power generation, proved to have a potential role at higher integration shares starting in the range of 60% - 80%, greatly reducing energy curtailment. Finally, biodiesel was found to be important at the last stages limiting the cost and reducing overcapacity of generating and storage technologies.<br/><br/>***This thesis was carried out at the Engineering, Systems and Services department of the Technology, Policy and Management Faculty. ***<br","Renewable energy; Optimal Configuration; island; SIDS; energy transition; ocean energy; OTEC; Genetic Algorithm; optimal sizing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Legged locomotion is an example of a discrete event system (DES) with only synchronization and no concurrency. This particular kind of DES can be framed in max-plus algebra, which consists of maximization and addition as its basic operations. Utilizing the max-plus operations between matrices, max-plus linear (MPL) system is constructed.<br/><br/>Switching max-plus linear (SMPL) system is a class of MPL system where the element of the system matrices can be changed by a switching function. In modeling legged locomotion as an SMPL system, the touchdown and lift-off time instant of every leg is set as the states. The SMPL system is then used to schedule when each leg should touchdown and lift-off the ground. The swing period of a leg starts with lift-off and ends with touchdown. The stance period of a leg starts with touchdown and ends with lift-off. The SMPL system then incorporates the gait and the desired swing and stance period, to schedule the touchdown and lift-off time instant of every leg. <br/><br/>The legged robot which is considered in is called Zebro. Zebro is a robot with six half-circular legs, developed in TU Delft. In this report, the trajectory-following SMPL system for Zebro is proposed. With the trajectory-following SMPL system, a Zebro is able to move forward in all directions by means of the legs scheduling. To turn, Zebro needs to have different linear velocity on the left and right side. While the Zebro is turning with the trajectory-following SMPL system, the stance period of the inner legs are longer by tp seconds compared to the outer legs. On the other hand, the swing period inner legs are shorter by tp seconds compared the outer legs. <br/><br/>The motion of the Zebro is predicted by the switching kinematic algorithm in this report. Based on the relation between coordinate frames, first Jacobian matrices of the legs are formed. Each jacobian matrix describes the relationship between the motion of a leg and the motion of Zebro. The jacobian matrices are combined in the sensed forward solution, to predict the motion of Zebro if there are several legs on stance period. The switching kinematic algorithm will detect which legs are on the stance period, and the change of angle of the respective legs. The switching kinematic algorithm then forms a suitable sensed forward solution.<br/><br/>The results of the simulation show that the Zebro can turn by the trajectory-following SMPL system. In general, if the tp is increased, the turning radius of Zebro is smaller. However, the Zebro does not always turn to the intended direction. To predict the trajectory of Zebro, a switching kinematic algorithm can be used. The switching kinematic algorithm can predict the trajectory of Zebro if a certain lower boundary of tp is exceeded. The Zebro can also turn to the intended direction if that lower boundary is exceeded. The results of the simulation still cannot be verified by the results of the implementation. <br","max-plus algebra; switching max-plus linear system; kinematics; Zebro; turning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Research into multi-axial fatigue requires knowledge on the through time and thickness development of the propagating crack front. In order to provide this knowledge methods must be developed to monitor crack initiation and growth during a fatigue test. The acoustic emission method has been recognised as a possible means to this end. <br/>Fatigue is a failure mode that is characterised by the accumulation of damage during cyclic loading. Fatigue initiates on the microscale as dislocation movement, and subsequently develops into crack growth and eventual failure. In the assessment of fatigue damage it is critical to estimate the remaining lifetime. Prediction models have been developed for uni-axial loaded joints. However in the field of multi-axial fatigue these models are inadequate. To improve upon these models knowledge is required on the development of the fracture during cyclic multi-axial loading.<br/>The acoustic emission method is a procedure for non-destructive testing that is based on detecting elastic stress waves originating from changes in the microstructure of an object. In the industry two common applications of acoustic emission exist. One of these aims to extract insights into the severity of damage from waveform features, the other aims to localise and correlate acoustic events. Novel applications focus mainly on the improvement of these two fields. A state of the art method is proposed which aims to localise acoustic sources in small scale volumes as a means of imaging the crack front. <br/>Localisation of the sources is performed using a time difference of arrive scheme, which is also known as multilateration. The accuracy of this scheme is highly dependent on the accuracy of the input parameters. Therefore the times of arrival, receiver positions and speed of sound must be established meticulously. <br/>Extensive processing is required to transform the recorded acoustic emission data into a representation of the crack propagation. For this purpose a post-processing system has been developed which automates time of arrival picking, event building and event localisation. The developed system is an extension to the AMSY-6 acoustic emission measurement system developed by Vallen Systeme. <br/>In order to validate the accuracy of the extended measurement system an experiment has been designed. In a volumetric geometry sources are simulated in order to assess the bias and the variance, additionally noise is added to the simulation to evaluate the sensitivity of the procedures. <br/>The study has shown that, under ideal noise conditions, the precision can amount to a cluster of about a millimetre in size. Additionally the bias of this cluster can be reduced to a minimum by means of careful calibration of the receiver positions and the speed of sound. Both of these observations indicate that an accurate representation of the propagating crack front may be obtained through a regression model, if the conditions are known and within acceptable limits. Regarding non-ideal conditions the analysis of the noise sensitivity has shown that the accuracy is relatively stable as long as the signal to noise ratio is kept above SNR ≥ 30 dB.<br/>In conclusion this has shown that monitoring the propagation of the crack front using volumetric acoustic emission source localisation may be possible if the conditions are right. This means that the signal to noise ratio must be kept above SNR ≥ 30 dB. If this is the case, and if enough events are recorded to perform regression both the bias and the variance should pose a problem to monitoring crack growth. <br","Acoustic Emission; Fatigue; Non-destructive testing; Imaging; Crack growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","4D-Fatigue",""

(mentor); Head, A.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The growing interest in organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) based power systems has encouraged ample amount of literature on the design methodologies for unconventional turbo-machinery. These machines generally operate in the so-called Non-Ideal Compressible Fluid Dynamic (NICFD) region of the working fluid where the thermophysical properties and transport properties models, and optical properties are experimentally unexplored. Therefore, these design methods need to be validated using state-of-the-art measurement techniques like Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). PIV has not been implemented to study the non-ideal behaviour of such fluids, and therefore a feasibility study of PIV in these unconventional media is required. This work deals with exploring the possible challenges that could occur while applying the PIV technique to measure the flow comprising of non-ideal fluids in low speed and high-speed regime.<br/><br/>The fluids for which the feasibility is studied are Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and Hexamethyldisiloxane (MM) which are frequently used working fluids for ORC power systems. The equation of state used to calculate thermo-physical properties of these fluids is briefly discussed. The viscosity of these fluids is calculated to assess the tracer particle response characteristics and check for large variations of viscosity with the thermodynamic variables. To be able perform optical diagnostics, one also has to explore the optical properties of the working fluid --- especially the refractive index. Therefore, a theoretical study of refractive index and influence of thermodynamic properties on the refractive index is studied. Conventional seeding techniques are reviewed and its feasibility for the fluids of interest is discussed.<br/><br/>A test facility called the Non-Intrusive Vapour Analyser (NIVA) was designed to conduct PIV in low speed vapour flows induced by a rotating disk. A suspension of D4 and 170 nm titania particles was evaporated to obtain a seeded volume of D4 vapour, on which PIV can be performed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated to verify sufficient light scattering property of the titania particles. The seeding technique of evaporating the suspension of D4 + titania yields sufficiently homogeneous seeding distribution. Mean velocity fields of the vapour flow in the NIVA at different disk rotation speeds could be measured with acceptable uncertainties. Considering a vast difference in flow conditions at high-speeds, a theoretical study of high-speed MM flow in a de-Laval nozzle is done to explore challenges that could occur in application of PIV. Large gradients in density are typical of dense gas expansions. This subsequently results in large gradients in optical properties like refractive index. Challenges to particle imaging due to inhomogeneous refraction of light are investigated by preliminary estimation of position error and velocity error along the nozzle axis. A conceptual design of the seeding system is proposed that can operate at high-pressures and does not risk contamination of the working fluid.<br/><br/>It was concluded from the experimental results in NIVA that PIV is feasible in low-speed vapour flows and can measure velocity fields with an average uncertainty of less than 1%. Also, refractive index gradients in high-speed vapour flows could cause unacceptable errors of greater than 1% in PIV measurements. These errors depend on the complexity of the fluid and the distance between the measurement plane and nozzle wall. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

How does the environmental impact compare to average washing machine use, and what level of change is reached through the current interventions?<br/>Which design solutions can provide the best results in terms of environmental impact, customer satisfaction and business viability? Which design and business model solutions can provide the best results for creating the sustainable customer behaviour interventions?<br/><br/>To answer the first question, a literature review was conducted to understand what sustainability entails in the case of washing machines, and which factors influence it.<br/>Nationwide washing data was then collected, and compared through statistical analysis to the washing data of HOMIE customers. Although the monthly mailings did not have a statistically siginificant effect on the washing behaviour, there was still a statistically significant difference between certain washing behaviour aspects of HOMIE customers and the national averages.<br/><br/>Gaining the necessary insights for the second research question also started with a literature review, aimed at understanding the relevance of customer behaviour to the environmental impact of washing machine use.

Driven by the curiosity of the studio on projects that aim at solving social problems, this graduation project was set up as a collaboration of Oak &amp; Morrow with TU Delft. The research of the project provides insights on the value that the discipline of Futures thinking can add to Strategic design when designing for projects related to societal challenges. Moreover, it argues that the combination of both disciplines can be used as a knowledge base to develop solutions for societal challenges that have a positive effect on the systemic level. The project has dealt with both a research and a design part. The research part has explored three different areas, being 1. Futures thinking and Strategic design, 2. internal analysis of Oak &amp; Morrow and 3. societal challenges and social innovation. Different types of qualitative methodology has been employed to tackle these three areas, with research methods including literature and generative research, among others. As part of the research activities, different sessions such as a Contextmapping session with Oak &amp; Morrow, or a testing session with design students have been conducted. Based on all the findings of the research of the project, a toolkit has been designed for Oak &amp; Morrow to use Futures thinking and Strategic design to design for societal challenges. As part of the information reviewed to collect insights for the design of the tool, existing tools and methodologies of the disciplines of Strategic design and Futures thinking were analysed during the research phase. These served as inspiration for the ideation of the toolkit for Oak &amp; Morrow. Moreover, the main conclusions of the research that inspired the design of the toolkit have been compressed in different sets of criteria. These criteria defined the characteristics and purposes of the toolkit. The toolkit designed for Oak &amp; Morrow includes activities of Futures thinking and business innovation and contemplates guidelines of social innovation. The toolkit has been structured in three phases: 1. Preparations phase, 2. Uncovering value opportunities and 3. Towards systemic change. Each of the three phases includes different tools focused on a different step of the Futures thinking, business innovation or social innovation process. Overall, the project’s outcomes uncover the value of combining Futures thinking and Strategic design for designing for projects related to societal challenges with a systemic impact. Moreover, the toolkit gives Oak &amp; Morrow the opportunity of exploring a new line of expertise and making stronger their current strategic toolkit.

Using timber as the main structural material, the carbon footprint of a building is strongly reduced since the carbon will be stored for as long as the building stands or the timber is used. <br/><br/>An integrated structural concept was developed for free-form timber structures, which is light and yet strong while trying to keep difficult node connections to a minimum. The structural concept consists of ribbed elements that are covered with plates on the top and the bottom. The ribbed elements are cut from laminated veneer lumber to allow a smooth transition in depth according to the structural demands. The ease of fabrication is achieved by designing simple connections such as an incision in the ribbed elements and the plates are connected by screws. The maximum length subject to fabrication and transportation constraints has been considered. This has been achieved by determining the efficient height and the allowable stresses have been reduced.<br/><br/>For structural design, an automated procedure was developed to yield a smooth height variation of the roof structure and place the material where structurally required and thus achieving a significant weight reduction. Deep sections are used where bending govern the design and shallow section where shell action is dominant. Furthermore, the smooth height variation meets the desired shape from architectural design's point-of-view. <br/><br/>In general, it can be concluded that the developed structural concept is suitable for the design of a free-form timber structure that exhibits both bending and shell behaviour. In order to achieve an integrated structural concept, the inhomogeneous material properties of timber were incorporated in the structural concept. Precaution has been taken in the computational modelling by also taking into account the different directions for the anisotropic material properties. <br","Structural Concept; Timber; Free-Form Structure; Smooth Height Variation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By traveling supersonically, launch vehicles are exposed to harsh environmental conditions during the various phases of operation. However, the most extreme operational conditions are encountered within the rocket engines themselves. By their process, combustion temperatures can reach an excess of 3000 K followed by a 'mere’ 1100 K at the nozzle surface. Considering that these temperatures tremendously exceed the maximum operating temperatures of typical launcher materials, active cooling is required to enable continuous operation. Active cooling is often achieved by cooling channels, which are formed by constant cross-sectional, hollow tubes welded onto the inner surface of the nozzle. Even though the application of these cooling channels are quite common, detailed investigations on their more fundamental design properties are absent for flow conditions similar to those encountered in rocket nozzles. As such, it is decided eliminate the custom design aspects and reduce the complexity of the nozzle roughness elements to periodically placed, ribbed roughness elements. <br/><br/>The aim of the present study is to obtain quantitative insights on the influence of large, ribbed wall roughness elements on the mean flow, heat transfer and turbulence properties of a turbulent, supersonic boundary layer (M = 2.0).

(mentor); van Nes, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Complex urban planning problems comprise socio-spatial conditions, human behaviour and external factors (e.g. technological developments). The perspective of urban planners and designers is crucial to comprehend these problems from a holistic point of view but does not possess the skills to grapple the full problem. Cities bear characteristics of complex systems in which the interaction between decision makers is an important factor in the manifestation of urban change. Quantitative and computational methods are becoming increasingly capable at evaluating this aspect of urban planning problems. Computational models, although a simplification of reality, can help to evaluate many data and therefore extend the thinking capacity. Design thinking can interpret model outcomes in the broader socio-spatial context. But integration between these engineering-based methods on the one hand and the conventional urban planning and design methods proves challenging. This research investigates how an integrated methodology can lead to better understanding of urban planning problems. Models that comprehend built environment dynamics, can be used as design evaluation tool. The uncertainty around the spatial impacts of automated driving is used as case study for a complex urban planning problem. How automated driving will affect cities depends on the development and the deployment of the technology but also on how human agents adapt their behaviour. Mobility aspects (and therefore automated driving) relate to the built environment through the concept of accessibility and by the integration of the transportation system in space. An important condition to employ computational models within a research process is to explicitly define the system one evaluates. This research narrows down to households and their location choice behaviour as important behavioural aspect in urban development. The residential location choice depends on characteristics of the households itself and on dwelling, environment and location attributes. Automated vehicles are propagated to be more efficient in terms of infrastructure demands and travel efficiency compared to conventional vehicles. Therefore, this technology relates to the decision factors of households through spatial quality and accessibility effects. A scenario approach is employed to grapple the uncertainty around automated driving. In four scenarios, different development paths of automated driving are assumed. The province of Utrecht in the Netherlands is used as case study to provide for context and data. This research employs a residential location choice model to examine the changes in moving behaviour of households in space caused by the development of automated driving. The accessibility effects are studied with a transport model and the spatial quality effects are obtained by research and design. The residential location choice model evaluates these factors. The result is a change in urban development pattern. The results are interpreted in an urban strategy where the results of previous research steps are synthesised and assessed, to provide for interpretation of the research outcome from a holistic socio-spatial perspective. Computational models ask for explicit data which complicates the compatibility between various research steps. This research shows that it is possible to implement qualitative design methods within the data collection process. Design-based research methods are easier to apply and therefore relate directly towards the context of the problem. For using a computational model, this requires often for an operational model before one can comprehend the context. This makes for a more complicated research process. Therefore, employing an integrated methodology in urban planning research proves challenging but helps to approach the urban planning problem from a holistic perspective. An integrated approach broadens both perspectives to consider and combine the most important variables. By explicitly defining the problem, core principles reveal and computational models help to explain the dynamics between these core principles. Interpretation of the results in the socio-spatial context allows to account for the values that are inherent to urban planning problems. The method is labour intensive and does not guarantee more inspiring and detailed plans or designs. But the outcomes for proposed actions relate better to the factors that are significant to the system and elaborate more accurately on the uncertainty and dynamics the urban planning problem encompass.

In forward models of glacial isostatic adjustment, mantle viscosity is often assumed to be laterally homogeneous. However, a lateral transition in shear wave velocities suggests a sharp transition in viscosity between West and East Antarctica. Along this transition, horizontal GPS velocities of<br/>ANET/POLENETWest of the Ross Sea Embayment point towards the ice load rather than away from it. It is unclear why, as the dependency of horizontal velocities on viscosity is not well understood. In this thesis, this dependency is clarified, and it is investigated with a 3D finite-element model if the horizontal GPS velocities can be used to constrain the viscosity transition.<br/><br/>It was found that horizontal velocities point away from the ice load for viscosities of 1020 Pa s and lower, whereas for 1021 Pa s and higher their direction is reversed. The results in this thesis show that the GPS measurements at the Ross Sea Embayment likely require a lateral viscosity transition.<br/>Preferred viscosities in the upper mantle are found to lay between 1018 and 1019 Pa s at the West Antarctic side of the transition, and between 1021 and 1022 Pa s at the East Antarctic side. The results demonstrate that horizontal GPS velocities can be used to constrain lateral variations in rheology. As more studies will start to use 3DEarth models, horizontal GPS velocities should be used as one of the<br/>primary constraints of glacial isostatic adjustment, since their direction can be reversed depending on mantle viscosity.","Glacial Isostatic Adjustment; GPS; Horizontal; Antarctica; FEM; 3D; Viscosity; Ross Sea Embayment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

The proposed work is motivated by the research questions concerning what are the relevant critical modeling strategies that accurately reproduce the behavior of in-plane crushed laminated composite parts with LS-Dyna, how will the simulation model be evaluated following the modeling strategies, and which are the main similarities and dissimilarities among the result of the modeling strategies considered. The research objective is to develop detailed finite element simulation models for axially crushed GFRP composite parts which can represent complex damage modes by a methodical approach in a reasonable time with LS-Dyna explicit. Previous research has shown the necessity to calibrate many parameters with no physical meaning to correctly reproduce crushing. This research addresses these gaps by benchmarking two material models that are not characterized by such effects (*MAT_261, *MAT_262) in comparison with the one characteristic of such behavior, *MAT_54. The most important contribution is to the crashworthiness industry. To date, no research studies were found in the literature covering all the aspects described. This work demonstrates how to deploy such capabilities starting from simple numerical models, to vehicle parts. To illustrate these concepts, the necessary assumptions to create the models and how the parameters were identified have been described while choosing fully integrated shell and thick shell elements. The qualitative and quantitative criteria defined were necessary to systematically evaluate more than 200 simulations in comparison with available experimental data from Daimler AG. The significant findings from the research demonstrate that *MAT_261 and *MAT_262 are not subjected to strain localization phenomena, unlike *MAT_54. The developed set of parameters resulted in a low sensitivity of the *MAT_262 models concerning element size, lay-up or impact energy. Moreover, the research demonstrates that more accurate quantitative results than the current state of the art can be produced with a 5.0 mm element length against the general belief that fine-meshed and mesh convergence studies are required. Contrary to the expectations *MAT_261 demonstrated a low mean force in crushing although sharing the input parameters with *MAT_262 and similar damage laws. The developed models and set of *MAT_262 parameters can be deployed in full vehicle crash simulations with the plug-in possibility to evaluate new design variants. It is concluded that the findings provide support fulfilling the research objective.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-10-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The main goal of any launch vehicle is to bring as much payload to space as possible. Space planes have been studied for decades, as they are thought to be more cost effective for frequent access to space than traditional expendable launchers. This research aims at optimizing the payload capacity of a single stage to orbit (SSTO) horizontal take-off horizontal landing (HTHL) space plane, by flying a minimum fuel an heat load trajectory. Trajectory optimization of launch vehicles is traditionally performed with local optimization methods. The objective of this research is to find a good approach to optimize the ascent trajectory with a global optimizer. To achieve this goal, a simulation model is set up. This model propagates the ascent trajectory based on a guided angle of attack and throttle setting as a function of the normalized energy state of the vehicle. The guidance parameters are defined at a number of control nodes and are stored in a decision vector. This vector is randomly initialized and subsequently optimized. The performance of different optimization methods and problem settings is assessed based on the convergence of the optimized populations with respect to a set of evaluation objectives. Specifically multi-objective (MO) global optimizers were selected for this research. The performance of MOEA/D, NSGA-II and NSGA-II-tabu was compared. MOEA/D was found to give the most consistent result and fastest convergence. Different combinations of control parameters were used. The use of thrust-vector control improved the convergence and the quality of the results, as long as the problem dimension was not over-sized. Also various approaches for constraint and objective handling were evaluated. As the objectives and constraints were highly conflicting, a penalty function had to be included to reduce the sensitivity to premature convergence to no-flying solutions. <br/>The resulting set up was not able to find a solution for the complete trajectory. The trajectory was therefore split in three phases: take-off, acceleration and pull-up. The first two stages were optimized successfully and resulted in similar payload capacities as found in the literature with traditional methods. The final pull-up stage needs to be further investigated. Although this research has shown that global optimizers can be used for the ascent trajectory optimization, further research is required before the methods can be applied effectively.","space plane; optimization; trajectory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Due to the increasing share of electricity that is produced from renewable energy sources, the operational hours of these conventional power plants are decreasing. However, these power plants are also the main source of frequency reserves, which are required to guarantee the stability of the electricity grid. Stability is maintained if there is a real time balance between the electricity production and consumption. Due to the decreasing availability of conventional power plants, the possibility to offer frequency reserves with other power sources must be explored. A possible provider is the Car Park as Power Plant (CPPP). This is an aggregation of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) parked in a car park and operating in Vehicle to Grid (V2G) mode. This thesis contains a technical and economic feasibility assessment of a Car Park as Power Plant offering frequency reserves in a future power system with a low share of conventional power plants.<br/><br/>The dynamics of the frequency was analysed considering the reduction of the operational hours of the conventional power plants. This causes the inertia in the system to decrease. As a consequence, this increases the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF). A high RoCoF makes the frequency react faster which will make it more feasible that the maximum instantaneous frequency deviation will be reached. When this maximum deviation is reached, the system enters the alert state, which could endanger the global security of the system. To prevent the frequency from reaching the maximum instantaneous frequency deviation under conditions of a high RoCoF, the full activation time (FAT) of the frequency reserves could be reduced. The FAT is the maximum time between the moment that the signal for a change in power output is given and the actual moment that the required power output is reached. Reserves with a reduced FAT are referred to as fast frequency reserves. By measuring the FAT of the FCEV in V2G mode with an experimental setup, it was tested if the FCEV could offer the fast frequency reserves. The FCEV appeared to be a suitable power source to offer fast frequency reserves. When the power output of the battery and the fuel cell are combined, an even higher power gradient and thus a shorter full activation time, can be obtained. However, improvements must be implemented in the V2G discharge unit and the energy management system of the FCEV to optimise the operation in V2G mode. The economic feasibility of the CPPP as provider of frequency reserves was then analysed. The factor that has the highest impact, is the position of the CPPP on the bid ladder. Only when the price for frequency reserves is relatively high, the reserves of the CPPP will be activated. This is caused by the high price for hydrogen, which is the dominant factor in the marginal costs of the CPPP. Most of the time the prices for frequency reserves and for electricity sold on the spot market are lower than the marginal costs of the CPPP.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view the CPPP is a suitable power source to offer fast frequency reserve. The profitability of the CPPP is, however, strongly related to the occupation pattern of the car park and the price for frequency reserves. The occupation pattern can be influenced by the aggregator by giving incentives to the car owners, combining different car parks with deviating occupation patterns or by operating company car parks with, for example, autonomous driving cars. The price for frequency reserves is dependent on the quickly evolving market and can not be influenced by the aggregator of the CPPP. The aggregator can influence the marginal costs of the CPPP. By adding relevant components to the system, like hydrogen production units or storage facilities, the aggregator can offer reserves with different power sources, which will have different marginal costs. From the point of view of the transmission system operator, it could be possible to add an extra product for fast frequency reserves instead of changing the requirements of the existing reserves. This could have a positive effect on the profitability of the CPPP.

The project is conducted from May to October 2017.<br/><br/>Essent NV is the largest energy provider in the Netherlands with 2.4 million customers for electricity and about 2.1 million for gas. Essent serves the residential and business market. The focus of the thesis is on the business market, the market in which Essent Zakelijk operates with a focus on large business consumers with an electricity connection larger than 3x80 Ampère or a gas connection greater than 40 m3/hour. <br/><br/>Essent Zakelijk was the biggest business unit within Essent, in recent years they lost that position as Essent Zakelijk became a loss-making business segment which was explained by Essent as a result of external and internal forces that put pressure on the profitability of Essent Zakelijk. The way of how Essent addresses the challenge of making a loss making department profitable, is by viewing the problem from an operational perspective. The desire from Essent for this project is to approach the problem context from a consumer perspective rather than a cost driven perspective. <br/><br/>The main research question is: how can energy providers, in specific Essent Zakelijk, be relevant for its large business consumers? By finding out what those needs are from business consumers and translating those needs into a revised Essent Zakelijk strategy from a business consumer perspective. And lastly, translating the strategy into a new service proposition for Essent Zakelijk. <br/><br/>Due to the consumer centric nature of the assignment, the process of the project is inspired by the design thinking methodology which is a human-centric method. This methodology blends an end-user focus with multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative development to produce innovative products and services by iterating between the stages empathise, define, ideate, prototype and test. In order to create a desirable, feasible and viable outcome, stakeholder involvements are crucial in the process. <br/><br/>The context of the business energy market is explored by researching the relevant energy trends with the corresponding implications for business customers. <br/><br/>To assess the needs of business consumers around their energy affairs, open-ended interviews are conducted with eight business consumers within different industries that have their own specific energy consumption profile in order to examine commonalities, differences and relationships. Secondly, the energy offerings of competitors are explored to create an indication of the issues business consumers encounter during the orientation process of choosing energy commodity, and non-commodity, products and services. <br/><br/>The insights found by investigating the needs of large business consumers and by mapping the implications and opportunities of the market onto large business consumers are the input for reframing the Essent Zakelijk strategy from a business consumer perspective. The reframed Essent Zakelijk strategy shows the desire for having a service to business customers to filter the information overload present in the energy market. The aim is to find the lowest total bill, by working together with a trusted partner who understands their company and its industry. <br/><br/>The reframed business consumer strategy will guide the solution frame, using the Design Sprint methodology followed by iterative concept development resulting from the output of the design sprint. Constant validation and verification with Essent, experts and users, led to the final concept: the Energy Co-pilot. This research concludes with a list of final recommendations and remarks. <br","Business energy market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Therefore, monitoring these structures to get the information of their health condition, which is called structural health monitoring (SHM), is becoming more significant. In SHM, acoustic emission (AE) technique shows promising features in detection, localization and characterization of damage. This technique has been applied in many fields, such as steel structures, composite structures and concrete structures. In dealing with existing concrete structures, cracks can influence the features of AE signals when they are on the way from the defect to the sensor. Therefore, it may challenge the commonly-used notion of AE monitoring. The influence of crack on AE monitoring has not been sufficiently investigated. More quantitative assessment on the crack influence on AE signals is believed to be valuable for the evaluation of accuracy and reliability of AE monitoring of existing concrete structures. In this research, the influence of crack on AE signals has been studied quantitatively. Experiments on cracks with different opening have been performed to support the formulation of the signals. The results are then used as inputs for an analytical study on source localization influenced by a crack. A three-dimensional (3D) triangulation technique has been used for source localization on a modeled cracked concrete beam. Localization error can therefore be estimated for AE sources in the presence of existing cracks. Furthermore, the influence of a crack on the amplitude of AE signals has been discussed. With the demonstrated crack-induced errors and attenuations ranges, the results can provide insights to the accuracy and reliability of AE monitoring in practical situations.","Acoustic Emission; Existing concrete structures; Source localization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a designer, food textures can be considered as tools to shape people’s snacking experiences. Textures of food have impact on both consciousness and satiation: the aforementioned factors play the most significant roles in termination of eating. Thus by unfolding the relationships between the perceived textures and conscious and satiating snacking, more opportunities to control calories intake can be proposed.<br/><br/>A series of qualitative research and literature review were conducted to discover the determinants for conscious and satiating snacking experiences.

Capable of running on renewable fuels, SOFCs are regarded as potential solution to carbon-neutral energy conversion path. SOFCs operate on fuel supplied to the anode and oxidant supplied to the cathode. The anode should facilitate the oxidation of fuel and transport of electrons from the reaction site to the current collector. It should also enable the diffusion of gaseous fuel to the reaction sites and reaction products away from the reaction sites. Meeting abovementioned requirements, Ni/YSZ cermets are competent SOFC anodes, where Ni is an electronic conductor, YSZ is an ionic conductor, and pores in between Ni and YSZ facilitate the fuel supply. Fuel oxidation occurs in the vicinity of triple phase boundaries (TPBs), where Ni particles, YSZ particles and pore interact. Thus, TPB length quantifies the electrochemically active sites within the anode. The fuel oxidation involves physical processes and multi-elementary reaction steps in reality, among which exists a rate-limiting step. The overall reaction rate can be represented by the rate-limiting step whose kinetics are proposed as a function of the TPB length. In many past computational studies of the cermet anode, a global electrochemical reaction expressed by Butler-Volmer equation is put forward, simplifying electrode reaction to a single step process and probably inadequately to present insights into intrinsic processes occurring within the anode. In this work, TPB-based kinetics, derived from the pattern anode experiment, are implemented in a CFD model to evaluate the performance of Ni/YSZ cermet-based cells. For model validation, simulated polarization curves are compared with the experimental ones. TPB length as a fitting parameter is determined to ensure the agreement between simulated polarization curves and experimental ones. The fitted TPB length is found to be several orders of magnitudes lower than physical TPB length of typical Ni-YSZ cermet anode, which might imply that only a small fraction of the physical TPB length actually participates in the electrochemical reactions. CFD behavior like species distribution and electrochemical behavior like overpotential breakdown are investigated. The gradient of species molar fraction in anode turns to be larger than that in fuel channel, agreeing with the fact that fluid flow is much slower in anode where species transport in porous electrode is dominated by diffusion rather than convection. The cathode activation overpotential makes the most significant contribution to the overall overpotential. The anode activation overpotential at high current density region in the case of low molar fraction of inlet hydrogen yields rapid increase, which could be explained as a consequence of rapid decrease of exchange current density in the vicinity of anode/electrolyte interface. Parametric study of operating temperature is conducted later to see its effect on the cell performance. The higher the operating temperature is, the slower drop of cell voltage with respect to cell current is observed. At a fixed cell voltage, an elevated temperature will cause intensified fuel consumption/vapor generation within anode, leading to a larger gradient of species molar fraction and accordingly a larger concentration overpotential.","SOFC; Ni/YSZ anode; TPB length; rate-limiting step; TPB-based kinetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flow velocities in vegetated flows are lower than in non-vegetated flows under otherwise similar conditions due to the increased drag by the plants. Therefore, a shear layer develops across the interface. Within this shear layer, Kelvin-Helmholz like vortices develop, inducing exchange of mass and momentum through the interface. These vortices are present in the water column, but their strength near the bed governs sediment transport mechanisms, which are the basis of morphological activity. The objective of this study was therefore: to obtain a better understanding of the coherent flow structures in the interface between vegetated and non-vegetated river beds and the effect of these structures on sediment transport mechanisms.

It can be seen as a thin wedge of water running up the beach face (Brocchini and Baldock, 2008). Under storm conditions runup is responsible for beach and dune erosion and accurate runup predictions are therefore required (Ruggiero et al., 2001; Stockdon et al., 2005). For runup and its components, the time-mean setup component and the time-varying swash component, empirical parameterizations have been developed in the past, but they cannot be validated for storm conditions due to a lack of data (Stockdon et al., 2005). The data gap can be filled by numerically simulated runup, for example with the process-based XBeach model. XBeach is a depth-averaged model which predicts nearshore hydrodynamics and can be used in a phase-averaged or a phase-resolving mode. However, both the significant incident and infragravity swash is underpredicted by the phase-averaged XBeach Surfbeat model (Palmsten and Splinter, 2016; Stockdon et al., 2014), which does not resolve incident wave motions. In order to predict runup under storm conditions with confidence the performance of XBeach under mild conditions should be assessed. Here runup simulated with XBeach Surfbeat and the phase-resolving XBeach Non-hydrostatic for the intermediate reflective beach of Duck was compared to measurements of the SandyDuck'97 experiment, where mild offshore conditions were present. A 2DH model was set up using measured bathymetry and forced with measured frequency-directional spectra. The hydrodynamics responsible for a difference in runup prediction were investigated and their origin in the cross shore was identified. It was shown that the prediction of significant incident and infragravity swash can be improved by using the phase-resolving XBeach Non-hydrostatic model instead of the XBeach Surfbeat model, while performance for setup remains similar. Incident swash predictions are improved by resolving the incident wave motions. The major part of the improvement in infragravity swash predictions is driven by differences in infragravity wave transformation between the two XBeach models. A small part also originates within the swash zone, for which incident bore merging can be a possible explanation. The difference in infragravity wave height predictions between the two XBeach models mainly develops in the surf zone where a different response to directional spreading and different degrees of shoaling most likely can explain the difference in infragravity wave height. Against expectations no correlation with the groupiness of the incident waves or with the phase difference between wave group and infragravity wave was found. A small part of the difference in infragravity wave height predictions is already present near the offshore boundary and probably results from interaction processes between high and low frequency wave boundary conditions. It can thus be said that on intermediate reflective beaches, where both incident and infragravity waves play a role, the resolving of incident wave motions is a necessity to predict runup accurately. In these situations the phase-resolving XBeach Non-hydrostatic model should therefore be used, instead of the phase-averaged XBeach Surfbeat model. Here only an intermediate reflective beach and a small range of energetic conditions were included. More types of beaches and storm condition forcing should be investigated to be able to validate the empirical parameterizations but also to further indicate applicability ranges of the two XBeach models. Also, more attention should be paid to hydrodynamic differences at the boundary and in the surf zone in order to find more conclusive reasons for differences between the two XBeach models.","XBeach; runup; numerical modelling; SandyDuck'97; infragravity waves; hydrodynamics; swash","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

Despite the technological, economic and environmental benefits that the new generation system brings about, intermittent and uncontrollable nature of the renewable energy sources creates new type of challenges. The emergence of microgrids, prompted by such background, can offer a platform for effective integra- tion of distributed generation systems.<br/>In this thesis, two microgrids network interconnected through a backbone bus is developed. The main feature of this system is the absence of ICT infrastructure. Instead, the so-called droop con- trol is used to regulate power outputs among the interconnected microgrids; frequency information obtained from local measurements, is the only signal used for communications.<br/>Within this context, the thesis focuses on improvements of issues related to short-term dynamics of the droop control. To be more specific, it concerns the seamless transitions between islanded and backbone connected mode. The novel advanced controllers were developed in order to en- able these seamless transitions. They also aim to overcome the challenges found in the previous works within the same project. Three main functions exist in the controllers implemented for this thesis: synchronisation, seamless intentional(planned) and unintentional(unplanned) islanding. These developed controllers were verified and validated through both simulations and experimen- tal analysis. A significantly improved synchronisation performance was found, with the use of the newly introduced Synchronous Reference Frame-Phase Locked Loop (SRF-PLL) method. A fine tun- ing of the control parameters for voltage source inveters helped to shorten the preparation time for planned islandings. Last but not least, the introduction of the fuzzy droop controller reduced tran- sients in the microgrids during unexpected disconnections.<br/>The software platform used for the development was LabVIEW, and GPIC FPGA was utilised as the hardware platform. The functionality of the controllers were tested under several base and extreme case studies and scenarios. The results were compared to that of the previous controllers and the agreement between simulation and experimental results were evaluated.","Microgrids; Smart Grid; Droop Control; Distributed Energy Resources; Labview","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","CSGRiP",""

(mentor); Lukszo, Z. (mentor); van Gelder, P.H.A.J.M. (mentor); Geurts, Rengko (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Due to automation and robotization of material handling systems (MHS) in the transportation industry, maintaining equipment and systems becomes more important, and needs to be integrated in the company’s business strategy (Tsang, 2002). Implementing and investing in the right maintenance approach to keep these systems in optimum state is therefore essential for the performance of a company and more important, for the customer’s satisfaction. When a company has to deal with an increase in failures and decreasing performance, it needs to anticipate to change this negative trend. In literature, most of these problems are analysed by using electronic data and condition-based monitoring (Bouvard, Artus, Bérenguer, &amp; Cocquempot, 2011). Analysing the condition of equipment requires data monitoring which is not always possible. Besides, these analyses are often based on a single system which conditions do not apply on systems with different specifications. TNT Express (initiator of this research) is dealing with this problem within the Benelux. They are dealing with decreasing on-time delivery (OTD) performance and increasing costs of smaller sorting-sites without technicians. Having high OTD performance is an essential element of TNT’s business strategy, and is a competitive advantage in their industry. Their time-critical processes combined with the interrelated network structure of their sites makes it hard to develop a single strategy or solution that positively affects the performance of all sites. The differences in size, work methods, level of technology, different size of freight and fluctuating demands makes it a dynamic and complex environment with a lot of variables that influence the performance of on-time delivery. That makes it hard to identify the causes and effects of these failures over time. Besides, TNT doesn’t have the useful data to base their maintenance on. Therefore, finding the bottlenecks and the right variables that influence this performance most is essential for decreasing the costs of TNT. Therefore, the objective of this research is: “Identify the constraints of TNT’s Material Handling Systems in a dynamic environment, to be able to apply the right maintenance strategy that preserves TNT’s delivery performance at lower cost.” Before a start could be made on finding the bottlenecks of the sorting sites, TNT’s maintenance structure, operational structure, financial structure and operational structure needed to be defined. TNT’s sorting operation, where freight is unloaded, sorted, measures and loaded, runs around 19 hours a day, 6 days a week all year long. That limits the time for maintenance and check-ups to 6 hours a day. Still, a fast response is needed when the sorter does fail during operation, to prevent the process getting delayed which generates extra costs. TNT’s maintenance of those sites turned out to be depending on mostly corrective maintenance, and less on preventive and predictive maintenance. Mechanics are traveling from site to site to solve current incidents that cause delays, and less for preventive maintenance and check-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are also responsible for some maintenance activities, although these are mostly time-based and less used for trouble shooting. When specifying TNT’s on-time delivery performance, the performance of the sorting sites turned out to be the most important factor of the OTD. This sorting site performance is measured by the capacity of freight it theoretically can handle, and the amount of freight it is transporting in reality. This site performance is also influenced by several variables, where the Material Handling Systems availability turned out to be the largest influential variable. The failing devices and equipment are the cause that IV operators on the floor have to sort manually, which takes a lot more time. Besides, these delays are generating extra costs, only how much and which costs is not quite clear. TNT’s limited registration of essential elements like downtime, maintenance costs and OEM activities made it difficult to link these elements, and to find possible bottlenecks. So, to be able to link the MHS- downtime with the related costs on a daily basis, three Critical-to-Quality factors (CTQs) are analysed:  Breakdown costs  Maintenance costs  MHS availability Because the financial impact of a breakdown was not yet specified, the most important factors are determined by interviewing business improvement experts. Some costs turned out to be different for the import or export process during a working day. For TNT, the next financial factors turned out to be important: 1. Missed Check-Weight-Cube (CWC) revenue 2. Hiring extra vans and trucks 3. Personnel costs (overtime) 4. Financial consequences of lower service level (loss of customers) From these factors, the missed CWC revenue turned out to be largest costs factor in the import process, where hiring extra trucks and vans turned out to be the largest costs factor of the export process. These two factors are further specified and calculated, to link them to specific breakdowns. Depending on the volume in different locations, the missed CWC revenue is variating between €000,- and €000,- for a single shift per day. These costs are calculated by determining the number of packages that are affected by a breakdown and do not get a second weighing check on a next location, multiplied by the average revenue missed per parcel. These calculations showed that without a working sorter or CWC on a single location comes with large financial consequences. These specific insights in CWC revenue loss show the need for fewer failures to improve the financial performance of TNT by changing the maintenance activities. The extra costs of hiring extra vans to transport all freight towards the customers in the export process turned out to be €000,- for a single shift (1day). These costs are in the same order as the CWC revenue losses, and from financial perspective just as bad. The cost analysis regarding this data showed how disperse the information is within TNT, and that it is hard to develop a strategy without this kind of crucial information. Maintenance costs are referred as costs that are made to solve the incidents and include, service contracts, mechanics salaries etc. However, costs that are made for decreasing the number of incidents are more important. Think of hiring extra employees, changing service contracts, training current employees. Quantifying these costs is only possible when the bottlenecks of the breakdowns have been derived. V The lacking quality of the data regarding downtime and availability of the MHS made it impossible to use mathematical solutions to find the bottlenecks, so “Soft Operations Research” methods have been used to find the causes of the failures (Heyer, 2004; Masys, 2015). Using Pareto charts and Ishikawa diagrams on the incident file controlled by TNT’s mechanics, the data in this file is structured and enriched to find failures with recurring root causes that are a structural problem. First, three devices that have the most impact on the MHS availability are determined. These are the Sorter, Roller track/belts and Check- Weigh-Cube (CWC) and are responsible for 130 of the 210 incidents for the first 5 months in 2017, which represents more than 60% of all incidents of the MHS. The registered incident data of these three devices is enriched by going a step further in the cause, structuring all data, and visualising them in an Ishikawa diagram. By doing so, it became clear that a high number of incidents (35%) have an operation cause, which means that they are caused by human error. These incidents are not specifically location bounded, and solving the most frequent occurring incidents will prevent a lot of future incidents. The three selected root causes that are responsible for most incidents are: 1. Lack of system knowledge Operators, especially Team Leaders (TL) and Leading Hands (LH), have too little knowledge of the process, the effects of failures and simple technical solutions. There skills haven’t been developed with the increasing mechanisation. Not knowing the impact of failures, and how simple incidents can be prevented leads to unnecessary failures. 2. Sensor related incidents A large part of those operational incidents are sensor related. Because these incidents are still frequently occurring, they need to be handled separately. These incidents can be solved quite easy most of the times, and a support system to help operators to solve them is very helpful. 3. Lack of working according instructions A large part of the incidents are caused by wrong choices of operators, by putting wrong parcels on the sorter, putting them on the sorter at the wrong place or working not according the given instructions. The lack of knowing the consequences results in an uninterested work attitude which results in a performance decrease of the sorting site. For these three root causes, several improvements have been developed. For the first root cause, a training program is recommended which start with a well-communicated plan to create the urge for change. The current attitude of personnel is asking for a plan that provides support from the whole organisation. TNT needs to know the value of knowledge amongst their employees, and this needs support from top management. Combining this with low-technical training sessions and useful supporting tools will increase the employees’ knowledge, and also creates ownership with the employees. To do so, TNT needs to review its distribution between part-time employees from employment agencies, and employees contracted by TNT. Increasing system knowledge amongst employees is only effective if that knowledge stays within the company. Rewarding well performing VI employees with a contract by TNT will have positive effect on the knowledge on the work floor and not only prevents, but also decreases the amount of downtime. For sensor related incidents, a supporting manual has been developed that functions as a simple flow chart that guides TL through the process of solving these failures. Following these steps in the included manual gives simple but clear instructions how to act and what to do. Before using this supporting manual, the TL need sufficient training before they can execute the process. Although this solution is more focussed on corrective maintenance, this manual helps to solve simple incidents that mechanics do not have to solve by themselves. Not only are these incidents solved much quicker, due to direct handling of the TL, but the mechanics do not have to drive towards the location of the incident. That also gives the mechanics more time to do preventive maintenance tasks, and therefore further decrease the number of incidents of the MHS. This manual strengthens the need for more direct or autonomous maintenance within the sorting sites of TNT (Chen, 2013). Currently, these sites are too depended on the knowledge of external maintenance providers to repair the failures which is not desirable. To improve that employees work more according instructions, better supervision is advised and recommendations are made to reward well-performing operators. Rewarding operators also means that they will be more responsible for their colleagues and have to make sure that they understand the instructions. They become responsible for preventing wrong parcels being put on the sorter, and have to correct their employees if they ignore the instructions because a lot of incidents are caused by wrong packages being put on the sorter. However, TNT should also improve the visibility and clarity of these instructions by using dummy parcels to indicate the allowed parcels sizes. Improving this product flow on the sorter will improve the sorters performance and lowers the number of incidents. The effect of these improvement could only be expressed by a decrease on the number of incidents, and not on downtime due to lacking data registration. If, as a starting point, already half of these structural incidents is solved by these improvements, the total amount of these 210 incidents over 2017 would already decrease with 13%. Due to the unknown length of the breakdowns, they cannot be compared to financial results although these results definitely improve. All these improvements are based on autonomous maintenance which is focussed on letting operators do more maintenance and technical tasks. Finally, all these improvements will help retaining TNT’s on-time delivery and decrease their breakdown costs. This process of finding these bottlenecks led to an even more valuable advice for gathering data. This research showed that TNT needs to improve their data collection system, and document important factors with a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) like time registration, downtime during operations, and weight of breakdown. This data also needs to be accessible for OEM’s, so they also have insight in the failures, and can help improve the MHS performance. With this data, TNT can measure the downtime and better monitor its MHS availability to see which devices or incidents need further improvement. The importance of such data collection system is once emphasized by the fact that it was hard to determine the bottlenecks, especially with multiple locations at the sorting locations of TNT. VII The goal was to identify the constraints in a dynamic environment that has a lot of influential factors that make it hard to determine the effects of these variables. Using multiple techniques based on the number of incidents and the failure history, the first bottlenecks could be derived that needed improvement. Together with a costs analysis on the most important financial factors, solutions and recommendations are developed that will retain TNT’s on-time delivery at lower costs. However, the recommendations for a more centralized data-based maintenance system could even be more valuable in the future.","Transport Logistics; Maintenance; Availability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

A common method to increase the SNR is to average time-locked responses over repeated trials. Unfortunately, relevant information is lost due to averaging. In addition, EEG responses are influenced by psychophysical elements, such as stimulus intensity and stimulus detection. Therefore, to reduce the loss of information and to control for psychophysical elements we developed a novel analysis method using linear mixed-effect (LME) models. Furthermore, capsaicin was used to challenge the novel method with the goal to quantify peripheral and central sensitization effects.<br/><br/>New method: LME models were used to include all EEG trials into one model to reduce the loss of information caused by averaging. In addition, phase locked and non-phase locked EEG data were combined with psychophysical data to control for psychophysical elements. <br/><br/>Results: Including all EEG trials into one model made it possible to perform statistical analyses. Moreover, combining EEG data with psychophysical data showed effects of stimulus detection, stimulus amplitude and the number of pulses on EEG responses. Although the LME models were able to test for significant effects after capsaicin application, the analyses did not show sensitization effects. <br/><br/>Comparison with existing methods: The phase locked EEG data was analyzed using conventional time-domain averaging methods and compared with LME models which included all EEG trials into one model.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This study showed that the novel LME method could be used to perform statistical analyses using all EEG trials and detect significant differences over time. In addition, psychophysical elements such as stimulus detection, amplitude and number of pulses could be controlled for both phase locked and non-phase locked EEG analyses. Probably, attention and learning effects played a role in the interpretation of the effects of capsaicin. Although application of this novel method showed no peripheral and central sensitization effects induced by capsaicin, it did show the potential of LME models in phase locked and non-phase locked EEG analyses.","mixed-effect model; intra-epidermal electrical; EEG Analysis; stimulus processing; capsaicin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-26","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

Meer specifiek is er onderzoek gedaan naar de situatie in Utrecht. In Utrecht zijn meerdere wko-systemen aanwezig en de Gemeente heeft plannen geformuleerd om in de buurt hiervan een plantsoen aan te leggen om hemelwater op te vangen en in de ondergrond te bergen. In deze studie is de invloed van deze owb op de omliggende wko-systemen onderzocht. Bij het bepalen van de invloed van een owb-systeem is zijn de neerslag- en ontwerp dimensies variabel.<br/><br/>Het onderzoek is gestart met de inventarisatie van de bodem in Utrecht. Hierbij is gekeken naar eigenschappen die van belang zijn voor de toepassing van beiden systemen. De bodem in Utrecht is opgebouwd uit twee verschillende typen lagen: de scheidende klei- en veenlagen en de watervoerende zandpakketten (aquifers). De dikte van de eerste scheidende laag is ca. 4 meter en de dikte van de eerste aquifer is ca. 40 meter. Met deze opbouw kan water in de aquifer worden geborgen zonder dat dit voor wateroverlast op het maaiveld (mv) zorgt.<br/><br/>De bodemenergiesystemen rondom het plantsoen betreffen die van de Jaarbeurs en de Rabobank.

OPC has become the highest-volume manufactured product on the planet. Production of OPC is energy-intensive, consumes unrenewable natural resources and is one of the primary contributors to global warming (accounting for at least 5-8% of worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emissions). An alternative for OPC concrete is Alkali-Activated Concrete (AAC), for which Portland cement is completely substituted by an alternative binder. Instead of using OPC and water, precursors (raw materials) like Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) or Fly Ash (FA) are activated with an alkaline activator solution.<br/>Although AAC seems to have promising qualities for structural application in terms of sustainability, worldwide use is not yet established. One of the reasons for this is the fact that there are no available regulations or codes to apply it, the material is relatively new and limited research has been conducted. For OPC concrete, the design codes are based on compressive strength at 28 days (strength at later ages stays either constant or is higher) and most other mechanical properties used in calculations are estimated based on this compressive strength. For AAC it is not yet sure if the same relations and assumptions as for OPC are also valid. First, because mechanical properties that have been reported for AAC in literature vary a lot, depending on mixture composition and curing conditions. Second, the long-term strength development of AAC is scarcely investigated and it is not clear if the compressive strength at 28 days can be used as a safe reference for design. Namely, a few researchers reported a decrease of strength or stiffness over time, for AAC mixtures that contain blast furnace slag. The observed decrease might not be a very desirable phenomenon and should be well-understood prior to wider structural application of AAC. Therefore, the main research question of this thesis is: Can a decrease of stiffness and strength over time, as sometimes reported in literature for AAC, also be found for AAC used at TU Delft and if so, what could be an explanation for this behaviour? Does the amount of BFS in the binder play a role, as a decrease over time has only been reported for AAC containing BFS? And if not, what other cause could lead to a decrease of properties over time? The intention is to make some first steps towards a better understanding of this phenomenon.<br/>The research question is investigated in an experimental manner. Compressive strength, elastic modulus, splitting tensile strength and flexural strength are tested at different ages (28, 56 and 91 days) after being wet-cured (20°C and 95% RH) for 28 days. Two different AAC mixtures are investigated, S100 and S50, characterized by a BFS/FA binder ratio of 100:0 and 50:50 respectively. Furthermore, the flexural behaviour of reinforced beams is investigated by conducting four-point bending tests on both S100 and S50 concrete of two different ages (33/34 days and 69/70 days) and compared to an OPC concrete control beam. <br","alkali-activated concrete; development of strength; development of stiffness; e-modulus; AAC; AAS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

The goal of the project was to find out how blockchain technology can help Schiphol Group to enhance the passenger experience. Blockchain is seen as a technology that will disrupt many industries. But why is this? The core value of blockchain is trust. The blockchain is a decentralised database which enables people and organisations to do transactions without having to trust each other. People are enabled to transact for example money without involving a bank. Because of this, blockchain will change the way we transact value on a global scale. Therefore it is important to explore what this new technology can do for companies. In this thesis the possibilities for Schiphol Group are explored.<br/>Schiphol Group has the ambition to become Europe’s prefered airport. Next to this, they have the ambition to become the world’s leading digital airport by 2018. To achieve this the airport has to continuously innovate. Schiphol Group does this by expanding the airport with the Capital Programme and by making the current airport smarter with the Digital Airport Programme. Both programmes aim to create an excellent seamless passenger process with a minimum of stressful moments.<br/>At the moment passengers experience dissatisfaction in some parts of their journey. This moments are often the moments with the lowest control. These include the waiting times at check in, security and passport control. To decrease waiting times, Schiphol works on a project called Seamless Flow, that enables passengers to pass checks with biometric identification. But, implementing biometric identification brings along some challenges. Enrollment still takes quite some time. It is hard to proof the removal of personal data. Scanning a person’s passport presents challenges because of privacy legislation. Last, due to the central character of the database it takes more effort to protect the data. To enhance passengers control over their journey and to solve the challenges biometric identification brings, the concept of a self sovereign identity is proposed. A self sovereign identity is a system working with blockchain technology in which the user has consent and control over who he shares his data with. In a self sovereign identity system, identity providers provide the user of an attestation, a proof of correctness, for example that it is indeed the persons passport. The identity provider can be governement for example who gives out your passport. From the same attestation a hash, a number that represents the attestation, is written onto the blockchain. The relying party, an organisation like for example an airline who wants a confirmation of the passengers identity, can than compare what is presented by the user with what is on the blockchain.<br/>When it’s a match, your identity is confirmed. <br/>In the ideal situation Schiphol does not have a role in the self sovereign identity system. Until government enables such a system, Schiphol has the opportunity to<br/>act as a identity provider. They can create attestations with the enrollment kiosks that are going to be used for biometric identification in the upcoming years.<br/>To enable Schiphol to act as an identity provider, the TravelWallet service is created. The TravelWallet is an application for passengers that enables them to store their data safely, all in one place. You control who you show your data to at the airport. The app stores your data on your phone in a way only you are able to open it with your fingerprints. This way you never have to take out your passport or boarding card at the airport after you are enrolled. After you verified your account at the airport, you will receive a push notification with a request to share your data, for example from the airline you are flying with. When approving the request, the airline is only able to see the information and not able to share it. If your identity is verified, you receive a confirmation. With the confirmation you can pass the gates towards security.<br/>The TravelWallet service has a lot of benefits for all the different stakeholders involved. The passenger will experience more control in their journey. They do not have to hassle with physical documents and they will have a faster and smoother journey. Schiphol will reduce the risk of cyberattacks and legal complications. Airlines can save time by replacing their time consuming identity verification methods. Implementing the TravelWallet will be expensive, but it can change the whole passenger journey and thereby save a lot of money. With the TravelWallet there is no need for a check-in desk (assuming that everyone uses<br/>the self service bag drop), physical border control or employees for the boarding process. By digitizing these processes, money, time and space can be saved.","blockchain; passenger experience; Amsterdam Airport Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The electrical performances include the output voltage drop and voltage ripple, rise time and decay time of output voltage and power losses. In order to get high imaging quality of the X-ray machine and reduce damage to patients, the multiplier circuit is required to be designed with low output voltage drop and voltage ripple as well as fast respond time. <br/><br/>This thesis concentrates on the investigation of the electrical performances of the Half-wave series Cockcroft-Walton(HWCW) voltage multiplier circuit.

Significant parameters of the multiplier circuit that play a role in determining the electrical performances are investigated. Analysis of impact of the parasitic components on the electrical performances are carried out together with simulations.

This phenomenon can be found both in natural and artificial systems, especially in threshold-based systems such as comparators or a population of neurons. As noise always exists and interacts with the system, it is advantageous to design a system that purposefully uses SR to boost its performance. One possible use of SR is in the signal reconstruction. In this application, noise is added to the input signal and is processed by a comparator to produce a 1-bit output signal. This output can be averaged to recover the amplified input signal. In this thesis, three challenges regarding the use of SR in signal reconstruction are addressed. Firstly, to use SR not only to reconstruct the original signal, but also to implement mathematical operators, specifically a multiplier and an adder, that take two or more input signals. Secondly, to define the relevant metric(s) that can be used to measure the performance of the operators. Lastly, to build a system out of the proposed SR-based operators. The SR-based mathematical operators are implemented on the system level with a comparator as its fundamental building block. To analyze the behavior of the operators, formulas for noise and distortion power are derived. MATLAB simulation is then used to verify the theoretical analysis. Finally, these SR-based mathematical operators are used to build a Teager Energy Operator (TEO) for action potentials (APs) detection. An SR-based multiplier and adder can be implemented with the use of an XNOR logic gate and a binary half adder, respectively. The theoretical formulas are successful in predicting the noise and distortion behavior of the operators. In conclusion, it is possible to implement mathematical operators, specifically multipliers and adders, which use noise to boost their performance. The noise and distortion behavior of these operators can be predicted mathematically. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) are used to measure the performance of the operators. Systems, specifically a TEO, can be built using the SR-based operators.","stochastic resonance (SR); multiplier; adder; Teager Energy Operator (TEO); 1-bit processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Glass products have been widely used in facade applications and recently their use has expanded to the load-bearing structure due their large in-plane compressive strength. However, the fragile nature of glass requires special treatment and attention to detail to avoid fracture caused by tensile stresses. Connections between glass components are very critical to the structural integrity of the system. Bolted connections, which are often used to transfer forces between glass elements, require drilling the glass. This process may cause additional flaws and stress intensifications around the holes and thus reduces the bearing capacity of glass elements. Adhesive connections offer an alternative approach for the connecting joints and enable a more uniform distribution of stresses. Laminated connections have recently been developed that combine high strength and transparency. This work focuses on the Transparent Structural Silicone Adhesive (TSSA), produced by Dow Corning, that is used for the realization of laminated connections. TSSA connections have been used in several projects worldwide; however, the hyperelastic and viscoelastic nature of the material has not been fully investigated. In this work, the mechanical response of TSSA laminated connections under static and cyclic loading is investigated by means of experimental, analytical and numerical studies.<br/><br/>Firstly, the shear behaviour of TSSA laminated circular connections is characterized by means of monotonic and cyclic loading tests at different frequencies. The hysteretic behaviour of the material under loading cycles, which is caused due to its viscoelastic nature, is analyzed. The adhesive exhibits significant stress-softening under repeated cycles that becomes more severe as the maximum load increases. Energy dissipation analysis is conducted to understand the nature of this phenomenon with the aim to simplify the cyclic behaviour of the adhesive for modeling purposes. <br/><br/>Secondly, TSSA laminated circular connections are subjected to monotonic and cyclic tensile loading of increasing maximum load. The development of the whitening phenomenon is studied for both cases. The stress level when whitening appears for the first time and the way it propagates to the adhesive surface show some consistency both for the cases of static and cyclic loading. The occurrence of the stress-softening phenomenon is also recorded, in order to observe whether it appears within the working limit of the connection.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the deformation behaviour of the adhesive is described analytically based on hyperelastic prediction models. Conventional test set-ups, such as uniaxial and biaxial tension tests, are combined with the simple shear test results obtained within the framework of this thesis, for the material characterization of TSSA. The hyperelastic material parameters are calibrated by a simultaneous multi-experiment-data-fit based on the nonlinear least squares optimization method. The softening behaviour observed in shear tests is modeled based on a simplified pseudo-elastic damage model, which is supported by most finite element software. A first attempt is also made to model the actual softening response of the adhesive. A less conservative approach proposed by Guo, also based on the theory of pseudo-elasticity, proved to give a good approximation of the actual cyclic response of the adhesive. <br/><br/>Finally, TSSA laminated connections on the edge of the glass are experimentally and numerically investigated. The edge bonded specimens are tested in shear and the stress distribution of the adhesive is analyzed by means of a three-dimensional finite element model. The distribution of stresses in the adhesive is non-linear showing significant stress peaks towards the free edges of the adhesive. A parametric study is conducted to relate the magnitude of the stress peaks with the eccentricity of the applied load.","Glass; Laminated connections; TSSA; Dow Corning; Adhesive; Edge connections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Currently, they are considered as one of the greatest challenges worldwide. The widespread use of fossil fuels causes the increase of the harmful emissions which are associated with significant health and environmental issues. Ports are no exception to this problem as they are considered as major contributors. Although there are some measures available, the high majority of them focus only on technologies that can reduce the vessel emissions. The focus of this research study is on the development of a decision making tool for technologies that can be used for the reduction of the emission footprint of the ports’ shore-operations. The decision making for such technologies is not an easy process. The large number of stakeholders, the environmental concerns as well as the fast changing business environment create a complicated decision making scheme. This scheme represents specific practical and theoretical issues which need to be addressed. A list of known theories that solve these issues and a list of methods and tools that deal with values and data were used for the development. <br/> The developed decision making tool describes a ten step approach that provides specific guidelines and sub-tools for the assessment of the port’s situation and the technologies until the final technology selection. Considering the diverse character of ports, their fast changing business environment as well as the innovations concerning the low emission technologies, this tool has no static data-input. It reacts with the business environment and provides with the best technology choice related to the values of the stakeholders at a specific moment of time.<br/> The developed tool was applied as an illustration study to the port of Piraeus for the following vision: ““Implementation of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation that can reduce the emission footprint of the Piraeus’ shore-operations”. The decision making tool can be used by port authorities either as the main decision tool or as supplementary tool that provides port authorities with an indication. The tool can be applied to all types of ports without restrictions such as the size or the economic activity. Its main characteristic is that it quantifies the decision making process by creating a “common language” for understanding the current situation in terms of decision criteria importance and technology opportunities. The application of the tool proved that it is particularly efficient for gradually identifying the values and their importance as decision criteria. The idea of dynamic input of data provides the flexibility to possible changes which consists an important aspect for making responsible decisions. <br","Low Emission Port; Decision Making Tool; Sustainable technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-20","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Electric vehicles (EVs) even though viewed as emission free and environmental friendly can still contribute towards indirect emissions if charged by using traditional fossil fuels. The integration of renewable energy sources is hence paramount to approach a completely carbon free future of E-mobility integration in the transportation sector. This thesis project aims at designing and implementing a photovoltaic (PV) based charging station for a fleet of ten EVs in the TU Delft campus. The complete solar powered charging station for EVs is hence called as E-Hub, which aims to facilitate the development of e-mobility in the TU Delft campus by providing charging facilities that can be scaled up along with a competitive business model. At first, the driving pattern of EV owners in the Netherlands is analysed to categorize employees and visitors. The driving pattern is used to estimate the load profile and the yearly charging demand for the EV fleet in the TU Delft campus. Calendar effects such as holidays and vacations are taken into account to accurately predict the charging demand. A thorough PV system design is carried out to meet the estimated charging demand, followed by a practical and economic feasibility study. The components required for the E-hub are listed along with an estimation of the initial investment. Later an optimisation model is used to develop power management algorithms for optimum economical performance based on the designed technical framework. Nine charging strategies are considered for both summer and winter conditions. The performance of each strategy is analysed under the estimated load profile and designed PV system. The model is also extended to explore the integration of battery systems and its effect on the technical and economical performance of the E-Hub. This battery system can hence function as a virtual power plant to supply power back to the grid in times of peak load and facilitate in stabilization of the grid. A proof of concept is then built to test the developed power management algorithms in the Electrical Sustainable Power Lab (EWI, TU Delft). The Eneco SolarEdge and Tesla Powerwall (ESTP) set-up is used to study the power flow and a system is designed to dynamically control and monitor the ESTP set-up. It was concluded that such a system is technically and economically feasible and can be implemented in the university to provide an environmentally friendly charging infrastructure to electrical vehicles.","solar energy; EV; Electric Vehicle; Charging Infrastructure; Tesla Powerwall; Renewable Energy; Photovoltaic Systems; Experimental study; System design; Smart charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","E-Hub","51.996,4.377"

Various organisationshave laid down debris-mitigation guidelines that will be enforced by law forfuture launchers. One of the guidelines entails proving that the generateddebris will re-enter in less than 25 years with a 90% probability. Naturalperturbations can be exploited to meet this requirement without the use ofextra propellant or complex de-orbiting systems, which is especially attractivefrom an economic point of view. Objects in GTO can undergo a resonancetriggered by an interplay between perturbations caused by the Sun’s gravity andthe irregularities in Earth’s gravity field, leading to a sudden re-entryor making the object stay in orbit for decades. This effect is very sensitiveto initial conditions because it depends on the relative positions of theperigee and the Sun when the semi-major axis is close to 15000 km.By simulating the orbital evolution of a representative GTO object—ballistic coefficient of 0.011 m²/kg, initial orbital inclination of 10degrees and initial perigee altitude of 200 km— for several initialepochs, it was found that favourable launch conditions take place twice perday during most part of the year, while for epochs close to the equinoxesof March and September they only happen once per day or not at all. Giventhe high sensitivity to initial conditions, the problem was studied from astatistical perspective, taking into account the uncertainties in thevalues of the relevant parameters. Semi-analytical techniques were used topropagate the mean equinoctial elements instead of the osculatingCartesian elements, which reduced computation times by a factor of 45 whilestill keeping proper levels of accuracy.

It was found that the launchtime leading to the highest probability of compliance with debris-mitigationguidelines for GEO launches from the European spaceport in Kourou isslightly later, regardless of the day of the year, although the value of theoptimal lifetime does vary slightly throughout the year. Thus, achange in procedures would be required in order to reach a higher degreeof compliance with debris-mitigation guidelines, which was below 10% for GTOlaunches carried out with Ariane 5 from in the period 2004-2012.","GTO; debris; mitigation; semi-analytical propagation; Orbit modeling; perturbations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-25","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As part of an effort to answer this question, a stall model of a Cessna Citation II aircraft is developed from specifically-gathered flight test data. The model is based on Kirchoff’s theory of flow separation. During identification, the nonlinear and linear parameters of the model are estimated in separate steps. This distinction enables the application of a semi-objective model structure selection method using multivariate orthogonal functions. It is shown that stall-related effects should be included in the model equations for lift, drag, and pitch moment. The model parameters are accurately estimated, and model output is validated around a flight condition of 5,500 m altitude.

The urgency to make ships more eco-friendly captures the interest of shipowners and naval architects. Hull designs of a ship, with regard to minimum fuel consumption have been optimized in the last decades and it has been proven difficult to improve current hull forms. Another strategy is to reduce fuel consumption by using external wind power combined with engine power, so called 'wind-assisted propulsion' or 'motor-sailing'. The potential of an extraordinary high lifting device of a mechanical sail using aspiration power, known as a 'Turbosail' introduced by Jacques Cousteau [1], has been selected as wind propulsion for an existing cargo ship. This foil can generate about 3 times higher lift compared to conventional foils, which do not use active suction of the boundary layer. Similar to the concept of a velocity prediction program for sailing yachts, a fuel prediction program (FPP) is set up to visualize the fuel savings for all wind directions relative to the vessel. For a wind force 7 Beaufort, the fuel savings for optimal wind angle can reach up to 40%, which are enormous. <br/> <br/> The working mechanism of the Turbosail is further explored and examined with CFD using ReFRESCO [38], to see if the performance of the Turbosail is as high as reported by Cousteau. Steady and unsteady RANS simulations are conducted for infinite span Turbosail using the k-ω SST turbulence model of Menter [32]. As a verification study, an expansion of two other turbulence models are included, which are the  k-ω SST-LCTM model of Langtry et al [30] and the EARSM model for a more anisotropic flow accounting for Reynolds stresses. The difference between all turbulence models appeared to be small, and a fair agreement is found with the lift and drag coefficients found by experiments of Cousteau. <br/> <br/> A steady RANS simulation has been conducted at model scale for a finite Turbosail to calculate the lift, drag and aspiration power. The distribution of air suction along the span of the foil is visualized, which gives insight for the real experiments. During this study, a Turbosail at model scale 1:2 is built with a span height of 5.5 metres and a chord length of 1 metre. The comparison with CFD is therefore very useful for validation. As a final step, the lift and drag coefficients found from the numerical result are implemented in the FPP. The fuel savings from the FPP are analysed by placing four full scale Turbosails on an existing cargo ship. In this model, there has been accounted for aspiration power needed for the boundary layer suction.

In addition, considering the fast-paced growth in size and power generating capacity of offshore wind turbines, the designs of floating foundations need to be continuously improved. Therefore, proper testing (at model-scale) is necessary. <br/><br/>To achieve this, several factors need to be taken into account. For instance, down-scaling for testing of floating structures brings challenges due to the so-called Reynolds effects, which degrade the aerodynamic response of the mounted turbine. Likewise, the rotation of the blades and the motions of the platform as a result of its interaction with waves, have an impact on the wind inflow acting upon the rotor. Thereby, modifying its instantaneous performance. <br/><br/>This Master thesis, carried out in cooperation with MARIN (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands), focuses on developing a reliable methodology that renders in the design of a scaled-down thrust-matched 10MW wind turbine rotor blade, for its further implementation in the testing of a floating offshore support structure. <br/><br/>For this purpose, the aforementioned effects are investigated, and a suitable set of design tools is selected and coupled, in order to realise an optimised blade geometry. For predicting the wind turbine behaviour, this implementation relies on the Blade Element Momentum Theory. Furthermore, the resulting blade's aerodynamic performance is validated using ReFRESCO (MARIN’s in-house CFD code), against the non-dimensional parameters of the DTU 10MW reference wind turbine.","Floating Wind Turbines; Wind Turbine Performance; Blade Element Momentum; ReFRESCO; Model-scale; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The abdominal aorta is the most common location for an aneurysm to form and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) can turn lethal in the event of rupture. Since the current clinical practice to classify AAAs is on the basis of their size (diameter), it was decided to investigate the impact of varying geometric parameters viz., the expansion ratio (ER) and the expansion angle (EA), on the pulsatile flow field in a hypothetical axisymmetric AAA (4A) geometry and in particular, investigate the role turbulence. All the combinations of ER and EA lead to a total of 8 cases. The simulations show that a vortex ring is shed just after peak systole in every case. The vortex ring, at inception, is similar for all cases within visual limits. As the ring travels downstream, an azimuthal instability sets in that grows with time. This is the short wave or the elliptical instability usually associated with a vortex pair perturbed by an infinitesimally small amplitude sinusoidal wave. The number of waves formed along the circumference of the ring as a result of the instability varies from case to case but in general, the number of waves decreases as the ER increases. The growth of this instability, along with interaction of the ring with the remnants of the flow field form the previous cardiac cycle, cause it to break down into smaller vortices thereby generating turbulent fluctuations. Further, subtle differences between various cases regarding the vortex ring breakdown mechanism are observed and discussed. Investigations are also carried out to identify recirculating or dead flow regions as in the context of an AAA, such a region indicates the presence an intraluminal thrombus (ILT) which is a commonly found feature in AAAs. An ILT deprives the surrounding arterial tissue of oxygen thereby weakening the aortic wall and increasing the risk of rupture. From the simulations, it could be seen that the inflection regions of the 4A geometry are most prone to the formation of an ILT which is in agreement with the physically observed locations. Finally, the oscillatory shear index (OSI) is investigated to see the influence of turbulence on a hemodynamic parameter. It was found that for the geometries tested, there is no clear co-relation between the two. From this thesis, numerous conclusions can be drawn. But perhaps the most important conclusion is that the flow field in an AAA is very complex and sensitive to various input parameters such as the ER and EA. Although flow parameters such as the Reynolds and the Womersley number are kept constant across all the cases, existing literature clearly highlights the dependence of the flow field on them. As such, the desire to be able to formulate general co-relation trends between various flow field quantities in AAAs is wishful thinking at best.","CFD; Turbulence; Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Oscillatory Shear Indes; blood flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As many developing nations, especially the ones located in rural areas, face many difficulties to access the grid, alternative stand-alone solutions such as Solar Home Systems (SHS) have been proposed and used already for a while. The main technical limitation plaguing SHSs is the necessity of including a storage device that mitigates the energy difference between production and demand. Batteries are the components that experience the shortest lifetime and highest cost in stand-alone PV systems such as SHSs.<br/><br/>This study aims to explore and find the most suitable and viable storage option in terms of lifetime and costs for certain load cases concerning SHS applications. In order for this to be achieved, single battery options, as well as Hybrid battery options, were examined.<br/><br/>For the comparison of the different battery technologies with the different Hybrid battery configurations, lifetime and costs had to be taken into account. For this purpose a non-empirical dynamic battery lifetime estimation method was modelled and applied to four different battery technologies and a variety of different Hybrid battery combinations. The battery technologies examined in this thesis are Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), Sealed lead-acid (VRLA), Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) and Flooded lead-acid. This method takes into account different DOD (Depth of Discharge) levels, Temperature effects and lifetime curves extracted from different datasheets for the different technologies, in order to be able to model the different battery behaviours as accurately as possible.<br/><br/>For the modelling of the different Hybrid battery configurations two different power management schemes were constructed and applied to the dynamic lifetime estimation that is proposed. This method was validated and concluded to be realistic as it was able to capture the different battery characteristics for the different technologies.<br/><br/>For the comparison of the different storage options, a singular function was constructed for both single and hybrid battery options. This function quantifies both upfront and lifetime battery costs while, at the same time, captures the future battery cost trends that are foreseen for different technologies. This function was used as the point of reference in the comparison of every storage option that was tested.<br/><br/>The optimum storage option that minimizes the battery cost function for the two sets of PV-load Case studies used in this project, was found to be a Hybrid battery that consists of LiFePO4 and Sealed lead-acid technology, with different sizes and configurations. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the lifetime method proposed as well as the battery cost function constructed could be easily adopted and used for a variety of different battery technologies in low-power applications. A prerequisite for the above mentioned realization is that cycle life data of the examined technology are either provided or easy to be constructed.<br","Hybrid Battery; Solar Home Systems; Energy storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-24","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The diffraction limit prevents the resolution to up to a few meters for these missions and are confined to Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO). At these altitudes, strong disturbances act on the system, limiting its lifetime and the pointing capabilities of CubeSats. As a solution, the Department of Space Engineering at the Delft University of Technology<br/>has proposed a 6 unit CubeSat named the Stable and Highly Accurate Pointing Earth-imager (SHAPE) orbiting at a Sun synchronous VLEO which uses a momentum wheel to passively stabilize the system against the external environment within a competitive cost of less than 500 000e. By utilizing the dual-spin stabilization concept, composed of a stable platform and a spinning rotor, it is expected to perform pointing missions of less than 1 degree.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the SHAPE concept has been revisited and further developed based on the work of Kuiper and Dolkens to conduct whether these types of missions are feasible within the aspect of the Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS). This thesis covers the base of this subsystem approached from a top-down methodology; designed from the final nominal mission mode to the detumbling mode on a system level.<br/><br/>The ADCS design will consist of a momentum wheel which has been determined to have an angular momentum of 1 Nms. This value is based on a prediction of the worst-case atmospheric density of the next solar cycle. The design<br/>point, at which the momentum wheel has been sized, has been taken at 90% of SHAPE’s lifetime after several design iterations. Hereby, the last 10% of the mission has been partially forfeited with degraded performances due to the<br/>exponential increase in disturbances acting on the spacecraft at lower altitudes. As therefore, the mass and size of the momentum wheel has been reduced with 41% and 20%, respectively. To re-align the angular momentum vector within<br/>the 1 degree pointing requirement, a set of magnetorquers with a dipole moment of 0.5 Am2 has been chosen due to their low power consumption, mass, cost, and high reliability while capable of producing sufficient torque. Also, a<br/>damper is to be integrated as it provides the system asymptotic reduction of the transverse momenta, thus increasing the image quality without expenditure of additional power.<br/><br/>To reach the nominal mission observation state, several momentum wheel spinup strategies have been investigated. Based on a trade-off between three spinup concepts, it was concluded that the major axis spinup is most suited. This<br/>type is initiated after the spacecraft as a whole has attained an angular momentum equivalent to that of the desired end value of the momentum wheel. Then, a constant rotor torque is applied, providing a momentum transfer from the platform to the rotor. The disadvantage of this spinup procedure is that the system’s solar panels are aligned parallel to the orbital plane, meaning that power cannot be generated and batteries are required during the spinup. Despite this, it was found that after completing the spinup, the transverse angular momenta was minimized to marginal values in contrast to the other spins. The inclusion of the passive damper during the major axis spin further improves the ability of reducing the transverse momentum as the damper’s dissipative energy property adds an asymptotic attraction at the point of lowest energy, located at the spin axis near the end of the spinup.<br/><br/>The all-spun state is achieved using a set of thrusters. This choice was taken as the magnetorquers was found not to deliver sufficient torque. From the detumbling analysis, it was concluded that the magnetorquers are able to reduce<br/>the tumbling rates with magnitudes of up to 35 deg/s to mean motion values in less than an orbit using a static gain B-dot controller.<br/><br/>Imperfections in the momentum wheel can cause static and dynamic imbalance, imparting internal disturbances to the system which affects the image quality detrimentally. Therefore, isolators are to be integrated within the momentum<br/>wheel suspension subsystem. If these disturbances can be negated using isolators, it can be expected that the pointing error will stay within one degree and attitude stability can be achieved at least until the design altitude of 280 km.<br/>However, the analysis and design of the isolators have yet to be done and thus the attainability of the pointing and image quality requirements are still inconclusive.","Spinup; SHAPE; rotational dynamics; gyrostat; momentum wheel; ADCS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The goal of the report of team 5 is to validate and optimise the design of the pilot house that was created based on the work of previous teams, and the development on implementation plans for a validated and optimised house. Literature study, field work and interviews have been performed resulting in main findings of this report.<br/>Primarily, the used materials were analysed in the report, including bamboo, CSEB bricks and concrete. They were analysed consulting literature, conducting laboratory tests in cooperation with the University of Tribhuvan. Bamboo was mainly analysed consulting literature sources, since laboratory tests were not feasible. It was found that its material properties are immensely difficult to determine and can vary from one column to another. However, it remains a strong and cheap building material. CSEB bricks were used due to its availability, strength and price. The material properties were derived from tests done by Build Up Nepal and from literature sources. Its mechanical performance is like that of concrete. It’s an easy material to build with and incorporate steel rebar’s. However, its durability and consistency is something which was not thoroughly investigated and remains debatable. The concrete used, was thoroughly tested, conducting slump cone, compression and Schmidt Hammer tests. It was found that the concrete used in the pilot house is of acceptable quality, but there is room for improvement by following clear guidelines and technical assistance. Subsequently, static calculations were executed, regarding the roof, the load bearing structure and the foundation. It was found that these different components, perform safely under static conditions, with the applied loads, separately and combined. The load bearing structure has turned out to be a wall-bearing structure. This was not assumed at first. Furthermore, after calculations, it was found that the roof and foundation were largely over dimensioned. This is, however, determined considering many assumptions, such as the soil properties.<br/>Regarding an earthquake situation, the walls and bearing capacity were researched and calculated following quasi-static conditions. The earthquake conditions were derived from the Peak Ground Acceleration. Primarily the walls were researched. Two scenarios were considered, a 3-point collapse failure mechanism and punctual overturning collapse failure mechanism. Both mechanisms were tested for different wall compartments. These calculations give a small insight in the actual situation, because dynamic loads are applied statically, non-linear or dynamic calculations should be conducted as well as FEM modelling, for more thorough understanding. It must be said that the rebar and resonance effects were not considered. Regarding the bearing capacity, a PGA of 0.6 was used and from calculations, partly considering the soil and superstructure inertial effects, the bearing capacity would not fail. However, superstructure resonance was not considered. Larger PGA’s were not investigated, which means that it is not determined under which conditions failure would occur. From these analyses the Structural optimisations are made to the design. This includes improving the joints between different elements of the house. Regarding the materials used the optimisations include 5 protecting the CSEB bricks from weather as they are load-bearing. Guidelines are given on the placement of the house regarding the foundation and the slope. According to the calculations the foundation is over- dimensioned.<br/>For the stakeholder analysis, extensive research was done through interviews which was combined with literary information available. This was then used to create a power interest grid and a network analysis, which shows the links between different categories of stakeholders and different specific stakeholders. This analysis also gave insight in the sheer number of stakeholders involved in rebuilding Nepal and the importance of defining the role of SSN further. The external factors that are important in working in Nepal were analysed, this was done regarding social, technical, economic, environmental, political, legal and ethical aspects and based on literature research, field research and interviews. Implementation methods of different types of organisations in Nepal were analysed. These findings were concluded in a SWOT analysis of the organisations. Defining the strengths, weaknesses, Opportunities and threats of other organisation help to define the direction that SSN should move in and those aspects of building in Nepal that can also be defined as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to SSN or make SSN different to other organisations. The risks of building in Nepal must be considered to create a realistic and feasible long-term plan and need to be mitigated a risk analysis is done. The findings in the risk assessment are found in external risks, design risks and construction risks. A plan is then set up to mitigate external risks and construction risks are the. The findings of the long-term plan are organised into a strategy for SSN, an engagement plan and an implementation pathway. The strategy is concluded in a SWOT analysis which is then used to create a TOWS analysis. This TOWS analysis combined the internal and external strengths and weaknesses to bring new creative ways of maximising strengths and opportunities and minimising the weaknesses and threats. The Implementation pathway contains long- term goals for SSN, that are structured into regulatory, implementation, technical and organisational goals and that can be added onto by future teams.<br/>This research is to be a logical step in a series of research projects which will contribute to the reconstruction of an earthquake safe environment in Nepal. It can be used as consultation advice, guideline or as a base for in-depth follow up research on one of the included topics.","Earthquake; Resistant; Housing; Ratankot; Nepal; Rural Area","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Shock Safe Nepal","27.700769, 85.300140"

Demand response offers a set of solutions allowing consumers to achieve normalised load profiles and increase the balance between energy generation and consumption. Storage technologies and renewable energy sources integrated in microgrid topologies allow them to participate in demand response programs while maintaining their consumption behaviour and achieving energy cost reduction. The aforementioned integration requires the development of control capabilities and communication with the energy market. Consequently, this project aims at investigating the possibility of energy cost reduction and reliability of power supply through the development of a microgrid which incorporates a control design and a management strategy.<br/>The project proposes a microgrid control strategy suitable for both power quality and energy management applications. This control strategy is implemented through a controller regulating the operation of the battery storage system. More specifically, regarding the power quality side of the controller, the system is able to identify and overcome any possible operational grid faults securing the provision of continuous power supply and voltage stability under any conditions. Concerning the energy management capabilities of the microgrid, the controller’s main goal is to achieve energy cost savings and to extend the lifetime of the battery storage system, through its communication with the spot energy market and by taking advantage of the hourly volatility of the electricity prices while considering the ageing factor of the battery storage system. The battery storage system operates only when the electricity prices can compensate for the energy cycling costs, thus prolonging its life span. Whether the batteries are charging or discharging is decided by the level of the hourly electricity prices. This way the potential economic benefits are maximised. <br/>This microgrid development was based on the case study of a technical building for the telecommunications company KPN. The company’s goal is to reduce its electricity bill while maintaining its load profile, integrating renewable technologies and active storage systems. For this reason, the development and modelling of a microgrid with the control attributes described in the previous paragraph and integrated PV and storage system is required. <br/>The developed microgrid and the implemented control strategy were modelled in Matlab/Simulink. From the simulation results, it was observed that the controller responds appropriately to electricity prices levels, it respects the battery’s capacity limitations and it acknowledges the PV and storage system’s priority over the grid. Furthermore, it was able to achieve high levels of power quality for the microgrid and energy cost reduction for KPN under certain technological and market conditions. Regarding the latter, it was observed that the main influencing factors for the proposed system’s economic performance are the investment costs for the PV and storage systems.","DC Microgrid; Storage System; Electricity Prices; Demand Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

They rely on the generation of runoff through the propagation of a pressure wave and do not accountfor the actual advective movement of particles. Over the last years different model frameworks have beendeveloped to account for this shortcoming. The difference between the frameworks lies in whether they arebased on mixing coefficients or storage age selection functions. Both methods have shown their ability tocapture the stream chemistry response. It is however not clear how these distinct approaches compare toeach other and to reality.To provide more clarification in this matter, this research applied both frameworks separately to model thehydrological and stream water chemistry response for a specific catchment. The results are analysed usingthe concept of transit times, where information on the fluxes and states in all model components is used togenerate distributions that describe the age structure of water. By comparing the distributions generated byboth methods and by evaluating the overall model performances, more insight is gained on the two frame-works and on their ability to capture subsurface mixing dynamics.From the results of this research it is concluded that both frameworks show similar performance. They arehowever conceptually different, which might have implications for their ability to capture specific dynamics.These implications depend on the characteristics of the catchment of interest. It is still concluded howeverthat performance for each frameworks is likely to be similar. Because the model description of the MixingCoefficient framework is less complex, it is recommended to continue research with this framework.","mixing; subsurface; hydrology; passive storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the large temperature differences between the injection fluid and ambient groundwater, buoyancy flow occurs, which causes heat losses which in turn results in poor efficiency of such systems. The heat losses can be reduced by applying density difference compensation, this entails injection water with a higher salinity, to compensate for the low density caused by the high temperature of the injection fluid.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to get insight into the behaviour of a possible HT-ATES system on the campus of the TU Delft with the injection of saline groundwater from deeper layers for storage in both less deep and less saline aquifers. To achieve this different cases will be considered; a reference case, a theoretical optimum, density difference compensation of the TU Delft case and the optimum density difference compensation. For these cases, different scenarios are modelled in SEAWAT to identify the influence of injection temperature, injection volume, aquifer thickness, and hydraulic conductivity on the behaviour of the system. <br/><br/>Using the density difference compensation from the aquifer at TU Delft, with a salinity of 16.4 kg/m$^3$, a maximum improvement of 2.0\% can be achieved. Also, differences between the different scenarios for the TU Delft case were maximum 2.5\%, with exception for a thicker aquifer or smaller injection volume. Due to the large injection volume in thin aquifers, the hot water has a large volume, causing conduction losses to dominate in the system. For thick aquifers a lot of density driven flow occurs in the reference case. With optimum density difference compensation, having a salinity of 39.1 kg/m$^3$, the density driven flow can be significantly decreased and the efficiency increased with 21.5\%. Both aquifer thickness and salinity of the injection fluid have a negative correlation with salt recovery. <br/><br/>Thin aquifers in relation to injection volume are not sensitive to density driven flow, so density difference compensation is not useful for such HT-ATES systems. Density difference compensation in the case of the TU does give significant improvement in efficiency. The most influential parameter on the efficiency is aquifer thickness, for both the cold and warm well, in relation to injection volume. For thick aquifers with optimum density difference compensation the highest efficiency of 75.5\% is achieved after 10 cycles.","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES); Density difference compensation; Groundwater density; HT-ATES; Salinity deeper aquifer","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

While a lot of research has been performed to optimize the design of the upper-body of the vehicle, the flow over a rotating wheel that is enclosed by a wheelhouse is not understood to the same level. Estimates show that the addition of wheel and wheelhouse to a vehicle body, can increase its drag and lift coefficient by as much as 40 \%. With the major automobile manufacturers striving to improve the fuel economy of the vehicle, understanding the flow over a rotating wheel in a wheelhouse, offers a new dimension for the improvement of the drag coefficient of the vehicle. In the present research, the flow over a simplified car body with a wheel and a wheelhouse was studied using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). When performing an LES on a given numerical grid, it can be expected that the contributions from the subgrid viscosity model reduces on decreasing the Reynolds number of the flow. A study focusing on the dependence of the flow field on the Reynolds number was thus performed. Three Reynolds numbers based on the wheel diameter - 9 x $10^3$, 75 x $10^3$, 150 x $10^3$- were chosen for the dependence study. A comparison of the relative pressure distribution and the flow topology between the different Reynolds numbers showed that the flow over a rotating wheel in a wheelhouse was qualitatively independent of the Reynolds numbers considered in this work. Experimental results from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), performed on a similar vehicle model, were used to validate the numerical solution at a Reynolds number of 9 x $10^3$. The behaviour of the flow in the wheelhouse region was investigated and a new description of the flow field inside a wheelhouse, consisting of 11 vortex structures, was presented in this work. To determine the qualitative dependence between the flow field and the drag coefficient, a comparison of the flow between two geometric configurations, with different wheelhouse radius, was performed at a Reynolds number of 9 x $10^3$. It was found that the configuration with the larger wheelhouse radius had a higher wheelhouse drag coefficient and a lower wheel drag coefficient when compared to the configuration with lower wheelhouse radius. Based on a detailed flow field, four out of the eleven vortices were found to be crucial in determining differences in the drag coefficient of the wheel and wheelhouse. Based on this analysis, an alternate wheelhouse geometry, combining the advantages of the two geometric configurations considered in this work, was proposed, that could potentially lead to a reduction in the drag coefficient of the vehicle.","CFD; LES; Aerodynamics; Wheel; Wheelhouse; Automobile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extensive research has been done in the past on scour holes close to hydraulic structures in a homogeneous subsoil, however, a large amount of scour holes are not related to hydraulic structures. Additionally, in deltas, the subsoil mostly consists of alternating layers of soil with different erosive capacities. This experimental study focused on a simplified situation of scour holes in heterogeneous subsoil with a three-dimensional character. The bed of the flume consisted of a concrete layer with a hole in the centre in which sand was exposed to the flow. Water depth, flow velocity and the size of the geometry were systematically varied to investigate their influence on scour hole development. Additionally, general observations were performed on the flow structures and scour development in and around the scour hole. It was observed that the scour development is different compared to the results of earlier investigations as a result of the non-erodible top layer. The process of undermining is a limiting factor for sediment transport out of the scour hole. The water depth showed a significantly smaller influence on the scour depth compared to existing empirical formulas. Additionally, the size of the geometry seems to be the most important varied parameter in this study. Relative to the size of the geometry, the scour depth remained approximately equal with different experimental conditions. Compared to two-dimensional experiments, the scour holes became deeper, which suggests importance of three-dimensional flow for scour hole development.<br","scour; holes; heterogeneous; subsoil; experimental; study; poorly; erodible; top; layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In this context, SolteQ Energy has developed the FreshWaterMill system (FWM) which can provide an isolated community with both electricity and fresh water. It involves a wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission system for water desalination via the process of reverse osmosis (RO) in addition to a generator which is placed in parallel to the RO plant. The generator is seconded by a PV system and a battery bank for electricity production. The main constraints for the implementation of renewable energy systems are the high initial cost, a problem especially faced by developing countries. However, in contrast to developed countries, their system reliability requirements for power system design are less strict which allows for more freedom in finding an optimal compromise between system cost and reliability. This trade-off approach has the potential to substantially lower the overall cost as stand-alone renewable energy systems tend to be oversized due to the fluctuating and unpredictable nature of solar and wind and the lack of controllable energy sources.<br/>This thesis aims at optimally sizing the bespoke FWM system for specific locations by searching for a best compromise point between the conflicting objectives, cost and system reliability. For this purpose, a model of the FWM system and a suitable operation strategy has been developed and the triple-objective optimisation problem was defined which simultaneously minimises the net present cost (NPC) as well as the loss of power and water supply probability. The optimal sizing procedure is performed by means of the Pareto-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) solver ‘gamultiobj’ part of the Matlab Optimisation Toolbox. The Pareto-based multi-objective method provides the system designers with numerous FWM system configurations along with the optimal size of each component allowing them to find one or more appropriate solutions from a set of alternatives based on specific requirements of the location. GA has been chosen because compared to classical optimisation techniques it is highly applicable to complex and multi-modal problems with a large search space and is able to tackle these with little computational effort. The simulations of the FWM system are run for an entire year and require the input of hourly solar radiation, wind speed, ambient temperature, electricity and fresh water demand of the location under study as well as technical and economic specifications for each component. The simulation and optimisation procedure has been applied to a real case study of a remote Colombian island in the Caribbean Sea with a yearly average wind speed of 7 m/s.","renewable energy; optimal sizing; triple-objective optimisation; genetic algorithm; reliability analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Physical activity is used by the Dutch government as a policy tool to create a healthy society. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport stimulate people to adopt active life styles in order to combat the prosperity diseases: overweight, diabetes and depression. In benchmarking municipal sport policy there are the following complexities. Firstly complexities related to the governance of municipal sport policy, there are many actors involved with contradictory interests. In addition municipal sport policy is focussed within municipal boundaries and evolves on previously pursued policies. Secondly complexities related to benchmarking. Benchmarking is from origin a method developed for the industrial industry and now is also applied in the public sector, but the applicability of the method is contested. Moreover benchmarking is not straightforward and is dependent on its design, data reliability and the way of processing data. <br/><br/>An essential actor in sport policy are the municipalities: they conduct sport policy in order to heave healthy citizens and focus their policy to a large extent on sport facilities. Currently municipalities lack insight in whether the output of the sport policy (namely the quantity, type, and location of sport facilities) leads to the desired effects (namely healthy citizens), which we define as a lack of insight in the effectiveness of the sport policy. This insight is crucial for municipalities, since it can be used in the policy evaluation to assess the performance of their policy.<br/><br/>A method that has been proven useful for measuring and comparing of performance is benchmarking. Benchmarking is the research in which the output between organisations can be compared. However, there is a lack of literature describing how sport policy by municipalities can be compared, whereas comparison with other municipalities can provide additional insights and stimulate learning. In this study a benchmarking method for municipal sport policy aspects is developed and conducted.<br/><br/>The benchmarking method is designed based on a benchmarking literature review. Based on the review it was established that the design of the benchmarking method consists of phases, process steps and criteria. Subsequently with the literature review a benchmarking model is designed consisting of phases, steps, and criteria directed at assessing the performance of municipal sport policy. In the benchmarking criteria common elements are: the usage of indicators, transparency in performance measurement method and self-assessment of performance. In the benchmarking models common process steps are: set objectives, define indicators, select benchmark groups, collecting data, preparing data, analyzing data, determining significant different findings and reporting findings. <br/><br/>With the designed benchmarking model the benchmark is conducted, resulting in the following findings. The benchmarking results found no significant correlation between the dimensions, the output and the outcome of municipal sport policy. This study found that for benchmarking both the benchmarking design as the benchmarking process are crucial. Currently literature focuses on the design of the benchmarking method. This study found that the benchmarking process confronts challenges mainly related to data analytics.","Benchmarking; Municipal policy; Sport facilities; Performance measurement; Open data; Public data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasingly stringent emission regulation in maritime field and the limitation of marine diesel engine systems, the shipbuilders may start to seek cleaner solutions rather than modifying the currently prevailing internal combustion engine systems (ICE). According to previous researches, a tandem fuel cell system power plant, which uses LNG as fuel, has a very good overall emission performance in comparison to marine LNG based ICE systems, and can achieve an overall efficiency of more than 60%. To study whether the tandem fuel cell system can be an alternative for marine LNG engine systems, two models are built in this master thesis to study the performance of the system under stationary operation and transients. The first model is built to study the stationary performance of the system, and to verify the result of high efficiency from previous researches. The result shows that indeed an efficiency of almost 60% can be reproduced. The second model is built to study the transient behaviour of the system, and to compare it with that of marine LNG engine systems. The result shows that the system has a better transient response than the recommended transient response for current marine LNG engine systems. Since the SOFC in the tandem fuel cell system has a slow transient behaviour, a hydrogen tank is added between the SOFC system and the PEMFC system as an energy buffer. A design assistance tool is developed to assist in sizing the hydrogen tank and the fuel (LNG) tank in design phase.","Fuel Cell; Marine; Hybrid; Natural Gas; SOFC; PEMFC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The coastline gets closer to the vegetation each year and during the monsoon season, at high tide, it reaches the palm trees completely. The assumption is that this is due to people shovelling truckloads of sand from the beach to use for construction, this is otherwise known as sand mining. All around the world there are recorded cases of it, often with disastrous outcome. However, sand mining is done sensible, the consequences can be very limited. This research will make a quantification of the influence of sand mining on the beach, will help to understand at what rate the erosion of the beach over the past 30 and 15 years has been and will make a prediction with what rate this will continue. This is done by analysing 30 years of satellite data, gathering data about the movement of the ocean at the shore, looking at characteristics of the beach and talking to the locals. The conclusion is reached by looking at two different methods. Firstly the quantification of the amount of sand that is taken from the beach yearly with respect to the amount of sand that moves along the shore yearly. Secondly by looking at the satellite data to show if the erosion of the beach was already a trend before the sand mining started. The first method established that the sand mining is but a fraction (&lt;1%) of the sand that moves along the shore each year. From the satellite data we can determine that the erosion of the beach already started when the satellites first started measuring. Therefore we can conclude that the erosion of the beach is not the result of sand mining activities.","Myanmar; Ngapali; Erosion; Coastal erosion; Sand mining","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18.3802687,94.33564249999995"

This increasing demand calls for a sustainable and clean energy resource that would reduce the load on non-renewable resources. Wind energy is a renewable resource which is harnessed by mankind from an ancient era. So as to meet this increasing energy demands, innovation in the field of wind energy is required.<br/>A wind turbine generates electricity but achieving optimal power is a difficult task. In this case, the optimal power is defined as maximum power produced but at the constraints that the fatigue loading of the wind turbine structure should be as minimum as possible. Also, the wind turbine parameters such as rotor speed and pitch activity should be in a safe operational region. The problem in controlling wind turbines is that they work in a highly uncertain environment where managing so many factors at the same time are difficult. Optimal control of wind turbine has helped in achieving maximum power with-in safe working limits. Due to high uncertainty in the operating conditions of a wind turbine, it is quite a daunting task to find optimal gains for a wind turbine controller.<br/>This thesis focuses on achieving optimal gain parameters for wind turbine controller by using an algorithm from machine learning community. In this thesis the problem is formulated as a supervised learning problem where input-output mapping has to be predicted. For this purpose, GPRT is used. The reason behind using GPRT is it takes fewer number of measurements to give good prediction compared to others. The property of GPRT where it deals with uncertain and non linear data with ease, making it a good choice for predicting wind turbine controller gains.<br/>The second part of this thesis contains optimisation of the surrogate model achieved by performing regression. The optimisation is done by Monte Carlo Maximum distribution and improved results were generated by applying sequential sampling to this algorithm. This helps us to get a likelihood of optimal gains where the wind turbine gives out rated power with minimal fatigue loads, pitch activity and least deviation of rotor speed from rated.<br/>The results obtained from the likelihood was tested for different operational wind speed and also tested for Extreme Operating Gusts as part of disturbance rejection and compared to current parameter used.<br/>The comparison shows considerable improvement in the fatigue loads and pitch activity with having improvement in power production. In second case study, more parameters were predicted and optimised using the same algorithm so that the potential of this algorithm can be estimated. This was also performed successfully which proves that this technique can successfully be used to solve higher dimensional problems of wind turbine control.","Gausssian Process Regression; Wind Turbine Control; monte carlo localization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

With Time-series InSAR (TInSAR) methodology, the ground deformation time series can be derived from InSAR observations. One of the important ways to analyze the InSAR deformation time series is to parameterize the InSAR deformation time series with deformation models.<br/>The previous ways of modelling InSAR deformation time series are usually point-wise, i.e. they focus on the deformation models of single InSAR measurement points. The deformation model of each point is either assumed to be a linear function of time, or is selected from the predefined alternative models. The point-wise modeling methodologies can well interpret the deformation behavior of each point, but is limited on modeling the spatial deformation patterns.<br/>In this study, we design and implement methodologies to model the spatio-temporal deformation patterns, based on given spatial smoothness information of the deformation. We introduce a work flow to digest the spatial smoothness information from external sources, and use the information to improve the functional and stochastic model. We also propose a model selection methodology based on hypothesis testing to select the the most probable spatio-temporal deformation model from given potential models. The spatio-temporal deformation modeling methodology is applied to the simulated data, as well as the real InSAR measurements. We apply the spatio-temporal deformation methodology to study the deformation in a hydrocarbon production field in California, and successfully detect the instantaneous uplifting and subsiding events. Based on the simulation and real case study, we conclude that given proper contextual information, spatio-temporal deformation modeling is able to derive the deformation model in both temporal and spatial domain, and has a good performance on parameterizing the non-linear deformation behavior in the temporal domain.","Satellite Radar Interferometry; Spatio-temporal Deformation Modeling; Hydrocarbon Production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So, for making good use of resources, people have to cooperate with each other. Cooperation is important not only in the physical world but also in cyberspace. Computers holding different resources also need to cooperate with others. The problems that people cooperate with people and computers cooperate with computers can be abstracted into a high level one – peers cooperate with other peers in a network. In such problems, the first step to initiate a cooperation is loc-ating other peers – you can not cooperate with a peer when you are not even aware of its existence. The task to locate other peers is called “peer discovery”, it is not an easy task, especially in distributed fashion. Peers need to acquire information of other peers from somewhere, if there is not a central party, the only place to acquire such information is other peers. Malicious peers may provide toxic information to other peers. Therefore, unconditionally trust other peers is very dangerous. For security concern, peers need to find a way to decide who is trustworthy and who is not. This thesis aims to establish trust among peers basing on the historical behaviors of other peers. We believe that by using the established trust, a Peer-to-Peer system will be more resilient to Sybil Attack where attackers create a lot of fake identities to deceive honest peers.

The generation of orthogonal signals is very difficult and true orthogonality cannot be achieved in practice. The Circulating Codes provide a simplified alternative to orthogonal signals, by transmitting the same waveform, but slightly shifted in time from channel to channel. By applying digital beamforming on transmit through signal processing on receive, a performance similar to orthogonal signals can be achieved. The Circulating Codes can also be used with a spatial code along the antenna elements, to improve the auto-correlation properties of the signal and thus the range resolution of the radar. These codes are called Hybrid or Delft Codes.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the Circulating Codes, as well as Hybrid Codes are revisited and analyzed again. An implementation for simulations has been created in Matlab to examine their behavior in more detail. To improve the range resolution of the Hybrid Codes, this thesis proposes the use of so-called Golay pairs as spatial codes. Each Golay pair consists of two codes, which have the property that the sum of their auto-correlation functions produces one strong peak and zero sidelobes. Since the application of these codes requires the transmission of two pulses, the phase shift due to the displacement of a moving target in between of the pulses has an impact on the result. This thesis focuses on the mitigation or correction of this phase shift, by the use of different methods and presents two possible solutions which perform well in simulations.<br/><br/>Finally, some of the techniques are applied in practical measurements with an available radar system. The results of these measurements show that the single-pulse techniques of the Circulating and Hybrid Codes perform well with the system, while the multi-pulse techniques with Golay pairs suffer from much higher sidelobes than expected from the simulations. First of all, this shows that the system has certain issues that need to be improved. Secondly, it shows that Hybrid Codes with Golay pairs are sensitive to disturbances and phase shifts. Therefore, very clean signals are required that might be difficult to generate in practice.","radar; MIMO; colored space; Golay sequences; Hybrid Codes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","Microwave Sensing, Signals & Systems",""

The approach followed in this research is to investigate other convex penalty functions for this purpose in order to achieve better results than the traditional LSQ method, while maintaining the overall quality and robustness of the former.<br/>To simplify the application of convex optimisation methods, an external toolbox was used to implement the different convex cost functions. The testing environment included a Precise Orbit Propagator (POP), measurement generating and processing functions, the POD algorithm itself, and data processing functionalities for the representation of the results. All the different components integrated in the final algorithm were validated before their application.<br/>Tests to assess different aspects of the implemented penalty functions were run, regarding both computational aspects and solution performance. The traditional method was observed to present suboptimal results when the noise present in the observations included unprocessed outliers. In addition, cases where the observations were highly sparse yielded a suboptimal estimation of the trajectory.<br/>After that, the L1-Norm was implemented as penalty function, alongside with Huber’s penalty function, which represents a combination of both LSQ and L1-Norm.<br/>The use of the L1-Norm in the orbit determination algorithm outperformed the traditional method in the cases where it lacked performance, such as in the presence of unprocessed outliers or sparse observation sets. However, in other tests run, the LSQ algorithm was able to reach higher accuracy levels than the L1-Norm. Huber’s penalty function, conversely, proved to be a great candidate for both purposes, closely resembling the results obtained by the best penalty function for each test and even improving it on occasions, at the cost of a higher computational effort.<br/>Finally, the designed algorithms were applied to a real-world study-case making use of GOCE data provided by TU Delft. These applications demonstrated satisfactory performance for each of the methods that were implemented and provided an important validation of the work.<br","convex functions; orbit determination; observations; robustness; penalty functions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

If actual weather conditions exceed the operational limit, then the operation cannot be executed and hence downtime occurs. It is up to contractors, such as Boskalis, to accurately estimate the expected downtime in order to determine the project costs. Recently, anew tool has been developed to make downtime assessments by using the Markov theory: the so-called `Downtime-Modular-Markov model' (DMM-model). It abstracts the actual metocean conditions by stochastically producing binary `workability sequences' for each operation, where a distinction has been made between workable and non-workable states given an operational limit. The Markov statistics of the model are based on the characteristics of the observed metocean conditions. Complex marine project simulations are realizable based on these statistics. The purpose of this thesis is to develop the DMM-model for which a software-testing process is applied. In the verification phase the concept and the code of the model are checked on correctness, consistency and completeness. Subsequently, the validation phase addresses to the quality of the model. Three different metocean datasets are used to test the model and its individual modules whether they perform sufficiently accurate. The most important findings of both phases are tackled in the improvement \&amp; extension phase. Adjustments made during this last phase bring the DMM-model to a new state-of-the-art. It is recommended for further study to conduct an uncertainty analysis (quantify the model and parametric uncertainty).","Complex marine project; operation; operational limit; downtime; Markov theory; Downtime-Modular-Markov model; workability sequences; simulation; software-testing; verification; validation; improvement; extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-20","","","","","",""

Among these, two future Japanese spacecraft are expected to repeatedly encounter the Moon along their trajectories to either facilitate the escape from the Earth–Moon system or opportunely target a speciﬁc region in its neighbourhood. Although never actively employed for preliminary trajectory design, lunar collision orbits have shown a rich dynamical structure and an applicability for both medium- and low-energy regimes. These characteristics, together with their intrinsic nature of being close to trajectories experiencing lunar ﬂy-by, have encouraged this research. In this work, lunar collision orbits are employed to delineate a method for obtaining ballistic transfers between two successive lunar encounters, brieﬂy addressed as Moon-to-Moon. This study is ﬁrst carried out with the assumptions of the autonomous Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem, subsequently extended to the nonautonomous Bi-circular Restricted Four-Body Problem, including the solar gravitational inﬂuence.<br/>Poincaré cuts are extensively used as a dimensionality reductant for lunar collision orbits: this allows to ascertain their similar behaviour with trajectories ﬂybying the Moon, whose characteristics are partly foreseen by determining the associated intersection with the same cut. A patching is performed at the cut to obtain both single and multiple ballistic Moon-to-Moon transfers. The strict bond of lunar collision orbits with the invariant manifolds of simple periodic orbits about Lagrangian points is conﬁrmed and exploited to design ballistic itineraries connecting highly elliptic orbits about the Earth to horizontal Lyapunov orbits of the Earth–Moon system, via a single Moon-to-Moon transfer. With the usage of the lunar collision orbits and the Poincaré cut, a simple optimization technique is implemented to retrieve a properly deﬁned Moon-to-Moon transfer from a trajectory missing a second ﬂy-by with the Moon. Including the presence of the Sun, a similar method for obtaining single and multiple Moon-to-Moon transfers is developed. A classiﬁcation of lunar double-collision transfers is then performed within the same framework, highlighting their similarity with other studies in past literature, eventually leading to the construction of a database of Moon-to-Moon transfers. The latter, conceived as an improvement with respect to the former version by adding the lunar gravitational inﬂuence, shows its applicability in real preliminary trajectory design.","Moon-to-Moon transfer; Circular restricted three-body problem; Bicircular restricted four-body problem; Collision orbits; Levi Civita regularization; Poincaré map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The area is now largely underdeveloped, but in 2021 it will be directly connected to Yangon’s CBD by a bridge, after which rapid urbanization and growth is expected. Current water infrastructure is already lacking heavily, making the need for a full new system even more imminent for the future. In an 8 week field research period, a full design cycle was conducted with input from several local experts and stakeholders. The final advice is to implement a new system focused on rainwater harvesting, large-scale storage in reservoirs and a dual reticulation system for water supply to the consumer. Other water infrastructure, such as drainage, sewage and treatment is designed to fit these focal points. This system is more sustainable than commonly used methods, as the resource is not impacted and energy is saved on treatment and transport. Furthermore, it caters for all expected water needs in 2040, making Dala fully self sufficient in closing the water circle.","Sustainable; water infrastructure; drinking water; water harvesting; water supply","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP239","16.758, 96.158"

Over the last decades more and more research has been done in trying to enhance strength and endurance by means of an exoskeleton. Reducing the metabolic cost of human walking using lower extremity exoskeletons is one of the challenges that has been taken on by several research groups. Only recently have some of these groups managed to reduce the metabolic cost of walking with the help of an exoskeleton. Understanding how human walking behavior changes and adapts to these new supportive devices is crucial in the quest to better, more efficient exoskeletons. Effects of two control methods, that were proven to be successful in making human walking more energy efficient, on the biomechanics of human subjects were examined by performing lab experiments and using the collected experimental data to run musculoskeletal simulations to compute muscle mechanics and energetics of six lower extremity muscles. Lab experiments, which were completed by eight out of ten recruited subjects, consisted of treadmill walking with and without the exoskeleton, while EMG, respiratory, kinematic and kinetic data was recorded. Processing of this data, the simulation steps taken and the eventual results are presented in this thesis. It was found that walking with the exoskeleton, while it was not giving any assistance, significantly increased the energy consumption rate of subjects, compared to normal walking. This increase was reduced by one of the two support methods, whereas the other had no significant effect on the total metabolic rate.","Exoskeleton; Musculoskeletal modeling; Biomechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

By removing the constraint of a conforming mesh, more freedom is offered to modeling exact geometries by means of splines. However, very few studies have been published which combine Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to interface-enriched methods, addressing uniquely weak discontinuities. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to propose a NURBS-based enhancement to the Discontinuity-Enriched Finite Element Method (DE-FEM) in two dimensions and to discuss the potential of its application. The main advantage of this method is the possibility to study problems that present discontinuities with arbitrary smooth shapes, while maintaining exact geometries throughout the analysis: in this way, the equivalence between design and computational geometry is preserved. To this purpose, a suitable NURBS-based analysis technique is selected and implemented within the framework offered by the group's finite element library, Hybrida. <br/>The capabilities of the NURBS-enhanced DE-FEM to solve several weakly discontinuous problems are assessed for composites of different complexities. Furthermore, a novel study is presented which extends this technique to the treatment of strong discontinuities, in the context of fracture mechanics. The accuracy, convergence properties and numerical efficiency of the proposed method are investigated, in particular in comparison with the standard DE-FEM. Based on these observations, further insights are provided into the convenience and the limitations of adopting NURBS enhancements within the DE-FEM formulation. Lastly, some recommendations about possible directions of improvement are provided.","FEM; NURBS; structural mechanics; discontinuities; composites; fracture mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Usually, damage is measured as the dent deformation that the pipeline will experience. Depending on the size of the dent, leakage, rupture or cease of production might occur. Thus, it is important to quantify how a pipeline behaves and interacts with its environment during an impact with a dropped object.<br/>Initially, a simple finite element model has been developed in order to verify some laboratory experiments from Karamanos and Gresnigt that have been conducted under quasi-static conditions, where no inertia or velocity need to be taken into account. The falling object’s geometry, external or internal pressure and different material models have been investigated in order to derive preliminary conclusions regarding the stiffness of the system and the shape of the dent.<br/>Next, velocity and mass of the indenter and of pipeline are taken into account in order to simulate the previous experiments dynamically. It has been observed that there are significant differences when inertia is taken into account in the denting behavior of a pipeline for low-velocity impact scenarios. Moreover, the effect of strain-rate sensitivities of steel have been incorporated by using the Cowper-Symonds law and their importance is stressed out in the results especially for mild steel pipelines.<br/>In an effort to model closer the reality, simplified fluid models have been created using both the Lagrangian approach and the acoustic element formulation. This way, the partial incompressibility of the fluids, their inertia and their pressure can be modeled more accurately in order to reach valuable conclusions as to how they contribute in the system behavior.<br/>All the aforementioned analyses have been conducted under the assumption that the bed upon the pipeline is resting is completely rigid. However, in reality the pipeline rests on a soil bed which is flexible and deformable. This is the most significant aspect of this thesis. Specifically, the energy dissipation due to the soil deformation and the pipe penetration into the soil is investigated. A soil – structure finite element model has been developed, considering a simplified Mohr-Coulomb elastoplastic model of failure which is adequate to obtain a good estimate regarding the soil contribution. It has been shown that for a range of different soil profiles of clay and sand, the energy dissipation is significant resulting in decrease of the dent deformation compared to a rigid bed case. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out regarding the impact velocity, mass and the initial embedment of the pipeline into the soil where it is shown that for the same kinetic energy input different results are being derived.<br/>A final model is considered, where pressure, soil and strain-rate of steel are combined. The system behavior can be explained based on fundamental physics which give additional confidence in the interpretation of the results. Useful conclusions are derived in the end, showing that in many cases current practice is over conservative when assessing damage from dropped objects and thus a more detailed analysis and approach should be used in the future when conducting a risk or integrity assessment.","impact assessment; pipeline; denting; Soil-Structure Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-20","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This is due to the ageing and the increased use of these assets. As a result, some assets need additional maintenance measures, besides the regular maintenance, to keep them from failing. However, there is a limited budget making it impossible to invest simultaneously in each aging asset. As a solution, the asset manager can prioritize the numerous assets in order to know in which asset needs to be invested first. The sophistication of this prioritization strategy ranges from ‘observations’ via extended asset maintenance logs and logical reasoning down to more complex prioritization strategies which make use of risk assessment. Asset managers can use risk assessments to prioritize investments in the maintenance of their assets by assessing the risks of the assets’ failure. The risk of an asset failure can be defined as the probability of failure times the impact of failure. The higher the risk value attributed to the asset, the more critical the asset is assumed to be. <br/><br/>In practice, however, risk assessments of assets don’t always yield sufficient information to support a prioritization process and help decision makers to decide which investment in maintenance for which asset is necessary first. It appears that to be able to successfully conduct the risk assessment and prioritize maintenance, the asset manager must connect with two actor groups whose perspectives and interests have a big influence on the process which seeks to identify critical assets. One actor is the asset owner, whose interests towards assets are expressed at a strategic level and who speaks a non-technical, political language, has a long-term point of view and cares about social accountability. The service provider on the other hand speaks a technical, non-political language, has a short-term point of view and cares primarily about the functioning of the assets. So, these actor groups do not speak the same language, use different time perspectives and have diverging interests. Thus the asset manager has a challenging position and needs to translate content between these strategic and operational levels. This friction strongly affects the extent to which the asset manager can claim any degree of control over the process of identifying risks of all assets.<br/><br/>A literature review yielded many methods to identify the critical components of an object, which is necessary for determining the necessary maintenance measures to prevent risks. Nevertheless, no method in literature explains how asset managers can identify critical objects using risk assessments. However, such a method is required when an asset manager wants to prioritize objects of an infrastructure system in order to determine which object needs additional maintenance measures first to treat the current risks. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is therefore to develop a systematic process model for the asset manager to identify the critical public infrastructure objects that simultaneously complies with the interests of the three management levels involved in the asset management process: the asset owner, the asset manager and the service provider. This model is presented in an IDEF0 model, a type of process model, which shows the necessary activities, inputs, outputs, mechanisms and controls underlying the risk assessment process. <br","Critical; Assets; Objects; Infrastructure; Asset Management; Prioritization; IDEF0; Interests; Asset owner; Asset manager; Service provider","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For economic reasons, the thickness of these substrates shows a decreasing trend over the years. This results in an increasing breakage rate of the substrates during the production process. A solution to this problem could be air-based contactless handling. A thin film of air is used to perform a levitation and propulsion function. The levitation is similar to conventional air bearing technology, while the propulsion is achieved by exploiting the viscous traction force of a thin film of air. The state of the art in contactless positioning using a thin film of air is mainly focused on the positioning of the substrate. The next step in thin substrate handling is transporting them.<br/>In this project, a transport demonstrator for handling a 100 mm diameter wafer is designed and fabricated. This is done in a layer approached way, for which new manufacturing methods are developed. The demonstrator consists of an active surface and a passive surface. The active air bearing surface is able to actuate and levitate the wafer in two degrees of freedom, while the passive air bearing surface is only able to levitate the wafer and guide its motion. Crucial in the combination of the two different surfaces is a smooth transition of the wafer. This is realised by matching the wafer fly height and the air film stiffness of each surface. A smooth transition of the wafer between the active surface and the passive surface is observed. Therefore, the demonstrator is a promising concept to realise an air-based contactless conveying line for thin substrates.","Contactless; Air bearing; Substrates; Transport; Pneumatics; Demonstrator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-19","","","","","",""

The flushing procedures of i4 devices to clear obstructions from its conduits caused by insulin degradation are not always fully effective. The goal of this research was to investigate how the flushing effectiveness can be increased by adapting conduit geometries and adapting the flush flow rate. It was hypothesized that flushing of conduits with complex geometries (featuring a.o. widened sections, or parallel flow paths) would be less effective than simple geometries, and that a higher flush flow rate would increase flushing effectiveness. An ex vivo laboratory experimental setup was created by producing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) test conduits of differing geometries that model the in vivo implanted intra-peritoneal insulin infusion (i4) device’s conduits, but are transparent to allow optical inspection. These test conduits were filled with acidified insulin, and precipitation thereof was artificially induced by heat incubation of the filled conduits, as a model for obstructed i4-device conduits. Experimental flushing procedures using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a flush liquid were performed on these test conduits at 2 different flush flow rates: 1.5mL/min, and at 20mL/min. After the flushing, the effectiveness of the procedure to clear the conduit of precipitates was evaluated by microscopically analysing the quantity of residual precipitates, and measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) of a liquid sample taken from the post-flushing conduit. All conduits with more complex geometries than straight tubes showed lower effectiveness of cleaning by flushing. The high flow rate showed an averaged 19% higher effectiveness of the flushing. In the sections of the conduits featuring widening, flushing often resulted in a narrow path being effectively cleaned, but significant regions of the conduit showed presence of residual precipitates. This research provides insight into the negative influence of complex geometries on effectiveness of flushing, and the positive influence of increased flush flow rate to improve effectiveness. Experimental repetition in this research is low, and the experimental methods were prone to much influence of material or measurement disturbances. This research merits elaboration and improvement of materials and methods to more precisely investigate the proposed relations. Outcomes suggest that future i4-devices should be designed to avoid complex conduit geometries as much as possible, and to be flushed with significantly higher flush flow rates than currently clinically applied.","insulin; infusion; aggregation; precipitation; obstruction; fouling; conduits; implant; intraperitoneal; flushing; rinsing; cleaning; geometry; fluid dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-19","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

Their fleet of over 20 semi-Submersible Heavy Transport Vessels (SHTV) is capable to carry the heaviest and largest structures. Until today the load or discharge operation of a floating body has only been performed in sheltered waters. Here, the influences of the environmental loading (wind, waves and current) are limited. Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSO) are subjected to hull maintenance and repairs in the near future, which causes a major downtime due to transportation. If the maintenance of FPSOs could be performed offshore, it could reduce this downtime significantly. Due to the environmental loading the SHTV and FPSO move separately. In order to perform a safe offshore load/discharge operation their relative motion should be within the width of the cribbing. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the influence of the location of the connections between the two vessels on the relative transverse motion at keel level of the FPSO. Sway, roll and yaw are considered as the main degrees of freedom (DOF) that have influence on the transverse motion. A numerical model is built to solve the equations of motion in the frequency domain for a 3DOF system. This system consists of a rigid body which represents the FPSO. The rigid body is connected to a set of springs and dashpots which influence its behaviour. For every combination of location and parameters of the spring/dashpot system the numerical model calculates the response. The outcome of all these runs are brought together in contour graphs that give insight to a possible optimal location for the connections and their corresponding parameters. It is found possible to get the transverse motions at keel level within the limits of the cribbing. By positioning the spring/dashpot systems in the corresponding optimal location the minimum required stiffness can be reduced. A fraction of the critical damping at each spring location appears to be adequate in reducing the motions during resonance. The significant forces in both spring/dashpot locations are very high but workable.","FPSO; offshore; load; discharge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","","","","","",""

These tasks are exposed to sensory and motor noise and delays originated from the biological system characteristics, as well as to varying surrounding environments while performing movements. Therefore, uncertainty of the estimate of limb position arises. Error estimates during movement and displacements after a mechanical perturbation are compensated by relying on proprioceptive feedback from the body. Moreover, the motor system can rely on co-contraction as it increases the amplitude of the short latency stretch reflex, which plays an important role in minimizing the effects of disturbances. This study examines the influence of position, velocity, and pre-perturbation background muscle activity in the decision process of avoiding obstacles in the environment after a mechanical perturbation while performing a reaching task. After the perturbation, participants had to choose between two strategies: going in between or around the obstacles to reach an end target. Position of the hand, velocity, and EMG activity of four muscles in the shoulder and elbow were compared at different time epochs between both strategies. No significant differences were found in muscle activity pre-perturbation and lateral position before and up to 100ms after perturbation onset. Significant difference in lateral velocity was found 50ms after perturbation onset between the two strategies. Online corrections to avoid obstacles after a mechanical perturbation are modulated by the lateral velocity of the limb.","Upper-limb; motor control; co-contraction; obstacle avoidance; decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

There are still plenty rooms of research to understand the unique characteristic of sea ice, especially in relation to offshore engineering. This includes the most fundamental problem in floating body motion analysis: the radiation-diffraction problem. A powerful mathematical concept, - so called Greens Function – is one of the favourable tools to be used for solving this mathematical problem. This is because the radiation-diffraction problem can be formulated as a boundary value problem expressed by partial differential equations. Although the application is already quite advanced for the open water case, the same cannot be said for the vessel operating in ice infested waters. The integral solution of 3D Greens Function for ice-infested waters which has not been studied before, was derived in this thesis. The open water case is also studied to gain more insight in the implementation of an arbitrary floating body thoroughly. As a closure, interpretation about the difference between open and ice-infested waters is discussed.<br/><br/>For Greens Function in the open water case, numerical evaluation of the principal value integral is not straightforward due to the hyperbolic term inside the integrand. This term makes the integrand exceed the limit of floating point number (in MATLAB) and cannot be evaluated into infinity. On the other hand, a numerical integration is quite time consuming (whereas the analytical solution, as far as the writer’s concern, is not found yet). A well-known alternative form of the solution which formulated as an infinite series might improve the computation speed. The rate of convergence depends solely on the ratio of horizontal distance between source and field point (R) and water depth (H). Another numerical issue arises in the deep water case. A finite water depth causes a catastrophic cancellation, both for the integral and the infinite series solution, due to the extremely small difference of the wave number between deep water and infinite water depth. This is where the infinite depth solution needs to be used. <br/><br/>In numerical implementation, an influence function at a panel can be approximated by multiplying the potential with panel's surface area. Due to the singularity of the Rankine source term in the integral or the modified Bessel function in the series, this approach fails and the solution need to be integrated over the panel. Although the analytical solution is available, a numerical approach is chosen to simplify the problem. The surface integration procedure can be done by transforming the global arbitrary panel orientation into the local element coordinate system, and subsequently, perform a bilinear mapping to reshape the quadrilateral panel into the desired rectangular panel. This transformation procedure is needed since MATLAB is only capable to handle double numerical integration of a function bounded between four lines perpendicularly each other. This encloses the whole challenge that needs to be addressed and might be re-occur in the ice-infested waters as well. <br/><br/>From the derivation of the Greens Function for ice-infested waters, it is shown that the hyperbolic term inside the integrand is present. This discloses that the obtained solutions cannot be used instantaneously. Another effort to rewrite them in the exponential term might be useful. Moreover, the radiation condition is not satisfied yet in this thesis. However, the suggested approach of the derivation by introducing an imaginary line to represent the source depth location avoids the use of a singular term. Generally speaking, this thesis initiates a promising foundation for further research in the hydromechanics analysis of sea ice.","Greens Function; Hydromechanics; Ice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

To fulfill its functions, it is essential that the different elements of a port work together. The full potential of a terminal can only be reached when the wet infrastructure of a port (access channel, inner basins, turning circles) can keep up with the traffic load. From the literature study, it has become apparent that simulation tools have become increasingly popular for assessing the capacity of ports and waterways. However, the application has often been aimed at a specific case study and the existing models are not easily reusable for new applications. In this master thesis project, the assessment through a generic simulation tool of the effective capacity of the wet infrastructure of a port is investigated. The model considers the processes taking place from the point a vessel arrives at the entrance of the access channel until the start of the (un)loading procedures and the departure of the port until exiting the access channel. The analysis capabilities of the model are demonstrated by studying the Port of Hazira. The main processes of the model relate to vessels obtaining authorisation to sail towards a destination. To receive this authorisation, the vessels must find a moment when the correct weather conditions occur, the tidal elevation is adequate, the waterways are available and sufficient quay length is available. The authorisation is given in a dynamic way, depending on the dimensions of the vessels, waterways and quays. Based on their origin and destination, vessels can determine their route based on the shortest path available and waterways available depending on their vessel type. Once this is done, a vessel will construct a sailing plan by finding a suitable timeslot to through each section of the port. When doing so, a vessel takes into account the sailing plans of other vessels and the sailing rules that apply for each section. As a result, a vessel can construct a suitable sailing plan based on an origin and destination which can be applied to any port layout. During this study, it has become apparent that many processes should be included to properly determine the capacity of port. Simulation software offers the possibility of including all these processes and observe their interactions in order to locate bottlenecks more efficiently. Simio has proven to be able to incorporate all the required process to properly model the wet infrastructure of a port. However, it does not offer a user-friendly interface to handle different scenarios and facilitate the handling of both the input and output of the model. To this easier, an interface has been created with Scenario Navigator. This interface enable the storing and comparing of input parameters and results of different scenarios.","port planning; simulation; Simio; marine operations; logistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The government of the Netherlands aims to support the transition of the energy system of the Netherlands towards a sustainable system by implementing policy measures. Recently, companies have voiced their concerns on the fluctuating effects of policy measures in the Netherlands and have asked for a more long term vision of policy measures. This long term vision can be (partly) provided by analysing the interference in the energy system. Another component of a policy strategy is that to develop and implement a long term policy strategy, multiple governmental organisation have to collaborate. The policy measures are designed by different ministries within the Netherlands. In order to implement the coherent policy strategy, collaboration between these ministries is essential. <br/><br/>This research proposes a methodology to identify five types of interference and to analyse the effects of the identified interference on the Dutch energy system. This categorization of interference allows for a discussion on the unavoidable nature of interference. Moreover, it shows which types of interference can prove to be beneficial at certain times.<br/><br/>A conceptual theoretical framework for factors that influence interorganizational collaboration between public parties has been constructed based on literature, and is tested and validated within the case study.

The relations can provide insight into the more complex system view of the factors that influence interorganizational collaboration between public parties.<br/><br/>Both researches are based on a view of the world in systems, and for both is searched for links between sub-systems. Finding the link between the technical energy system and the collaborations required in policy making was based on this system perspective. These two topics are invariably linked together. The integrations in the energy system increases the need for collaboration, whereas collaboration can increase (the effectiveness of) the integrations in the energy system.","Interference; policy measures; interorganizational; collaboraiton; system perspective","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

About half of the Earth’s land-based cobalt reserves can be found in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study focusses on characterising cobalt-bearing copper ore from a DRC based mining operation and linking characteristic ore properties to the comminution behaviour. Portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) is used to determine the geochemistry, while QEMSCAN, CT scan and InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy are used to assess mineralogy on different length scales. In terms of geotechnical properties, the surface hardness of the ore is determined using a rebound hardness tester. The comminution behaviour is assessed by crushing selected ore samples below 3.35 mm and by grinding the crushed samples for 21 minutes using a ball mill. The energy consumption required for different ore types is quantified using the crushing and sieving simulation package Bruno. <br/><br/>The chemical characterisation of ore samples showed significant variation in cobalt content, as the cobalt grade measured in the samples using pXRF varied from 0% to 33.5%. By applying QEMSCAN analysis to samples coming from different locations within the deposit, two different mineralogical zones have been identified: a weathered, and a sulphide zone, with large differences in modal mineralogy. In the weathered zone kolwezite and heterogenite are the principal cobalt bearing minerals, in the sulphide zone carrollite is the only mineral containing cobalt. The CT scan confirmed the unique mineralogy of certain samples, as the mineralogy of pure carrollite nodules found using QEMSCAN showed to continue in 3D. Both QEMSCAN and CT scan were able to detect differences in mineral texture of the studied samples. <br/>In terms of geotechnical properties, differences between surface hardness of the samples were observed using the rebound hardness tester. An empirical formula has been derived to adjust the measured surface hardness of drill core samples with a mass below 300 grams. This formula aided in identifying the differences in surface hardness for the distinct mineral textures of the sulphide zone. Influence of mineralogy on the sur- face hardness has been observed, as areas containing only carrollite showed to have a lower surface hardness than areas with a mixture of Mg silicates, quartz and carrollite. <br/><br/>Fourier Transformed IR (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify a range of gangue minerals within the samples. Carrollite could be identified if it was present in significant proportions and no other IR active minerals were present. FTIR spectroscopy also allowed to refine mineralogical data, as it was possible to differentiate between talc or serpentine and muscovite or illite in the studied samples, which was not possible using QEMSCAN. In total 8 minerals were identified using IR spectroscopy. The relative proportions of the modal mineralogy showed to be in agreement with the mineralogy found through QEMSCAN. <br/><br/>The comminution experiments led to the identification of three different comminution classes. These three classes can again be linked to the identified mineral texture types. The surface hardness showed to be correlated to the p80 of samples with the same mineral texture. After 21 minutes of milling, the samples with a higher surface hardness had a coarser p80. Simulation showed that the crushing energy requirements differ up to a maximum of 27% for different comminution classes. This research provides a foundation towards identification of geometallurgical domains in the sulphide section of the investigated cobalt-bearing copper deposit. <br/><br/>This MSc thesis was carried out at Camborne School of Mines (University of Exeter) as part of the NERC funded Cobalt: Geology, Geomicrobiology and Geometallurgy (CoG3) project. <br","Geometallurgy; Cobalt; Comminution; QEMSCAN; FTIR; XRF; Equotip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","","","","","",""

This project proposes a product-service service system for the detection and diagnosis of AF in the current healthcare system in The Netherlands. This thesis is based on interviews with cardiologists, general practitioners and literature research. One in four middle-aged adults in Europe and the US will develop Atrial Fibrillation (Kirchhof et al., 2016). Furthermore, AF is associated with a five-fold risk factor of stroke, while other cardiovascular deaths, such as sudden death and heart failure, are common in AF patients. (Kotecha et al., 2014). AF is a progressive disease, it starts with short episodes that end by themselves, paroxysmal AF, then episodes that have to be stopped in a hospital, persistent AF, and eventually permanent AF. Diagnosing AF in the first stage is difficult, the episodes are short and random, while current monitoring devices only cover up to 48 hours. Thus, the problem is that current diagnostic tools have too short a monitoring period to diagnose paroxysmal AF effectively. The proposal by Philips was to monitor over longer periods, using Philips’ HealthWatch. However, the PPG technology, integrated in the current generation HealthWatch, is too sensitive to movements on the wrist position. This could still result in an inaccurate diagnosis. PPG is a sensor technology that uses a LED to look at the reflections of the blood volume in the skin. Blood volume changes within every heartbeat in a predictable manner. From these changes, it is possible to extract information such as the heart rate. Using an algorithm, it is possible to diagnose AF from this kind of information. However, PPG is also very sensitive to the movement between the skin and the sensor. After an initial exploration of the subject the design proposal was formulated as follows: “To provide a low threshold tool to support the initial diagnosis of (paroxysmal) atrial fibrillation for the General Practitioner while collecting useful data for the further treatment and providing support for the patient.” This proposal led to the creation of Afi, which is a small diagnostic tool based on PPG, that can be deployed by the General Practitioner for unobstructed longer-term monitoring. The Afi is usually placed on the upper arm of the user. Afi was evaluated with some users and healthcare professionals [HCP], namely a GP and a leading cardiologist. The evaluation with the HCP demonstrated that Afi has excellent potential as a new way of diagnosing AF.","AF; atrial fibrillation; Medesign; Cardiolab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Measures for variability of identification with respect to the number of repetitions and for nonlinearity with respect to the perturbation amplitude were calculated. Results: Identification variability was found to significantly decrease with number of repetitions. Nonlinearity within the neuromuscular controller increased significantly with perturbation amplitude. Conclusions: After having measured 6-8 repetitions, measuring subsequent repetitions does not decrease identification variability significantly for the following 6-7 repetitions. The balance between suppressing noise effects by using a high amplitude perturbation and minimising nonlinear effects by using a low amplitude perturbation was identified to be optimized between a perturbation signal amplitude of 8 cm PtP and 11 cm PtP.","System Identification; human balance control; neuromuscular controller; perturbation; multisine; perturbation amplitude; averaging; repetitions; nonlinearity; single inverted pendulum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

For example wafer scanners, used for production of integrated circuits, have to provide (sub)nanometre precision positioning whilst satisfying challenging requirements on speed at the same time. It is in demanding cases like this that different requirements begin to conflict with each other. A fundamental trade-off between robustness and performance exists as an inevitable result of the waterbed effect in linear control. PID controllers, which have been an industry-standard for many years, do not satisfy the ever increasing demands.<br/><br/>In this MSc thesis a novel reset control synthesis method is proposed: CRONE reset control, which combines a robust fractional CRONE controller (Commande Robuste d’Ordre Non-Entier) with non-linear reset control to overcome waterbed effect. In CRONE control, robustness is achieved against gain deviations by creation of constant phase behaviour around bandwidth with the use of fractional operators. The use of fractional operators also introduces more freedom in shaping the open- loop frequency response, allowing fractional factors in Bode’s gain-phase relation. However, waterbed effect remains, which motivates introduction of non-linear reset control in the CRONE design. In reset control, controller states are reset when the error between output- and reference- signal is zero. In frequency domain, using describing function analysis it is predicted that reset filters generate less phase lag for similar gain behaviour. For instance, a reset integrator gives a phase lag of about 38 degrees, which is 52 degrees less compared to the linear integrator. This allows for relief from Bode’s gain-phase relation, breaking aforementioned trade-offs.<br/>In the new controller design, reset phase advantage is approximated using describing function analysis and used to achieve better open-loop shape. New design rules for CRONE reset control have been developed in this thesis. Three different reset control strategies have been investigated: integrator reset, lag reset and lead- lag/lag-lead reset. For these controllers, a two-degree-of-freedom non-linearity tuning CRONE reset control structure has been developed. This control structure has been implemented digitally within a MATLAB/Simulink environment on a Lorentz-actuated (dual) precision stage via a real-time dSPACE DS1103 controller interface. For the implemented controllers sufficient quadratic stability has been shown using the Hβ-condition.<br/><br/>It has been shown that simulated frequency responses using describing function correspond well to experimental identified frequency responses. Moreover, frequency domain measurements have shown that better performance for CRONE reset control can be achieved for same phase margin compared to linear CRONE. Relief from both waterbed effect and Bode’s gain-phase relation has been accomplished. Furthermore, for the same bandwidth, average noise reduction between 1.79dB and 3.93dB has been attained at a number of distinct frequencies above bandwidth. <br/>In the fine stage separately and also in dual stage configuration, tracking of a fourth-order input-shaped reference signal (with second-order- and fourth-order feedforward respectively) showed improvement in CRONE reset control compared to linear CRONE. In the dual stage configuration, after decoupling fine stage and coarse stage, tracking performance of a linear CRONE controller has been compared to a CRONE reset controller. In both cases the same linear CRONE-2 controller with a bandwidth of 80 Hz and phase margin of 50° was applied to the coarse stage. On the fine stage a CRONE-1 lag-lead controller was applied with a bandwidth of 150 Hz and a phase margin of 55°. RMS error for a triangular scanning wave with maximal acceleration of 0.25 m/s2 and maximal velocity of 75 mm/s over a stroke of 2 cm, was reduced from 929.8 nm to 443.7 nm.","reset control; describing function analysis; loop shaping; fractional order control; CRONE; robust control; precision positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Prolonged periods of drought in densely populated areas threaten the quantity and quality of freshwater sources. Closing the water cycle by wastewater reuse can alleviate pressure on these freshwater sources. However, a closed water system requires a different institutional environment. A comprehensive and specific institutional analysis framework can provide guidance to stakeholders in the regional water system. A literature review has concluded that academia has not yet provided such framework (van Es, 2017a). This research proposes an institutional analysis framework by combining two widely used frameworks in institutional analysis: the four-layer model of Williamson (1998) and the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework of Ostrom (2011). The aim of the institutional analysis framework is twofold: 1) to find the critical issues that can be expected in closing the regional water cycle and 2) to provide recommendations on coordination of the action situations in which the critical issues are addressed. The framework is applied to the case of closing the water cycle in the service area of water authority Delfland in the western part of the Netherlands. This research shows that the proposed institutional analysis framework is highly useful in finding and coordinating crucial issues in closing the water cycle. An empirical operation of the four-layer model of Williamson (1998) provided a deep and structured understanding of the expected issues by relevant stakeholders. It also provided insight into the attitude and main drivers of stakeholders on a closed water cycle. The IAD framework of Ostrom (2011) helped to specify the most critical action situations. Further research can contribute to the field of institutional analysis by conducting more case studies with the proposed Williamson-Ostrom framework and execute the case study in a theoretical way instead of an empirical way.","Closed water cycle; Williamson; four-layer model; IAD framework; institutions; Ostrom; wastewater reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

The different types of surgical procedures, the variety of tools used by the surgeon and the varying viewpoint of the surgeon combined, makes it a very dynamic situation where the microscope should fit in. (Re)positioning the microscope on different locations and under different angles is therefore essential. The support system of the microscope should allow for manual, effortless and fluent repositioning to make it extremely user-friendly. Activation of the brakes in all the joints turns the flexible system into a rigid one.<br/><br/>In this rigid mode the support system should be a steady base for the microscope, but certain support systems currently on the market cannot realize this. The microscope keeps vibrating in its eigenmode for too long after a perturbation from its equilibrium position, which causes a deteriorated image. A quicker return to the equilibrium position allows the surgeon to continue the operation without much delay. An investigation in the design of a steady but repositionable support system for a surgical microscope is therefore desired. <br/><br/>The strategy used in this thesis to improve the design of the system is by creating a dynamic simulated model of the microscope support system in order to perform a free vibration analysis. The model has been validated with vibration measurements performed on an actual system. To investigate possible improvements of the vibration response, the model has been subjected to a set of parametric experiments. A second strategy to improve the vibration response is by implementing a subsystem with damping properties: A tuned mass damper. <br/><br/>The results of the parametric experiments show that the settling time of the support system can be reduced with 17.5% by slight adjustments to certain design variables. These results have been transformed into design recommendations. The tuned mass damper has successfully been implemented in the simulated model of the support system. This subsystem has great damping properties: The addition of a tuned mass damper shows that the settling time can be reduced with 77.4%. <br/><br/>When a tuned mass damper is implemented in the support system of a surgical microscope, delays after microscope repositioning actions will significantly be reduced which shortens the total operation time. Verification of these results in practice are left for future work.","surgical microscope; simulated model; vibration analysis; Tuned mass damper (TMD)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","","","","","",""

Most of them rely on imported fossil fuels, which makes electricity generation both expensive and unsustainable. Moreover, small tropical islands are more vulnerable to the consequences of climate change than the mainland. Effects of climate change can be: more and more powerful hurricanes, shrinking fresh water resources, crop failures, land loss and coastal ecosystem change. An Ocean Thermal Energy system can be the solution for a tropical island. Cold deep seawater can be pumped up to generated baseload electricity in an onshore Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion power plant. The same deep ocean water can be used to cool houses, hotels, data centers, greenhouses and more. Furthermore, fresh water can be produced in an Ocean Thermal Water Plant and aquaculture and algae farms can use the nutrient-rich, virtually pathogen-free deep ocean water to cultivate fish and algae. In this work, a comparison has been made for the water usage and cold water pipe diameter between a non-integrated and a time-integrated Ocean Thermal Energy system. The cold deep seawater has to be pumped up by a large and long pipe. To reach the depth of about 1000 m, the cold water pipe can be a few kilometers long, depending on the slope of the seabed. To make an Ocean Thermal Energy system economically more attractive, an optimization study can be made for the maximum water demand and cold water pipe diameter. To do this, a modular model of an Ocean Thermal Energy system is developed in Python 2.7. The model exist out of modules for the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, Sea Water Air Conditioning, data center cooling, greenhouse cooling and fresh water production.<br/>A case study has been conducted for an Ocean Thermal Energy system in Cura\c{c}ao. Based on the expected electricity and cooling demands, a comparison has been made between a non-integrated and a time-integrated Ocean Thermal Energy system. The results show that the maximum cold deep seawater mass flow and the required cold water pipe diameter in case of an time-integrated Ocean Thermal Energy system are lower, but the difference with a non-integrated system is not significant. Peak demands can be compensated with thermal storages. The optimization with thermal storages are applied to Sea Water Air Conditioning, data center cooling, greenhouse cooling and fresh water production. When the daily fluctuations are compensated, the decrease in maximum water demand and cold water pipe diameter is larger compared to the time-integrated Ocean Thermal Energy system. The optimization to compensate seasonal fluctuations result in an even higher decrease in cold water mass flow and pipe diameter. However, very large storage volumes are required and it has to be researched if the reduction in cold water pipe cost outweigh the cost of the thermal storages. Changing the configuration of the subsystems in the Ocean Thermal energy system also decreases the maximum water demand and cold water pipe diameter. The results show that a significant decrease is possible when only the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion power plant and the Sea Water Air Conditioning are connected to the cold deep seawater. The maximum water demands of the subsystem are researched in case that the Ocean Thermal Energy system is expanded or when the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion power plant is shut down in favor of Sea Water Air Conditioning or data center cooling.

During the transportation and immersion, the floating tunnel element is connected via cables to the immersion barges/pontoons. In this study, the hydrodynamical behavior of a floating tunnel element during construction has been modeled. The motional characteristics and stability of a floating tunnel element and twin barges during the installation are investigated.This study aimed to investigate, how the stability of the system can be improved to make it possible to immerse a large number of tunnel elements in relatively short span of time in offshore conditions. The hydrodynamical behavior of the system and the related forces in different construction stages are analyzed. The focus of the study was on the determination of the influence of the pontoon configuration on the systems stability, the related forces, and operability. For this study, Fehmrnbelt Fixed Link tunnel project has been taken as a case study. The calculations are performed for two different pontoon configurations, namely: - Catamaran (conventionally applied pontoon for the immersion of tunnel elements) - Semi-submersible (platform used in offshore industry)In the analysis, first, the main dimensions of the two pontoons are determined. The pontoons form the main piece of the immersion equipment. Subsequently, during the transport, the forces and moments on the floating element are evaluated. Two main type hydraulic external forces have been taken into consideration in the model, namely current and wave force. For different positions along transport route, the forces and moments are calculated for finite water depth and different values of flow velocity.From the analysis, it appears that the wave-induced motions of a floating tunnel element are negligible. The relatively small waves are not able to bring the massive tunnel element into motions. The lowest natural periods of the floating tunnel element appears for roll degree of freedom, and it is about 8s. The significant current forces and moments occur during the fitting out. The stability of a floating element during transport is primary determined by the towing velocity.During immersion, the systems stability due to waves and current forces is being analyzed. To assess the stability of the system for different current conditions, the vortex shedding periods are calculated. Then the natural frequencies of the system have been evaluated for different pontoon configurations and tunnel element length.It appears that an immersion system with Catamaran pontoons seems to be less sensitive to vortex shedding period in contrast to the Semi-submersible barge. A Semi-submersible barge can only be used in 80% of current conditions in Fehmarnbelt. A Catamaran pontoon can be applied in 95% of the occurring current conditions.Also, during the immersion, the wave-induced motions of the tunnel element can be ignored, provided that the wavelengths and wave periods are not too large. On the other hand, the relatively light pontoons are sensitive to wave loadings. The motions of the barges are prevented by the element, which leads to significant force fluctuations in suspension cables. In the analysis, the coupling between surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw degrees of freedom are considered. The calculations are performed for the first order responses that are valid in relatively low wave heights. Hydrodynamic effects caused by the nonlinearities are disregarded in the calculations.The pontoons were considered as a hybrid structure. That means, concerning the horizontal degrees of freedom the pontoon structure is regarded as it is compliant and it behaves like a floating structure. While concerning the vertical degrees of freedom, it is stiff and resembles as a fixed structure, and it is not allowed to float freely. The contribution of the mooring lines to the first order response is considered of minor importance, and it is disregarded. Numerical studies are conducted to compare the dynamical behavior of the Catamaran pontoon with that of the Semi-submersible. The results of this study reveal that:  - The contribution of the first order wave force to the pontoons motions in soft degrees (surge, sway, and yaw) is limited - The motions in stiff degrees of freedom (heave, pitch, and roll) are normative for the immersion operation. When the tunnel element is immersed in wave conditions T&gt;5 s and H &gt; 1 m, then there is a significant danger that one of the suspension cables will break when applying a Catamaran pontoon. If a Semi-submersible barge is used, then the tunnel element can be immersed in wave conditions T &lt; 6.5 s and H &lt; 1.8 m. - Semi-submersible pontoon has larger natural frequencies than Catamaran pontoon. The natural periods of the Semi-submersible barge are approximately a factor 1.4 larger than the natural periods of the Catamaran pontoon. - A Semi-submersible pontoon is more sensitive to the force fluctuation in the suspension cables than the Catamaran pontoon concerning the static stability and floating capacity. Especially the floating capacity became problematic if the force fluctuations become large and therefore the pontoon can be pulled under water. - The heave motions mainly affect the force fluctuations in suspension cables, and they can be considered as normative. - Both barges are sensitive to the increasing wave height and period. However, the effect on Catamaran pontoon is larger. In total, a Semi-submersible barge has favorable operability in the waves and current conditions in Fehmarnbelt. Therefore, if the workability is the primary objective, then it is better to apply a Semi-submersible pontoon. Then in 77% of environmental conditions, the tunnel elements can be immersed.","Immersed tunnels; dynamic stability; pontoon; catamaran pontoon; semi-submersed pontoon; fehmarnbelt tunnel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-31","","","","","Fehmarnbelt fixed link","54.5666644, 11.2833322"

Various drivers can be identified for the production and consumption of biofuels, such as environmental considerations, energy security and economic development. Therefore, biofuels may be an appealing option to policy makers. Biofuels are in general more expensive to produce than their fossil counterparts. Therefore, (support) policy is necessary to increase the competitiveness of biofuels. Policy makers can implement various measures to realize the potential benefits of biofuels, such as import- and export tariffs, imposing trade embargoes, offering subsidies, mandating blending targets and creating tax exemptions. However, the biofuel market is an international affair, because demand and supply of feedstock and biofuel are unequally distributed around the globe. In the past it appeared that domestic biofuel policies could have major unforeseen and unintended effects on the international bioenergy markets.<br/><br/>The influence of policy measures on the global bioenergy markets is not extensively investigated. Lamers et al. [2011] found that trade volumes were largely influenced by import duties, whereas trade routes were mainly driven by tariff preferences. In other words, it is found that there is some interaction between policies and patterns of international trade flows (in terms of volumes and routes) of biofuels and feedstock. However, the study performed by Lamers et al. [2011] did not explain the underlying mechanism. The aim of this research is to fill this knowledge gap. With this knowledge, decision making by policy makers may become better informed and aforementioned effects of policies may be reduced or even prevented.<br/><br/>The main research question addressed in this research is: Which mechanism can explain the effect of policies on emerging patterns in the international trade flows of liquid biofuels and feedstock? To answer this question, an agent-based model (ABM) of the international liquid biofuel markets is developed. If literature on international trade flows for bioenergy is reviewed, it appears that the models applied are usually general- or partial equilibrium models. Contrary to equilibrium models, ABM allows for heterogeneous actors with bounded rationality, the ability to learn and intrinsic behavioural traits. Above that, geographical aspects can be incorporated. It is hypothesized that these factors play an important role in international bioenergy trade. Therefore, this approach could be of added value to the current strand of literature in which equilibrium models are applied.<br/><br/>To limit the scope of this research, a case study is performed. In this case study a number of key players in the international biodiesel market are considered: the European Union, Indonesia and Malaysia. Since the take-off of the biodiesel industry (around the year 2000), the European Union has been one of the largest producers and consumers of biodiesel in the world. In addition, the European biodiesel market has been targeted as an export market for biodiesel and feedstock (palm oil) by Indonesia and Malaysia. In view of the case study, the focus of this research is on first-generation liquid biofuels.","Liquid biofuel; International Trade; Policy; Agent-Based Modelling; Bioenergy; Biodiesel; Palm oil; European Union; Indonesia; Malaysia; Vegetable oil; Oilseed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Although RES have much lower life-cycle emissions, they do not offer a continuous and fully predictable output like their fossil-fuelled counterparts. Energy storage is paramount in order to include the growing share of these intermittent sources into the grid and provide a reliable supply of energy. In 2016 a long term vision which involves the creation of an artificial island on the Dogger Bank in the North Sea was presented. The island would act as the central spill in an interconnected future economy fuelled by RES. Currently there are no competitive energy storage technologies under consideration that could contribute to this ‘energy hub’. In Europe pumped hydropower storage (PHS) represents over 90% of the grid-connected storage capacity and continues to be identified as the most cost-efficient energy storage technology available today and in the future. Unfortunately, conventional PHS is restricted to mountainous areas and the remaining potential (2291GWh) does not suffice to future demand (estimated at 3596GWh). The plans of developing a large wind farm via the construction of an island made it an attractive base to test the contribution and feasibility of a substitute to conventional PHS: inverse offshore pumped hydropower storage (IOPHS). It relies on the same principles as conventional PHS, only the process is inverted. When the wind farm generates a surplus of energy, the excess power is used to drive hydraulic turbines which pump the water out of the artificially created lake into the surrounding sea. Then when there is a higher demand for energy than the wind farm generates at that time, the sea water is allowed to flow back into the interior lake driving the same turbines. Although the idea of inverse offshore pumped hydropower storage has been around for years, it has never been constructed. The objective of this research is to identify the possible design alternatives and determine how the costs of an offshore pumped hydropower storage facility scale with the power and storage capacity, using existing construction technologies. The construction of the storage plant consists of four main elements: the dam, dredging works, turbines and the turbine housing...","Energy storage; Pumped hydropower storage; Offshore; Clay dam; Dredging; Francis turbines; Modular caissons; North Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55, 3.7"

To allow for such an operation, the barge consists of two half-hulls that are connected by hinges at the top and hydraulic cylinders at the bottom. Any forces that act at the interface between the half-hulls have to be transferred by the hinges and cylinders as a result. The aim of this thesis is to develop a method to determine the workability limits of split hopper barges in irregular seas. For this workability of the barge, the design limits of the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are assumed to be governing. A quasi-static model is formulated to determine the effects of roll, different types of cargo, opening the barge and discharging the cargo on the forces in the hinges and cylinders. The results of the quasi-static model are a set of governing load cases for the split hopper barge. From the quasi-static model, it is found that the forces of interest are the largest for a closed split hopper barge and that either a solid or a liquid cargo will yield the governing load case. To account for the dynamics in irregular sea conditions, a calculation method is proposed based on Ansys AQWA. Since AQWA is not able to account for liquid cargo motions, its effects are incorporated separately. Using WAMIT simulations, the influences of the liquid cargo to the added mass and stiffness of the barge are determined. Based on the WAMIT results the AQWA model is adjusted. Superimposing the results from the quasi-static and dynamic models, the maximum forces in the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are obtained for the governing load cases. By comparing the obtained maximum forces to the design forces, a conclusion on the workability limits of the split hopper barge is drawn. <br/>For the barge carrying a solid cargo only one resonance frequency is found, while, due to the liquid cargo motions, the barge with a liquid cargo has two resonance frequencies. As a result, a larger number of combinations of wave directions and periods yield considerable forces. For a 3-hour-extreme with a significant wave height of 3 meters, the governing hydraulic cylinder forces are found for a barge carrying a liquid cargo. The maximum resulting hinge forces however, are found for a barge carrying a solid cargo. Because the limits of the hinges are exceeded before the limits of the hydraulic cylinders, it is concluded that the workability limits of the split hopper barge in irregular waves are most limited, and therefore governing, for a barge carrying a solid cargo.","Workability; ANSYS; AQWA; WAMIT; Split hopper barge; Bureau Veritas; MATLAB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Gavin, Kenneth (mentor); Reinders, K.J. (mentor); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In March 2016, an addendum to the Dutch design guideline for micropiles, CUR 236, was published. This addendum elaborated on the ‘axial stiffness of micropiles’. The softening behaviour was here first mentioned as an aspect relevant for the axial stiffness of the micropiles. Due to the slender geometry of the micropiles, this further translates into axial capacity. Up to this moment very little research was done into this phenomenon and to be conservative a ‘best guess’ of 50% of the peak shear stress was made. The goal of this thesis is to have a more profound understanding about this (strain) softening behaviour, leading to the main research question: “How does strain softening manifest for micropiles under tensile loading?”. This strain softening behaviour can be further subdivided into the mobilisation from peak to residual shear stress and the reduction of the residual shear stress relative to the peak. Furthermore, the installation effects play a big role in the bearing capacity. Also, some thought is given to the large scale measurements of the behaviour. Three different paths are chosen to research the strain softening behaviour. Numerical modelling, small scale tests on sand and large scale pile tests are performed. In case of the numerical modelling, the large scale situation is simulated in the numerical software Plaxis, using an axisymmetric model and the hypoplastic constitutive model. Direct shear tests are assumed to represent a small part of the micropile, simulating the local softening behaviour. Numerous tests are performed varying relative density and top pressure to assess the local strain softening behaviour. Last, a method is developed to quantify the occurring ratio between peak and residual shear stress in-situ, extending on the current prescribed testing procedure (CUR 236, 2011). The only constitutive model available that describes the critical state soil behaviour for sand is the hypoplastic sand model. However, the combination of the tensile loading, softening implementation into the hypoplastic sand model in Plaxis and the deformations, induce considerable inaccuracies and physically impossible behaviour. This rejects further elaboration with this approach. The direct shear tests are performed on only sand, based on the results of Uesugi &amp; Kishida (1987), assuming a rough surface. In summary, a clear dependency on relative density and average confining pressure is observed. Varying from a reduction of approximately 30% for samples with the maximum possible density to 0% for a sand with a medium dense packing. Furthermore, the displacements necessary to mobilise from peak to residual shear stress show a uniform trend, independent of relative density or pressure. Quantitatively, the displacement ranges between 2 and 3 mm. In the large scale tests, due to unexpected, structural failure, the majority of the test results, unfortunately, were unusable. The pile test that did produce workable results, behaved as expected. It could be deduced that the used methodology works. The use of the hypoplastic constitutive model in Plaxis, does not give the expected results. It can thus be concluded that a fully coupled stress – strain analysis of the problem is unfortunately impossible. Concluding on the direct shear tests performed, the implementation in the CUR 236 addendum is too simplistic. In terms of ratio between peak and residual shear stress, a dependency based on relative density and average confining pressure should be included. In terms of displacement, the found displacement is larger. It should however be noted that the direct shear tests are only a simplification, approximating the actual situation. The performed large scale tests do show results in line with expectations and could be used in the future to assess the softening behaviour in-situ.","Micropiles; Softening","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Plaxis",""

The developments of Algorithms Aided Design (AAD) introduce a new form of Mass Customization: Computer Aided Consumer Design (CaCODE) which enables the laymen consumer to design their own products by letting them modify Computer Aided Design (CAD) models directly.

The monopile can provide a technically and financially feasible solution in shallow water environment due to its’ ability to support the wind generator ensuring at the same time the maximum production, since it can provide a foundation concept which ensures that the displacement and rotation thresholds set by the wind turbine manufacturers are being met. However, the trend nowadays is to develop wind farms in deeper water and to use wind turbines of higher capacity in order to increase the electricity production. This can be translated to a demand to increase the dimensions of the monopile, leading to complications in the transportation and installation procedures. This thesis project focuses on the possibility to enhance the structural and dynamic behavior of the monopile by filling it with sand. The effect of the sand-fill on the local buckling, on the static displacement, on the natural frequency and on the damping ratio of the structure have been investigated. In order to estimate the effect of sand-fill on local buckling, its’ effect on the ovalization of the monopile’s cross-section was estimated using the relevant European Standards and Dutch guidelines. The analysis has shown that for an increasing Youngs Modulus (E) of the sand-fill, the ovalization of the monopile at the critical cross-section decreases significantly, which in turn increases the bending resistance of the filled monopile. The effect of the sand-fill on the static displacement has been estimated by modeling the monopile in Plaxis 3D. The effect of sand-fill appears to be more significant for lower static loads. The effect of sand-fill on the fundamental natural frequency of the structure was estimated analytically by using the approximate normal modes obtained by the Euler Bernoulli beam equations and numerically, using the finite difference method to model the structure. The results of the analysis have shown that the total effect of the sand-fill on the natural frequency of the structure is negative, and sand-fill should be applied only in cases when a decrease of the natural frequency of an existing structure is required. The effect of sand-fill on the damping ratio of the structure has been performed through Free Vibration Tests which have been simulated in Plaxis 3D. The analysis has shown that the hysteretic behavior of the sand-fill leads to an increase of the damping ratio of the structure. The beneficial effect of the sand-fill on the damping ratio increases as the initial displacement applied at the top of the structure increases. Finally, a financial analysis was performed in order to identify the influence of sand-fill on the foundation cost. This additional cost sets the minimum threshold to be exceeded by the possible financial benefits achieved due to the higher damping ratio, in order that the sand-fill can be applied as a financially feasible solution.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","","","","","",""

Immersed tunnels have been utilizing the Gina-Omega gasket solution since the 1960s to prevent leakage from occurring. However, after almost 50 years of service life, leakages were detected in the immersion joints, which leads to an investigation into the source of the problem. It was uncovered that the bolts of the Gina gaskets had failed due to the immense load exerted by the sand above them. It was apparent that the load on the gaskets builds up due to an increase in soil stresses. A hypothesis was formed regarding this phenomenon; the sand inside the joint gap was exposed to almost 50 years of loading and unloading cycles from the expansion and contraction of the tunnel elements due to seasonal changes in temperature. This, in turn, densifies the sand inside the joint gap, which results in rising soil stresses. A 1:3 scaled physical model of the joint gap was designed and constructed to test the validity of this hypothesis. The model joint gap is equipped with a static lining on one end and an actuated lining on the other, hence the device is able to imitate the annual joint contraction and expansion cycle. A barrel containing sand is fixed onto the top of the model joint gap and acts as a reservoir of sand, allowing for more sand to enter the joint gap. The device is also equipped with 2 load cells and an LVDT, which allows for the measurement of horizontal soil stresses and vertical gasket displacement respectively. Two holes, with a flap covering each of them, are installed on the side of the model joint gap, which allows for a penetrometer test to be conducted on the joint gap sand. Multiple experiments with varying configurations and test conditions were performed. The results show that although the multiple loading and unloading cycles apply the same displacement for every cycle, the soil stresses increase with time. The Gina gasket show an apparent “walking effect,” where the gasket moves continually inwards. While a similar test conducted without the presence of sand fails to produce any “walking effect.” Penetrometer measurements show that the soil increases in density over time. The investigation is continued further with finite element analysis using the geotechnical modeling software PLAXIS. The joint gap part of the device is modeled in the program and is subjected to loading conditions and configuration similar to the physical model. Results of the simulation show indications of gasket “walking effect,” as well as stress-strain behavior similar to the experiment results. A comparison analysis between the results of the physical and finite element model is subsequently conducted. The finite element analysis allows for the calculation of the sand vertical stresses, which is previously unable to be measured during the experiment. It is observed that the vertical stresses rapidly escalates due to the high friction between the sand and the lining wall. A further analysis is conducted to estimate the force required to push back the displaced Gina gasket. Due to the good agreement between the results of the physical and finite element models, a modified version of the finite element model is used to predict the resulting pushing-back forces. Finally, the research is concluded with the validity of the previous-mentioned hypothesis. It was also confirmed that the soil undergoes densification, proven by the penetrometer readings as well as further validated by the stress-strain behavior of the sand. It is also proven that at higher horizontal strain, the increase in density, stresses, and the “waking effect” is more pronounced. The force analysis produces values of force needed to push back the Gina gasket. It was concluded that pushing back the entire Gina gasket upwards would require a high amount of force. However, affecting only 1/3 of the gasket bottom area would result in the gasket merely being pushed aside while failing to push the soil upwards.","Immersed tunnels; Immersion joints; Gina gasket seal; Physical modelling; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-13","","","","","",""

Recently, the company started using Virtual Reality headsets on their racing simulators. Currently, a consumer grade VR headset (Oculus Rift) is used in these type of racing simulators. However, it should preferably be a customised VR headset that is fitting for the simulators and is suitable to be used in an entertainment context. In short, the assignment is to integrate two products together: A racing helmet and a VR headset. Main requirements were that the VR Helmet should re-use components of a current VR Headset and should be one-size-fits-all. <br/><br/>The project started with an analysis phase. A contextual analysis showed that hygiene and durability are important aspects to take into account during the development of the VR Helmet. A technological analysis provided insights which components of a chosen VR headset were necessary to be reintegrated. In an ergonomic analysis, various aspects such as anthropometrics, thermal comfort, pressure sensitivity and maximum weight was researched. In a business analysis, a batch size and first cost price estimation for the VR Helmet was set. Finally, a product experience analysis led to the questions regarding the desired look, feel and use of the VR Helmet. Basically, the question was whether the VR Helmet should be a Racing helmet with VR or a VR headset with racing helmet characteristics. <br/><br/>This above mentioned question was answered during the conceptualisation phase. Two concepts were constructed in order to answer this question. The first concept stayed close to the look, feel and use of a racing helmet. The second concept was almost the opposite of the first concept regarding the look, feel and use. This concept was designed as a VR headset with racing helmet characteristics. Both concepts were detailed to such extent that it could be user tested. The user test showed that the first concept was preferred on various aspects, such as intended emotional response, matching the current simulators, (surprisingly) comfort and practicality. Therefore, concept 1 (Racing helmet with VR approach) was taken as a basis for the final design proposal. <br/><br/>A final design proposal was made (see pictures). This VR Helmet is designed to match and enhance the current experience of the VR simulators by mimicking the look, feel and use of a racing helmet. Like a real racing helmet, it has a visor which can be opened and closed. In this visor the VR components are situated which provide the VR experience. Besides displaying VR, it also has speakers integrated in the helmet for audio display. Moreover, this is one of the first VR Helmets which has a one-size-fits-all feature. By turning the knobs located at the back and top of the helmet, the VR Helmet can be adjusted and fixed on various head sizes. In order to guarantee a hygienic experience, the helmet has to be worn in combination with a balaclava. <br/>The final design proposal was prototyped and user evaluated. In this user evaluation, the VR Helmet was compared to the current solution: The Oculus Rift. Combined with a review on the product requirements, a full evaluation on the final concept was conducted. The final design proposal meets the requirements regarding comfort (one-size-fits-all), experience, hygiene and cost-price. However, aspects such as durability, the weight of the product, integration of the Oculus Rift (electronics) need to be researched further or improved. <br/><br/>In all, the final design proposal is a promising concept, but will need another full iteration before it will meet all the product requirements.","Virtual Reality; Helmet; Racing simulators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Recently even structural glass elements have been developed and the application of glass in structural elements is becoming more common. The ongoing development of new glass types and different production and processing methods resulted in the manufacturing of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass by AGC. Thin glass is mainly applied in the electronics industry, but the increased strength, optical properties, toughness, bending resistance and weather resistance make it a promising material for application in buildings. The Netherlands is the globe’s number two food exporter and more than half of the nation’s land area is used for agriculture and horticulture. Research on the optimisation of greenhouse designs is a hot topic in the Netherlands to maintain this leading position. The greenhouse industry provides an appropriate application for flat thin glass panels, because of the possibility to increase both light transmittance and structural performance. The goal of the research presented in this report is to determine the feasibility of the application of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass in greenhouse coverings. The research was divided into four topics that are relevant for greenhouse designs: building physics, structural properties, structural behaviour and economics. The building physics research was conducted in collaboration with the Greenhouse Technology team of the Wageningen University &amp; Research. The light transmittance results showed an increased hemispherical light transmittance for thin glass when compared to regular float glass. The investigation of the structural properties of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass was based on available literature and the material properties provided by the producer. For this research a characteristic bending tensile strength of 260 MPa has been assumed. However, further research is recommended for the determination of the accurate bending tensile strength and design impact strength of thin glass. The structural behaviour of a thin glass panel in a greenhouse covering was investigated by executing both numerical and experimental analyses. The numerical analysis of the reference system showed that it is necessary to stiffen the thin glass panel for flat application in a Venlo greenhouse system. Multiple variants were designed and studied by numerical and experimental analyses. The IGU panel turned out to be the most promising variant for future application of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass in greenhouse coverings. As a main outcome it was concluded that thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass has a better light transmittance, higher bending strength and increased impact strength than regular float glass. This leads to a higher crop yield and lower costs for transportation, construction, maintenance and insurance which makes thin glass an attractive alternative. At this moment, however, the material costs are very high and the decreased thickness and increased flexibility resulted in a lower stiffness. It is therefore not likely that a single layer of uncoated thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass will result in a feasible greenhouse covering design. Nevertheless, the use of thin chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass can result in an optimised greenhouse covering design when applied as an insulating (IGU) panel.","Thin Glass; Greenhouse; Greenhouse Covering; Leoflex; Light Transmittance; Chemically Strengthened Glass; Structural Design; DIANA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

In 2011, the benchmark was incorporated into the Drinking Water Act. As a result the benchmark switched from a voluntarily benchmark executed by the Association of Dutch water companies to a mandatory benchmark executed by the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate. In addition, the drinking water companies have to hand in an improvement plan 6 months after the benchmark publication. Based on interviews with benchmark coordinators of drinking water companies the influence of the inclusion of the benchmark into the Drinking Water Act on the improvement driven part of the benchmark is studied. For this purpose, the following four issues are discussed: changes experienced as a consequence of the shifting from a voluntarily to a mandatory benchmark, influence of mandatory character of the benchmark on the drivers, identified by de Goede et al. (2016), the role of the improvement plans and a new instrument to stimulate improvement.<br/><br/>The differences between the voluntarily and mandatory benchmark are identified: the benchmark switched from being only an improvement driven instrument to an instrument for accountability as well and the drinking water organizations lost control over the development of the benchmark. The influence of the mandatory character on the drivers for performance improvement have been determined: only the driver 'enhanced transparency' is (positively) influenced. In order for the improvement plans to be able to have a positive effect on the stimulation of improvement, a feedback system should be implemented and the publications of the benchmark and improvement plans have to be faster. The benchmark is still thought to be useful, although an adaptive benchmark could stimulate improvement again.","benchmarking; Dutch drinking water sector","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additional thesis",""

The high level of redundancy makes it an interesting object for research on mission-specific control allocation. A (spline-based) incremental control allocation approach is proposed to deal with nonlinear input functions and aerodynamic interaction between multiple control surfaces. Two control allocation modes to minimize drag are proposed and assessed in a general flight scenario. With both modes the average drag is reduced by about 6.5% relative to a standard control allocation scheme. Sensitivity analysis points out that one mode is vulnerable to the choice of initial parameters, whereas the other is primarily sensitive to the accuracy of the onboard model. Improvement of the ICE aerodynamic model is necessary to substantiate the true potential of mission-specific control allocation for next generation aircraft.","Control Allocation; Innovative Control Effectors; ICE; Incremental Control; Tailless Aircraft; Drag","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

Focusing on customer intimacy, KLM defines their purpose: Moving your world, by creating memorable experiences. In order to be successful towards customers, KLM has to start on employee level first, with the cabin crew to be more specific. For cabin crew, their journey start in the KLM crew center. The most important part of their preparation is the crew briefing. Here, they mainly discuss flight safety and information about the flight and passengers, while the main purpose of the briefing is team forming. In this magical moment crew walks in as 3 to 5 individuals and has to transform into a strong team with KLM-spirit. The current rooms are experienced as functional, instead of motivating, inspiring or empowering. So, there is a lack of support by the environment to form an optimal cabin crew team, and therefore no memorable on board performance is created for customers.<br/><br/>This thesis is divided in three main phases; Exploration, Creation and Finalization, adding an User Centered approach by implementing four design sprints. In the Exploration phase, insights were gathered by analyzing the current briefing situation, and by performing an internal and external analysis including research about the corporate vision and developments, a global trends analysis and comparison with similar briefing settings. All analysis during the Exploration formed the design vision:<br/><br/>Enhance the briefing experience and setting for the KLM crew center. The design should support the team forming and efficiency of the briefing process of EUR flight for KLM cabin crew. <br/><br/>Exploration is progressing gradually to the next phase Creation, since the design sprints involve an iterative process containing research, creation, tests and evaluation. To gain insights about the crew preferences, different aspects of the design and interaction vision were tested, namely connect, inspire, comfort, privacy, intuitiveness, openness and efficiency. To structure the insights of the user tests, an unique briefing journey was created and five interesting design challenges were defined. These challenges were the starting point for the ideation.<br/><br/>In the Finalization phase of the project, the design proposal was presented: the Blue<br/>Connect. The design is a meaningful piece of furniture placed in an inspiring environment, especially designed for the future KLM crew center as an innovative solution for the cabin crew briefing area. The driving force behind the design is that the setting supports the experience and efficiency of the briefing, and provides a moment of connecting; the Blue Connect enhances the transformation of individual crew members into a strong, focused and confident bonded team.<br/><br/>In the last part of the report, the design proposal is evaluated. The overall response was very positive and inspiring. All participants agreed that they would likely use the EUR design proposal. And finally, a cost estimation and some recommendations for further development of the design are presented as a final outcome of this thesis.","KLM; Briefing; Furniture; Design; Aviation; Cabin crew members","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Deloitte noticed a mismatch between the degree and pace of innovation in data dashboards and the needs of the end-users of the dashboard. Deloitte creates digital dashboard to communicate all kind of data and information to their clients. They develop the dashboards along with the trends while the clients does not adopt the innovations and do not use all provided functions and features. The aim of this project is to develop a way of data communication for 2025 that provides the users with insights and matches to their needs. <br/>A project of Deloitte is selected as case study. Deloitte and ActiZ, branch organization for caregivers, provide as strategic benchmark to the elderly healthcare sector. The benchmark is presented on a digital platform, ActiZ Benchmark Zorg. Members of ActiZ use the strategic benchmark to gain insights of their performance relative to other members. (Deloitte, 2017) <br/>The first step was to discover the current situation of data communication. A walkthrough, discussion with ActiZ and Deloitte and interviews with CEOs in the sector are the base of this first step. The walkthrough and discussions let to insights about the usability of the current dashboard. From the interviews the CEOs experience of the current situation is analyzed. The interviews focusing on the user experience and needs of the data communication. To get an image of data communication in 2025 a literature research is conducted. The research focuses on developments in an organization and in data communication. The developments in data communication can be divided in technology and communication developments. Combining the gained insights from user and future perspective a design goal is formulated; the design should stimulate and facilitate the CEOs to gain insight from the strategic benchmark and facilitate communication between the CEO, CFO and HR manager about benchmark findings to maintain the overview. <br/>Via iterations with paper prototyping and a final user test the concept is improved to match the design goal. The user tests gave clear understanding of their experience of Actiz Benchmark Zorg 2.0 and how to enrich the experience. The result of this project is ActiZ Benchmark Zorg 2.0, a digital dashboard for CEOs in the elderly care, providing the strategic benchmark in the elderly care. CEOs can make data driven decisions of organizational strategy and vision by gained insights from Actiz Benchmark Zorg 2.0. The simple and clear structure provides an effortless and seamless navigation experience, so the user feels in control. By only showing the main topics and the option to dive deeper in to the data the overview will be maintained. The CEO is not overwhelmed by an overload of information. A selection menu and the data visualization stimulates to dive deeper in the data when needed. Features like notifications for changes and warnings, chatbot as helpdesk and easily sharing insights with others, facilitate the CEO to gain insights with less effort.

Many corporates are therefore looking at opportunities to collaborate with startups, also called external venturing, and to capture their value. Although working with startups has many benefits and great opportunities for corporates, it is currently not part of Fokker Services’ innovation strategy, and therefore the objective of this study was to determine the first steps for Fokker Services to start with external venturing. However, Fokker Services is mainly active in the commercial aviation industry, and this industry differs from non-aviation industries in many ways. Therefore it has been decided that it was required first to determine how external venturing should be done in the (Dutch) aviation industry specifically. The answer to this question, which has also been the answer to the main research question, has been found in the formof a normative framework. This framework describes success factors and pitfalls for external venturing in the Dutch aviation industry and exists out of five different levels. These levels are found during the literature study and describe prerequisites to do external venturing in the right way. The normative framework has been the foundation on which the first steps for Fokker Service, to start with external venturing, relied on and has been presented in the form of an implementation plan. This plan describes four short-term stage, a mid-long term stage and a long-term stage with accompanying steps at the five levels relevant for external venturing. The normative framework is, in its turn, has been build based on a two-fold approach. First by translating key learnings from other organisations and external venturing experts about the execution of external venturing (combined with a literature study) into a list of success factors and pitfalls. Secondly by translating solutions to overcome industry specific startup challenges into success factors and pitfalls. The research strategy to answer the first part of this two-fold approach is chosen to be a literature study combined with a qualitative, multiple case study strategy. The research strategy to answer the second part of the two-fold approach has also been chosen to be a qualitative, multiple case study strategy. Unstructured interviews served as main data collection method for the case studies, and as a result, one of the most important solutions to overcome startup challenges is to grow and improve the Dutch aviation startup ecosystem. Another important solution is to clearly define the opportunities for entrepreneurs in the Dutch aviation industry. Both solutions aim at increasing the likelihood of entrepreneurs to enter the Dutch aviation industry. To overcome the remainder of the startup challenges, four external venturing ingredients have been found which should at least be present in each external venturing program aimed at the aviation industry. These four elements are business services, financing instruments, network and people connectivity and opportunities to use the corporate image. All these solutions have been translated into success factors for external venturing in theDutch aviation industry by saying that having a full-grown startup ecosystem, clearly defined opportunities and an external venturing program with at least containing the aforementioned four ingredients increases the chances on successful collaborations. Together with the success factors and pitfalls for external venturing in general, we now know how Fokker Services and other organisations in the Dutch aviation industry can start with external venturing in an effective way.","External venturing; Startups; Aviation; Dutch; Fokker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Hegen, G. H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The integration of the engine with the airframe is investigated in the German-Dutch Wind tunnels (DNW) using special scale engines called Turbofan Powered Simulators (TPS). The bookkeeping of thrust and drag must be clear. The TPS thrust is determined under static conditions in a calibration facility, and then subtracted in the wind tunnel test from the balance force of the aircraft model (airframe + TPS) to obtain the airframe drag including jet interference drag. A critical assumption valid for traditional turbofan engines is that the external flow does not affect the statically calibrated thrust. However, with the rise of more efficient engines with higher bypass ratio this may not be the case due to the close coupling between the engine flow and the wing. The objective of this Thesis is to identify the current limitations of the testing procedure as well as to produce scientific basis to deal with these limitations. This is achieved by means of a consistent thrust/drag bookkeeping combining numerical methods and a modified experimental setup.<br/><br/>External flow effects are identified by means of the analysis of theoretical models, the comparison with testing procedures undertaken in similar facilities, the review of standard bookkeeping techniques of full-scale turbofan engines and the analysis of previous test data. The change in thrust is quantified using a mathematical model integrated in an error propagation study by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The influence of the external flow and wing pressure field is further studied through a numerical analysis in RANS-SST for a very high bypass ratio TPS unit, and a Through-Flow Nacelle respectively. The latter configuration is also tested in the Low Speed Tunnel in DNW to investigate which instrumentation can be used to detect external flow effects in the future. In this case the velocity in the fan exhaust plane is measured with a hot wire and static pressure sensors are placed in the intake, exhaust and boattail.<br/><br/>The theoretical, numerical and experimental approach show that the external flow and wing pressure field change the conditions in the TPS exhaust with respect to static calibration. In the wind tunnel, the nozzle exhaust shear layer decreases in size as the difference in velocities between plume and free air is decreased, reducing the flow spreading rate and increasing the local pressure at the nozzle exit plane. The local Nozzle Pressure Ratio is reduced. This leads to flow suppression, the reduction of the fan mass flow and exhaust velocity. In addition, the scrubbing and boattail drag, currently bookkept as loss of thrust in the modified standard net thrust, are changed from static to wind tunnel conditions. These effects change the TPS thrust leading towards an improperly bookkeeping of the aircraft installation drag. The bias error produced by external flow effects is one order of magnitude higher than the random instrumentation error and should be corrected for, especially at low power settings. Differences decrease proportionally to the Fan Nozzle Pressure Ratio until chocked conditions are reached, where the freestream velocity has no influence in the TPS performance. <br/> <br/>A possible solution lies in the advanced derivation of thrust and drag. The current approach neglects the thrust contribution from the nozzle exhaust to infinite downstream. According to the definition of the Jones thrust, a better solution lies in the assumption that the flow is expanded from the exhaust to infinity downstream without any transfer of energy of momentum. The decrease in mass flow and velocity can be effectively captured by pressure taps located at the intake or fan plane. A linear correlation exists between both stations, that can be used for the bookkeeping of the TPS thrust in the wind tunnel according to additional calibration in the wind tunnel. The new bookkeeping method can also be used to correct for the decrease in local jet exhaust Mach number from design conditions, the parameter of interest in engine/airframe integration tests. <br/><br/>The research presents and solves the limitations of the new generation of turbofan engines by accounting for the local conditions at the TPS exhaust due to external flow effects. The new thrust/drag bookkeeping method leads to optimized configurations by improving the accuracy of engine/airframe integration tests.","Engine/Airframe Integration; Flow Suppression; TPS; TFN; Wind Tunnel; Boattail Drag; Thrust/Drag Bookkeeping; Hot Wire; DNW; German-Dutch Wind Tunnels; Turbofan Powered Simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The increasing share of renewables in power production is demanding conventional plants to take on additional tasks. It is estimated that the cyclical and unpredictable nature of renewables will create under- and over-capacity periods that the system will need to accommodate. Given their wider load range and faster load changes, combined cycles can complement renewables very well; therefore, energy industry is investing many resources to make them more flexible. <br/>Sloecentrale is a modern combined cycle thermal power plant located in Vlissingen area; its Heat Recovery Steam Generator is equipped with once-through technology, characterized by the absence of a drum and by a continuous flow path from the economizer to the superheater. When operating in once-through mode, the water flow in the line is adapted to the heat input in the evaporator, in order to guarantee a full evaporation and prevent liquid flowing into the superheater. Below a certain GT load (minimum load), the flue gas is not able to fully evaporate the water-steam mixture and the HRSG is switched to non once-through mode; in this mode, a small separator separates steam from water and send it to the superheater. Given the higher efficiency at part-load and the faster load changes in once-through mode, the goal is to extend the load range operating in once-through mode by a reduction of the minimum load. A steady-state Matlab model of the once-through evaporator has been developed, returning the flow distribution in the heat exchanger and other relevant quantities. The model is based on mass and energy conservations, and takes into account the local heat flux along each tube as well as the non-uniform phase separation occurring in the junctions. The inputs of the model (flue gas and water-steam flow properties) have been computed by simulating the plant operations by a Thermoflex thermodynamic model. Both the models have been validated against real process data from Sloecentrale. By an analysis of the flow distribution at minimum load, the main limitation to the once-through load range extension has been located. Finally, some potential solutions to overcome the limitations have been proposed and simulated, and their technical feasibility has been assessed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","","","","","",""

They offer simple but stylish bicycles with a focus on the urban area, for the consumer market. Recently they have linked their brand to the Food &amp; Beverages domain, and are keen to collaborate with businesses in this sector.The Dutch electric bicycle market has been growing rapidly in the last decade and is expected to continue to grow over the next decade. Since Union has the ambition to expand their portfolio, a new electric bicycle is a logical next step for them. The emerging trend of the food delivery market has been growing in the Netherlands as well, and an increasing number of food delivery companies are changing their mode of transportation from gasoline vehicles to electric bicycles. Union has realised that this combination of circumstances gives them a potential opportunity to combine the development of a new e-bike with an entrance into the food delivery e-bike market. Creating a product proposition only for the B2B food delivery market will not be profitable, in terms of sales volume, so Union would like to combine the product with its regular consumer sales. Accordingly, the research question for this project is ‘How can Union enter the food delivery e-bike market, with a product and commercial proposition that primarily serves the needs of food delivery companies, and secondly, is suitable for consumers as well?’Analysing the food delivery e-bike market has shown that (the few) competitors currently offer low quality bicycles for a relatively high price, which leaves room for improvements in terms of product, price and service. User research within both target markets has revealed several interesting overlapping problems, needs and desires, which are seen as key focus points. Generating creative ideas, based on these key focus points has resulted in a selection of proposed features and specifications, which are the starting point of the concept design.Ultimately, the design activities have led to the development of the Union DELI, an e-bike designed for food delivery companies. With a simple but robust design, integrated battery and mid-motor, it is optimal for daily intensive use and weight transportation. This in combination with the ‘connected’ e-bike service (a service that lets the client see and use relevant e-bike-data) food delivery companies can ensure an even better experience for their customers. The e-bike can be customised as desired through the use of modular lighting and transportation elements. The integrated lights can be replaced by one or two food boxes. This modular design makes the Union DELI also suitable for regular use. Client branding ensures that the e-bike represents visually the client’s brand. Repair and maintenance and financial services are all included in the lease construction of the DELI. The geometry and design appearance of the e-bike are based on user desires combined with Union’s brand positioning and portfolio. The DELI therefore fits well with the Union brand. Finally, recommendations for further research combined with a roadmap are presented to give an overview of the activities and next steps that should be taken to prepare for the launch of the DELI.","Product; Innovation; Service; Food delivery; e-bike; Strategy; Bicycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of extreme rainfall with 12% per degree Celsius increase (KNMI, 2015). Especially cities are vulnerable to flooding due to extreme rainfall because of the high urban density and paved surfaces (van Herk et al., 2011). Hence, municipalities face the challenge of developing a climate-proof urban area. However, due to decentralization municipalities face more responsibilities without enough spending capacity. For example rainwater, the municipality has a legal duty to take care of rainwater discharge but has to cooperate with water boards, citizens and other actors. Moreover, cooperation with other actors increases because of high costs for rainwater discharge through the sewage system (RIONED Foundation, 2016). This demands municipalities to look for smarter solutions. However, municipalities are still trying to find a way of coordinating and facilitating cooperation within their network of actors which could lead to shared climate-proof developments. The question remains how municipalities could deal with this challenge and coordinate the network of actors to ensure shared execution of measures. In literature this gap is indicated as the lack of knowledge on the governance role of municipalities to develop a climate-proof urban area (Crowe et al., 2016; Francesch-Huidobro et al. 2016; Marchand &amp; Ludwig, 2014). The research question is as follows: “To what extent is the current governance role of municipalities able to provide, direct and indirect, enough measures in both quality and quantity to ensure a climate-proof public area in dealing with extreme rainfall and how can it be improved?” By means of a literature study the role of municipalities in developing a climate-proof urban area is identified from a scientific perspective. Then, a practical perspective is presented on the position of the municipality of Delft within its network of actors, because Delft is a comparable mid-sized municipality. Furthermore, an additional in-depth case study of Delft is performed. This case study provides empirical evidence on a finished project coordinated by the municipality of Delft to develop a climate-proof public area. Subsequently the three analyses are presented in the synthesis to propose improvements for the municipality of Delft. Next, this synthesis is reviewed by experts. The results from the analyses show that the municipality of Delft is to some extend able to provide a climate-proof urban area. The analysed project was the first of its kind and thus more projects could be initiated to cover the whole municipality. The municipality ensured shared decision making and execution of measures by coordinating and facilitating the project as a meta-governor. Hence, this approach provides good potential to apply more often and ensure a climate-proof urban area. Furthermore, analysis show the municipality of Delft executes some climate-proof measures but this is not yet on a larger scale or in cooperation with other municipal departments or network actors. Lastly, maps with information on bottlenecks, opportunities or other climate related aspects are not up-to-date or lacking which could hamper effective climate-proof developments according to experts. To improve the ability of the municipality of Delft to develop a climate-proof urban area a proposal was presented. The recommendations were confirmed by experts to improve the ability of Delft. The use of area managers is valuable in Eindhoven, The Hague and Rotterdam in gathering local information to improve decision making and communicating the municipal message to the different 5 actors within an area. Also the municipality of Delft could invest more in data gathering and map making of bottlenecks and opportunities. If there is one overview from different municipal disciplines, synergies of plans can emerge, roads, sewage, park maintenance and private initiatives can be executed in one go. This lowers the costs for a plan but needs coordination and availability of data. Furthermore, the time horizon for maintenance of public space or projects could be extended to 1-10 years in order to identify opportunities and synergies earlier. Additionally, the organizational structure or way of working observed in other municipalities is a contributing aspect to be able to develop a climate proof urban area. Disciplines are incentivised to cooperate and develop integral plans because of the organizational structure and way of working. However, without a systems approach these recommendations could only have limited effect. As an example: when the maintenance of weeds in the streets is lacking behind one storm with extreme rainfall will still cause flooding. Which is an important aspect mentioned by experts that often the maintenance is often neglected. Further research should focus on more case studies and the application of meta-governance in the Netherlands. Also different kinds of projects could be valuable to analyse since the analysed project was a municipal project. The provincial or water board projects could have different outcomes. This could increase the body of knowledge and the applicability of meta-governance on different government levels. It is noted that meta-governance is a way of externally coordinate and facilitate developments. However, it is not yet studied what the internal structure has as an effect on the effectiveness of meta-governance. Also, more research should be focused on how the meta-governor can determine clear conditions and boundaries for urban development. These are needed for the new environmental act to clearly indicate how to comply private initiatives with the rules and regulations. Especially since the new act focuses more on private initiatives. Lastly, it is observed that the municipality as the meta-governor used a mixture of meta-governance techniques two, three and four. As most literature focusses on one technique it is recommended to research the effectiveness of the meta-governance techniques when these are combined including who will take this specific role or use a technique. Depending on the situation the roles can be taken up by different municipal actors and not necessarily the city-planner.","meta-governance; extreme rainfall; role of municipalities; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Morphodynamic models parameterize physical processes in order to relate the fluid motions (hydrodynamics) to the bed level changes (morphodynamics) over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Despite recovery of the beach profile being a slow process, accretion mechanisms in the swash zone are complex to represent by a numerical model due to the shallow, rapidly varying flows and high concentration gradients (Brocchini &amp; Baldock 2008). The swash zone on most beaches is readily accessible, but this accessibility does not translate into a broad knowledge of the underlying physical processes (Chardón-Maldonado et al. 2015). This research focused on assessing the representation of physical processes in the swash zone of intermediate-reflective beaches during erosive and accretive conditions in the non-hydrostatic version of the XBeach model (XBeach). This is a depth-averaged phase resolving model, mainly used for calculations of storm impact (hours-days) on sandy and gravel beaches. Based on conclusions in literature, relevant physical processes that contribute to accretion were determined. Using a simple planar beach bathymetry, the sediment transport formulations in XBeach and the individual influence of groundwater effects, bed slope effects, sediment response time and wave breaking induced turbulence were assessed. The results showed that for both accretive and erosive wave conditions, XBeach predicts erosion in the swash zone. Groundwater infiltration and wave breaking induced turbulence are likely to enhance onshore transport significantly Reniers et al. (2013), Turner &amp;Masselink (1998). To verify the findings of the planar beach modeling approach, in the second part of this thesis the morphodynamical predictions of XBeach were compared to the dataset collected during the Bardex II experiment. Bardex II was performed in 2012 in the Delta Flume in the Netherlands and the dataset contains observations of a series of experiments focusing on the effect of varying wave, sea level and beach groundwater conditions on a sandy beach (D50=0.42 mm)(Masselink et al. 2013). Stored data and published resultswere used for comparison with the morphodynamical prediction performance of XBeach. Two timescales have been analyzed, the total morphological response of the beach on a timescale of 100 minutes and the intra-swash sediment transport processes on a timescale of 10 seconds. Two experiments from the series have been reproduced. The first, experiment A4, has an almost stable, slightly erosivemorphological response throughout the swash zone. The second, experiment A8, shows accretion in the upper swash and a stable profile in the rest of the swash zone. XBeach erroneously (over)predicted erosion above the mean sea level (MSL) for both A4 and A8 conditions. This conclusion was related to the results of the intra-swash sediment transport assessment. The modeled velocity in both uprush and backwash were higher than the Bardex II measured velocity and XBeach extremely underpredicted uprush sediment concentrations suggesting that turbulence induced by the bore is not enough taken into account. Over-predicted backwash sediment concentrations for both accretive and erosive conditions suggested that groundwater infiltration was not strong enough. However, enhancing wave breaking induced turbulence and groundwater infiltration did not lead to an improvement of the predictions of sediment concentrations in the swash. The sediment transport formulations of XBeachwere developed using a long wave resolving (short wave averaging) model, andwidely validated and calibrated on field and experimental data (Soulsby 1997, van Rijn et al. 2007, Van Thiel De Vries 2009). Therefore, in the last part of this thesis two possible improvements of the two sediment formulations of XBeach (van Thiel-van Rijn and Soulsby-van Rijn) when applying them in a short wave resolving model are assessed using a 1D sediment transport model. The decomposition of the velocity signal in amean and a fluctuating part improved mainly the predictions using Soulsby-van Rijn where the separate calibration of turbulent kinetic energy resulted in better predictions for both transport formulations. This analysis was performed only at one point on the cross-shore domain (slightly above MSL). Although the results for this position were promising, comparison of modeled sediment transport with Bardex II observations at different positions throughout the upper and lower swash zone is needed to give a full validation of the proposed adaptations to the transport formulations.","Swash; XBeach; Morphodynamics; numerical modeling; Bardex II; Delta Flume; sediment transport modelling; sand; Nearshore morphology; Morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Comidas",""

Firstly, the luxury landscape is shifting from collecting tangible assets to pursuing exclusive tailor-made experiences. The second trend is the electrification and the use of batteries on superyachts. Due to the increase of emission restrictions, there is more interest towards battery-powered yachts.<br/><br/>During the Monaco Yacht Show of 2016, Feadship presented their answer to these trends: a unique multibody superyacht concept by the name of Choice. A multibody superyacht is a combination of multiple yachts, including at least one superyacht, and designed around positive involving interaction. In the case of Choice, this interaction enables a combination of three bodies, of which one solely propulsed by batteries, to sail long distances. By the means of interaction, the weight of the batteries are kept within reasonable amounts. Besides the previous features, the multibody creates significant more flexibility and possibilities for its use. On the contrary, sailing with three interacting bodies instead of a conventional yacht could use more energy.<br/><br/>At the moment of writing, there is no such multibody concept sailing the seas. Therefore this thesis analyses a range of multibody superyacht concepts by comparison of total energy consumption. To gain more understanding of the multibody superyacht usage, a fictive itinerary is designed. This also functions as a business case for the concept design boundaries and the energy consumption comparison. <br/><br/>Different multibody superyacht concepts are created within the boundaries of the design space. By splitting the design space into two parts, i.e. the multibody design space and single body design space, the process is kept comprehensible. All concepts have an equal overall functionality, measured by the available luxury area. The difference between the concepts is found in the way of distributing the area over the three bodies within each multibody concept. The battery propulsion could be fitted in either, or multiple, of the three bodies. Different possibilities concerning the location of the batteries are assessed too.<br/><br/>When designing the single bodies within the multibody concepts, a challenge arises. Due to the weight of the required batteries, the single bodies within the multibody are heavier than their conventional fuel powered counterparts. To compensate for this weight, the bodies size is increased, while maintaining the predefined functionality. Due to the size increase, more engine power is required. Consequently, the battery capacity should increase, resulting in more weight. This thesis proposes a design tool for the single body to solve this iterative process. If the designer provides information on the functionality and usage of a yacht, the design tool calculates the main dimensions of a single body concept. The functionality of a single body is predefined by six yacht types and functions as design tool input. Other input is derived from the business case. Through this input, the design tool generates single body solutions.<br/><br/>By combining the solutions of the multibody design space and single body design space, three multibody concepts are established. To compare the multibody superyacht concepts with the conventional way of yachting, a benchmark concept is created. The benchmark concept consists of two fuel powered bodies, with an equal amount of luxury area as the multibody concepts. These four concepts are then compared to each other on total energy consumption in the fictive itinerary. The comparison is based on equal activity time for the guests throughout all concepts.<br/><br/>All three multibody concept designs have a lower total energy consumption than the conventional benchmark. One of the multibody concepts saves up to 33.2% of energy compared to the benchmark. This reduction is mainly due to slow steaming of the largest body within the multibody. Note that the energy consumption reduction does not jeopardise the amount of activity time for the guests.<br","multibody; yacht; energy; energy consumption; battery; ship design; yacht design; concept design; design tool; operating profile","en","master thesis","","","","","","Confidential report - Only abstract available.","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In large braided rivers, river training is often required to protect the banks against erosion, to improve navigability and for land reclamation. Closing one of the channels is a promising option to achieve these goals. However, there is a lack of systematic research on channel closures and no guidelines for their use exist. In the few documented cases, the river reopened the closed branch by eroding a channel across the island that separated the channels. The goal of this study is to analyse the consequences of closure, find the variables that affect channel reopening and provide guidelines for channel closures. The problem is studied with a numerical Delft3D model. A simplified reference case is set up, with two branches separated by an island. It is based on typical reaches of large braided rivers. Initially, one of the channels is closed with a combination of a weir in the channel and a short embankment on the island. A bypass channel is eroded around the weir in the first weeks of the wet season. A sensitivity analysis of different physical properties is performed in order to determine how general the simplified case is. Quantitative results vary, but the qualitative morphological response to closure remains similar. The largest part of the study consists of analysing simulations with various interventions. Combinations of a weir in the channel and embankment on the island, multiple weirs, roughness elements, vegetation and partial closures with bandals are tested in different positions along the channel. Analysis is extended by including simulations with higher water levels, four additional geometries and some longer-term simulations. Finally, aggregated results are analysed to find connections between variables. Channel reopening due to formation of channels on the island is the main cause of reduction in closure effectiveness. Bypass channels of varied depth form around the intervention in most cases. Channels across the island mostly occur when longer embankments are used. Their extent is less predictable and increases in time, so they should be avoided. The type of channel on the island that will most likely develop can be predicted from the initial hydrodynamic conditions after closure. Correlation between erosion of channels on the island and the initial hydrodynamic conditions is found. The water level gradient is the most important parameter that determines the location and degree of channel erosion. Water depth on the island plays a role when water levels are relatively low. Higher water levels cause more erosion, which can be mostly prevented with the use of submerged weirs. Flow patterns on the island determine the exact position of the eroded channels and directly contribute to erosion. Sediment supply to the newly formed channels reduces their growth. Deposition in the closed branch improves conditions over time, especially with interventions that do not block the channel fully. Length and width of the island play a role in the extent of erosion on the island, whereas channel and bifurcation asymmetry mostly do not. The best overall solution is found to be a combination of a weir with a long embankment or roughness elements. Further details, such as position of the interventions and weir crest height, depend on goals of closure and water levels in the system.","braided rivers; river training; river morphodynamics; Delft3D; channel closure; erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Until recently, the design of such systems was done according to design principles such as rotational symmetry as it simplifies the theory, reduces technological risks, manufacturing costs and cuts down assembly, integration and testing efforts.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the ever-growing need to develop more compact and lightweight payloads with enhanced performance often forces designers to adopt tilted off-axis configurations which break the rotational symmetry of the system.

The solution to this problem is to abandon the conventional approach and adopt a new design paradigmbased on the use of non-rotationally symmetric surfaces, also known as freeform optics.<br/><br/>Most of the state-of-the-art methods used for the design of conventional optical payloads are not entirely suitable for freeform optics because: first of all, they were developed on the basis of rotational symmetry (which is no longer applicable) and secondly, because they do not cope well with the large amount of additional degrees of freedom that freeform optics usually entails.

Many kitchen appliances are being connected to the Internet to facilitate `smart-cooking'. The appliances are becoming cordless too, i.e., they are being powered by the inductive power sources which are integrated into the kitchen counter-tops. The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) has proposed standards for smart-cooking in cordless kitchens by enabling communication using the near field communication (NFC) protocol between the appliance and the power transmitter. In order to keep the appliances safe as well as reduce the cost of the appliances, it is required that the NFC channel should be exploited to enable Internet connectivity in the appliances. However, due to practical constraints, the NFC channel is time-slotted. Furthermore, this NFC channel has low data rates and high latencies. These constraints make it highly challenging to enable Internet connectivity for these resource-constrained cooking appliances for IoT applications.<br/><br/>This thesis explores different ways of providing Internet connectivity to the cordless kitchen appliances using the time-slotted NFC channel. Two architectures are proposed based on this method, namely the Proxy and the Bridge architectures. In the proxy architecture, the cordless appliances implement only the application layer and tunnel the application data through the NFC channel which will then be used by the power source to create TCP/IP packets for the appliance. In the bridge architecture, the appliances implement all the layers of the TCP/IP network stack. All the TCP/IP traffic is sent through the NFC channel and the power source acts as an intermediate hop. These architectures are evaluated in detail to determine the best-suited architecture. The thesis concludes that the bridge architecture, although heavy on the appliances, truly creates an IoT-enabled appliance, and therefore adopts it.<br/><br/>While it is proposed to send the complete TCP/IP packets to go over the NFC<br/>channel, the impact on the performance of the protocols needs to be investigated, specifically the TCP as it is the most used protocol for IoT applications. The performance of the TCP will be affected due to several reasons: (a) the time-slotted NFC channel; (b) low data rates on the NFC; (c) delays in accessing the NFC channel, and (d) no control over the network stack of the other TCP end-point. Furthermore, the behavior of the TCP in such resource-constrained channels aggravate the problems as spurious retransmissions get triggered. This work presents important challenges that need to be solved in order to enable the TCP to work smoothly in the time-slotted NFC channels. Two major performance problems that occur in such an environment are identified, viz., spurious retransmissions and packet drops at the NFC interface. The existence of the problems are verified with an experimental setup of the cordless kitchen and solutions are presented to these challenges: (a) determine the optimal retransmission timeout and the heuristic, and (b) avoid packet drops due to small inter-packet delay on the NFC channel. Next, a detailed parametric analysis of the other TCP parameters such as contention window size and maximum segment size of the TCP packets is performed.<br/><br/>From the evaluation, it is found that the proposed solutions can almost completely eliminate spurious retransmissions. With these solutions up to 38% reduction in the system latency is achieved at an NFC bit rate of 11.2 kbps and up to 53% at 24 kbps in the time-slotted mode. By implementing these solutions and choosing the right parameter values for the TCP, it is possible to seamlessly adapt and use the TCP for the time-slotted and resource-constrained NFC channel, and enable a truly IoT-based cooking experience for the smart cordless kitchens.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-09","","","","","",""

One of the procedures that is performed during vitreoretinal surgery is Epiretinal Membrane (ERM) Peeling , during which the surgeon has to peel a membrane of the retina without damaging the retina. Robotic membrane peeling can greatly improve clinical outcome because of increased accuracy, tremor reduction and little fatigue effects. However, depth perception remains a problem, because the surgeon is looking at the procedure from directly above through a microscope, therefore creating a 2-D vision. The topic of this study is a tele-operated robotic system that is specialized in vitreoretinal surgery. The PRECEYES surgical system is equipped with an OCT -sensor that can estimate how far away the tip is from the retina, but not accurately enough for traditional 'forbidden region' assistance. This study aims to design and evaluate a proof-of-concept for haptic support during robot-assisted vitreoretinal surgery, by means of an artificial damping-field on the master device. The main contributions of this study were 1) to create a simulation environment for robot-assisted vitreoretinal surgery; 2) to design and implement a damping field on this simulator; and 3) to perform a human-in-the-loop experiment to compare unassisted control behaviour to assisted control behaviour <br/> To study the effect of the damping field, a simulation of the procedure was created. A physical haptic master device controls a virtual slave in a simulated environment. The participants (n=16) were asked to move the instrument towards the retina, and then gently move it through a ring on the surface of the retina. This task forced the participant to make a peeling motion that is typical for ERM peeling. The experiment had 4 conditions: a small or a large target, with the damping field switched on or off. Each of the 16 participants had to perform 10 successful runs per condition. A retina puncture resulted in a failure and is not counted as a successful run. Results showed that for the small target, the average number of punctures per participant decreased from 2.4 to 0.9 when the damping field was enabled. The average completion time was comparable for both small target conditions, and likewise for the large target conditions. It was observed that participants decreased their velocity at the same distance of the retina for multiple runs when the damping field was active, which indicates that the participants were able to estimate the distance to the retina using the damping field. Furthermore, the damping field enabled the participants to employ a larger safety margin (distance between the instrument and the retina) between the instrument and the retina. For the experimental conditions studied, the damping field decreased the amount of punctures without affecting the completion time. Improvements to the damping field, such as an exponential increase of the damping coefficient and moving the starting point closer to the retina could increase the performance.<br","Vitreoretinal Surgery; Medical Robotics; Haptic Assistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-12","","","","","",""

On the other hand, it uses existent traditional parametric CF models to predict acceleration when no similar situations are found in the training dataset. This formulation guarantees a complete and continues model and deals with the challenges of new available types of dataset in the transport field: noisy and incomplete yet with large amount of data.

The other main innovation of this thesis is that variables rarely included in any CF model such as the status and the distance of drivers to the traffic light are also analyzed. Results show that the GPR model formulation is robust as the model performs better than OVM alone according to the main KPI, but still collisions occasionally occur.

Exact subsystem performance remains unknown. Propeller performance is estimated to size the aircraft propulsion. This thesis explores the consequences on the aircraft’s maximumtake-off mass if the propeller estimation is removed in favor of a higher fidelity design approach. The influence is determined by implementing an optimization routine whichminimizes aircraft maximum take-off mass by adjusting the propeller design. A rapid conceptual design tool is used to establish the interdependence between propeller and aircraft: ‘The Aircraft Design Initiator’. This tool is able to quickly conceive realistic aircraft designs to investigate the effect of new technologies and aircraft configurations. The Initiator is employed to create a design objective. This objective contains the information needed to achieve an optimumbetween propeller aerodynamic efficiency and its implication on the mass of the propulsion unit. These two factors determine the fuel required for the mission, as well as the mass of the propeller engine combination. In turn, these masses impact the maximum take-off mass of the aircraft. To establish a propeller design, a set of tools is developed. Aerodynamic performance is calculated from blade element momentum theory. Mass estimation is performed by a class II sizing approach. A limited structural tool is used to size the propeller blade root. Propeller optimization is performed with two strategies: a gradient descent optimization and a genetic algorithm. It is concluded that the propeller design space features a lot of local minima and is poorly suited for gradient based optimization. Genetic optimization is better suited for propeller design. This strategy results in certain conclusions regarding propeller design influences on the aircraft’smaximumtake-off mass. The influence of the propeller on the maximumtake-off mass is determined to be less than 1% compared to initial performance estimations. The applicability to conceptual aircraft design is therefore limited. However, the results do clearly show the influence of the propeller design parameters on the aircraft’s maximum take-off mass.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

After a section of the well has been drilled, a steel casing (or liner) is inserted into the hole preventing the collapse of the hole. The next well section has a smaller diameter as it’s casing must pass through the previously installed casing. This process leads to a stepwise reduction of the well diameter which, especially in deep or complicated wells, restricts the maximum production rate of oil and gas.<br/><br/>Mono-diameter technology utilizes casings which are plastically deformed after they have been placed in the well. This plastic deformation is done by pulling a conically shaped tool, known as the cone, through the newly installed casing. The plastic deformation increases the diameter of the new casing to (nearly) the same as that of the previous casing, therefore the well diameter no longer decreases with every new section.<br/><br/>The expansion requires a force in the order of 1000-2500[kN]. The work done by this force leads to high local heat generation due to friction and plastic deformation. This heat, poses a risk for the expansion process as the lubricant (RPSLF) decomposes above 250[C]. Decomposition of the lubricant leads to an increase of the friction, inducing more heat release and further decomposition of the lubricant. The expansion force may then exceed the pulling capacity of the drill rig or strength of the drill string, leaving the cone stuck in the well.<br/><br/>Previous research provides the distribution of pressure on the contact surface of the cone, the strain distribution inside the liner and the temperature dependent friction coefficient of the lubricant, by combining these the frictional heat is calculated. Heat generation from plastic deformation is a complex phenomenon<br/>especially at low strain (-rates). The Taylor-Quinney coefficient defines the ratio between the work done on a material and the heat generated. A strain-dependent model for the Taylor-Quinney coefficient, developed by Zehnder, is used to determine the heat release from plastic deformation.<br/><br/>A numerical heat transfer model is built in Matlab, based on the finite volume method. The model uses a mesh based on skewed quadrilateral cells. Numerical stability of the model is verified for the cell size, time step and time integration method. Movement of the cone and the plastic deformation of the casing are modeled by taking a reference frame fixed relative to the motion of the cone and adding a ”convective” term inside the liner. Heat transfer phenomena at all boundaries are investigated using thermal resistance models.<br/><br/>A series of experiments is executed to verify the numerical model. The <br/> experiments consist of full-scale expansion test using a cone equipped with 30 thermocouples placed just below the contact surface. Additionally also the temperature of the liner, expansion speed and expansion force are measured and recorded.<br/><br/>Comparison of the experimental and numerical results leads to the observation that the pressure profile determined in previous work is likely valid at the first onset of expansion. Over time, the forming of a lubricant film however leads to the re-distribution of roughly 20% of the force from the rear of the cone to the front. When the pressure profile is corrected for this effect; the temperatures inside the cone, temperature of the liner, expansion force and overall heat balance show a good match between the numerical and experimental results with an error of around 5%.<br/><br/>From the heat balance based on the experimental results, it follows that between 54% - 60% of the work done on the system is converted into heat. As all work done in the form of friction is converted into heat the remaining energy must be lost in the work done to plastically deform the casing, this provides indirect evidence for the validity of the Zehndermodel.<br/><br/>The validated numerical model is used to simulate a reference case field expansion, the maximum contact temperature here is 164.4[C]. This value is well below the lubricant decomposition temperature of 250[C], which leads to the conclusion that the process is safe and the expansion speed could even be increased from a thermal point of view.<br","mono-diameter; Plastic deformation; Finite Volume Methods; Friction; wells; lubrication; numerical methods; expandable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","","","","","",""

(mentor); Molin, E.J.E. (mentor); Santoni De Sio, F. (mentor); van der Waard, J (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Automated driving systems (ADS) can improve traffic safety, improve accessibility and reduce environmental impact (Shladover, 2016). On the contrary, on May 7th 2016, a fatal accident with a Tesla on autopilot in U.S. Florida was a harsh reminder that the technology is still in its testing phase (Greenemeier, 2016). In complex technical systems like ADS technical failure may occur, which forms a serious threat to human well-being. Moreover, studies have shown that citizens are very concerned about deliberate misuse of ADS (Kyriakidis, Happee, &amp; De Winter, 2015), e.g. people purposely abusing ADS to cause damage or even hurt someone. Therefore, according to many experts, the implementation of ADS does not only entail technical issues but also normative issues. To bridge the gap between technical- and normative issues, responsible innovation can be applied (Santoni de Sio, 2016). Friedman et. al. (2006) propose value-sensitive design to achieve responsible innovation via technical-, empirical- and conceptual research. As following from responsible innovation and value-sensitive design and in particular its focus on empirical research as one of its necessary elements, in this research an effort is made to use empirical research methods to provide more insights in normative issues of automated driving systems (ADS). The focus lies on social acceptance, particularly with respect to traffic safety. Also accessibility, environmental impact and heterogeneity among citizens will be analysed. Social acceptance is defined as “a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit” (Fish, 2014, page 1). The following questions will be answered in this research: What is the social acceptance of automated driving systems from the perspective of safety, accessibility and environmental impact and what is the corresponding heterogeneity? 1. What percentage of citizens thinks automated driving systems are socially accepted? 2. How is the social acceptance influenced by safety, accessibility and environmental impact? 3. Are traffic fatalities caused by automated vehicles valued differently than current traffic fatalities? 4. Is there heterogeneity in the social acceptance among citizens? A survey is chosen as research method since it is a relatively inexpensive, flexible method to achieve extensive information about characteristics of a population. After an extensive theoretical analysis, seven attributes were identified that possibly influence the social acceptance: level of automation, road exemption, travel time, emissions, human error fatalities, technical failure fatalities and deliberate misuse fatalities. After the experiment was fine-tuned by a pilot study, it was held among a representative sample of 510 Dutch adults during the spring of 2017. The respondents had to state if they were in favour or against ADS for each of the twelve hypothetical futures that were presented to them. In these hypothetical futures, the attributes were systematically varied and described as a change to the current situation. Using a MNL RUM model, the results show that 63% of all citizens prefer ADS over the current system. It is therefore concluded that citizens have a high social acceptance and thus are rather positive towards ADS. Also, citizens prefer a system where human drivers are still in control and can intervene in case necessary. Next, it is concluded that the social acceptance is mostly influenced by fatalities caused by automated vehicles (AVs), while travel time is the least important attribute. However, the differences in influence of the attributes were not substantial. Safety, accessibility and environmental impact are all important for the social acceptance. Nevertheless, technical failure fatalities weigh as much as 4 human error fatalities. For deliberate misuse fatalities this is a factor 5.5. Although these relations coincide with literature, the magnitude is larger than expected. It implies that ADS have to be very safe in order to reach social acceptance. Since AVs are still ‘learning’ how to drive, this might cause problems for current and future experiments. A latent class choice model is estimated to answer the final research question. Results show that large heterogeneity exists among citizens in the social acceptance. Citizens can be segmented into three classes (% of citizens): automated driving enthusiasts (32%), central mass (52%) and risk-averse class (16%). Contradictory to average citizens, automated driving enthusiasts prefer high automation levels. Even so, they still weigh fatalities caused by AVs as much as 3 human error fatalities on average. The central mass shows similar results to the results of the MNL model estimated on the full sample. The risk-averse class has a strong dislike for fatalities caused by AVs. This class weighs technical failure fatalities (deliberate misuse fatalities) as much as 5.5 (10) human error fatalities. In conclusion, primarily two discrepancies are identified that are critical for the implementation of ADS: 1) High social acceptance versus strong dislike for fatalities caused by AVs; 2) Citizens who are enthusiastic about ADS versus citizens who are risk-averse. They lead to the following recommendations: The social acceptance for ADS is high, so it is recommended for policy makers to have a positive and active approach towards ADS. By conducting experiments for professional users, safety risks can be minimalized while a learning curve is ensured. Also technology producers and policy makers should intensify research into cooperate driving. According to experts, ADS and cooperate driving are inseparable (Shladover, 2016), but globally the research into cooperate driving is lacking (Roland Berger, 2017). Since cooperate driving can lead to an increased risk of deliberate misuse, it is deemed critical for the implementation of ADS. Next, policy makers and especially the RDW should review the licensing of AVs. Currently, hardly any restrictions are in place for the licensing of AVs, which can cause dangerous situations on public roads. Finally, information campaigns can help to make citizens aware of the risks and benefits of ADS.","automated driving systems; social acceptance; normative issues","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Non-conventional sources of wastewater are being considered as a solution for this problem, since fresh water sources will not be sufficient to satisfy the world’s water demand in the following years. Extensive research is being done on different wastewater treatment technologies and methodologies, and lately, reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration has caught more attention as a solution for reclaiming and reusing wastewater. Nevertheless, the biggest problem RO membranes face is fouling, which increases energy consumption, and therefore, costs. Organic/particulate fouling affects the mass transfer of an RO membrane, but it can also contribute to biofouling, worsening the mass transfer and causing pressure drop on the RO system. For this study, a RO crossflow cell was used in order to investigate the effect of crossflow reversal on particulate fouling removal by testing two different feed spacers: (a) 1.25-mm high cavity spacer and (b) 0.71-mm high zigzag spacer. The experiments were carried out with an average crossflow velocity of 0.36 m/s, an average permeate flux of 20 L/m2 hr (LMH), an average feed electroconductivity (EC) of 14.90 mS/cm, and a feed temperature in the range of 21-25 C. Four runs were done, each with an average runtime of 1050 minutes. Two runs tested the cavity spacer, one with a crossflow reversal done at minute 806, and the other run with a crossflow reversal done twice every working day. The last two runs follow the same methodology but using the zigzag spacer. Each run used a new membrane and spacer. The mass transfer was graphed as a Mass Transfer Coefficient (MTC), and its development with time was analysed for identifying fouling, as well as particulate fouling when applying the crossflow reversal method. Crossflow reversal proved to be a reliable method for removing organic/particulate fouling. The cavity spacer caused a more severe organic/particulate fouling, but allowed it to be removed by crossflow reversal. The cavity spacer also proved to be less energy-consuming if applied to a full-scale RO facility. On the other hand, the zigzag showed to have a better effect on flow mixing and concentration polarization disruption inside the feed channel, thus keeping a higher mass transfer for a longer period of time. A more frequent crossflow reversal showed was not more efficient in removing organic/particulate fouling.","RO; Reverse Osmosis; membranes; crossflow reversal; particulate fouling; organic fouling; membrane fouling; feed spacer; cavity spacer; zigzag spacer; spacer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These queues can spill back to the main road network, where through traffic is driving as well: this through traffic will be hindered by the congestion, while those travellers don’t have the event venue as their destination. To prevent or at least reduce this unnecessary hindrance caused by car traffic at events, this Master thesis has researched control methodologies to optimise advice that is given to individual travellers using in-car systems. In individual traffic management (ITM), the event visitors will receive advice for their route and departure time choice. ITM can be used to optimise the decisions of the event visitors, to prevent queue spillback and other traffic issues at events. In this thesis, the design trade-offs for an ITM controller are identified: these trade-offs determine the actual design of an ITM controller aimed specifically at car traffic around large-scale events. Conceptually, the controller design is composed of a one-shot prediction model and mathematical optimisations of the individual route and departure time advice. These optimisations target a constrained system optimal traffic state in the network. Simulations of the designed controller show that ITM has potential to alleviate the congestion (and spillback) hindrance at large-scale events, by distributing event visitors over alternative routes and departure times. The benefits found in the simulations advocate the use of ITM at an event (or event-like conditions) in practice. Therefore, the application of the ITM controller design in practice is also discussed in this research. The discussion identifies the need to develop a (software) tool that is able to execute the controller’s actions in an offline or real-time manner. Furthermore, the possible barriers and opportunities for the implementation of ITM in the current and future traffic system are assessed.","Traffic Management; Events; Controller; Optimisation; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IoT systems exist in different ways, ranging from industrial applications to user focused systems. A specific subset of a user-focused IoT system is found as Smart Home environments. At Smart Homes, themultiple Smart Objects or Smart Devices are working together, frequently based on sensor input, to increase the comfort and user experience of the home inhabitant(s) and guest(s). Smart Objects can have automated tasks, home security enabling functions or efficiency improving functionality. Apart from great applications of Smart Home devices, threats from a cyber security perspective are present: cyber risks arise due to a variety of threats on such IoT systems. We show that in the development of new Smart Home products or systems, vendors fail to meet requirements for security and privacy are not met. Comparing the current state of the market, the four most used Smart Home ecosystems (Samsung Smartthings, Apple Homekit, Amazon Echo and IFTTT) are surveyed based on three key focus areas: 1. The regulatory compliance of the systems according to the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 2. The commercial threats due to data profiling. 3. The risk of data leaks due to insufficient security. This analysis results in four key observations: 1. Security- and Privacy-By-Design is usually not in place due to the fact that the focus lies on launching a product as soon as possible, e.g. due to market competition; 2. Vendors process (meta)data on the vendors locations resulting in data profiling, which can compromise user privacy; 3. Smart Home ecosystems are not ready for the GDPR; 4. A trade off between privacy, security and utility usually results to the detriment of the first two and favors the latter. We propose a new design for a Smart Home ecosystem. In this design, the focus lies at the privacy of the end-user. We design a network for device-fitting encrypted communication between Smart Devices and User Devices and the Privacy Enforcing Arbiter (or Peter). Peter functions like a hub in the network, managing among others all traffic, user privileges and key distribution. With Peter, the centralized cloud party (vendor) for data storage and data analysis is replaced with a decentralized personal storage and computation entity at home. With our network design, we facilitate the use of IoT devices in home in a privacy-friendly way. Within the network, devices are authenticated using PhysicallyUnclonable Function technology and users are authenticated with a Zero Knowledge Proof.

Intentional controlled islanding constitutes the final resort to rescue the system from a blackout by separating the network into islands in a controlled manner. Various post-separation control action such as generation rejection and load shedding have to be considered in order to restore the active power balance in the created islands.<br/>The transient stability of the constructed islands can be enhanced by identifying and grouping together the coherent generators of the power system. This can be achieved by representing the electrical network as an undirected graph and performing constrained graph partitioning with respect to the generator nodes.<br/>If the demand is higher than the active power produced, the frequency of the formed island starts declining. To deal with this problem and keep the frequency within acceptable limits, it often becomes necessary to curtail a proportion of the load. An advanced underfrequency load shedding scheme can dynamically adjust the shedding steps based on accurate power deficiency estimation and thus minimize the total load shed.<br/>In this thesis, the coherent generator groups are identified for several power systems. Then constrained graph partitioning is used to split these networks into islands, while forcing the coherent generators to remain in the same island. For this step, three different algorithms performing constrained clustering are implemented in Matlab and compared for two different study cases. Moreover, an advanced underfrequency load shedding scheme is applied on various constructed islands by utilizing PowerFactory and Python. Its objective is to minimize the load shedding amount, while keeping the frequency within the predefined limits. The amount of load that needs to be curtailed is estimated based on the frequency gradient of the generators in the island with an excess in power demand.","Intentional Controlled Islanding; Constrained Graph Clustering; Coherency; Underfrequency Load Shedding; Power Imbalance Estimation; Matlab; PowerFactory; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Diamond is arguably the best electrode material for its robustness, wide potential window, very low background current, biocompatibility and self-cleaning features. <br/>Nowadays, there is a new trend leading to electrodes getting smaller. One of the current challenges in the development of diamond micro-electrodes is to increase the sensitivity of the diamond electrode, while the electrode’s dimensions decrease. <br/>An interesting biomolecule to detect is glucose. 2.8% of the world population suffers from diabetes, these people need to measure their blood sugar level and manage this level by dispensing insulin in their body when needed. A glucose sensor is used to determine the amount of glucose in the blood. Boron-doped diamond (BDD) is an interesting material for the non-enzymatic detection of glucose.<br/>In this thesis project, study has been done to the nanostructuring and functionalisation effects on the performance of sensing glucose by using diamond electrodes. Measurements have been done with different types of electrodes: bare BDD, acid cleaned BDD, BDD functionalised with gold nanoparticles, BDD with a nanowire surface structure, and BDD with a nanowire surface structure and gold nanoparticles on top. It was found possible to detect glucose with three of these samples: bare BDD, BDD with gold nanoparticles, and the nanostructured BDD functionalised with the gold nanoparticles. The other two electrode types did not give any reduction/oxidation peaks, which is attributed to the oxygenated surface resulting from their fabrication processes. The three glucose-detecting electrodes showed linear behaviour in a range of 1-10 $mM$, which is in line with the detection range of glucose in human blood. The sensitivities achieved with bare BDD, BDD with gold nanoparticles, and the nanostructured BDD functionalised with the gold nanoparticles are 0.022, 0.429, and 0.136 mA/mMcm^{2}, respectively. The addition of gold particles improves the sensitivity for glucose substantially and works like an electrocatalyst. Making use of electrocatalysts is an interesting and useful functionalisation for direct non-enzymatic glucose sensing, because sensing glucose with bare BDD is a kinetically very slow process. Results of such high sensitivities for BDD with gold nanoparticles were not published in literature yet, so this is a promising achievement that asks for continuation of research in this field.","diamond; BDD; electrodes; sensing; glucose","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

This involves assessing multiple variables, and their underlying relations. Infrastructure systems can perform multiple functions, have various connecting interfaces, and are mostly situated in a dynamically changing environment. Therefore, intervention decisions are subjected to dynamic complexity, and uncertainty. However, asset managers predominantly make large intervention decisions based on decision support methods of a static nature, which provide insufficient insight in the dynamic complexity, and uncertainty, of future developments. Since infrastructures are the backbones of local economies, a decision support method able to incorporate all relevant complexity, and uncertainties, is inadmissible for infrastructure asset management. <br/><br/>This study aims at improving large intervention decisions, by assessing dynamic complexity, and uncertainty, with multivariate simulation approaches as the exploratory system dynamics modelling and analysis approach (ESDMA), and adapting strategies for large intervention decisions with the adaptation pathways approach.

(mentor); Akkerman, I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Two important performance parameters of a ship are fuel consumption and motions in a seaway. Besides a well-designed hull, several appendages can be used to increase the performance. One of these is a resistance reducing fixed foil behind the transom of the ship. This wing has the potential to create large lift forces near the aft of the ship, thereby changing the resistance and dynamic position of the vessel. <br/>In this thesis an algorithm is designed that controls the pitch angle and thus lift of this foil. The goal is to investigate the potential of such a dynamic foil for further reduction of (added) resistance and ship motions. The resistance reduction is investigated by creating thrust on the foil trough an oscillating foil principle (i.e. vertically moving the foil to create propulsion). The research is done with the use of the FINE/Marine CFD package. A model from the AMECRC OPV series is used for analysis, in combination with a foil optimized in earlier research.<br/>From the literature review can be concluded that a dynamic, rotating foil behind a ship will not generate thrust in the same manner as an oscillating foil does. Furthermore, an initial CFD study showed that the pitching velocity of the ship has the greatest influence on the changing angle of attack on the foil. Additionally a study into basic wing theory showed that the foil would produce the most thrust at low angles of attack.<br/>With the use of this information, four algorithms were developed. Two of these algorithms focused on reducing the overall resistance by increasing the generated thrust on the foil. The results showed that the generated thrust cannot be significantly increased in comparison to a static foil. Two other algorithms were designed with the goal to reduce the pitching motion of the vessel. These two algorithms both achieved a significant reduction of the pitching motion, which also lead to a reduction in added wave resistance. Although the foil dampened the pitch motion, the generated thrust was found to be less than for the case with a static foil. The reduction in thrust was similar in size to the reduction in added wave resistance. It can be concluded that the rotating foil was able to provide similar resistance reduction as a static foil, with the added benefit of a significant reduction in pitch motion.<br","Active foil; pitch; resistance; waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","","","","Marine Technology | Hydromechanics","",""

The simple models are unrealistic since the dynamic interaction between the aerodynamic loads, hydrodynamic loads, control system and the structure is not included which leads to a lack of understanding of the behavior of the structure and possibly a poor design. The simulation software models, on the other hand, require input that the wind turbine designing party is not willing to provide, are computationally expensive, and since these are 'black box' models, give no insight into the system. In between these methods, there is currently unoccupied room for a hybrid model which includes relatively advanced rotor aerodynamics but remains computationally inexpensive while providing good insight into the behavior of the system.<br/>This thesis aims to define such a model based on modification of models present in literature and validate it by comparing its behavior to commercial wind turbine design software. First, a model of only the rotor with a rigid frictionless drivetrain shaft and blade pitch control system (the model restricts itself to the above rated regime) is considered and validated by comparison with Bladed. The blades of the rotor are assumed to be identical and rigid, the flow is assumed to be attached and the wind velocity field is uniform and has only one directional component. The effect of the use of different wake models is tested and it is concluded that for a step wind input the equilibrium wake model is most suited, while for a turbulent wind input the dynamic wake model is the best option. Simplification of the model results in the conclusion that the lift and drag coefficients can be evaluated for the mean wind velocity and chosen to be time independent without having any significant effect, while the induction factor cannot be chosen to be time independent without it significantly affecting the behavior of the model. The aerodynamic torque is linearized with respect to wind velocity, rotational rotor velocity, pitch angle and induction factor, which results in an acceptable approximation while the operating conditions are within reasonable proximity of the chosen mean operation state. Afterwards, a tower structure and flexible drivetrain shaft are added to the model, which again is validated by using Bladed. Frequency domain analysis shows that the tower motions of both the model and Bladed are similar, thus validating the model. The aerodynamic excitation is linearized with respect to wind velocity, structural motion, rotational rotor velocity, pitch angle and induction factor and applied to the model including a tower structure and flexible drivetrain shaft. Lastly, it is concluded that after simplification of the model and linearization of the aerodynamic excitation the model results in a good approximation of the wind turbine simulation software.","Wind energy; WInd turbine; Pitch control; Aerodynamic; Model; Numerical; Aero; Servo; Elastic; Monopile; Support structure; Response; Bladed; Linearized; Linear; Nonlinear; Lift coefficient; Drag coefficient; Induction factor; Generator; Drivetrain; Rotor; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In contrast to 'regular' localised slope failures, flow slides are diffuse, large-scale and potentially disastrous. Earthquake-induced ground vibrations currently dominate the liquefaction engineering scene. In reality, however, many liquefaction failures may be attributed to non-seismic sources of cyclic shear loading, albeit often in less dramatic context. Pile or sheet pile installation form an example. The construction of a new sea lock in IJmuiden brings this issue to the forefront and initiates a series of pile installation tests, conducted in several sandy deposits. The results of these tests are analysed and reveal (1) some key differences with seismic sources of vibration; (2) the importance of the duration and frequency of driving in residual excess pore water pressure (EPP) generation; and (3) the magnitude of spatial and temporal scales on which vibrations and EPPs generally act. The observations from the tests also form the basis for the establishment of a cyclic liquefaction model which simulates vibratory pile driving-induced EPP development. The model is validated using data from the IJmuiden pile installation tests. The cyclic liquefaction model is combined with a constitutive modelling approach for flow, or static, liquefaction behaviour. This enables the creation of a comprehensive strength framework, which allows representative strength parameters, based on the onset of flow liquefaction, to be derived for use in slope stability analyses. This strength framework is rooted in critical state soil mechanics and the related state parameter. A slope stability analysis procedure is advocated in which priority is given to pre-pile installation liquefaction analysis. Given a satisfactorily stable slope, pile installation effects are incorporated, where EPP generation and migration of pore water are considered the dominant contributors to failure. The procedure is applied to a fictional reference slope, where results show significant reduction in safety against global failure during driving. Considering three-dimensional drainage effects, however, suggests that pile installation may only have a minor effect on slope stability, depending on the failure mechanism and volume under examination. From the example stability analysis, some recommendations are made with regard to prevention and mitigation of piling-induced slope failures. Finally, in terms of further study, it must be noted that several major simplifications and assumptions underlie the cyclic liquefaction model and the corresponding method for slope stability analysis, which may be improved upon with more rigorous constitutive modelling and numerical analysis.","pile installation; liquefaction; slope stability; ground vibration; excess pore water pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-10","","","","","",""

A try-out of this research framework suggested the result of this graduation project is a promising step towards the development of a tool that helps to identify and facilitate the imaginative needs of individuals to engage successfully in inter-organizational innovation projects, if it can be merged with work on organizational culture and personal decision styles. <br/>This research framework has four levels: <br/>1.The description of the main concepts innovation, inter-organizational collaboration, and imagination. The innovation considered in this research is process innovation from existing companies (a category that fits most innovation projects driven by CSR-policies). Innovation in an inter-organizational network is described as a complex decision-making process, and imagination as a driving force for innovation is described as providing a mental image of the innovation at hand that is well-developed in a creativity dimension and an emotional dimension, which provides the flexibility, holism, and motivation for action that is needed to develop and implement and innovation successfully. <br/>2.A conceptual framework that ties together these main concepts. This level is built upon a conceptual framework from social psychology that links stimuli from the social context to behavior from the individual via a black box of cognitive processes and a mental representation.

To operationalize the stimuli from the social environment, the concepts arena games (from policy studies) and network structure (from group dynamic theory) are used. For the operationalization of the mental representation, five imaginative qualities are determined. Three of them are creative and increase the flexibility of the individual’s innovative action, and two of them are emotional and increase the motivation for action of the individual. The operationalization of the cognitive processes and the behavior of the arena attendees emerged from the empirical data, just like additional layers of operationalization for the other elements of the conceptual framework that are probably more specific for the specific research context of this graduation project. The cognitive processes are operationalized as a set of nested trade-offs that assess the quality and fitness of proposals concerning the innovation project that are done in the collaboration arena. If the final judgement of this assessment is positive, the proposal will become part of the mental representation.

The trend for development of offshore wind farms is towards a growing size of installed power. This together with higher distances from the shore leads in many cases to HVDC connection as a preferred choice for power export. Thus, the wind turbines are connected through a collection grid to an offshore platform. As the offshore wind farm contains a large number of power electronic devices and submarine cables, it will inevitably lead to the occurrence of harmonic resonance. Offshore wind farm harmonic and resonance will affect the power quality, while poses a huge challenge to the power grid and wind power. <br/>In this thesis work, a comprehensive harmonic analysis in offshore wind farm was studied. Firstly, a detail configuration of the wind energy conversion system and harmonic analysis basics are described and interpreted. Next, a suitable model of one offshore wind farm is built and validated in Matlab/Simulink. The equivalent circuit is calculated for the components in the aggregated wind farm based on their harmonic model. And potential resonance problems are analyzed by frequency scan method to calculate the resonance impedance and frequency. Afterwards, based on the self-built system model, potential harmonic issues that arise in the system are investigated in time domain to interpret the THD at PCC between the collection grid and the onshore grid. As well, a few effective strategy for suppressing harmonics are simulated to evaluate the various influence on the harmonic issue.

Of these methods, Fourier-based homing performed best: it still succeeds when snapshots are compressed to less than twenty bytes. Visual homing only works from a small region surrounding the snapshot, therefore odometry is used to travel longer distances between snapshots.

An enormous amount of data can now be generated, ranging from smartphones to sensors in machineries. However, most organizations are reported to be able to only create and store data, and creating added value from data is a major challenge for many organizations (Akerkar et al., 2015). Only 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to create value through Big Data (Bertocco &amp; Padmanabhan, 2014). Organizations might want to look into their business model, as adjusting their business model can facilitate the implementation (Muhtaroğlu, Demir, Obalı, &amp; Girgin, 2013), and can result in more efficient business operations (Loebbecke &amp; Picot, 2015).

The study also shows that activities, resources, and value propositions are core in the implementation, where implementing Big Data into the activities will result in improvement of value proposition, and enabled by resources. The changes in those three aspects can lead to changes in other aspects of business model, such as partnership, customer relationship, and financial. Customer segments remain unaffected, due to the specificity of value perceived by a certain segment. However, it might change in the future in the case that a new value is offered. It is found that a certain sector characteristic or combination of sector characteristics influences how organization adjusts their business model, but more importantly, the causes that shapes such characteristics need to be considered well.","Big Data; Business Model; Canvas; Sector Characteristics; Innovation system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Blom, E.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Technologies used in the energy sector, and many other sectors, are too complex for innovation by a single actor. Many influences from different types of actors are required to advance the technology, creating a collective innovation process. However, without the right accountability structures between different types of actors, unfavourable outcomes might emerge as the result of collective irresponsibility. Responsible Innovation is a theory that aims to improve the degree of responsibility of innovation processes, by incorporating the dimensions of anticipation, inclusion, reflexivity and responsiveness in the innovation process. However, to date this has been mostly applied to individual organisations. No framework exists that can assess and guide the responsibility of the collective innovation process of an entire system of actors. The objective of this exploratory research is to create a first version of a framework that can do such and perform an initial case study to generate insights for its future use.\\<br/>\\<br/>From a literature review, responsible innovation in the collective innovation process was specified as the application of the intertwining dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness in an evolutionary environment with actors of an innovation system that contains a constant group of institutions, while an open knowledge environment is present. Three concepts helped to define what a responsible innovation system is. Systems of Innovation helped to determine that innovation systems emerge on a regional level. The Quadruple Helix helped with the categorisation of the active institutions (Government, Industry, Academia, Civil Society) and the evolutionary characteristics of a system. Open Innovation helped to determine what an open knowledge environment entails in innovation. A responsible innovation system is then defined as an open knowledge network that allows for both emergence and evolution of the four institutions of the Quadruple Helix and the regional innovation system to develop, while the dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness are mutually shared among the actors. A combined framework was constructed consisting of three elements: components, relations and functions. In the components, the actors are characterised according to the Quadruple Helix and the system is evaluated on its inclusion of all institutions. In the relations, two-way knowledge channels are revealed, with the help of Open Innovation. In the functions the three virtual spaces of Knowledge, Innovation and Consensus are created, each with its specific role of explaining interaction in the system. The Consensus Space will only form if the dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity and responsiveness are found in the activities within and among the actors of the system. Also a number of conditions for a responsible innovation system to emerge were set up.\\<br/>\\<br/>The framework is subsequently applied to the case of the Indian innovation system of rural energy technology, after an institutional analysis showed that all of the institutions are present and active in the system. The framework was applied in three data collection methods, which covered different parts of the collective innovation process, explained as the exploration, construction and implementation phases. Several local event visits showed that in the exploration phase has arenas exist where responsibility prevails, but governmental policy feedback events are far from inclusive, anticipatory and responsive. Structured interviews with 17 organisations, predominantly actors from industry and civil society, reveal that in the construction phase, inclusion of governmental and academic partners is limited. Also two-way communication channels were often absent, preventing alignment of goals and values through anticipation, reflexivity and responsiveness in the Consensus Space. From the actor analysis, CLEAN appeared to be the most central actor of the system. Semi-structured interviews with end-users showed that full inclusion is also absent in the implementation phase, while also responsiveness should be increased. The framework appeared to succeed in revealing the important interactions of an innovation system, because it became clear that government and academic actors are not sufficiently included in the innovation activities of the industry and civil society institutions, further preventing alignment of objectives in order to achieve responsible innovations. Evaluation of the conditions showed that these indeed left some gaps to be filled. Overall, the results show that actors in the system should perform more co-creation activities between institutions.\\<br/>\\<br/>It should be noted that a validation of the results generated several limitations to the research and the framework, leading to recommendations for further research. It was shown that due to multiple realities in the intersections of an innovation system, the results of the framework can not always be generalised and needs to have input from central actors of all institutions. Also, the way a component or relation contributes to anticipation, reflexivity and responsiveness should be revised, because the framework fails to capture gradations in such contribution. Next to that, the oversimplification of the characterisation of actors might prevent a good evaluation of the system. Furthermore, there appears to be a tension between effectiveness of the activities of organisations and responsibility, due to the large amount of resources that are needed. This means that to become responsible might take more time and effort, making the activities less efficient in reaching the objectives. This would make the framework more usable for the exploration phase, opposed to the other two phases, because in this phase the goal is generally to have a broad perspective, while in the construction and implementation phases a certain focus is required and intervention of many stakeholders might trouble the process. Also, the conditions of the framework should be further examined and enhanced, possibly with a role for CLEAN as the central actor. Lastly, in line with global issues, the framework could be extended with the Quintuple Helix with the environment as additional institution, so that innovation systems might also be in line with ecological constraints. Also, among some other operational limitations, the research failed to question all institutions, creating a potential bias in the results. <br/><br/>More research is needed to validate the framework and the results, both within and outside of India. Still, a first exploratory step has been taken towards a framework for assessing and guiding towards responsible innovation systems.","Responsible Innovation; rural; Energy; india; Yvo Hunink; Triple Helix; Quadruple Helix; Systems of Innovation; Open Innovation; Innovation systems; institutions; collective innovation; quintuple helix; functions of innovation systems; Energy Bazaar; Rural Spark","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","","28.644800,77.216721"

The two main types of surgical treatment for breast cancer are mastectomy and lumpectomy. In mastectomy, the entire affected breast is excised whereas in lumpectomy only the tumor along with a rim of healthy tissue is excised. This rim of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is called a ‘surgical margin’ and to prevent recurrence of cancer, it is necessary that there are no cancer cells remaining after the surgery. Owing to this purpose, many techniques have been developed to discriminate between healthy tissue and tumor. Two noteworthy techniques are namely, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI), which use spectral information to discriminate between healthy and cancerous tissues. Both techniques have the potential to be used for real time intraoperative characterization of breast tissue in vivo but each technique has its respective limitations. While HSI provides non-contact tissue imaging which DRS does not, DRS provides spatially resolved depth information that HSI does not.<br/>The goal of the thesis is to evaluate the translation of Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy into Hyperspectral imaging by bridging the gaps between the two technologies. For this purpose, three main research questions were answered. First, the changes in spectral shapes were observed when moving from contact DRS to HSI by acquiring data from two intermediate DRS set ups that emulated the non-contact and illumination settings of HSI. Second, the scope of a spatially resolved non-contact DRS tool was assessed. And third, the spatially resolved non-contact DRS in a clinical setting was put into perspective. A multitude of experiments were performed to answer these three research questions. All experiments were performed on commercial butter or ex vivo porcine adipose tissue samples. DRS measurements were obtained for a wavelength range spanning 400 nm to 1600 nm.","diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; hyperspectral imaging; breast conserving surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-09","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

For instance, due to the decrease in size of electronics, it<br/>becomes more necessary to have efficient and smaller cooling systems. In order to increase the effect of the<br/>cooling liquids used, it might be interesting to add extra solid particles with a high conductivity, to possibly<br/>increase the effective heat transfer fromthe wall to the liquid. These particles can be separated in 2 categories:<br/>point particles, with a very small size compared to the flow phenomena, and finite sized particles, which due<br/>to their larger size are able to significantly influence the fluid flow. In this thesis, the finite sized particles<br/>and their effect on the effective conductivity have been analyzed by using a CFD code. The main focus has<br/>been on the effect of the mechanical and thermal Stokes numbers, which give an indication about the time<br/>required for the particles to react to changes in surrounding flow and temperature compared to the relevant<br/>flow time scale.<br/>To investigate the effect of large particles on the effective conductivity of a fluid a numerical method to<br/>solve heat transfer inside a fluid and between fluid and particles has been implemented. This method, based<br/>on an immersed boundary method combined with DNS, is able to solve both isolated particles and extremely<br/>high conductivity particles. To solve the heat transfer for finite conductivities, a volume of fluid method has<br/>also been implemented. These methods have been verified by comparing the simulation results to known<br/>results for single sphere heat transfer and conservation of energy.<br/>With this code, the influence of the thermal and mechanical Stokes numbers have been analyzed for<br/>laminar Couette flow. In order to gain a better understanding of the underlying heat transfer mechanics, it<br/>has been assumed that the natural convection is negligible and the density ratio between the particle and the<br/>fluid is taken to be equal to one (no effects of gravity). From this it appeared that the effective conductivity<br/>of a suspension can be split in 3 components: the non-moving conductivity, an enhancement due to fluid<br/>convection induced by the particles and an increase in heat transfer due to particle convective heat transfer.<br/>The non-moving conductivity is only dependent on the conductivity of the particles and the fluid, and<br/>on the particle concentration. It stays close to constant independent of Stokes numbers. In contrast, the<br/>fluid convection appeared to scale significantly with the mechanical Stokes number and with the particle<br/>concentration. This appeared to be due to the increase in particle inertia resulting in more movement in<br/>wall normal direction and as a result moving more fluid in wall normal direction. The particle convection<br/>appeared to not only scale with the thermal Stokes number and the particle concentration, but also with the<br/>mechanical Stokes number. This increase was caused by the particles being able to absorb and release more<br/>thermal energy for higher thermal Stokes numbers, and thus transport more heat from the hot wall to the<br/>cold wall.<br/>Finally, the resulting effective conductivity and effective viscosity of the suspension were compared and<br/>it was shown that it is possible to enhance the heat transfer more than the viscosity, but only by either introducing<br/>a small amount of highly conductive particles, or by introducing well-conducting particles with very<br/>low mechanical Stokes numbers. It appeared to not be possible to increase the heat conductivity more than<br/>the viscosity for particles with equal or lower conductivity compared to the fluid.","Multiphase flow; Heat transfer; Suspension; finite-sized particles; Immersed boundary method; DNS; Volume of fluid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If no measures are taken, the shorelines of the islands will retreat and the basins may drown. In the Ameland Inlet, the Boschplaat at the eastern tip of Ameland and Bornrif at the western tip of Terschelling are currently shrinking. <br/>This thesis evaluates different nourishment strategies to counteract the coastal retreat, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of how nourishment sand of different grain sizes is shared between the different morphological units of the Ameland Inlet. <br/>The process-based model Delft3D is used as a means of predicting the transport pathways of nourishment sand on a time scale of 10 years. In this thesis an existing model of the Ameland Inlet is improved, in order to make it suitable for medium term nourishment calculations. The Mormerge (parallel online) approach is applied in combination with a phase shift in the tidal signal for the different wave conditions. As a result the computational time is significantly reduced. The bathymetry is updated based on the 2016 Vaklodingen and Bed Composition Generation is used to create a suitable bottom composition. The composition of the nourishments is based on the particle size distribution of the borrow area. <br/>The model results suggest that different objectives, such as feeding the Terschelling or Ameland coast, feeding the basin, or reinforcing the ebb tidal delta, can be met by varying the nourishment location and composition. <br/>The main findings regarding the transport pathways within the inlet system are as follows: Near the Terschelling beach import via Boschgat is dominant. Further offshore, bypassing via the ebb tidal delta is the most important transport pathway. Boschgat feeds the western part of the basin and Borndiep feeds the eastern part, but interaction between the two is limited. The model predicts some transport from Boschgat to Borndiep via Westgat under the influence of the tide, or driven by waves over the shallow area in between the channels. There is no connection in the other direction. Borndiep connects the basin to the ebb tidal delta, resulting in transport in and out of the system. Bornrif is the only location where a net westward transport into the inlet is observed. <br/>Finer fractions are imported further into the basin by the tidal flow. When bypassing the inlet, they are transported further offshore, since they are more influenced by the tidal currents flowing out of the inlet. As a result coarser nourishment fractions end up closer to the Ameland shoreline.<br/>The model has several limitations, mainly since insufficient data is currently available for a sound calibration and validation. However important phenomena observed in the field are reproduced by the model, such as the coastal retreat at Boschplaat and the bar migration at Bornrif. This gives confidence in the model performance regarding the predictions of the sediment transport patterns.<br","Nourishment; mega nourishment; sediment transport pathways; sediment transport modelling; SEAWAD; tidal inlet system; Ameland Inlet; bed composition generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","53.41206, 5.60186"

However, continuous thrust opens new extensive sets of feasible trajectories, and optimization algorithms are needed to mine the admissible search space and find optimal transfers. Practical methods to solve complex optimal control problems as low-thrust trajectory optimization typically involve high computational times, the major bottleneck of these techniques. The objective of this work is the development of a novel multiple-shooting optimization tool, employing a variational approach for quick derivative computation, and the assessment of its performance against a variety of test cases. Indeed, after a first analysis of practical optimization methods, the derivative estimation by finite-difference approximations has been found as the major contributor to the computational burden, and the propagation of the variational dynamics has been selected as an accurate approach to speed-up their computation. The theory of variational dynamics for multiple-shooting application has been analyzed in detail, and further developed for what concerns the second-order equations. After practical considerations on the method implementation (scaling procedures, sparsity patterns, et cetera) and its interface with WORHP, the selected non-linear programming solver, the tool has been applied to a broad range of test cases, spanning from elementary problems to practical applications. For what concerns the latter cases, two complex problems were analyzed and optimized: a CubeSat rendezvous departing from Earth-Moon L2 and arriving at asteroid 2000SG334, resulting in a propellant mass convenient trajectory suitable for asteroid reconnaissance well before a proposed NASA manned mission in 2069; The Kessler Run, i.e. the 9th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC9), in which the developed tool, employed as last step of the optimization cascade of Strathclyde++ team, managed to make the solution constraint-feasible, valid and further mass-optimal.","Low-thrust trajectories; Optimization; Multiple shooting; Variational equations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This research question regards a business model on a system level and the hybridity is reflected in the tension between the individual interest of fulfilling a care need and the collective interest of keeping the system economically viable.<br/><br/>In the healthcare system before 2005, care providers had freedom to match their care to the need of clients. The insuring institution, mainly the government, paid for the provided care, based on the care provider’s activities of last year. As the costs for care provision kept on growing, it was decided to put more focus on controlling the costs. Now, insuring institutions can contract care providers and negotiate on “care products”. These care products contain a certain diagnosis and treatment trajectory for a certain price. As care providers must act within the rules of this system in order to cover their expenses, they are less able to match their care provision to the client’s need. Furthermore, the administration that insurers require from care providers result in high system costs.<br/><br/>So what if there would be a stakeholder in the system that intertwines the collective interest of the economic viability of the system and the individual’s interest of fulfilling a mental care need? To embody this role, a new stakeholder is proposed called the “care scout”.<br/><br/>The care scout fulfils a special role. He must understand what a client needs and matches the client with appropriate care. He must not solely act from the client’s care need, but also from the perspective of what that care will cost. So he should independently determine the right price and quality. The care scout is a generalist specialist on mental care. Someone who is able to oversee the full spectrum of mental needs, and even aspects that influence that mental need. <br/><br/>If the care scout thinks help is needed, he will explore what further explore the client’s needs. The care scout will stay involved in the client’s process to adjust the care provision in such a way that the client will have sufficient result of the provided care. Once the care provision ends, the care scout will see that the care provider is being paid for his effort and will document the made match and its result in the learning system. This accumulated knowledge will support care scouts to improve future matchmaking. <br/><br/>The client’s incentive to do his work properly is incentivized through client feedback and through the costs of the called in care provision stated in the digital system. Supervisors will regularly assess the care scout’s performance.<br/><br/>The system is designed to drive sufficient result by dynamically adapting care provision to a client’s unique need and by decreasing ineffective care provision, through ongoing involvement of the care scout. Documenting match results and evaluating the performance of the care scouts, will improve matchmaking and the affordability of care over time.<br","Hybrid System; Mental health; Business Model; System Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Assessment of their impact can be made through numerical modeling. In a forecasting context, the CPU time of the wave model is decisive in its suitability. Recent years wave model approaches have been to describe both linear and non-linear generation, dissipation and transfer processes in the wave spectrum explicitly. This resulted in computationally demanding tools. Such models are very suitable for research purposes or for design and assessment if time is available, but are rather heavy tools for forecasting applications on larger scales. Parametric models describe the wave spectrum through characteristics in a smaller solution space compared to spectral models, which makes them potentially faster solvers. In this thesis the suitability for forecasting of a spectrally integrated approach to the wave action balance is investigated. The stationary wave drivers from the storm impact assessment model XBeach were taken as a starting point. A second balance equation was identified to model the evolution of the mean period. In estuaries and behind shoals, locally generated waves can be dominant over offshore wave conditions. As part of the project, a wave generation mechanism is developed for the modified wave drivers based on prediction relations for growth of wind-waves under fetch-limited conditions. The two-equation approach was discretized and tested in a 1D Matlab model and the solution was proven to converge towards the literature prescribed growth curves for total wave energy and mean wave period. This approach was then implemented in the unstructured Frequency Integrated wave drivers in D-Flow FM. The implementation has been verified through semi-1D test cases and showed convergence behavior equal to the Matlab model. A hindcast of a 1982 storm in the Haringvliet was performed to compare the model skill of the unstructured frequency integrated model (FIM-FM) to the spectral wave model SWAN. In this hindcast the model skill of FIM-FM is comparable to SWAN for significant wave height and mean wave period for all locations apart from directly behind a shoal. Depth and wave height dependence of bottom friction coefficients should be studied in more validation cases to improve the prediction of wave steepening over shoals. Further research should also look into the iterative method in the solver for stationary solutions of the model equations to realize faster CPU time of a stationary problem. Although not established in this thesis, faster CPU time compared to a spectral model like SWAN should be possible based on the reduction of the solution space.","numerical modeling; wave action balance; wind-waves; frequency integrated; wave generation; growth curves; Environmental Fluid Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Druten, Emiel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The European energy system is significantly changing to restrict the rise in global average warming. There is a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, which resulted in an exponential growth of offshore wind energy capacity in the North Sea. However, the North Sea is already one of the most intensively used sea basins in the world and space is limited. Offshore wind farms are therefore increasingly constructed under less favourable conditions. On the one hand the industry is rapidly developing and the cost of offshore wind energy goes down, but on the other hand offshore wind farms are constructed at greater water depths and further from shore. This latter development counteracts the cost reduction achieved by the industry, but countries are forced to construct offshore wind farms under less favourable conditions in order to achieve the climate agreements.<br/><br/>In June 2016, Dutch transmission system operator TenneT proposed the Hub and Spoke concept. It is an alternative method to connect offshore wind farms with the onshore grid and makes the parameter distance to shore far less important. Basically, the concept combines offshore wind farms with interconnector cables. An artificial island is created somewhere in the centre of the North Sea which is surrounded by offshore wind farms, thereby being far away from the crowded coastlines while profiting from near shore conditions. The interconnector cables subsequently transport the generated electricity to shore.<br/><br/>Dogger Bank is the envisioned location for the Hub and Spoke concept. The area contains strong winds, shallow water conditions and is centrally located. However, the unique characteristics of the shallow sandbank make it also very favourable to a variety of species. The area is therefore appointed Natura 2000 territory and could cause major resistance from environmental organisations. The general consensus amongst environmental organisations is not yet known, but industry experts indicate this as the major reason which could stop the Hub and Spoke concept from being realised on Dogger Bank.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to determine the optimal location for the Hub and Spoke concept in the North Sea. The concept feasibility has never been determined and it is not even certain if Dogger Bank is the most beneficial location, while the location contains a very large risk. Therefore, the site selection model is created. The model contains input data from metocean conditions and electricity markets, which makes it possible to calculate the feasibility of the Hub and Spoke concept for every location in the North Sea. The result is a contour plot with the net present value of the Hub and Spoke concept, which shows the optimal location in the North Sea.<br/><br/>The Hub and Spoke concept is divided into five components to determine the influence of certain conditions on cost or revenue and to compare the components between each other. The artificial island and offshore wind turbines are primarily influenced by water depth, while the subsea interconnector cost is mainly influenced by the cable capacity and length of the cable. The optimal location for the island and offshore wind farms with respect to cost is thus along the shallow coastlines or at Dogger Bank, while the optimal location for the subsea interconnector cables is determined by the minimum total cable length. This point is equal to the centre of gravity of the countries surrounding the North Sea and is located just above the Netherlands and Germany.<br/><br/>In terms of revenue, the wind conditions are normative for the production and revenue of offshore wind farms and interconnectors derive their congestion rents from electricity price differences between countries. Offshore wind farms generate most electricity in the northeastern part of the North Sea where the wind conditions are strongest. This negatively impacts the generated revenue from subsea interconnectors as the cable is used more often for offshore wind energy. Interconnector revenue of the Hub and Spoke concept is therefore lowest at locations with the strongest wind speed, but in total the highest revenue is generated. A comparison between these components for four various locations is presented in Figure 1.<br/><br/>XXX<br/><br/>Offshore wind farms are both in cost and revenue the major component in the Hub and Spoke concept. The optimal location is thus expected to be found in areas with shallow water depths and high wind speeds. Finally, each component with its cost and revenue has been determined and can be merged in the site selection model to determine the feasibility of the Hub and Spoke concept in the North Sea. See Figure 2.<br/><br/>XXX<br/><br/>It can be concluded that the highest net present value for the Hub and Spoke concept is situated along the coastline of Denmark and Germany. However, these locations are known to be very crowded and the reason to investigate alternative locations in the first place. Dogger Bank and the northwest of Denmark are two very interesting alternatives. Dogger Bank is very shallow with depths of 10 m, while the northwest of Denmark is slightly deeper with 20 m but contains roughly 10% higher wind speeds. Both locations are primarily free from other marine uses, although Dogger Bank is protected Natura 2000 territory and therefore contains a very large risk. It is therefore advised to construct the Hub and Spoke concept at the northwest side of Denmark.","Hub and Spoke; offshore wind energy; TenneT; artificial island; North Sea; interconnector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","55, 3.7"

Therefor these weights can be learned from data with a technique called gradient descent optimization. While the filter weights have a well-defined derivative, the filter size has not. There is currently no other way to optimize filter sizes, then with an exhaustive search over multiple CNNs trained with different filter sizes. <br/>In this report, we propose a new filter called Structured Receptive Field of which the filter size can be optimized during the training stage. This new filter constitutes a parameterization of a normal filter as a linear combination of all 2D Gaussian derivatives up to a certain order. Instead of learning the weights of the resulting filter directly, we learn the weights of the linear combination and the sigma of the Gaussian derivatives that implicitly define the filter weights. The advantage of parameterizing normal filters in this way, is that gradient descent optimization of the continuous sigma parameter which has a well-defined derivative, can be used as a proxy for optimizing the discrete filter size which has no well-defined derivative. <br/>The basic idea for this parameterization comes from scale-space theory in which the scale of image features is studied by parameterizing the image features with a continuous scale parameter. Thereby explicitly decoupling the spatial structure of image feature from the scale at which it occurs in the image. Structured receptive fields have several compelling advantages: they can learn bigger filters without increasing the number of learnable parameters and without increasing the complexity of the structure of the filter.<br/>In this report, we both provide theoretical and empirical evidence that structured receptive fields can approximate any filter learned by normal CNNs. I.e. we show that structured receptive fields of order 4 can approximate the filters in all layers of a pre-trained AlexNet. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that structured receptive fields can indeed learn their own filter size during training, and that this extra ability over normal filters seems to give them an advantage over normal filters when used for classification tasks. I.e. by replacing normal filters in a DenseNet architecture and keeping every- thing else the same, a ~1% higher test accuracy was obtained on the highly competitive CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset. <br/>It would not be wise to draw hard conclusions from a single training run on a single dataset, but this result definitely looks promising. In future research, we hope to demonstrate that, because of their extra ability to learn their filter size, replacing normal filters with structured receptive fields will always lead to strictly better or equal performance.","machine learning; deep learning; convolutional neural networks; scale-space; learning feature scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Research and Development track",""

The ability of a robot to create such a model itself is crucial to having truly autonomous robots around in our daily lives. For basic robot-tasks, a two-dimensional grid-map that describes a distinction between inhabitable and uninhabitable space is a commonly used model. Creating grid-maps, or any environment model, is usually done by simultaneously estimating the robots location and its environment. <br/><br/>Modern SLAM algorithms are based on incremental non-linear optimization and the robustness highly depends on the used sensors and their proneness to environmental ambiguities. In this thesis an affordable laser-range-finder (often referred to as LiDAR is used in combination with ultra-wideband radios to improve the localization and mapping performance in large ambiguous environments. <br/><br/>In SLAM-literature it is common that LiDAR measurements are used to both correct the robot's ego-motion and to build a grid-map. In this thesis, however, the LiDAR is used solely for creating a grid-map while the ego-motion is corrected using UWB range-measurements. To quantitatively assess the mapping performance using this strategy, a HRL-SLAM algorithm was designed and implemented as a real-time application. The application is benchmarked on both synthetic- and real data and compared to similar range-based SLAM implementations. <br/><br/>The result of this thesis indicates that UWB radios can dramatically improve the robustness of indoor localization and grid-mapping with affordable LiDARs. Secondary results are a scalability enhancement for an existing beacon-localization algorithm, a graph-topology inspired submapping-strategy and the introduction of a reference-frame independent benchmark-metric for range-SLAM. <br/><br/>Finally, a few recommendations are done for improving the HRL-SLAM algorithm. The thesis concludes with an outlook on how to proceed from SLAM's graph-representation to a hierarchical metric-topological set of spatial representations, this can be seen as a tertiary result.","SLAM; Ultra-wideband; graph; mapping; localization; hierarchical mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Due to this ageing society, solutions are needed to alleviate the limited care personnel and the ever increasing healthcare costs. To this end, service robots are proposed to meet this demand by assisting the elderly with their daily activities and providing them with a more independent life.<br/><br/>When people are present, new behavioral concepts are necessary to assure acceptance of robots as daily assistants. Robot motion must take safety, as well as human comfort into account. This is the goal of Human-Aware Navigation (HAN). Most current HAN approaches focus on maintaining appropriate interaction spatial distances between the robot and the human, aiming at respecting their proximity space. However, these approaches are effective only when the human lies in the close vicinity of the robot. Predictive methods, on the other hand, aim at foreseeing how humans will move in the environment and plan a navigational behavior based on this anticipated motion. Though, these methods usually fail to produce socially acceptable robot motion as they do not account for proximity constraints.<br/><br/>This thesis is concerned with the implementation of a Human-Aware navigation framework that incorporates the proximity space around a human as well as human intention, as layers of a layered 2D costmap architecture, used for navigation. The proximity space is modeled as a Gaussian cost function around the person. Human intention is defined by the probability that a person will move to a specific destination within the environment and is used as a<br/>means of human motion prediction model. In order to infer the path that the human will follow to reach the destination, a simplistic path planner is implemented. Then the intention cost model is assigned along this expected path.<br/><br/>The proposed framework is benchmarked against two current state-of-the-art navigation methods. The contestants are: the navigation method used in the ubiquitous Robot Operating System (ROS) and a social navigation method that accounts only for the proximity space around humans. The goal of the thesis is to show that the incorporation of human intention in the robot path planning process is able to produce friendlier motion and increase human comfort. Simulated experiments have been conducted and metrics have been defined<br/>to evaluate the methods in terms of human comfort and navigation performance. Results demonstrate that the proposed navigation framework outperformed the other two methods, proving to be able to produce friendlier robot motion while exhibiting similar navigation performance.","Human-aware navigation; service robots; autonomous navigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, GPS readings can aid when flying outdoors, or when flying in GPS denied environments, such as indoors, visual information from one or more camera modules can be used. <br/>A single downwards facing camera however cannot determine the absolute height of the quadrotor, leaving the results from the Optical Flow (OF) up to scale. To estimate the velocity of the quadrotor an additional range sensor, such as an Ultrasonic Sensor (US), is used to solve this scaling problem.<br/>These solutions are difficult to scale down to micro quadrotors as the platform becomes too small to fit and lift additional sensors. Therefore stabilizing a quadrotor with a single camera and IMU only would pave the way for the development of even smaller quadrotors. This master thesis presents an adaptive control strategy to stabilize a micro quadrotor in all<br/>three axes using only an IMU and a monocular camera. This is achieved by extending the stability based approach for a single, vertical, axis by De Croon in Distance estimation with efference copies and optical flow maneuvers: a stability-based strategy[1]. This stability based method ncreases the control gain in the visual feedback loop until the quadrotor detects it is oscillating by detecting that the covariance of the given thrust inputs and the measured divergence passes a threshold. Next the height can be estimated using the predetermined relationship between gain and height at which these self-induced oscillations occur and proper gains can be set for the estimated height. <br/>An analysis is done in simulation to present proof of concept of the stabilization method in three axis and to determine the effects of scaling and the effects of varying effective Frames per Second (FPS) caused by computations. It was shown that the adaptive gain strategy can stabilize the simulated quadrotor and prevent it from drifting. Furthermore, the control gains were scaled such that the effects of scaling a quadrotor could be mostly negated, though at about a tenth of the scale the simulated noise had such an influence that the scaled gains could not negate it anymore. Furthermore, the minimum effective FPS required to stabilize an ARDrone 2 was determined to be 15 FPS, and it was shown that an increase in effective FPS aids stabilizing the smaller scale quadrotors that became unstable due to the scaling effects.<br/>Furthermore, flights on an Parrot ARDrone 2 and Parrot Bebop are performed to show the usability of this control strategy in real life. It was shown that both quadrotors could achieve stable hover without drifting at multiple heights, using various strategies.<br","Quadrotor; Adaptive control; vision; Monocular; ARDrone; Bebop; stabilization; MAV; MAVLAB; micro quadrotor; quadcopter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Model-based research on human aware navigation focuses on two specific alternatives.

The second alternative is related to models that use machine learning to copy human-like characteristics into mathematical models. <br/><br/>The former approach has proven to be efficient in human-aware navigation, but further studies are required to analyze the expansion of this method to more complex human-interactive navigation.

Biomass which is considered to be one of these sources can be converted into usable energy by combustion. Incomplete biomass combustion product formation is one of the challenging problems to overcome. By overcoming these problems, biomass will become a successful sustainable fuel source. Combustion experiments have shown that the use of manganese dioxide catalyzes the combustion. The use of this metal oxide was even known to Neanderthals who were deliberately selecting it for fire-making.<br/>In this study, a detailed investigation of the influence of manganese dioxide on wood combustion was performed. The combustion studies were performed both in a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and in a pyroprobe. The combustion of three wood materials (beech, birch and pine wood) was examined. In particular, their thermal decomposition in TGA using air as oxidizer was studied in the presence of manganese dioxide. The heating rate was 50C/min. For the beech wood combustion study, three commercial MnO2 materials (MD4, MD5, MD6) were used. They were mixed with wood in three different concentrations on mass basis (1%, 10%, 23%). Moreover, the TGA response of beech wood and 10% MD4 impregnation was compared to the cases of using 10% MnOOH and 10% Mn3O4 instead. Also, an investigation of whether Ca, Al, Si, Ba, Fe metals affect the combustion process was made by performing TGA tests using samples of beech wood and impregnations of it with 10% oxide material composed of MD4 and these metal oxides (Ca(OH)2, Al2O3, SiO2, BaO, Fe2O3). In order to assess if the volatiles play a role in the catalysis of combustion, the thermal degradation of fixed carbon was studied and compared to the case of adding 10% MD4. For birch and pine wood study, their combustion was examined by comparing the TGA response of two samples composed of 100% wood and mixture of wood with 10% MD4.<br/>As for the pyroprobe experiments, the combustion of these three wood materials was studied at 7000C, 9000C and 10000C (only for beech wood) with a heating rate of 6000C/s by using them as single fuels and in mixtures with 10% MD4. The gas products formed by the experiments were collected and analyzed by micro-GC.<br/>The TGA experiments showed that the addition of manganese dioxide to beech and birch wood decreased their char combustion temperature and increased the corresponding rate with the volatiles playing an important role in this catalytic effect. The concentration of manganese dioxide in the mixture determined the extent of the effect. It was found that metals do not affect combustion. In case of pine wood, the char combustion temperature remained unaffected when adding MD4. The addition of MnOOH and Mn3O4 also catalyzed the combustion. MnO2 was converted to Mn3O4 in such a low temperature when biomass is present. The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations indicated the presence of MnO at 3500C when the mixture of MnO2 with beech wood is combusted. The pyroprobe experiments showed that the addition of MD4 led to more gas and less condensable formation resulting in increasing the CO2 levels for beech, birch and pine combustion. Lastly, CO yield was decreased when adding 10% MD4 to the beech wood and combusting it at 9000C and 10000C. <br","manganese dioxide; catalytic biomass combustion; beech wood; birch wood; pine wood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Veldhuis, L.L.M. (graduation committee); Voskuijl, M. (graduation committee); Dwight, R.P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Flight testing is an activity that exists since the beginning of flight, and is still seen as an essential part of the aircraft development process. While numerical simulation has been improved significantly over the last decade, flight testing remains attractive in the exploration and evaluation of the flight envelope, especially in the region where numerical simulation lacks prediction accuracy. Free-flying model testing is a potential technique, which is recognized by some of the largest research institutes. Using such relatively cheap scale models aids in the determination of the flight behavior of full-scale aircraft in an early stage in the design process. Furthermore it takes less time to develop a scalemodel and is also safer to fly. A 5.5% scale model of the Boeing 737-700 is created by the TU Delft as a first step towards investigating the potential of dynamically scaled flight testing. This Delft University Unconventional Concept (DUUC) has a conventional tube-wing configuration and features ducted fan engines mounted aft on the fuselage, which replace the conventional empennage. A horizontal and vertical jet vane is placed in the duct, which guide the propeller slipstream and thereby control the attitude of the aircraft. Successful flights have already been performed with this model, which proves the propulsive empennage concept. However, the stability and control behavior has only been assessed at a low level. Flow characteristics entailed by the ducted fan are accounted for by means of approximate functions and empirical relations instead of looking at the physical interaction between the components within the duct. This study focusses on the processing of said interaction by performing a CFD study of which the results are used in the longitudinal equations of motion of the DUUC. This way, certain motion can be simulated from which the effect of the unconventional empennage on the stability and control can be assessed. In order to study the aerodynamics of the propulsive empennage and subsequently its stability, a CADmodel is developed using PARAPY. This is a knowledge based engineering platform written in the Python language and allows for parametrization of the model such that geometric alterations can easily be implemented. Previous studies within the TU Delft have lead to a multi-model generator written in PARAPY. The fuselage and wing generation modules that were developed can readily be applied in the generation of the DUUC model. The propulsive empennage module is created by the author of this thesis, consisting of several sub-parts: (1) outer duct that forms a shielding around the propeller, (2) the pylon that connects the duct to the fuselage, (3) a center body to which the (4) propeller and (5) control vanes are attached. The full aircraft model has been used in a series of CFD simulations with ANSYS FLUENT. Inviscid steady calculations are performed using a pressure-based solver with a SIMPLE pressure-velocity coupling scheme. The propeller is modeled as an actuator disk whereby the thrust is defined by specifying a pressure jump across the thin surface. The thrust produced by the ducted fan is based on the turboprop installed on the ATR72-600 aircraft, which has similar dimensions compared to the Boeing 737-700. Both the full-scaleDUUC as well as the 5.5% scale model are subjected to this aerodynamic analysis. Minor discrepancies were found between the two models, which is a result of the artificial viscosity that is implemented in the Euler scheme to smoothen strong gradients in the solution (numerical dissipation). Due to the location of the engine, the thrust line is located above the center of gravity which contributes to a stabilizing effect. The effect of several parameters on the stability and control has been analysed, such as the center of gravity location, mass and inertia, and geometric scaling factor. The slight difference in aerodynamic performance between the full-scale and subscalemodels, means that the trimmed solution for steady horizontal flight is also slightly different with a maximum error of 2.5 degrees in elevator deflection. More drag is obtained as the aircraft scale goes down, resulting in a higher required thrust to achieve force balance in a trimmed flight condition. Furthermore it is found that by scaling the aircraft down according to Froude scaling theory, the response becomes much faster. This response can in turn be scaled back, which proved to be a very useful estimate of the full-scale simulation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Jumbo is a heavy lift, shipping, offshore transportation and installation contractor. Jumbo is an experienced company in ocean transportation for more than 45 years. Since 2003, building on their heavy lift capability, Jumbo is rapidly getting involved in the offshore installation market.<br/><br/>Jumbo normally uses dynamic positioning systems for the stabilization of the vessels during the installation process. These systems are quite expensive and there is a need for alternative options for the stabilization of the vessels. One idea is the use of spudpoles for a K-type installation vessel which are inserted into the soil and connected to the vessel via hydraulic cylinders. The spudpoles transfer the loads caused by the motions of the vessel to the soil resulting in the reduction of the movements of the vessel. The goal of this project is the reduction of the motions of the vessel in offshore operation improving its workability. A design of the compensation system along with an investigation of its performance are necessary in order to achieve this.<br/><br/>A survey of several types of foundation for the spudpoles is conducted in order to find the appropriate solution for this specific project. After a Multi Criteria Analysis the suction bucket solution was selected, since it is a quick and easy way for the penetration and extraction of the piles, at the start and the end of the installation procedure respectively.<br/><br/>To model the vessel a 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) time domain model was created. The hydrodynamic coefficients as well as the response amplitude operators (RAO) were obtained with the diffraction program WAMIT. For the calculation of the motion of the vessel the time consuming convolution integral was replaced by an extensive state space system. This specific model was validated using a Matlab model based on the convolution scheme. The two spudpoles were discretized using finite differences. Moreover, for a better representation of the real life, an irregular sea state was used. In the final state space model, the vessel, the spudpoles, the hydraulic cylinders and the environmental loads are included. <br/><br/>An initial design for the spudpoles was done using steel type S355. After performing the necessary stress and buckling checks for the spudpoles and taking into consideration the limitations of the motions of the vessel, it came out that the required thickness of the spudpoles was too large and so the type of steel was changed to S690. A number of simulations were performed with several sets of different diameter and thickness in order to obtain the optimum design. Furthermore, the suction buckets were checked for their pull-out and bearing capacity. A final design was selected for both the spudpoles and the suction buckets taking into account the outcome of the checks and the limitations of the vessel’s motions. The vessel moves between the allowable limits for the 6 DOF, proving that this compensation system is a realistic and feasible solution. <br/><br/>Based on the performed simulations, the critical wave directions were identified. The wave directions of 105º and 135º are the two critical for the stress and buckling checks. The wave direction of 90º is the critical one for the pull-out capacity check of the suction buckets. These wave directions should be avoid during the operation to assure higher safety standards for the vessel.<br","compensation system; motion reduction; state space model; vessel model; wave loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-02","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This growth leads to a water stress and pollution of the surface and groundwater. The lack of proper waste management and sanitation results in the ongoing deterioration of the water quality in the Kathmandu Valley. The situation is worsened by the lack of a complete and safe drinking water network leading citizens to pivot on conventional water sources like stone spouts and bore wells. Consequently, groundwater extraction, from the aquifer under the Kathmandu Valley, is expected to keep increasing and the groundwater table to drop as the recharge is less than the extraction rate. This research aims to address the influences of land-use on the quantity and quality of water sources in the Kathmandu Valley and how the necessary data can be collected by citizen science in the future. The fieldwork took place in August 2017 when groundwater level, water quality and land-use data were collected from seven watersheds within the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. At the same time, existing citizen science precipitation data were processed and juxtaposed with respective satellite data, namely IMERG GPM. On the one hand, the results confirm our initial assumption that the quality of the river water dramatically deteriorates (except for nitrite, nitrate and phosphate) while flowing through the agricultural and urban areas. Another observation is that spout water quality (except E. coli, turbidity and iron) is also negatively influenced by human activities. On the other hand, there is no clear link between land-use and wells’ water quality. A strange finding is that spouts and wells water quality do not behave similarly showcasing that they do not originate from the same aquifer. A health risk analysis was conducted with the results indicating that some water quality parameters have values exceeding the WHO standards. Regarding the option of implementing satellite data to facilitate citizen science, the contingency analysis shows that satellite products can detect the general temporal precipitation pattern although they perform poorly when it comes to estimating the correct amounts of rainfall. An extended network of rain gauges within the Kathmandu Valley is vital to establish a strong linear relationship between ground and satellite data which is, in turn, essential to enable GPM to enhance the temporal resolution of the citizen science measurements. Furthermore, the implementation of land-use and water quality measurements into citizen science shows increasing potential especially when taking into account the contribution of ODK. The accuracy of the citizen science ground truthing was found to be 33% when compared to the experts. Proper training of the citizen scientists is essential to improve performance. During research temperature, EC and turbidity were labelled as indication parameters. Those parameters are used to indicate the range of other water quality parameters which cannot be measured easily. The indication parameters, however, can be measured with affordable equipment and together with water quality strips prove to be powerful tools in the hands of citizen science. Finally, the groundwater recharge for the monsoon period was determined, but it is expected to be drastically reduced the rest of the year. A solid conclusion about the relation between recharge and land-use can’t be made unless a more substantial number of wells is regularly sampled.<br","Citizen Science; Hydrology; Water Quality; Kathmandu Valley","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","CIE4061-09 | MP241","27.70169, 85.3206"

One such being the wind energy. With the development in the field of wind energy, the structure of the wind turbines (WT) has also increased. The huge wind turbine structure (WTS) and the wind farms, both offshore and onshore, has a strong impact on the radar signal communication. The wind turbine clutters (WTC), which is a result of strong Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), has affected the existing radar system such as air-traffic control, weather radars, etc. Thus, to mitigate the wind turbine clutters (WTC), there is a need to understand the scattering properties of the wind turbine structure (WTS).The thesis proposes a development of a radar model to study the radar signal scattering on the wind turbine blades (WTB). The proposed model is developed in a simplified approach to studying the time domain simulationof signal scattered on the WTS. The blades of the model are represented as linear wire structures, which are designed using thin wire approximation. It is implemented for arbitrary orientation of the WT with full 3-D polarimetry observation, which can be applied to different azimuth and aspect angle. The signal scattering from theWTB will be developed for mono-static scattering and bi-static scattering case. The scattering matrix was derived for the cases and the results of the different polarizations are analyzed.The models developed until the date has been focused on the high-frequency range (&gt; 1GHz). To bring noveltyto the model, it will be analyzed for very-high (VH) and ultra-high (UH)frequencies (50, 280, and 600 MHz).Another feature of the model proposed includes the capability to simulate the range profile with arbitrary resolution. To implement this, pulse compression and stepped frequency waveform is used to attain high resolution with narrow-bandwidth. The results of the model will be validated using measurements data provided by the Agentschap Telecom, the Netherlands. The model is further extended to study the contribution of the mast in the signal scattering characteristics of theWTS.","WInd turbine; polarimetry radar; micro-Doppler; STFT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","Microwave Sensing, Signals & Systems",""
