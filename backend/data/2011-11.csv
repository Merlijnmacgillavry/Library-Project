(mentor); Falkena, W. (mentor); Van Kampen, E. (mentor)","2011","In order to meet requirements in terms of robustness, stability, and performance for future generations of advanced attitude control systems, a sensor-based approach using Incremental Backstepping control is developed and proposed in this thesis. Assuming full state availability and fast control action, the resulting time-scale separation between the state of the system and the state of the controller allows to consider an incremental form of the attitude dynamics, where backstepping controllers can be designed to achieve stability and convergence with incremental inputs. This results in integral-control action where information of angular acceleration and actuator output measurements is required. The robustness and the full potential of Incremental Backstepping are evidenced in face of external disturbances, uncertainties, and unknown parameters. External disturbances are well suppressed in contrast with conventional backstepping and Lyapunov-based (non)linear controllers. Furthermore, the attitude stabilization results to be insensitive to parametric uncertainties and robust against model uncertainties. However, this comes at the expense of higher control effort. Moreover, with the influence of model and parametric uncertainties the resulting closed-loop dynamic performance can be better accounted for by studying the convergence and stability properties in terms of Lyapunov theory. This methodology results in a simple, yet effective, family of robust nonlinear attitude controllers which aims to meet demanding requirements in terms of robustness, stability and performance, which in turn, close the gap towards the development of future advanced attitude control systems.","Spacecraft Attitude Control; Nonlinear Control; Backstepping; Incremental Backstepping; Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion; Lyapunov-based control; Modified Rodrigues Parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations (C&O) - Control and Simulation Division (C&S)","","Dynamics and Control of Aerospace Vehicles","",""

(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor); Rixen, D.J. (mentor)","2011","Following in the wake of the increased bicycle popularity, bicycle research arose in the late 19th century. Early research, regarding the dynamic behavior of an uncontrolled bicycle, resulted in the Carvallo (1899) and more general Whipple (1899) model. In the past years, extensive research has been done to validate these uncontrolled bicycle models. However, the bicycle is normally accompanied by a rider, for which the combined rider/bicycle dynamics are less understood. The goal of this research is to identify the active rider contribution during stabilization tasks in bicycling. This knowlegde may be used to develop better and more user-specific bicycles in the future. The equations governing the combined rider/bicycle system subjected to an external disturbance are derived in the first chapter. Here, the bicycle is modeled according to the linearized Whipple model, where the passive rider dynamics are already included. After a process of trial and error, a flexible rider model structure is chosen, which interacts with the bicycle through steering torque. To be more specific, the rider model allows for proportional, integral, derivative and 2nd order derivative linear feedback on both the roll and steering angle and is limited by activation dynamics and transport delays. An experimental dataset from our colleagues of the UC Davis is used to obtain a preliminairy rider model. First a non parametric FIR model is derived, which serves as a platform for subsequent parametric modeling. The parametric models are fitted by minimizing the sum of errors squared between the non parametric and parametric steering angle responses, resulting in a set of optimized parameters. The resulting parametric model, which consists of 8 parameters, acounts for 97% of the variance of the non parametric model output. The parameter may be reduced from 8 up to 4 parameters, while the variance acounted for only lowers with 3%. The following important observations are made from the parametric model results:  The steer into the fall principle is observable in the positive roll angle and rate feedback for all measurements.  The roll angle, roll rate, steering rate and integral action are the key contributers and cannot be removed without causing a major drop of the VAF.  The integrative steering action controls the heading by applying counter steering. The identification results are used to set up a future frequency domain rider identification experiment. The experiment should be performed at forward velocities of 2, 3, . . . , 7 m/s, since the dynamic behavior is velocity dependent. A disturbance input signal has also been designed, and should be applied as a generalized roll torque to the system. A randomly appearing multisine input signal is created, with a bandwidth of 0.2 to 4 Hz, and where the input power is scaled sucht that its absolute value does not exceed the 40 Nm. The measurement time is set to 163.84 s at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz. A simulation study indicates that the parameters can be estimated with an error of less than 3% relative to the true parameters. Next, a number of perturbator designs are presented. The goal of these designs is to apply a desired perturbation spectrum as a generalized roll torque to the rider/bicycle configuration. 4 perturbator designs are presented, namely; the swing, sliding mass, lateral accelerator and simple rope perturbator. The designs are evaluated by the following criteria; active system contribution, passive system contribution, rider interaction, implementability and cost. Here, the sliding mass perturbator shows the best overall score and is recommended for further development. Apart from the rider identification, some errors in bicycle literature where encountered. To be more specific, the models presented in van Lunteren and Stassen (1970) and Stassen and Lunteren (1973) where found to contain sign errors. After correcting for these sign errors, the models where implemented in Matlab, but where found to be unstable.","Bycicle; Rider control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-12-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Dynamic substructuring as a method to solve complex systems is becoming very important. Dynamic substructuring techniques are based on assembling the dynamic models of some simpler structures in order to generate the dynamic model of a complex structure. Impulse Based Substructuring (IBS) as a time domain substructuring technique computes dynamic response of linear structures by applying convolution product on the impulse responses of the subsystems. The IBS method can be explained in 2 main steps; 1: Computing the Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) of the substructures due to a unit impact (by applying numerical time integration), 2: Assembling procedure and computing the dynamic response of the total system by applying the convolution product between the IRFs and the applied forces. The applied forces consist of both external and unknown internal forces which are made at the interfaces due to substructuring and will be found during the assembling procedure in a way to satisfy the compatibility conditions at the interface. The IBS formulations have been developed based on the 3 different impact models. Afterwards in order to reduce the computation costs for long simulations, truncation and windowing have been applied on the IRFs. In this thesis, the 3 different formulations of the IBS method will be presented and application of the IBS method (using both normal and truncated IRFs) is illustrated by a 1D example. Finally in order to show the validity of the IBS method in real problems, a real 3D example related to an offshore wind turbine has been analyzed by IBS.","substructuring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-12-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Cardiovascular diseases are leading cause of deaths worldwide. With increasing graying population and limited health infrastructure there is a need for portable and implantable ECG devices to diagnose these diseases early on. In general an ECG device requires three or more electrodes, which need to be applied to the body via a gel, to obtain a satisfactory reading. This puts a constraint on the portability of the device. This thesis deals with designing a fully-integrated 10 bit analog front-end i.e. an instrumentation amplifier and an ADC, specifically, for a two-electrode ECG device. Integrated ECG read-out circuits have to deal with two challenges mainly viz. obtaining a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and integrating large time-constants on the chip. Firstly, all sources of interference which affect an ECG reading is studied. It is shown that for a portable and integrated read-out circuit, a high CMRR is obtained from the fact that the device will be floating and hence the circuit itself need not have a high CMRR. Existing techniques for integrating large time-constants are presented and compared. It is shown that these techniques either give rise to unpredictable time-constants and are non-linear near the required cut-o frequency or consume a lot of power from a system perspective. A novel mixed-signal feedback technique using a sigma-delta ADC has been proposed wherein the digital signal is scaled, integrated and fed back to the previous analog stage. The advantages of such a method are more control over the position of the cut-o frequency and higher linearity. The power consumption needed to implement such a technique is negligible. The circuit is designed in CMOS 0.35um I3T25 technology. The designed instrumentation amplifier reports the best SNR and 3rd highest Noise-Efficieny Factor (NEF). The linearity at the cut-o frequency is shown to be of 10 bits which is an improvement of 3 bits over existing techniques. The total static power consumption for the system is 66uW. The implementation of the time-constant consumes only 40nW of static power.","ECG; instrumentation amplifier; sigma delta; ADC; CMRR; SNR; NEF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Research Laboratory","","Microelectronics","",""

However, the performance of public transport has decreased the past decade, in spite of an overall increase in mobility. Moreover, recent economic and political developments have led to a decrease in funding for public transport in the Netherlands. Even with the efficiency gains from public tendering, it is unlikely that the retrenchment can be compensated. So, the current paradigm is not sufficient to maintain or improve the current level of service and ridership of public transport. It is therefore necessary to look at possible new paradigms. One such paradigm is the Disney philosophy, which has been successfully imported from entertainment to healthcare. The challenges in that public sector have been overcome by applying principles from the Disney philosophy. Due to its success in healthcare, the Disney philosophy is assessed for its usefulness in public transport. The goal of this project is therefore to research how the Disney philosophy may be applied to pubUc transport to consider whether or not it may be a suitable new paradigm to overcome the challenges faced by public transport.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""

At first glance it would seem that the solution is simple, the use of a prosthesis. However currently available upper limb prostheses are beyond the capabilities of most of the people in the developing countries. Thus there is a need for a prosthesis that can be easily manufactured in the developing countries and which is affordable for the individuals. Bamboo is a material that can be found in most developing countries, it has a good combination of properties such as specific strength and specific stiffness. Therefore, the goal of this research project is to make a body powered hand prosthesis out of bamboo. The prosthesis uses a combination of levers to move and to provide high gripping force with a low actuation force. However, the results show that there is a high energy loss occurring at the joints of the levers. Furthermore, the operating force is high (120 N) and the grasping force is low (14 N). However, by adjusting the position of the cable and spring the operating force can be reduced while the grasping force is increased. Thus, it can be stated that a prosthesis made out of bamboo is a feasible option; but the performance of the prosthesis is very sensitive to the accuracy of the manufacturing process. ?","Bamboo Body powered prosthesis prehensor developing countries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Pruyt, E. (mentor); Dijkema, G. (mentor); Bastein, T. (mentor)","2011","Economic importance for the indium mineral has been growing in recent years and indium is usually referred to as one of the technology minerals. High tech industries use indium in their application because of the special properties: transparency and electrical conductivity. Indium demand has more than doubled in the last decade and is expected to grow more in the near future. Indium is not found in its pure state in the nature which makes indium supply complex because it is by-produced from zinc. Indium supply could become problematic in the future because of high demand, the high dependence on zinc supply and the market functioning of indium. The objective of this master study is the exploration under deep uncertainty of plausible futures of a system (indium) that has an important dependence on the function of another bigger system (zinc). To achieve that a simulation model was built to explore uncertainties and to analyse what causes scarcities. The purpose of the model is to generate thousands of plausible futures in order to create and capture behaviours of interest and to explain them. Indium and many other by-produced minerals have similar market conditions and expectations of growing demand hence; the purpose of this study is also to give general insights in by-produced systems and to produce a model that is generic enough to explore other types of by-produced minerals. The methods used in this thesis are System Dynamics (SD) and Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA). These methods are used together as Exploratory Systems Dynamics Modelling and Analysis ESDMA for the building of the simulation model (SD) and the exploration and analysis (ESDMA) of plausible future situations. ESDMA is a new multi-method and a special emphasis is on using and testing developed tools of ESDMA and to give insights into the usefulness of the method for analysing uncertainties of systems under deep uncertainty. The model built for this study is a generic model capturing the dynamics of supply and demand for indium and zinc and their dynamic relation. The model results indicate that many plausible futures of indium scarcities could be generated. In these futures, scarcities of indium is generated by the weak supply of zinc, high recycling of zinc and low recycling efforts for indium. The model indicates that in the first 30 years, supply of indium has little problems over the entire uncertainty space. After the first 30 years supplying indium becomes difficult, due to growth in demand, lags in zinc supply and poor market conditions of indium. Indium in slags and tailings of zinc can prove to be useful to mitigate scarcities in case it is feasible to refine the indium from those sources. The use of ESDMA can prove to be useful for exploring systems under deep uncertainties. The many plausible futures generated can be hard to generate with traditional scenario analysis where only few scenarios can be explored. As uncertainties often arise, due to lack of agreement of what generates a situation or what the effects could be, ESDMA proves to be very suitable to include different points of view and to test the difference in plausible behaviours generated. Analysing what causes what with the method is still difficult, because plausible behaviours can be many and understanding all of them is time consuming. Improving interaction with the ensemble of results and the analyst would improve the method because it can help in understanding and analysing results.","Mineral scarcity; Indium; Uncertainty; Systems Dynamics; Exploratory Systems Dynamics Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-11-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Schifferstein, H.N.J. (mentor)","2011","The aim of this master thesis was to start a new venture in the shaving industry. It was concluded that the new venture creation process consists of three main phases; (1) exploration, (2) realisation, and (3) exploitation. The focus of this graduation project is on the first phase. The exploration phase is all about creating a vision for the new business. The main research question of this graduation project therefore is: ""What is the business vision for the new venture?"" A visioning process was carried out on three distinct levels; market, product, and business. Developing a market vision and a product vision served as the building blocks in drafting the business vision. A market vision was developed by conducting both desk research as field research. The field research was conducted in the form of twenty-five interviews with experts from different industries. This analysis led to a set of interesting developments of which two were selected to focus on; (1) men's growing concern for their identity, and (2) the need for moments of freedom. The motive for taking this position is twofold; Firstly, these two meta-developments were selected since there are basically no players in this specific field yet. Secondly, it was hypothesized that by focusing on these two developments, a new venture could have a higher added value for the user than with the other developments. The concern for identity and the need for moments of freedom are issues that can have an effect on people’s wellbeing. The market vision is presented as follows: “The future of shaving is all about the unconscious significance of the process of shaving.” The market vision served as a starting point for developing the product vision. To come to a sound vision, the Vision in Product design method was used. Based on this method the following design statement has been developed: “I want to offer men a shaving ritual which facilitates in gaining a higher sense of self-agency“ Self-agency in this case means that one has control over his actions, thoughts, surroundings, and emotions. Based on a thorough analysis of both interaction qualities as product qualities, a concept was developed. This concept is inspired from the activity of ‘keeping a journal’ and focuses on self-agency. Keeping a journal fits very well within the market vision. Having a sense of self-agency is important in dealing with your identity. Keeping a journal also allows one to take a moment for himself to reflect. Despite of the advantages of keeping a journal, it is a product that is difficult to maintain as it asks for regular engagement. This is where the link with shaving is made. After having developed the market vision and the product vision, the research question of this project could be answered. The following vision was drafted for the business: “To become a highly respected brand known for facilitating men in their pursuit of a successful life” A successful life in this case means that one does what he loves and realizes his dreams. In a world where the concern for identity is increasing and where moments of freedom are becoming a luxury, this is a big opportunity. Mindfulness activities like meditation and yoga are becoming increasingly popular. Men however feel a burden to engage in these types of activities. This is where the opportunity lies. Offering men rituals that are aimed at helping them in their pursuit to a successful life. The threshold for engaging in these rituals is very low and could thus be interesting for them. Furthermore, making the link with shaving has two main advantages; Firstly, it is something they can easily incorporate in their daily lives. Secondly, shaving is a very masculine act which makes this topic of identity more accessible. This business vision will be communicated to the target audience in the form of a story. The story is about a man named Mr Maroosh. Mr Maroosh is a man who finds himself at a crossroad in his life. He is left wondering whether he is living the life he wants to live. In an attempt to find an answer he decides to go on a journey. During this journey he meets the most brilliant and visionary men that have ever lived. He spends time with Plato, Darwin, Shakespeare, etc. He spends time with them to learn about their lives, their activities, about their rituals. Whenever he encounters something that helps him towards a more successful life he will make sure that he shares this with the world. The first thing he notices is that men like Charles Darwin, Theodore Roosenvelt and Andrew Carnegie all kept a journal. He decides that he also wants to make this ritual part of his life. He does this in a way that he can easily incorporate it in his daily activities. He presents this in the form of a shaving ritual.","New Venture; Visioning; Shaving; Self-agency; Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-11-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

According to the simulations, the fabricated oscillator is a competitive one among the RC-time-constant based ones, but the measurements showed that the tradeoff between performance and integration (accompanied with power minimization) is worse than its counterparts (MEMs based or LC based all-silicon choices), or its quartz crystal based ancestor.

(mentor)","2011","To improve the lightering conditions of bulk carriers in the outer harbor of IJmuiden, the lightering facility will be transfered to a new harbor basin that will be implemented at the location of the dredging depot in the former Averij harbor. The Dutch Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management (RWS) demands that down time of the lightering operations inside the new basin does not exceed 5% of the operating time of 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Down time of the lightering operation can be caused by several issues. This thesis investigates the contribution of long waves with wave periods between 10 and 250 seconds to the down time conditions. Theoretically this long wave climate can cause high ship response as incoming wave periods are close to the bulk carrier's natural periods. The long waves can also cause resonance in the new basin or in the outer harbor as a whole. A coupled system of basin resonance and ship response is also investigated as the two separate resonance systems can enforce each other for certain wave periods. Investigating a 200.000 DWT bulk carrier's Response Amplitude Operators for an open water situation concludes that the bulk carrier experiences enforced movement in its horizontal motions for wave periods around 250 seconds and in its vertical motions for wave periods between 15 and 20 seconds. In the real time situation the ship's horizontal motions will be damped by the mooring system and the high resonance periods will not be met. The numerical wave model PHAROS has been used to analyze whether resonance patterns arise in the outer harbor basins for a wave period band between 10 and 250 seconds. It is concluded that the new basin can experience resonance for wave periods between 100 and 250 seconds. The highest wave amplification of 4.5 times the incoming wave height at sea occurs for an incoming wave period of 147 seconds. The amplified wave height inside the new basin will not contribute to down time conditions as the amplified wave height is lower than the critical wave height of 0.80 meter. The implementation of the new basin has a positive ffect on the area of the outer harbor behind the Fort island. Especially in the Hoogoven harbor and at the Noorder ship lock wave agitation decreases. However, standing waves may arise between the new basin and the opposing IJmond harbor if sufficient wave energy is present in the incoming wave climate. The results of the coupled system of basin resonance and bulk carrier vertical response do not result in a contribution to the down time criteria. Although amplified waves can become a factor 4.5 larger than the incoming wave heights, earlier investigation and observations and analyses in this study show that the incoming wave energy for long waves is low and the probability of incoming waves amplifying into waves of critical wave heights that cause down time to the lightering process is very little. The contribution to the down time of the new basin is very small in comparison to the contribution of wind and locally generated wind waves.","IJmuiden; long waves; basin resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

The conceptual model is an activity-on-node flight schedule representation where a delay can propagate through either the lines of flight or via a passenger connection if the resource is not ready. Through a Monte-Carlo simulation per flight a relation is made and visualized between the duration of the primary delay and the delay severity, i.e. the number of flights the primary delay affects downstream. From this the Expected Delay Severity is derived, a proposed flight robustness metric, where the delay severity curve is weighed against the probability of a primary delay. The simulation has been validated using empirical data from the operations of Kenya Airways. Integrating passenger connectivity is found to be essential in representing the true delay propagation in a hub-and-spoke network. Implementation at Kenya Airways can be realized by a pro-active approach that uses the stochastic simulation of delay propagation and allows to control the system impact of disruptions by identifying factors that can improve schedule stability. Several flight-retiming improvements have been made and implemented using the proposed methodology.","robust planning; flight scheduling; simulation; delay severity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-04","Aerospace Engineering","Air Transport and Operations","","Master Thesis","",""

(mentor); Van Kuijk, J.I. (mentor)","2011","Goal The original goal of the project was to find a way in which a captured design process can hold added value to the designer, and to design a tool in which this can be made possible. Current ways of documenting design processes are too much of a burden. The project has led to a design proposal of a tool for design teams, to facilitate meetings. During the meeting, important decisions are documented in a way that is intuitive for the designer. By doing this, the tool can help designers to evaluate their project better on the long term. Literature study The goal of the literature study was to explore the scope of the project. From this study, it was found that documenting in a tool should not be burden for a designer. To make the process of documenting more appealing, benefits on the short term should be provided. Also, it was found that the context of the captured information should be clear. User research Two rounds of user research were executed. To begin with, user interviews were held with designers to find situations in which a captured design process could be useful. These situations were found in three topics: evaluation and reflection, being new in a project or a team and the reuse of information from past projects. These three topics were explored more in a participatory workshop. From the workshop, I choose the topic of evaluation and reflection to continue with. Information about decisions, motivations and consequences was needed for this. Choice for meetings Two fairly broad concepts were evaluated with designers. In this evaluation, it became clear that I had to choose a more specific focus to continue with. This focus was found in meetings. An important reason for this choice was that meetings provide a natural moment to document important decisions. Also, being able to run an efficient meeting is a short term benefit for the designer. Meetings are also an opportunity to add context to the decisions. Design Using user scenarios and an iterative process of sketching, a design proposal was created in wireframes. This design proposal is a tool that can be used in different stages of a meeting. It is used prior to a meeting, to plan the meeting and prepare the attendees by showing the agenda and the work to discuss. During the meeting, the results are documented and immediately structured. The meeting minutes provide a way to document the meeting in an intuitive way. After the meeting, the tool is used to read back the results, what has been decided, and what everybody has to do. Also, new work can be added afterwards for others to give feedback on. The tool uses elements which are linked in a hierarchy. Projects contain meetings, which contain agenda items. Conclusions can be added to these agenda items, and tasks can be added to the conclusions. By connecting everything, it makes it easier to determine what the motivations were behind certain meeting results. On the long term, these connections can help with project evaluation, because they show what was decided (in conclusions), and what was done (in tasks). Evaluation In a user test, the design proposal was tested with designers, using a paper prototype. Participants were rather positive about the concept, and thought it would be useful in their own context. They liked the fact that it was the results are stored in a central point. Some negative points were also discovered, like in the way the results are added. Furthermore, to use the tool effectively for evaluation, it should be integrated with a planning, or provide a way to show the results on a timeline of a certain period.","meetings; facilitation; user-centered; users; evaluation; conclusions; tasks; connections; user testing; wireframes; flowchart","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Buijs, J.A. (mentor); Van Trigt, P. (mentor)","2011","Hangar 36 is part of the Bink 36 complex that is owned by Vestia. Some entrepreneurs see the potential of a group of multi-disciplined, talented and creative entrepreneurs in one location and are interested in structurally benefit from this potential. Every company in Hangar 36 is successful in its own market, but initiating and participating in collaborative projects lost its relevance to most of the entrepreneurs. This project investigates the possibilities for Hangar 36 and answers the question: How can the entrepreneurs in Hangar 36 structurally benefit from their presence in a spatial cluster which is shared by a group of multi-disciplinary, talented and creative entrepreneurs? First an analysis is performed that investigated theory on the origin of spatial clusters, collaborative entrepreneurship (Ribeiro-Soriano & Urbano, 2009) and communities of practice (Akkermans, Petter & de Laat, 2008; Wenger, 1998). It was found that relevance towards collaboration and a sense of belonging to the group are two very important aspects that have to receive enough attention before thinking about coordination and organization. This is described as engaging in meaningful and shared activities (Akkermans et al., 2008). The current situation in Hangar 36 was analyzed by interviewing every entrepreneur on a number of topics. It was found that collaboration was considered important, but past attempts were considered irrelevant by a number of entrepreneurs after a while. A number of examples of collaborative clusters have been visited. The two factors that found to influence the difference in collaborative activity within a spatial cluster the most are the clusters’ primary goals and the level of management within the cluster. This results in the classification of four types of clusters: Facilitator, Incubator, Collective and Accumulator. It was found that the original intention from Hangar 36 did not thrive because it tried to fit too many different categories at the same time. In the current situation Hangar 36 is classified as an accumulator. The visited examples served as a source of inspiration for opportunities for Hangar 36. A set of criteria is composed from the strengths and bottlenecks found in the interviews. Combining these criteria transforms these opportunities into 5 diverging concept directions. The concepts were presented to the entrepreneurs during a lunch session that included a group discussion with the purpose to find out which aspects are perceived as relevant in terms of collaboration. The outcome of the discussion was converged and summarized in the following mentality. Hangar 36 should be an engine for the participating businesses. Potential clients should know the name, and the location should attract clients as well. Any activity that distracts too much from executing core business activities is not appreciated at this point. This mentality was the starting point for diverging into a second round of idea generation. The mentality is transformed in two separate questions. The ideas take the set of criteria that have been derived earlier into account and were designed to be practical, implementable and affordable on a small budget. The second gathering was in the form of a creative session. The entrepreneurs picked their favorite ideas and supplemented and improved them. Furthermore, they have identified the required tasks for implementation and the steps that contain these tasks. The ideas were accommodated with a catchy title by the entrepreneurs and presented to each other. A roadmap describes how this project could have an impact on the further development of Hangar 36 on an abstract level, by cycling through the dimensions of communities of practice (as defined by Wenger, 1998). The ideas from the second session were digitalized and combined in the form of an idea catalog. The digital versions of the ideas are also contained in this report. The catalog was printed and presented to Hangar 36 as a means to physically take the ideas to the next meetings.","collaboration; communities; group decision; motivation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","MSc Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Zijlstra, J.J. (mentor); De Vries, A. (mentor)","2011","During this graduation project a sustainable activity for the C2C-Islands was researched and designed, with Ameland as main context. It was chosen to develop a C2C picnic set, because this matches the current activities (mainly outdoor) that are undertaken and possibilities that are available (local foods and excellent picnic facilities). The Pre-Design section of this report is all about the steps before the actual designing. It explains the context and goals of this specific project. For this project most of the business partners were searched and found throughout the project. The section starts with an introduction on the players involved and their relations to each other. This is followed by the problem definition, which describes the problems on sustainability, C2C, tourism and other island related problems that need to be tackled. The problem definition is followed by the actual assignment and deliverables of the project. The section ends with a description of the combined methodology; this methodology has been used throughout the project and proved to be very useful for structuring the design. It is mainly about designing roadmap based local services. The second section is about the analysis. It defines a framework for the ideas, concepts and the final design. As stated in the methodology paragraph, during the analysis phase it is important to build a strong foundation for the rest of the project. The focus of the analysis was on the environment of the picnic set, available materials, target group, market and finally the product itself. The chosen ideas from this section focused on very different aspects to be able to explore different directions, namely: small sized sets, experience sets and independency sets. The three concept directions were merged from eight different idea directions. The third section covers detailing the sets from ideas to concepts and evaluating them when they are detailed up to a sufficient level. This detailing is partially based on information from the analysis phase, but also on new information obtained. Both tourist and business partners indicated that are most interested in the small sized and experience sets, therefore, it was decided not to continue with the independency set. The sustainability evaluation indicated that both sets are very sustainable compared to the services they will replace. The fourth section describes the model building, it indicated that the experience set is too complicated for now and it was decided to solitary continue with the small sized set. This final set is detailed up to a level that it is almost completely ready for production. The sales system, which is partial about renting and partial about sales, will be explained in more detail. The fifth and final section is used to evaluate the product and process and to give recommendations for the continuation of the project. It was chosen to present the outcomes in a process report, where information is presented followed by conclusions and actions. This is done for two reasons, first of all to explain to the reader why the design turned out the way it is. Second of all it is done to give the committee and others (students) insight into the process, what went well and what went wrong.","Cradle-to-Cradle; Sustainability; Local; Recycle; Product Service System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Design for Sustainability","",""

(mentor); Van Breemen, E. (mentor)","2011","Inspired on an ergonomic study on the in- and egress of persons with reduced mobility in aircraft I developed an algorithm to improve the comfort of individual passengers by allocating them specific seats. The algorithm uses information which is already at the disposal of airlines to specify certain groups of passengers. Based on their group, the algorithm then allocates them to seats in different zones in an aircraft cabin. Passengers are likely to be less disturbed by others when they are seated amongst peers. This can be used to improve the comfort of different types of passengers without having a negative effect on the cost per passenger per mile. Airlines can then cater both services and tangible products to very different groups of customers within the same aircraft. The algorithm is designed to be adapted to an airlines business model or preferred segment in the market. Since graduation in the direction Integrated Product Development also involves engineering tangible products, an integrated check in kiosk was designed as well. By integrating luggage drop-off, obtaining boarding documents and the cue for customs, there is the possibility to reduce per-flight waiting time. Final production was done with the assistance of an experienced programmer.

(mentor)","2011","Patent collection is increasing incrementally. Most of the new technological information is from patent documents, and retrieving specific patents in such a large pool of documents has become a challenging issue for both patent examiners and normal/inexperienced users. Nowadays, most of the retrieval systems (patent retrieval systems) search for the exact match of the query string inside the collection to return a result. However, based on natural language processing, most words have different meanings and each concept can be expressed by more than one word. Since patent documents include lots of new technical terms, searching among them by exact match needs lots of experiences and it is an exhausting task. In this study we aim to investigate this problem by using expansion techniques. We propose a new semantic expansion approach, namely, vector-based semantic expansion (VSE). To do the expansion, we use external knowledge sources, WordNet and Wikipedia. We also examine the affects of using their combination on the expansion results. We do word (VSWE), query (VSQE), and document (VSDE) expansion in this thesis to demonstrate the performance of our approach. We show that our approach with combination of these two knowledge sources can be effective to find similarity between two units of language which might be word, sentence or text. We apply our technique on Miller and Charles dataset to find word-word similarity. Also, our experiments which are based on clef-ip 2011 shows that our technique increases the recall-rate in query expansion, especially for shorter queries.","semantic web; information retrieval; query/document expansion; patent retrieval; word silimarity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Computer science, Information Architecture (IA) track, Web information systems (WIS) group","",""

(mentor); Abel, F. (mentor); Hollink, L. (mentor); Visser, E. (mentor)","2011","This research is about the influence of link prediction on the evolution of communities on Twitter. We collected tweets from three technology micro-bloggers who led us through their followings and tweets to tens of thousands of unique users over several weeks. We analyzed conventional and alternative information streams for these micro-bloggers based on URLs embedded in their tweets and in tweets of followees and followees-of-followees. We model users based on the most recent URLs embedded on their tweets and the latest users they follow, from which we infer links and extract semantic entities that are indicative of their interests. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline of methods for user modeling and personalization of communities of interest on Twitter. We test the performance of different organizational principles in community design, including the principles of hierarchy, user interests and the baseline follower mechanism on Twitter, which is based on user intuitions. The goal of this thesis is to create a better notion of community by automatically calculating adaptive and personalized structures of followees that produce highly interesting content. Designing communities in this way is use- ful because it enables people to know in which community they are organized during a given period of time and because it enables community-based recommendations. Furthermore, designing communities based on organizational principles enables their automatic construction. Currently, communities are manually constructed by users through a tedious process of following and unfollowing which is based on disconnected user intuitions. We investigate whether it is possible to infer links between Twitter users who are not explicitly connected on Twitter and explore whether such automatically inferred social networks would allow for improving content recommendations on Twitter.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Boess, S.U. (mentor)","2011","A design study was carried out for the development of data/power transmission interface of Robert Bosch Healthcare’s telehealth products for elderly care. The scope of the project included the redesign of data/power transmission interface of an existing activity monitoring system (MoMo) and a complete new design of a wireless telehealth platform (NXG), consisting of a handheld tablet device and a docking station. The focus was on creating robust connection for reliable data/power transmission and easy interaction mode for the targeted patients with physical and sensorial impairments. An initial empirical study performed with thirteen elderly participants and existing products with specific connection properties revealed great diversity in physical and intellectual capabilities, levels of experience and disposition towards technology, and varied levels of functional aptitude and preferences regarding different electronic products. The results were used to generate initial design ideas. Based on conceptual prototypes, user evaluation was carried out with seven elderly participants, with the primary objective of finding the link between the sensorial elements and factors that directly influence usability (physical ergonomics, use cues and feedback indicators) and the secondary objective of identifying how these sensorial elements affect perceived aesthetics and the user’s preference. The main findings: a product must provide adequate visual cues to illicit a proper mental model upon initial encounter and provide further visual, tactile or auditory feedback to reinforce, create or correct the initial mental model. Results of the concept evaluation were used to generate the following new major design features: contours of major surfaces of each product serve as primary visual and tactile guidance, while secondary geometrical constraint is provided to ensure consistent docking performance; spring-loaded connectors are chosen for their customizability, greater durability, and inconspicuousness; newly specified contact force requirements are 10-30g per connector pin for MoMo and 30-50g per pin for NXG; feedback indicators are integrated directly into the main appliances rather than their docking stations. Material selection was carried out based on sensorial, metaphysical and technical requirements. A simplified analysis and selection (exploring, assorting, analyzing and selecting) approach was taken for each level of material hierarchy until the specific sub-class of materials was reached. Specific grades of materials were not selected in this project. The final prototypes of this project, but not presented in this report, include product details to match the sensorial, intangible and short-term structural qualities of the production scale. The next step is a small-series production of prototypes with highly accurate representation of aesthetic, tactile and functional qualities. When the form and functional characteristics of the product are confirmed, the design must undergo further optimization to resolve all issues related to production and long-term use.","design; telehealth; elderly; usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-11-23","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor); Veeke, H.P.M. (mentor); Burgers, J. (mentor)","2011","Container traffic has grown exponentially since 1980 and has become a reliable and efficient means of transportation of goods. In addition, world wide containerization and the availability of cheap and frequent container transport to all corners of the world have had a profound influence on industrial production, transport and the environment. All these aspects result in increasing the pressure on container terminals to provide good service to shipping companies. The Royal Haskoning Maritime Division (hereafter, RHMD) deals internationally with development of different types of terminals such as container, liquid and dry bulk. Due to involvement of numerous stockholders in a port planning project, different design concepts may be considered to satisfy interests of different stockholder; therefore, various scenarios should be studied quantitatively. As an international maritime consultant, it is of crucial importance to own a simple and cheap tool to estimate the dimension of a container terminal. The goal of this study is to develop a tool for engineers to prepare concepts of terminal layout, and estimate the required areas of those concepts, for sake of comparison, for design of a new container terminal. Container terminal design is divided into “waterside” and “landside” areas. Waterside consists of a quay for serving vessels. Landside consists of a storage yard for stacking containers and a hinterland area for serving truck and trains. The developed package, in two consecutive steps, first, accepts the waterside, landside and cost estimation information, such as terminal throughput, downtime, stack occupancy, and second, requires the possible equipment concepts, such as ship to shore cranes and reach stackers etc. Based on the above input data, the performance of the terminal concepts is quantitatively evaluated. Eventually, the dimensions of the container terminal yard are presented. The container terminal design tool is verified against two formerly performed projects (in India and Guatemala) that have been successfully designed at RHMD. The validation showed good performance of the tool, with justified differences compared to actual designed values. As a case study, the package is also applied on design of a container terminal for a port in Angola. In this case study, four different scenarios and their impacts on layout dimensions are considered and analyzed.","container terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2011","In the Netherlands, every year 200.000 pupils make the transition from primary to secondary education. Selecting a secondary school is no longer as ‘simple’ as finding a school with the same religious views. Pupils and parents want to know more information about schools, like quality and atmosphere. Some of them have easy access to information, while others have no idea where to start. This is caused by the fact that in some regions printed guides are distributed that help pupils and parents in the process. However, in most parts of the Netherlands there is no central ‘place to go’ when you want to find information about schools. Subjective information like atmosphere and ‘how the teachers are’ is hard to capture in a guide or on a website. Pupils and parents get a good idea about it at open days and it plays a big role in the final decision. When pupils and parents are however still orienting for schools they are interested in information that can be captured on a website, like the satisfaction of other pupils or the profile of the school. The website ‘Schoolkompas’, the result from this project, provides an answer to this need. It is meant to be the central place to go for all pupils and parents that need to find a secondary school. On the website they can find all information they need in order to make a well considered selection of schools. The digital appearance of Schoolkompas makes it possible to offer up-to-date information. Next to that, Schoolkompas offers an easy way to compare schools. Information is standardized so good comparisons are possible. With the gathered information in mind pupils and parents can visit open days well prepared and eventually select the school that suits them best. How does it work? Schoolkompas guides pupils and parents in four steps:  Schools can be searched on a map  Schools can be compared at fifteen characteristics  Schools can be added to a list of favourite schools  General information for visiting schools is provided The fifteen characteristics are carefully chosen based on research: 1. School supply 2. School profile 3. Satisfaction of pupils 4. Satisfaction of parents 5. Safety 6. Involvement 7. Filling in of cancelled lessons 8. Group sizes 9. Learning gains 10. Study rate 11.

Five PV technologies are currently commercially available, however because the PV market is characterised by increasing returns to adoption, it is expected one dominant design will eventually emerge. This research is the first to study the factors that affect technology selection in the PV market. In the first part of this research existing frameworks on dominant designs, expert interviews and (non-)scientific literature are used to arrive at a list of 20 factors influencing technology selection in the PV market. Moreover, four additional factors were found that are in favour of the coexistence of multiple designs. In the second part, from the list of 20 factors, 13 were selected to be analysed via a questionnaire on their importance in the technology selection process of PV manufactures. Also the current status of PV technologies regarding these factors was analysed using a questionnaire. The questionnaires were structured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and filled in by industry experts; data was analysed using the crisp and fuzzy (logarithmic fuzzy preference programming) AHP method. Results indicate that there are only minor differences between the two data analysis methods; in both methods the category of factors standard support strategy is most important (with a relative importance of ±47%), followed by characteristics of the standard (±29%), characteristics of the standard supporter (±18%) and other stakeholders (±6%). Similarly, pricing and technological superiority are the most influential factors (±20%), and mono-crystalline silicon has the best chance to become the future dominant design (a chance of 30%). The outcomes also show that existing frameworks do not fully describe selection in the PV market, since the factors policy and law needed to be introduced.","dominant designs; technology selection; photovoltaic technologies; analytic hierarchy process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-05","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy, and Entrepreneurship","","Management of technology","",""

(mentor); Giovanni, B. (mentor)","2011","The primary gas reservoirs in the Southern Dutch offshore are in decline. Discoveries of new gas reservoirs are getting smaller and smaller reservoirs receive more attention. The three major carbonate beds in the Basal Zechstein (Z1C, Z2C and Z3C) are considered potential secondary gas reservoirs. To be able to develop the gas from these carbonates depends strongly on the presence of fractures. The fracture pattern of the Zechstein carbonates in the Dutch offshore is however not well known. Currently the most reliable methods to investigate fractures in the boreholes are borehole-wall imaging techniques. These imaging techniques are expensive and time-consuming and most of the time not included in the logging suite. Therefore, an alternative method of predicting fractures using basic wireline logs (Gamma ray, sonic, density, photoelectrics, resistivity and caliper) would be very valuable. In this study an artificial neural network (ANN) is developed in order to make fracture predictions based on wireline log data. Additional the ability of indicating fractures with a decision tree is explored for wells that have too few logs available for a ANN approach. Both the ANN and decision tree are trained with supervised learning. The models are calibrated using core data (rotary sidewall core and slabbed core data) of fractured and non-fractured Zechstein carbonate intervals. The ANN is trained with success, where the degree of success is directly related to the amount of fractures identified in the core. The DCT approach resulted in a moderate fracture prediction performance and is best used in combination with an ANN. With this combination a fracture prediction has been made on several wells that were excluded from training with these two methods. The resulting fracture predictions have been compared with indications of mud losses and productivity data, showing a good match.","fractures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering/ Applied Geology/ Applied gophysics and petrophysics/ Geo-Engineering/ Resources Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Artificial beach and foreshore nourishments, as executed widely along the Dutch coast, change the nearshore morphology and current patterns significantly. Over the last decades the size of the nourishments has increased from 0.7 x 106 m3/km to over 6 x 106 m3/km. Groynes which were present along the southern Holland coast since the 19th century are now (partly) covered with sand. As a result, entirely new dynamic coastlines and beach configurations are found at several locations along the southern Holland coast. This major impact on the beach configuration (disappearance of groynes, alongshore variations in shoreline amongst others) changes the currents swimmers and lifeguards were familiar with. This leads to uncertainty and concerns of lifeguards and (local) governments regarding swimmer safety, especially for the beach season after construction of the nourishment. Two research objectives are formulated: 1) investigate the relevant aspects of nearshore currents and beach configurations with respect to swimmer safety and 2) investigate the regime for which rip currents are likely to form on a groyned and groyneless beach along the wind sea dominated South Holland coast. A monitoring campaign of the beach season of 2010 in The Hague was initiated in cooperation with the lifeguards. Experiences and observations of the lifeguards with respect to swimmer safety on the groyned (unnourished) and groyneless (nourished) beach were discussed. Lifeguard reports of the rescue brigades of The Hague and ‘s Gravenzande (another rescue brigade on the frequently nourished Delfland Coast 13 km south of Scheveningen) were collected for a period of over 6 years to assess critical conditions and locations. Rescue research parameters (wind, waves, tide, temperature, cloud cover, precipitation amongst others) at times of the rescues were compared to seasonal occurrence of the parameters to investigate a causal relation between the parameters and swimmer safety. Detailed lagrangian current measurements were performed on the groyned and groyneless (nourished) beach of Scheveningen, using GPS drifters. The measurements took place for a selected set of conditions, which, according to the analysis of the lifeguard rescue reports, caused many rescues in the past. Bottom topography of the nourished beach was surveyed just before or after the current measurements using PWC (jetski) surveys around high tide and low wave energy conditions. The sub aqueous surveys were complemented with RTK GPS 4wd- and walking surveys on the sub aerial beach around low tide, giving a coverage from -5 to +3 m above MSL. The acquired field data is analysed to identify hazardous currents, locations and to quantify the order of magnitude of the hazardous currents. The regime for the occurrence of rip currents along the open nourished beach and near groynes is investigated. In a synthesis of the analysis results seven aspects of nearshore currents and beach configuration were formulated, which need to be evaluated in order to make a comprehensive assessment of the impact of nearshore currents and beach configuration on swimmer safety at a certain location. The occurrence of rip currents on open beaches along the wind sea dominated South Holland coast was shown to be strongly related to and limited by the longshore current magnitude. Rip currents were observed when long- and cross shore current velocities were of the same order of magnitude, which was observed only for near-normally incident waves. No rip currents were observed when longshore current velocities were approximately three times higher than cross shore velocities, which was observerd for breaking wave angles of incidence larger than 10° to 15°. Wave angle of incidence, wave height, wave period, tidal level and vertical variations in bottom topography within the surf zone were identified as crucial factors in the occurrence of rip currents along the wind sea dominated Dutch coast. Conceptual swimmer safety tools were presented for application by lifeguards on a groyned and open beach. Based on the above mentioned (and readily assessable) parameters the relative risk on rip currents can be estimated.","nearshore; currents; surfzone; swimmer; safety; lifeguards; dutch; coast; beach; morphology; statistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor); Os, K.V. (mentor); Luitjens, S. (mentor)","2011","Many professionals suffer from regular pain in the joints as a result of their work. In such cases, traditional light therapy, for example-Infrared light could be beneficial by enhancing blood circulation deep in the skin. Many of joint pain sufferers have used an Infrared lamp to relieve their pain after work at home. They are satisfied with the pain relief effects, but feel restricted in movement during the15-minutes treatment of the Infrared lamp. With the LED technology's development, several kinds of pain relief products which use LEDs instead of Infrared bulbs come to the market. These LEDs pain relief products are smaller and lighter comparing with traditional Infrared lamp, but they still cannot fulfill consumer's requirements on easy operation and high mobility. Users still have limitations due to electronic wires remote, or complex operation way. This need for more mobility and simple operation can be addressed with a wearable pain relief product for joints. By understanding how light acts, and leveraging its expertise in LED and textile technology, Philips has created a unique platform for the development of effective light-based therapies. The first conceptual product of these therapies is the BlueTouch Pain Relief Patch for shoulder and back pain sufferers which uses blue LED light to induce production of Nitric Oxide (NO) in the skin. NO is proven to trigger a number of protective and preventive processes in the body, helping to heal in a natural manner. Based on this blue light platform for pain relief Philips want to further discover the opportunities of this kind of blue light patch for joint pain users. This has been the start of this graduation project. Firstly, several research sessions with potential users were carried out to learn what the potential users need for joint pain relief and what characteristics of pain relief products they like according to their using experience. It appeared that, joint pain sufferers want to relieve their pain not only at home, but also at daytime when they suffer strong pain during work. A joint pain relief product should be very easy to operate and feels really convenient during light therapy. Generally people do not want to wear it the whole day, but preferably use it during breaks and relaxing time besides work time. They would like to use this kind of product to help them reducing the pain during recovery and speed up the healing process. LEDs can be integrated into textiles. The main challenge for this joint pain relief patch is to find what kind of appearance would convince consumers and which kind of form with relevant interaction would fulfill user's pain relief and ergonomics requirements. Several concepts were generated and evaluated with relevant experts and potential users. Three detailed concepts with rough models were made to gain users feedback on finding meaningful form and interactions. The design named ""Enjoint"" was designed and further developed according to the results from former studies. ""Enjoint"" is simple, flexible and intelligent, can be easily operated and provides high mobility for users. Its unisex design is for both male and female: The appearance has professional impression which can convince consumer to purchase, meanwhile it doesn't show unhealthy impression like traditional clinical tools (for example, the bandage). Several optical rubber covers were designed to provide micro-massage effects for improving pain relief effects. Users were especially enthusiastic about the mobility and ease of use of the product. The soft and breathable materials provides for a proper relaxing experience without overheating. Most of the users were convinced by the appearance of the product on its simple, professional and Philips' looking. Users can easily understand and operate the product themselves by the button on patch or APP in smart phone. The participants in user testing showed high interest on the blue lights, they like both how it looks and how it feels. They feel relaxing by the light's effect and think they are getting a professional treatment by the product's professional looking (especially with blue light turned on). The ""micro-massage design"" works by users unconsciously grasp during therapy, but it's also found it may leave patterns on the skin which arose user's worry. A next step for Philips, in the feasibility study of this concept includes quantitative consumer validation, functional proof of principle, and product's detailing.","light therapy; blue LED-light; joint pain relief","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-11-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","Design for Interaction Master","",""

A case study was performed within the weekly online meetings of Microsoft’s Dynamics User Experience team and investigate the three design themes in this context. An interaction vision was applied to explore the relations between these three themes and to develop the facilitator guide. This vision played a crucial role throughout the project. It explains the focus on the facilitator, how he uses the interface for meeting facilitation and how the same interface supports social interactions between the team members. This guide consists of facilitation instructions and design guidelines for the interface of the online meeting application. The facilitator only needs to apply the online meeting application, since all instructions are embodied in its interface. The interface functions as a script for the facilitator to guide the online meeting process. Technical preparation, uploading content, defining type, - activities and - goals for the meeting as well as recording, managing and storing the meeting content and collecting team member’s objectives, all are tasks the facilitator can carry out with this interface. The interface is the central hub for all meeting information, communication and it facilitates the social interactions between team members.

The effects of the hydrodynamic external conditions on the currents in the surfzone are investigated. Then the reset is studied in details in order to understand the role of the different processes taken into account by the numerical model. The significant role of the longshore currents induced by oblique wave incidence is clearly assessed. In addition, the long wave orbital velocities as well as the mean flow related to the short wave forcing control the stirring of sediments and influence the time scale of the reset-event.","nearshore sandbars; reset; Xbeach; Delft3D; infragravity waves; subtidal bar; process-based modelling; nearshore sediment transport; bar migration; storm; Truc Vert","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

Therefore this research examines the technical feasibility of timber as a load bearing structure in medium rise buildings based on Dutch design requirements. The use of timber in Dutch medium rise buildings is examined by designing a 12 storey high hotel using timber as the primary load bearing structure. The design of the structure is based on cross laminated timber (CLT) panels.

(mentor)","2011","In recent years, various types of plate-like timber materials have been introduced to the building industry, offering a wide range of new possibilities. Due to a lack of knowledge on these possibilities, in the Netherlands, the material is not used as often as could be expected. To explore the boundaries of timber engineering, in this thesis, it is investigated whether it is feasible to engineer a stadium structure that is composed of timber elements to the utmost extent. The focus within this feasibility study is on the structural system, the floors and the grandstands. The roof structure is not included, since it appeared that such structures are already common in practice. As a reference, use is made of the architectural design of the Euroborg stadium, which was designed and engineered by BAM Advies & Engineering in recent years. The first part of the thesis provides an introduction to the most important aspects concerning the design and engineering of a stadium structure. Next to that, reference projects are discussed to provide insight in the possibilities of timber as a structural material. The preliminary design is elaborated on in the second part of the thesis. Investigating several structural systems it is found that a timber core system proves to be most beneficial. Decisive factors are the excellent fitting to the existing architectural design and the ease of erection. The proposed cores have a height of 19.22 m and are compiled from 4 walls, having a width of 5 m each, which are made from LVL elements. Analysing various floor products that are available on the market, timber hollow core elements called Lignatur appeared to be most beneficial to be implemented in the design. These span 14.4 m between the front and the back façades of the stadium structure and are supported by glued laminated timber support beams. Accounting for the required free height at the distinct floors, the span-width of these beams is limited to 9.65 m. When the grandstands are concerned, 4-tier elements made from LVL are introduced. Accounting for grandstand elements with an increased riser height the maximum span-width becomes 10.4 m, where vibrations are governing and under the condition that the grandstand support beams are infinitesimally stiff. Accounting for Glulam support beams, the maximum span-width decreases to a certain extent. In the detailed design phase, the feasibility of the proposed structural system is considered more in detail. At first, the structural behaviour lintels that are present in the core walls are investigated. It appears that these comply with all requirements. Evaluating the preliminary design phase, an expert on construction technology posed questions on the erection of timber cores with the proposed dimensions. It has therefore been investgated what structural consequences it holds when the core is divided in storey-high segments. It appeared that several measures are required to transfer the acting stresses at the horizontal joints. A feasible solution is acquired by applying a combined system consisting of glued-in rods and shear plates. Subsequently research has been performed on the distinct connections that are present at the LVL core. Due to the limited dimensions of the LVL elements (max 2.5 m), a large number of fasteners is required to obtain the required wall width of 5 m. The above is considered undesirable, wherefore it was investigated whether the core walls could be compiled from CLT elements, which are available in widths up to 4.8 m. Accounting for the results obtained, it was concluded that the structural behaviour of these elements is less beneficial than for LVL, but that they do comply with all requirements. The CLT core is therefore considered most beneficial. As a final check, the CLT core walls have been checked on buckling between two storeys and on their behaviour under fire conditions. It appeared that the proposed core complies with all requirements. With regard to the research question it is concluded that, from a structural point of view, a stadium of which the structure is compiled from timber elements is a feasible solution. Accounting for the functional requirements and the results obtained in this thesis, the optimal span-width of a timber stadium structure is set to 7.8 m. The results as presented in this thesis are still preliminary, wherefore several recommendations are made to improve the design.","stadium; engineering; timber; feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor); De Jong, G.E. (mentor)","2011","DP6 architectuurstudio developed a new high school building for the Sint Nicolaaslyceum in Amsterdam. First a multisensory concept for the library of the new school building was developed using the multisensory design approach from the faculty of industrial design engineering, Delft. The second part consists of a guideline for multisensory design in architecture. This guideline is based on an extensive evaluation of the concept development process. The project started with intensive literature and user research. The literature study showed it is important, when focussing on human well-being in environments to take into account that users need the possibility to create the desired level of privacy, they need a certain level of change and complexity in order to be stimulated. Furthermore natural processes and a link to nature in an environment is perceived as positive by users. During users research the users – high school students – of the library were involved in the context mapping research process. Context mapping is used to gain empathy with the user and to understand their dreams and wishes for the environment. The user research started with observations of the users within the library and interviews with employees. Then twelve students filled in booklets explaining interesting aspects of their everyday life. Finally user sessions are done with two 3rd grade classes. All results combined results in the conclusion that the main desire for the library is to have a motivating library. This results in the design goal ‘design a motivating multisensory library for the Sint Nicolaaslyceum’. Further investigation of the concept ‘motivation’ led to the interaction vision “the room should guide you like an easy flowing river”. The main target expressions that are empathised are: inspiration, reliability and support. The vision with its main characteristics lead to a concept separated in three main parts. Every part communicates one of the target expressions. The final concept consists of an inspiring pathway, bookcases that empathise reliability and supportive work spaces. The multisensory character of the designs contribute to the expression they communicate. The pathway meanders through the whole library. It consists of three layers, when walking across this floor a congruent fluid is moved by the users’ body weight. The sub floor, containing inspiring images, short stories and images which are linked to information which is available in the library, shows. The upper layer of the floor is made from scratch resistant plastic. This layer is slightly compressible, which gives it a bouncy feeling when walking across. Furthermore it contains a very subtle smell; the smell is called tranquil escape and is scented with lime and geranium which gives it a light and fresh appearance. The polymer which encapsulates the scent is developed by Eastman Innovation lab. The bookcases have a wave shaped shelf in them which is made from the same material and colour of the pathway. It represents the information from the bookcases flowing into the floor and back. The other material used for the bookcases is pressed lacquered bamboo. This gives it a solid, warm and natural appearance and feel. The expression which it carries out; reliable is expressed by its solid character and the use of warm coloured and feeling, solid wood. The glass shelf communicates transparency which is an important characteristic belonging to reliability. Finally there are three types of work places; the individual work places, group work places and computer work places. The work places should support the activities of the users in every specific place. This does not only include the ergonomic aspect but the preferred way of working, level of privacy and the support of the posture belonging to the performed activity as well. The individual work places should enable students to work concentrated and quietly. The group work place should enable students to work together and therefore should have a dynamic character. The computer work places are similar to individual work places. In addition group lessons are given here sometimes. Therefore all chairs have to be able to face the same direction. To create suitable environments, the aesthetics and feel of the furniture is taken into account; furthermore special attention is given to the lighting and acoustics. The evaluation of the concept led to an adjusted road map of the original Multisensory design method. The method is presented in a booklet called “multisensory design in architecture”. After consulting DP6 the decision is made to make a booklet with theoretical value and practical information without it being a proposal for implementation in their process. The final booklet contains the background of MSD, the MSD current method is explained. In addition detailed set of sensory characteristics that can be addressed in architecture is defined while evaluating the project, this set is presented and explained in the booklet. Finally interesting findings from literature are presented.","multisensory design; high school; architecture; senses; experience; target expression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The graduation assignment was to explore the new design possibilities of galleys with new materials and the challenge was to optimize the galley design which was established by very long hours of engineering process and experience of Driessen over years in this industry. The initial project planning was made according to the design approach of Pahl Betz including the design phases. As a practical explanation of these phases, in the analysis, first we see things far away and follow their track, then we try to get closer from different angles by different conceptual solutions and then try to figure out and envisage much more closer by detailing. In the analysis phase, galley system and design method of Driessen were investigated, heaviest and most costly parts in the galleys system were identified and new materials and manufacturing techniques were explored. This search mainly focused on composite production methods because of their weight advantages. The concept development involves the collection of strict aviation requirements for galley design. Design method has been reviewed during this phase and appropriate approaches for this technical design case were identified. On this basis, creative sessions were conducted to determine the promising elements on the galley system. Then concepts were generated taking into account these targets. Concepts have been compared and evaluated according to requirements and design goals. As the last phase, chosen concepts were detailed to join each other and related materials were determined. A new way of assembly was proposed mainly for G5 galley but the production principle can be applied to other galleys as well.","galley design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

In this thesis we consider the Greeks of both European- and Bermudan-style Libor rate contracts. To model forward Libor rates we use the lognormal forward Libor market model. Because of the dimensionality of the model, only Monte Carlo methods are capable to estimate these Greeks. Therefore various Monte Carlo methods to estimate the Greeks will be considered and adjusted to our model settings. The methods are tested and compared, and if possible, improved. We improve the likelihood ratio method for the Greeks of Bermudan-style options by the use of a predictor-corrector scheme. Another succesful method which can be used for Greek calculations is given by the pathwise sensitivity method.","Greeks; pathwise sensitivity; likelihood ratio; Bermudan; Libor market model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Numerical analysis","",""

(mentor); Esser, P.E. (mentor)","2011","COPD is the fourth largest cause of mortality in the world. Most commonly the result of long-term smoking, its symptoms are characterised by difficulties breathing making it hard for patients to perform the simplest of tasks without becoming short of breath. While exercising is difficult for these patients, maintaining good levels of physical activity is one of the most effective methods in prolonging the severity of the disease and maintaining a good health related quality of life. Current treatment for COPD is via pulmonary rehabilitation which typically involves an exercise component conducted through regular physiotherapy classes. In line with the World’s aging population, the number of COPD is predicted to increase by over 50% in the next 30 years, placing substantial demand on an already understaffed medical industry. However research suggesting the same health benefits of physiotherapy can be achieved through small increases in daily activity during free living conditions is presenting a new hope for tackling these predictions. Over the past three years the UMC Groningen have been experimenting with such programs and approached Evalan to explore the potential of incorporating pervasive technologies into the system. As such this work looks to build on the UMCG’s existing proposal to explore the potential and opportunities for adding value to such a rehabilitation program once pervasive technologies have been incorporated. The project was conducted over a 5 month period in cooperation with Evalan, an external company specialised in the development of IT based solutions for the medical industry, and explored the development of a Product-Service System (PSS) to aid in the Pulmonary Rehabilitation of patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). The report follows the structure of the project with the three main sections corresponding to the main phases of the project; Research, concept and embodiment. During the Research phase of the project an internal and external analysis was conducted, alongside primary and secondary research into the areas of COPD and Activity monitoring for physical activity. The results of this research phase were use to construct a ‘vision’, which became the basis for the concept generation phase. Before beginning concept generation, further research into Persuasive technology and its application in encouraging physical activity and context mapping techniques were used to gain deeper insights into users requirements for such a program. The results of this work were used to construct a list of required functionalities which was used to develop three concepts. These concepts were further detailed before, in cooperation with Evalan and the project supervisory team, one concept was deem to best meet the required functionality and selected for further development. As full embodiment of the entire system was not deemed out-of-scope for such a project, the system was embodied to a level at which expert feedback sessions with the medical professional who would potentially be using the device could be conducted. The feedback was used to implement changes in the proposal before the full embodiment of the physical monitoring device and the feedback was completed. Prototypes of both these aspects were created and tested with a group of COPD patients. The results and responses of which were used to construct a final list of recommendations for further development of the project. Finally a business model and plan were constructed for the company and further development of the project.","Medisign; COPD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

The investigation is carried out through re-organization and production of urban and architectural space and it aims to bring together questions of spatial quality, rental rates, working hours, flexibility, building materials, construction costs, and income levels, for the generation of a proposal for intervention. Albert Cuypmarkt in Amsterdam is chosen as the site for this intervention, since it is an important wealth-generating urban structure, which is currently inaccessible to the low-income vendors, and therefore which favors solely the middle to high-income groups. The spatial characteristics, working mechanism, economic organization and temporal dynamics of the market cause this condition to sustain. The proposal is based on the differentiation of the commercial units in their spatial quality, rental rates, working hours and temporal flexibility, which allows to differentiate the target income group for each commercial unit and therefore to create possibilities for the low-income to become a vendor. The configuration of the commercial units at urban scale is based on the principle of spatial transformation of the market at different hours of the day in order to create socio-economic and programmatic opportunities from the temporal dynamics of the market space. It is expected that as a result of this intervention, different income groups will co-exist in the same urban space generating urban wealth from one single economic structure, opportunities will be created for the low-income groups to climb up the income ladder in the society, and the economic investment made in urban space will benefit the low-income groups as equally as it benefits the others.

(mentor)","2011","A Skilled and Open Landscape Amsterdam and its population has always been seen as tolerant towards people that are ‘different thinkers’, but what’s left of that attitude in the current society? Focussing on the city centre, one can localize marginalized groups. The margins are the places where these different thinkers gather and form a group of same minded. This gathering can be based on race, religion, sexual preference, income, illegality, etc. Marginality produces space and social values, since the people living there cooperate in order to improve their quality of life. This production only takes place within the margin and therefore the margin is isolated in the biggest part of society. The main focus of the project is the tolerance between marginalized groups. De 2A0 posters dienen naast elkaar gezien te worden omdat er een afbeelding doorloopt over 2 pagina's. Een bijlage van 1xA1 is toegevoegd voor bouwtechniek. Investigation of the spatial, social and economical aspects of marginal groups can learn us how a common interest is created among people living in the margin. The Skilled and Open Landscape uses these qualities derived from the margin for the creation of an intermediating programme that creates a base for communication, production and reflection among people, regardless their social conceptions. The focus on a person’s skill and the qualities of its cultural materialism provides a new perspective. In Richard Sennet’s book ‘The Craftsman’ he writes: “The culture of matter provides by itself an entire overview of what man can make. This seemingly unlimited vision is bounded by self-caused harm, wether this happens carelessly, intentionally or by accident. Spiritual values will possibly not solve the struggle with Pandora here. Maybe nature is a better guide, if we consider our productions as a part of its being.” Richard Sennett: The Craftsman. 2008. from: De Ambachtsman, De mens als maker. Translated by Willem van Paassen. Publisher J.M. Meulenhoff, Amsterdam, 2008. Page 24. The project is located at the Marnixstraat, which is at the periphery of the city centre and forms a boundary whereon and around marginality is still strongly present. The site has the potential of forming a centrality but still isolated within the urban fabric. The programmatic theme of human skills (for the production of goods ánd knowledge) ties to functions which are accessible to people from the margin and could be used by the main stream. The building structure and the landscape create a network that ties to the urban fabric and stimulate the movements on the site. The architecture opens up at moments to emphasise the skills being practiced. The architectural typology of some programmatic key-functions, as for example the communal centre, creates flexible spaces to facilitate an informal programme.","marginality; economy; visibility; skills; mixed programme; production; integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-17","Architecture","Architecture","","DSD Urban Asymmetries, Amsterdam Refigured","",""

The masterplan is based on the ‘Randstad 2040’ vision from the government that foresees an expansion of Haarlem towards the east. Transit oriented development has been chosen as the main driver for the masterplan. By connecting Schiphol airport by train to the future Schiphol airport at sea, new transport possibilities arise in which the Haarlemmerliede area will act as a transport/transfer hub in the transport network of the Randstad and the Netherlands as a whole. The masterplan is filled with office and commercial related developments. The SIC (Schiphol Interchange Station) facilitates the entrance from the highway into the masterplan and the connection of the two sides of the masterplan. The SIC is an interchange station from the train to the car and vice versa. The architectural layout and design of the building is based on the flows of transport on the site and in the building. It is directly derived from the best integration of the different flows of transport such as cars, trains and people. The functions are placed along these flows to create interesting, open spaces. The building and building skin are parametrically designed and developed based on the traffic flows and a following Building Technology research.","train station; Schiphol; Amsterdam; Haarlem; parametric; free form; traffic flows; highway; public transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-27","Architecture","Architecture","","Architectural Engineering","",""

The original early 20th century housing stock in the European quarter has almost totally been demolished and because of the absence of authoritative spatial plans or strategies, the district has been subjected to a continuous wave of speculative investment, housing destruction and office construction (Baeten, 2001:121). There are many parties who have an interest in the European quarter, having their own view on the district and its problems. There is a will to change the area but transformation of the neighbourhood is a delicate issue given the interests of all stakeholders, the current planning system and economical, cultural and societal forces. The urgence of the problem asks for spatial design interventions which will contribute to a solution of the problems of the stakeholders, while at the same time designing the process of implementation of these interventions. This thesis aims at delivering those interventions by looking at theory, analysing the situation, formulating a consistent vision and finally creating a development strategy. The proposed strategy for the development process, urban design and accommodation of the European Commission results in an integral approach to deal with the problems in the area. It combines a gradual transformation process which can change over time with a clear direction - the direction of a smart, sustainable and inclusive neighbourhood which provides an attractive place for residents and workers, offers efficient accommodation and contributes to showing the value of the European Union.","Brussels; European quarter; European Commission; development strategy; urban design; accommodation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing and Urbanism","","","",""

The results of this comparison show that determining the right parameters for the policy is more important than the kind of policy used. The performance of the policies is generally worse than in previous work, due to the absence of explicit flow admission control, which makes it impossible to account for traffic until after it has been sent. The results also indicate that the use of a moving average instead of a hold-down timer leads to less link-state updates, while not impacting performance.","quality of service; QoS; link-state updates; lsup; Quagga; ospf; ospf-te","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Network Architectures and Services","",""

(mentor)","2011","Abstract – In order to create good urban environments city planners need to start addressing the issue of urban identity (Oktay 2002). According to Oktay, people should again feel that some part of the environment belongs to them, individually and collectively, some part for which they care and are responsible, whether they own it or not. For, as Oktay also states, people use their environment not only in a functional way, but also identify and express themselves through it. In a sense people form their environment and their environment forms them and it is exactly this role of spatial form that is being forgotten in the urban planning (Fortuin & Van der Graaf 2006). In addition Fortuin & Van der Graaf point out that increasingly such issues, of socio-cultural nature, take a backseat to the economic issues. Such projects often limit their impact on identity to that of the economical relevance of the ‘image’ or ‘brand’. Municipalities thus tend to develop ambitious plans that are bluntly imposed on their respective locations, in order to ‘sell’ the city (Jacobs 1992). In doing so however, any trace of the original urban identity is wiped out, including the communities, the culture and history. Consequently also the connection between the original inhabitants and their environment is lost, resulting in undefined, undesirable, useless and unliveable spaces (Oktay 2002). Nevertheless, in general, planners decide to stay this course. This is largely do to the illusive nature of ‘identity’. For how can something be factored into a design, when its spatial form is unknown (ed. Bell & Tyrwhitt 1972)? This paper thus provides a solid grip on the issue of identity. More specifically, the goal is to identify and evaluate the spatial form of urban identity in inner cities, through its sub-elements of public space and the neighbourhood. In doing so, this paper assists in the building of the theoretical framework of the author’s graduation project, which proposes strategies and interventions for the regeneration of problem-neighbourhoods (dutch: probleemwijken) in the inner city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

(mentor); Pruyt, E. (mentor); Dijkema, G.P.J. (mentor); Bastein, A.G.T.M. (mentor)","2011","High copper prices have not led to a place for this metal in the debate about mineral scarcity, while copper is a base metal which has many uses and is vital for developments in the energy transition. In this research the global copper system is examined from the perspective of the development of supply and demand and the effects structural and parametric uncertainties in the system have on the development of behaviour in this system. The question immediately arises: What are the effects of parametric and structural uncertainties on the possible future behaviour of the copper system? The research approach is Exploratory System Dynamics Modelling and Analysis (ESDMA) and the period the copper system is examined is 2000 till 2050. For the analysis three different System Dynamics (SD) models were built, with regard to existing literature about the structure and functioning of the different elements in the copper system. These models were connected to a python shell to perform the Exploratory Model Analysis (EMA). The effects of a specific ESDMA structure, a randomised economic feed, were first tested in this research. The conclusions were that, mainly due to the fact that this feed mainly influenced stocks in the system, the system behaviour was not significantly different due to this feed. Henceforth the other experiments were performed without the economic feed. During the interpretation of these experiments it became clear that a mistake were made in the experimental setup. The lower bounds for the four coefficients relevant for the Recycling Input Rate (RIR) were taken too low, causing the RIR in effect to have an overly low modus, as well as a lower average value for the copper consumption. While this potentially could have changed the behaviour of the system, a new experiment with the corrected bounds has let to similar outcomes. The behavioural conclusions of these experiments are that the copper consumption is likely to decline slowly in the coming 40 years. This reduction in consumption also leads to very high Reserve over Production (R/P) ratios. The system has further a high risk for volatile price movements, caused by a disbalance between copper supply and demand. This and the importance of copper for our economy make it a vulnerable resource, which needs to be monitored more closely. Six different policy designs were tested in this research to try to counter potential unwanted effects in the copper system. These policies were designed from the perspective of European stakeholders. Performing experiments with these policies has lead to the conclusion that policies aiming at improving the collection rate of copper products at their end of life in combination with improving the Recycling Efficiency Rate (RER) leads on average to lower copper prices. The copper price volatility was lowered by a policy regarding the implementation of a strategic reserve.","Copper; Mineral scarcity; Energy transition; System Dynamics; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Exploratory System Dynamics Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

As an example, Amsterdam Zuid (South) is characterized by high accessibility, heavy infrastructure, presence of different building rises and the development of a global company “Zuidas”, which -with its overscaled character- will predictably dominate the territory. The future urban layout of the Zuid presents a highly desirable area, however a possible social/economic/physical segregation is expected. The project aims to attract a diversity of users (which are currently scattered in the area) into a peripheral urban layout where they can coexist benefiting from the qualities of a traditional city center. The Mixed-Use block is a component of a “in-between” development site situated within the borders of the Zuidas. Being inspired by local typologies and city center patterns, it includes several functions addressing three main user groups who are already existing in the area: students, families and elderly people. The project aims to increase the attractivity of the surroundings considering the students as the potentially strongest target group owing to the presence of the Vrije University of Amsterdam next to the site. In order to intervene the business district dominated attractivity in a local/global way, the design focused on user specific housing and local commerce, adding several facilities to improve the daily life of the user groups.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-16","Architecture","Architecture","","DSD/Future Cities/Amsterdam 'Re'Figured","",""

(mentor); De Koning Gans, H.J. (mentor)","2011","Bigger ships are replacing the small ships, also at the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. A direct consequence is the use of larger main propellers and increased installed engine power in order to realize acceptable ship speeds. To improve the maneuverability, the power of auxiliary bow and stern propulsion systems has increased as well. This results in higher flow velocities and thus more damage to bed protections at berthing places. Especially pump jet thrusters as a bow propulsion system may attack the bed protections more severely due to a vertical component of the flow field induced by the pump jet which is directed towards the bed. The aim of this research is, in cooperation with Rijkswaterstaat, to develop an analytical model for the flow field induced by the pump jet thruster. Subsequently, the required dimensions of a bed protection has been determined as well as an investigation on the possible scour effects in case of an unprotected bed of the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. In order to meet this goal, an inventory of the bow propulsion systems in inland vessels has been made by conducting an inquiry. Subsequently, the different propulsion systems have been compared qualitatively. Since existing formulas are based on the circular free jet, this system is also treated in the comparison. In addition, a water jet (hydro jets can be distinguished in low-powered and high-powered jets), often used as propulsion system by ferries, has been taken into account due to the strong analogy with the circular free jet. As a result, both the ratio of decrease of axial velocities and diffusion of the jets in radial direction of a circular free jet strongly correspond to a high-powered water jet. However, the free propeller and transverse tunnel thrusters are considered to have a faster decrease of axial velocities and a faster diffusion of the flow field. The applied power and the induced turbulence seem to be the main reasons for the flow field characteristics. An essential part of this research is the derivation of an analytical model for the pump jet thruster induced flow field. The principle is based on the free propeller theory. In the case of a pump jet, part of the contraction takes place inside the unit. Furthermore, the flow field has been subdivided in three parts: initial outflow velocity, axial flow velocity and the flow velocity distribution in the region of the established flow. The coefficients in the model have been empirically determined using a simulation with a CFD model. This model has been compared to flow fields induced by different other propulsion systems. It results in a similar axial flow velocity decrease as a low-powered water jet. However, the pump jet diverges faster and with a greater angle than any other jet. The derived model has been used to investigate the stone stability at the toe of a sheet pile wall. Firstly, the flow velocities at the bed have been evaluated by looking at berthed ships in different conditions (fully loaded, partly loaded and unloaded). Secondly, a stability analysis of the bed material has been executed by using a method presented by Deltares. However, in order to protect the bed against the high flow velocities, large stone diameters are required. An alternative is allowing scour holes to occur, but the length of the sheet piling should be extended in order to maintain stability of the entire quay wall. The predicted maximum scour depths caused by a pump jet are in the same range of measured scour depths at the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. This means that scour holes may cause instability problems of the existing sheet pile walls.","pumpjet; boegvoortstuwing; binnenvaart; pump jet thruster","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Whereas the space in the modern city becomes a open-ended void with free standing objects as buildings. This design mediate between the two extremes, proposing an object where the public, semi public and private spaces are carved out. These spaces are linked with the adjacent buildings on one side, and creates holes on the other, which blurred out the harsh boarder and let the public domain extend into the building.

However, in many cases, exactly for the same reason, they destroy competitive advantage and companies start searching for opportunities to gain it. Taking into account increased information processing power and amount of collected data over the last couple of decades, companies are considering if it is worth to invest in customer analytics to gain competitive advantage. Therefore, the business world is questioning an ability of customer analytics to provide competitive advantage. Moreover, a sustainability of such an advantage is also questioned. In this thesis the resource-based view was applied to five cases to analyze how exactly customer analytics contributes to competitive advantage. The system theory was used to analyze the differences in a context where a technology is applied in order to analyze compatibility between organization resources and technology. In addition, a survey on customer analytics was studied to find a relationship between improved performance (across dimensions as: sales growth, time to market and customer retention) and analytical capability. Customer analytics can contribute to competitive advantage across three dimensions: increased bargaining power, improved effectiveness and improved efficiency of marketing capability. However, a sustainability of this advantage with analytics is doubtful. If analytics is complemented with other unique resources of the company such as scale advantage or access to unique data, then it is sustainable. Case studies suggest that each step of maturity requires more and more intangible organizational resources. So that if benefits from analytics were increasing with maturity, then the company which is able to innovate fast with analytics would sustain an advantage. However, this is not the case. The results show that sales improvement diminishes with analytics maturity over time. The decrease of perceived sales expansion might refer to the fact that there is a limit of the ability of the market and the company to grow at some point. Time to market improvement does not correlate significant with maturity (except for public services). This could be explained by a different perception to what it relates to. Profit-making organizations tend to associate time to market with products that bring profits and they tend to exclude extra services (e.g. information availability on their website). In addition, retention is improving with analytics maturity for products, public services and resource industries. The insignificance of financial services could be explained by the nature of the business and the level of regulation. Another interesting finding concerns the relationship between data driven decision making and soft driven decision making (e.g. intuition and experience). There is a significant positive correlation between data driven decision making and soft driven decision making. It rejects an existence of the scientific literature assumption that data driven decision making leads to decrease of soft driven decision making. The survey part of this research was limited to only three outcome variables: retention, time to market and sales improvement. The future research should also investigate the impact of maturity on other outcome variables such as cost improvement, process innovation, organization innovation, etc.","competitive advanatge; resource-base view; customer analytics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-26","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor); Schuetze, T. (mentor)","2011","The main issue of this project is waste and how we can better deal with it. We have to make clear at this point that being myself an architect the whole project has been approached through an architectural point of view. I firmly believe that there is a clear and clean way of solving it. So, When waste can be a problem? Everything that is brought into existence plays a role in the production of waste as a side effect. Everything that prospers and lives exceeds the waste and whatever dies or is not used anymore, becomes a waste. So to say, waste are the traces of every life and existence on earth, and this is inevitable. Therefore, we have to see waste as natural. In the nature as the ecosystem the waste from one process are always reused into another one as a ready product to process. Waste is a problem only among humans. And it becomes a problem only when pollution appears...And pollution appears only when there is too much waste on a given area and natural decay cannot take place. Let’s have a look on our system. Our system is more wasteful than any other before. We focus on the quantity of products and not on the quality or sustainability of production process. We forget that everything we use is highly processed due to the achievements of production, and impossible to degrade it in a short term of time. Planned Obsolescence and highly processed goods. Economize in the terminology means... that our economy from a practical and theoretical standpoint, is wrong in the term of dealing with the waste. It does not take into account that resources are not infinite and recycling is on the very low level. It is more down-cycling. The largest centers of economy and production are big cities in developed countries. These are the accelerators of economical growth and in reverse its biggest outcome/result/product. Moreover there exactly is where the problem begins. We do not usually see the waste since municipalities collect the trash to the down-cycling centers or exceed those into land fields or even ship them to developing countries. Where the waste become a visible problem, but in reality it is only a result of the global economy. Therefore, the project has to be settled in a city that belongs to a developed country. I chose to deal architecturally with the Municipal Solid waste among a variety of different types. That way we can show how to solve in the tangible way the small part of the whole pending problem, from the beginning till the end, while being accurate with technological possibilities and capacities of our times. Because the current problems have to be solved now, not later, through architecture which its function is to be a city supplement, i.e. the part that completes and encloses the city metabolism in the field of domestic waste. In order to create such a supplement, a vast research has been made in the technologies of recycling, fields of science and additional functions that are necessary to connect to create such a project. A team of scientists, researchers, architects and designers is needed. Interdisciplinary function will provide the best performance. The overriding function of the building becomes a Research Institute for investigating new technologies in waste recycling, building prototypes from recycled materials that will be used in a city as a decentralized units for waste recycling inside the city as well as architectural elements created from recycled materials that can be used in the design of future buildings, that are sustainable and collect, create and save water and energy.","waste; recycling; water facade; prorotypes; sustainable; rapid prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-16","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

(contributor)","2011","The Durban bight has a very dynamic and variable coastline which is constantly under attack by the Indian Ocean. To protect the Durban harbour from this energetic ocean, already in 1855 breakwaters have been constructed to protect the harbour and prevent sedimentation inside. The construction of these breakwaters and eventually extending these breakwaters towards the sea has influenced the sediment flow in front of the Durban beaches enormously. The natural sediment flow along the coast from South to North has been interrupted and this has changed the surroundings. The beaches of Durban are constantly eroding and nourishments are necessary every year to restore the beaches and preserve the safety of the citizens of Durban. The Durban Harbour has agreed to dredge all the available sand that is trapped by the breakwaters and deliver the sand back into the beach system. The Municipality of Durban has responded to this development by constructing a sand distribution system at the beaches, to nourish the sand in an optimal way. New nourishment pipelines have been constructed through three piers at the central part of the Durban coast to supply the sand directly in the surf zone. Although the rough sea is responsible for the erosion at the beaches, the sea also provides nice surf conditions. If the bathymetry has the right shape, perfect surf waves can appear. A combination of nourishments done by the Durban Harbour and the construction of the new nourishment pipelines can lead to the necessary change in bathymetry, resulting in the perfect surf waves. To investigate the consequences of the nourishments on the surf conditions and the movement of the sediment, a Delft3D computer model has been set up. Different nourishment scenarios have been investigated, as well as the available recorded data regarding the tide, the wave and the wind conditions. The total input data have been reduced in size towards representative parameters and converted to corresponding Delft3D input files. After running the constructed model with different scenarios for a simulation period of 15 days, the results have been checked on two different aspects. First of all the effect of the nourishments through the piers on the bathymetry is analysed. An overview of the most important model outcomes is bundled in the additional document ‘Modelling nourishments through the Durban piers, Figures’. The nourishments tend to move onshore and therefore into the coastal cells between the piers. Offshore transport doesn’t seem to be an issue for the dominant wave conditions, but during north-easterly and north-north-easterly waves it is advised not to carry out nourishments. The just nourished sediment might be transported offshore in that situation. The added sediment is partly used to fill up scour holes just north of each pier, but it also leads to the creation of a shallow area north of the tip of each pier. When every year a volume of 250,000 m3 of sand is supplied to the Durban bight, the coastal cells remain more or less in equilibrium, given that 40% of the total amount is nourished through the piers. The second part concerns the effects on the surf conditions. When analysing the physical wave parameters, no major changes can be noticed. However, the model is only run for 15 days, during which one nourishment is simulated. The results do show some subtle trends, which could lead to a bigger influence when successive nourishments are carried out. Waves start to break at the newly created shallow areas during low tide. This has a positive effect on the surf conditions, since the waves will break in a more favourable way. In case of multiple nourishments, the shallow areas will probably become shallower, so then the positive effect can be noticed during high tide as well. Furthermore, the orientation of the coastline between the piers will obtain a slight obliqueness with respect to the dominant wave direction. This causes the waves not to break at once along the whole wave crest, but more gradually from one side to the other, so that surfers can ride a wave uninterruptedly for a longer period of time. Finally a number of recommendations is given, which result from the whole process that the project has gone through. A few adjustments to the model might lead to a major improvement of the performance. Two of the most important recommendations concern a more detailed way of modelling the piers in the model and the inclusion of wind.","South Africa; surf reef; swell; artificial beach nourishment","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The aim of this study was to replicate these data using XBeach in order to assess the validity of both the Joint Probability Model (JPM) and XBeach on beaches such as Narrabeen. In this study, a large number of different storms were simulated using XBeach. The probability and thus return period of the resulting erosion volumes were determined using the JPM. XBeach was calibrated against two individual erosion events, one at Narrabeen beach and one at Hasaki beach (Japan). The best fit for the Narrabeen beach, obtained using a stationary mode, led to an overestimation of erosion volumes at lower return periods (< 3 year) but fell within the boundaries implied by a 95% confidence interval of the measurement data for higher return periods. When calibrated against the erosion volumes with low return periods (<2 year), XBeach slightly underpredicted the erosion volumes at higher return periods. Depending on the method of determining confidence levels, the results were outside or well within the confidence interval of the measurements. This could suggests that this method is a valid way to predict erosion volumes and their return periods, in cases where long term erosion volumes measurements are absent.","XBeach; JPM; Narrabeen; Extreme; Erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Dooren, E. (mentor)","2011","As a result of the climate change, showers of rain become more and more extreme. This results in water problems in dense build areas where large amounts of rain water are immediately discharged into the sewer system. Rotterdam is one of these dense cities that struggles with this problem. The water system of Rotterdam can’t handle the amount of water during extreme weather. The sewer is discharged into the city canals which results in large water problems. Rotterdam is solving the direct causes of the water problems but also stimulation solutions to solve the problem in a indirect way. This project is about solving the water problem at its cause: the 99% hard surface in the inner city. The location along the Hoogstraat is chosen because it is a part of the area in which the municipality of Rotterdam has planned an open water system to collect rain water. Also the location includes a new-construction project and is situated along a main route. The special charachteristic of this is location is the link between the quiet Grote Kerkplein, the bustle Hoogstraat and the Delftsevaart. The Waterplan of Rotterdam argues for more temporary rain water storage in the innercity of Rotterdam. In the Museumpark a new parking garage is combined with water storage and the same concept will soon be used for the Zuidplein. But what happens if we combine rain water storage and architecture in a visible way? Multifunctional use of space and construction becomes possible and the relation between water and daily use will become more and more important. We already know buildings that collect rainwater and re-use it in a self-sufficient way. It is a challenge to design a building that also collects rain water from its surroundings and provides the surrounding area with purified water. If architecture and rain water storage are combined in a visible way the architecture and shape of the building will change if it rains. Rain water can be an integrated part of the architecture and the functional design. The project will be designed following these new concepts. The project will contain a restaurant and open air theater that is already planned in the area in the masterplan of KCAP. These two functions will be combined with a new and political relevant function: a museum about Water and Climate Change.","architecture; landscape; rain; water; climate change; museum; restaurant","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-14","Architecture","Architecture","","Delta Interventions","",""

Hieruit wordt een strategie voor Dura Vermeer Vastgoed (DVV) ontwikkeld die aansluit op hun huidig beleidsplan. De vastgoedmarkt is een zeer dynamische markt. Veel factoren en actoren hebben invloed op het uiteindelijke resultaat. Het kunnen omgaan met deze veranderende elementen vergt veel kennis, inzicht en ervaring. De huidige kantorenmarkt wordt gekenmerkt door een zeer ruim aanbod en een hoog leegstandscijfer. Op dit moment staat 13,9% van het totale aanbod van 47 miljoen m2 leeg (DTZ 2011). Het aanbod van kantoren is tweeledig. De markt kent een overcapaciteit aan kwantitatieve m2 kantoorruimte terwijl het een tekort heeft aan kwalitatieve m2’s.

The design targets both soft and hard faults by implementing a combination of known fault-tolerance tech niques in an efficient way. The proposed architecture allows a trade-off to be made between performance and fault tolerance by means of instruction-level configurability. The design is evaluated in terms of fault coverage, area, average power consumption, total energy consumption and performance for various duplication policies and test-sequence schedules. It is shown that an area and power overhead of roughly 25% and 32%, respectively, are required to implement the techniques on the baseline processor. The main overheads of the architecture are performance (up to 106%) and energy consumption (up to 157%). It is observed that the average power consumption is often reduced when a higher degree of fault tolerance is set and therefore the energy consumption does not increase linearly with a higher execution time. It is shown that test sequences can effectively be scheduled during program stalls, and that nearly 100% of all soft faults are tolerated by using instruction duplication. The main advantages of using our techniques are the flexibility to make a trade-off between the overheads and the required degree of fault tolerance, the high portability of the used techniques and the small increase in area and power consumption.","fault tolerance; biomedical; architecture level","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-16","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

Nowadays, a number of well proven technologies exist with advantages and disadvantages which make each one of them more suitable in specific sites. As in any other case, the application of new technologies which can enhance the efficiency of such processes is always required. In this work we investigated the usage of electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) to improve the efficiency of the thermal desalination process. It is divided into three parts: the study of the spray, the characterization and design of a multinozzle device and experiments with a single-effect electrohydrodynamic thermal desalination device. From the results it could be inferred that EHDA enhances the evaporation by providing wider dispersion of the generated droplets. Additionally, the proposed design for the multinozzle device was proven to be stable and suitable for desalination processes. Lastly, the single-effect electrohydrodynamic thermal desalination device operated stable with good performance ratios with the use of a membrane.","electrohydrodynamic atomization; desalination; condensation; evaporation; spray; multinozzle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","PEQ","",""

(mentor); Tan, Y. (mentor); Bharosa, N. (mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Kockelkoren, S. (mentor); Van Wijk, R. (mentor)","2011","The use of a common set of semantic metadata is seen as one of the most promising developments in information exchange among public and private parties. Semantic metadata is data that provides context to core data and helps to convey the actual meaning and perspective of the information that is shared among people, systems and organizations. All information sharing activities are aimed at one objective: having the right information available to the end user, with as little loss, time delay and clutter as possible. Using a common set of semantics in electronic information exchange is believed to further reduce costs and time of information exchange, increase information quality and remove many of the unforeseen side effects and complexities of interconnecting stand alone information systems. Semantic metadata management is required in order to use semantic metadata effectively in a PPIC. A common vocabulary is of little use if it does not match organizational requirements. The main difficulty in semantic metadata management is that it touches on many elements of the organizational architecture. Semantic metadata management is primarily an alignment effort and partially a standardization effort. It includes the alignment of processes, technology and data models, both within and beyond organizational boundaries. However, many existing semantic metadata management approaches are ad hoc and lack a coordinated and premeditated approach. There are many theories and studies on individual topics related to metadata management, but a documented approach that puts all elements within the given scope in perspective is non-existent. This master thesis project was aimed at aiding those tasked with implementing a coordinated form of semantic metadata management within the domain of Public Private Information Chains (PPIC). The problem was approached from an enterprise architecture point of view. This means a broad, holistic view was applied. A PPIC is a digital information chain consisting of both public and private parties that is centered around a certain information process with a high rate of repetition and mutual responsibilities. This research project started out with a literature review and expert interviews. Best practices were extracted and tested in an in depth case study with two complementary cases in Dutch government organizations. The main research question has been answered by developing a reference architecture for semantic metadata management in a PPIC. A reference architecture is a generic blueprint that provides a holistic approach for a specific architecture archetype. It puts all elements required for semantic metadata into perspective making it easier to structure the many pieces of the puzzle. The reference architecture uses a format that on the one hand provides enough rigor to ensure interoperability, while on the other hand provides enough leeway to fit organizations with different characteristics or specific requirements. The mixture of rigor and leeway has been achieved by using both prescriptive design principles and tradeoffs that extend the design space. The reference architecture is centered around mitigating the main challenge in this domain and reinforcing one of the main potentials: reduction of complexity. Much of the complexity regarding information exchange in PPIC’s is artificial, not inherently present. Challenges have arisen by creating connections between systems, processes and organizations that were never designed from the outset to be interconnected in such a way. The semantic metadata management approach that is introduced in this research has two pillars. First, a conceptual model is introduced to act as a single point of reference between all components, reducing the number of existing relations. Second, the relations between all components in the organizational architecture are actively managed. This proactive approach reduces incidents and improves information quality. The solution presented in this thesis is generic. The design principles and tradeoffs apply in a similar way to both private and public organizations. Moreover, it applies to organizations with different maturity levels in technology, data management and processes and with a varying level of ambition on this topic. In an information chain the diversity in stakeholders and their interests is a given situation. A certain degree of commitment and effort can be expected from the stakeholders in the chain, but semantic metadata management should not interfere with the private processes or bring an additional burden. The evaluated reference architecture presented in this study deals with this problem. Even though the solution is primarily aimed at providing benefits in inter-organizational information exchange, it is useful for internal use in individual organizations as well.","semantic metadata management; public private information chain; reference architecture; information exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-08","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Information and Communication Technology","",""

(mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Van Beers, C.P. (mentor)","2011","This research aims to investigate whether adding electronic database information with the technology life cycle reflects the process of innovation. The chances of successfully market a news product are dramatically low, resulting in the need for methods to forecast the process of innovation. A well-known method is the use of market research. However, for specific cases, there is reason to doubt the validity of market research, since firms are not able to meet all the required conditions. (Ortt et al., 2007) This research aims to investigate whether the use of electronic databases can be used to reduce the risk in the process of innovation. An analysis between the various exiting Technology Life Cycle (TLC) models, the TLC model of (Ortt and Schoormans, 2004), appeared to be in the product category unit of analysis, while other innovation theories analyze the process on product or technology level. This model would constitute to best model to use for forecasting, seen the scope, the valid y-axis presentation (industry rate of adoption) and the use of hallmarks. For the theoretical scientific activity over the TLC, many scholars assume a scientific and patent double boom cycle. (e.g. (Schmoch, 2007)) Remarkable little attempt have been found regarding the theoretical news distribution over a technology life cycle. When defining a methodology in order to find consistencies, it is recognized that every quantification of a process with humans involved displays an erratic pattern. This vision results from the fact that the current stage of evolution cannot understand (or to a limited extent) the decision making model of a human brain. The methodologies to analyze the data quantitatively are formulated taking the expected erratic pattern in mind. The technology life cycle combined with the news, scientific and patent distribution is, in this thesis, defined as the innovation diffusion graph. Two types of analysis were performed for this research: qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative propositions are derived on the basis of the innovation diffusion graphs, while the quantitative propositions are derived on the basis of the average level, dispersion and slope. Defining the statements on the basis of every graph and data prevents neglecting of important results. It was found that scientific activity diffuses faster than patents (78%), were the uptake in patents was later than the uptake in scientific research (64%). In 71% of the cases, scientific research diffused before the hallmark large scale diffusion. A counter intuitive result came from the uptake in patent with respect to sales, were in 57,1% of the cases the patent uptake was later than sales (28,6% equal uptake; 7,1% patent before sales and 7,1% undetermined). For the pharmaceutical industry the news followed a parabolic trend, with its highest point in the market adaptation phase. The average level of news (material), scientific (both industries) and patent (both industries) all followed a linear upward trend in the majority of the cases. No evidence of the in the literature assumed double boom cycle for the patents and scientific activity is found. Furthermore, (Tushman and Anderson, 1986) found a significant increased uncertainty after a technological discontinuity. No evidence of an increased uncertainty was found.","patent; scientific articles; news; technology life cycle; forecasting; prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepeneurship","","","",""

(mentor); Xiao, Y. (mentor)","2011","This report introduces a method for the removal of zinc from aircraft aluminium-alloy scrap. The driving force for this research is the demand from the secondary aluminium industry for a low zinc content in the Al-alloy scrap, and the growing demand for aluminium in the world. Meanwhile large amounts of obsolete aircraft are stored because of the problems during recycling of the aluminium. The influence of coating on the aircraft scrap recycling is studied by treating the scrap in a de-coating process, regarding its influence on the melting process of the scrap. The coating accounts for approximately 1,6 wt% of the scrap. On a small scale, the melting of de-coated scrap shows much better results in coalescence and the separation of alloy from slag. On a larger scale, the melting results are also better for de-coated scrap, while the melting process of not de-coated scrap forms a reasonably coalescent alloy piece. The recyclability of aircraft scrap is studied in the presence of different salt fluxes. The addition of 10 wt% cryolite promotes the coalescence of the alloy and the separation of alloy and slag. However, this salt flux removes magnesium from the alloy. Addition of magnesium fluoride maintains or even increases the magnesium content in the alloy, but gives poor results in the melting process. The use of a higher salts-to-alloy ratio does not improve the melting results and possibly even counteracts the evaporation of zinc for both cryolite and magnesium fluoride as an addition. To improve the zinc removal from the aluminium alloy, a lance is used to blow argon gas into the alloy melt. The argon gas reduces the partial pressure of zinc, thereby promoting the evaporation of zinc from the melt. The tests are performed on an alloy with an initial zinc content of 2,42 %. A test with argon blowing lowers the zinc content to 1,88 %. However, a similar test without argon blowing results into an alloy with a zinc content of 2,11 %. The argon blowing only reduces the zinc content with 0,23 % compared to the similar test in which the same alloy is molten but no argon is blown into the melt.","aluminium; recycling; aircraft","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Resource Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (mentor); Westerweel, J. (mentor); Boermans, L.M.M. (mentor)","2011","In this thesis a numerical investigation was performed to increase our understanding of a low Reynolds number transition behind a zigzag trip. This was done with the use of Direct Numerically Simulation (DNS). This means that the Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically without any use of a turbulence model. The DNS solver of the CFD package ANSYS Fluent is used. The results from the DNS are compared to experimental data from an earlier study on the transition region behind the same type of zigzag trip [Elsinga and Westerweel, 2011]. In this experiment the undisturbed laminar boundary layer was formed over a smooth flat plate with a nominally zero pressure gradient. At a distance of 145 [mm] downstream the leading edge the laminar boundary layer was then tripped by a 1.6 [mm] high zigzag trip. In our DNS study the Reynolds number with respect to the experiment was increased in order for turbulent flow to develop behind the trip. The Re k based on the free-stream velocity and the height of the trip were 672 and 336 for the DNS and the experiment respectively. In general the statistical data of the DNS in terms of mean velocity and velocity fluctuations showed good agreement with the experiment. The shapefactor of the boundary layer, which is a more robust integral parameter, showed very good agreement for the total domain. In this thesis particular emphasis will be on the study of the generation and the shape of the large and small scale turbulent structures and their dynamic behavior directly behind the trip. Small scale vortices are detected on the leading edge of the trip as well as streamwise directed large vortices behind the trip. Further it was found that the generation and break-up of hairpin vortices, as identified by the second invariant of the velocity tensor gradient, showed variations for different inflow angles and geometrical changes. The shedding frequency and vortex amplitude are affected by the recirculation bubble behind a downstream pointing spike. After the shedding of the hairpin structures they are propagated downstream, where they grow in spanwise width and wall-normal height till they break-up into smaller structures, i.e., smaller hairpin structures or small streamwise directed rolls. Also the scatter distribution of the second and third invariant of the velocity gradient tensor, respectively Q and R, are studied in the transition region directly behind the trip. This scatter distribution shows the expected tear-drop shape which is described by Ooi et al. [1999] and is thought to be related to a certain state of the development into a fully turbulent boundary layer flow. The tear-drop shape appears already closely behind the trip, which indicates the production of three-dimensional structures by the trip. Further studies on this subject are desired. Furthermore it is found that the angle of incidence of the mean flow, in the range from zero till twelve degrees, had a marginal influence on the transition to turbulence. However, changing the spanwise wavelength of the zigzag to 50% and 200% of the original wavelength, resulted in significant differences in the transition into turbulence. In this study, the wide trip, i.e., larger spanwise wavelength, had a shorter transition region compared to the original trip and the narrow trip had a longer transition region compared to the original trip.","CFD; zigzag trip; transition; boundary layer tripping; speedskaters; wake reduction; gliders","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","MEAH - 263",""

(mentor); Hamdioui, S. (mentor)","2011","Three-dimensional stacked ICs (3D-SICs) based on Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) is an emerging technology. It provides heterogeneous integration, higher performance and bandwidth, and lower power consumption. However, 3D-SICs suffer from lower compound yield, especially those based on Wafer-to-Wafer (W2W) stacking. In addition, testability of such devices is still in its infancy stage. This thesis addresses these two challenges. To improve the compound yield of W2W 3D-SICs, a technique known as wafer matching will be used. It defines the best matching of top and bottom wafers from repositories of pre-tested wafers. The simulation results show that the compound-yield increase depends on (1) the number of stack tiers, (2) the number of dies per wafer, (3) the die yield, and (4) the repository size. Moreover, they demonstrate that, for realistic cases, relative yield increases of 0.5% to 10% can be achieved. The thesis also proposes a three-dimensional Design-for-Test (3D-DfT) architecture that solves the testability issue of of 3D-SICs. The architecture is based on a modular approach, in which the various dies, their embedded IP cores, TSV-based interconnect, and external I/O can be tested as separate units, before and/or after bonding. Furthermore, the architecture leverages existing 2D DfT already present in the design, and adds a die-level wrapper based on IEEE Std 1500 augmented with additional features in order to be able to deals with 3D-SIC challenges (e.g., to transport signals up and down through the stack). The architecture is implemented and the simulation results show that it provides the flexibility and the modularity is realized at the cost of less than 0.1% area overhead when considering large industrial chips. The architecture could serve as a basis for further standardization of DfT for 3D-SICs.","3D-DfT; Test Architecture; Yield improvement; 3D-SIC; TSV; Wafer matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-16","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Although cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer that accounts for only 10% of the cases of skin cancers in humans, it results in 75% of the deaths related to skin cancer due to its aggresive nature. It is the condition in which a tumor growth originates in melanocytes; skin cells which produce pigment and are the result of the skin's complexion. When diagnosed in time, the prognosis after removal of the tumor is very good, but when the tumor can grow invasively, the chance of metastases increases rapidly. When melanoma occurs, the appearance of the lesion will change. For example, the shape of the spot can change, or new colors can appear. The person can also experience aching or itching of the lesion. When a medical physician (e.g. a GP or dermatologist) inspects the skin of the patient, he will look for these symptoms. At home, the patients can perform selfscreening by regularly inspecting the skin for signs of malignancy. Several problems are identified that can occur in selfscreening. These mainly hold to the insecurity of patients of their ability to inspect the skin. Next to that, the quality of selfscreening may sometimes be poor, especially for hard to reach areas such as the back. There also seems to be reluctancy to attend to the physician in fear of a false alarm. To adress this issue, a product has been designed. The aim of this device is to provide the users with a tool to improve the quality of their selfscreening and to provide them with an advice on when to visit the dermatologist. The user will record an image of a selected group of nevi every month, which are stored on the device. After completion, the product will be connected to a PC on which a program performs the processing and analysis on the images. For each nevus, the program holds a record in which the change throughout time can be measured. When such change has been detected, the user will be alarmed to visit the dermatologist for this lesion. The dermatologist can also read out the device to see how the nevus has changed. The result is that the users feel supported in the procedure of selfscreening. Also, their quality of selfscreening has been improved. Together with a decreased change of false-alarms visits and melanoma diagnosed in a late stage, the investment of this product is justified for those with an elevated risk on melanoma.","medical; skin; cancer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-10-23","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Discrete-event systems encompass a wide variety of today’s systems including manufacturing cells and networking protocols. To prevent a system from entering a forbidden state and to ensure nonblockingness, it is desirable to control, or restrict, the behavior of such a system. The supervisory control paradigm allows for the synthesis of a supervisor which produces the necessary feedback to appropriately restrict the behavior of the system. When discrete-event systems are described modularly, the number of states grows exponentially with the number of components; this is known as the state-space explosion problem and is one of the central challenges of supervisory control. State-tree-structures and modular approaches are strategies which address issues of complexity in supervisory control. However, both still suffer from heavy computations when ensuring nonblockingness. In this thesis we introduce a novel procedure for a more efficient check for nonblockingness of state-tree-structures. This is accomplished using the structural properties of state-tree-structures to separate the shared events from the unshared events of a system. We build a recursive two-layer hierarchy in which the bottom level contains the parallel components, and the top level is an abstracted view containing the shared events between these components. To maintain reachability properties in the top level, the components of the system must be clustered such that in each cluster one can reach every outgoing transition from each incoming transition. This is formalized as a uni- versally reachable cluster. We introduce an algorithm which optimally clusters system components in such a manner. This clustering allows us to reformulate the conditions of nonblockingness in a hierarchical manner; the system is nonblocking if and only if both the top level and each component in the bottom level are nonblocking. Given a small top level and that the bottom level has no shared events, the components can be analyzed independently and in parallel, thus drastically reducing computation times. To verify performance, the universally reachable clustering algorithm was implemented and analyzed for a set of random automata and was found to reduce the number of states on average by 95%. Additionally, our entire procedure to verify nonblockingness was applied to a practical production cell example in which we achieved a 99.99% reduction in the number of states to be examined.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wigmans, G. (mentor)","2011","A transforming world The world is transforming as geographical locations are becoming less important as communication and transport facilities are expanding their domains, becoming increasingly efficient. The trend is clear; nations are opening their doors for people, trade, and knowledge in order to get involved in the world economy. We are now confronted with the phenomenon of globalization and Global Cities. London, New York, and Tokyo are examples of such cities as they represent a strategic space where global processes materialize in national territories and global dynamics run through national institutional arrangements. (Sassen, 2001) But the main question arises how African cities cope and what the (dis)advantages are for countries that is not participating in the global network (yet). One of the means for a city to position itself is through a mega event. A Global Event; the 2010 FIFA World Cup The Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, the World Expo, Rugby World Cup are famous events. As spectators we usually experience these events powerfully as our nationalistic pride gets put to the test. We watch proudly how our warriors reach the battlefields and subsequently win international recognition or lose their national honor. These events warrant the title of a ‘Mega Event’, a large-scale event with a high profile and global publicity. A mega event, also known as the ‘hallmark event’, is officially defined by Ritchie: “Major one-time or recurring events of limited duration, developed primarily to enhance the awareness, appeal and profitability of a tourism destination in the short and/or long term. Such events rely for their success on uniqueness, status, or timely significance to create interest and attract attention” (Ritchie, 1984). In 2004 South Africa won the bid and was granted the opportunity to host the 2010 Federations Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World CupTM. This was celebrated throughout South Africa and the African continent. There is a common belief that a mega event gives the host endless benefits and opportunities. Of course, this can be true, but the risks are often underestimated. To summarize, a Mega Event like the FIFA World Cup, brings new features to a hosting city; worldwide publicity, a stadium, infrastructure, accommodation, public spaces, upgrades of neighbourhoods, visitors, and therefore a great deal of business. However, when the event is over, the host city/region is left with infrastructure built to transport millions of travellers, a venue built to host thousands of spectators, and accommodations meant to house thousands of visitors. The new structures are often oversized or do not fit in the wider urban context of the host cities leaving them unused after the event, making them white elephants. Therefore the question is what the impact was of the global event, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, on the host city Cape Town. How did Cape Town develop its strategies in the preparation phase and how were the strategies realized? Problem Statement The legacy of the 2010 FIFA World Cup (2010 FWC) has not been effectively used to ensure a continuation of the developments created by World Cup and enhance the host city’s global position. Main research question What urban strategy should a host city of the FIFA World Cup in South Africa execute in order to trigger further developments and gain full benefits of the legacy of the FIFA World Cup 2010?","strategy; mega; FIFA World Cup; Global; events; Globalization; Legacy; Segregation; 2010; Variables","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor)","2011","Live-streaming media applications over the Internet are characterized by time deadlines and bandwidth constraints. Reliability over the Internet has been provided traditionally by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) based on retransmissions. However, resending the missed information leads to a waste in time and bandwidth. Erasure correcting codes can be used as an alternative to TCP. In this thesis, we consider the use of Luby Transform (LT) codes, which are part of the Digital Fountain (DF) codes. LT codes show a low encoding and decoding time as opposite to other erasure codes as Reed-Solomon (RS) and Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. They are also the first realization of rateless codes, where the number of encoded symbols is potentially limitless. Therefore, they are suitable for Internet applications, where the channel conditions can change very fast or be unknown. The accepted efficient decoding algorithm for LT codes is the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, unfortunaly it shows a rather poor performance when used with small sizes of message symbols. This turns out to be a limitation in live-streaming applications, as they should wait until that number of source symbols have been received for attempting decoding. In our project, we explore optimisations of the BP decoding process for LT codes when the number of information symbols is small. We present two new decoding algorithms that improve the performance of BP while keeping a low complexity. We show simulation results of the new LT decoding algorithms success rate and complexity versus overhead when used with small sizes, proving the gain in performance compare with BP.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Goossens, K.G.W. (mentor); Van der Wolf, P. (mentor)","2011","Over the last decade, the complexity of system-on-chips (SoCs) has continuously increased owing to the increasing demand for high performance IPs and SoCs. However, the productivity of chip designers has not scaled up at the same rate. This has led to an enormous design productivity gap. At the same time, the increasing time-to-market pressure and the high risk of design failure have all fostered the development of IP re-use based designs. One of the major challenges in re-using IPs is that it is difficult to configure and verify the performance of IPs/ IP subsystems after they are integrated into an existing SoC with a given infrastructure (on-chip network, memory subsystem, etc.). To overcome these challenges, we propose two performance estimation techniques that are based on high-level performance modeling of IPs and SoC infrastructure. These models capture some of their key performance characteristics (e.g. latency tolerance of IPs) and help relate the performance dependence of IPs on the service provided by the SoC infrastructure. Along with the advantage of re-using the high-level IP models in multiple SoC designs, the models allow the SoC designer to iteratively estimate the performance of a SoC over a range of IP and SoC infrastructure configurations, thereby aiding the design space exploration process. The proposed performance estimation techniques are particularly useful in rapidly re-assessing the performance of all IP/ IP subsystems once they are integrated into a given SoC design. The performance estimates provided by these techniques in the early SoC design stages saves a significant portion of the precious design time. The performance estimation techniques therefore simplify the process of integrating new IPs/ IP subsystems into existing SoC designs.","MPSoC design; Performance estimation; Latency tolerance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Otten, M.P.G. (mentor)","2011","After a MIMO revolution in the telecommunications world, this technology becomes increasingly popular in the radar world. The radar end-users are demanding more and more of their systems, while the targets are designed to have an as small as possible RCS, which makes them more difficult to detect. With multiple transmitters and receivers it may be possible meet the stringent demands of the users. Extending monostatic radar functions like target localization and Doppler velocity estimation to a multistatic configuration will show some significant improvements in resolution and overall situational awareness. With multistatic target localization, the cross-range resolution can be greatly improved and the overall system is much less susceptible to dips in the RCS, because it sees the target from different angles. With multistatic Doppler velocity estimations, a complete 2D or 3D target velocity vector can be composed to aid tracking and imaging techniques like ISAR. Multistatic ISAR is a perfect example of the strength of combining multiple radars. It can be used to achieve a higher resolution for the same integration time as a monostatic radar, or it allows a reduction of integration time, with a resolution equal to the monostatic case. A new concept in multistatic ISAR is the interpolation of the ISAR data. In case the geometry between the target and the radars does not meet the requirements for coherent combining the images, an interpolation of the data can be done. Not only the geometrical requirements can be eased, also the integration time can be artificially increased, allowing the radars to spend more time on other functions. Another new approach to multistatic ISAR is the incoherent combination of multiple ISAR images. This concept is called 2D ISAR and allows the creation of high resolution images with low resolution surveillance and MTI radars. The main idea of 2D ISAR is seeing the target under different angles, so the amplitude of the summation of scatters will be higher than that of the sidelobes, which allows to estimate the overall target dimensions.","multistatic; radar; coherent; ISAR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

Automatic processing diminishes the effect of human errors on the detection and allows extensive analysis after detection. Radar has certain advantages for human detection because of its all-weather and day and night capability, as well the fact it can function at a distance from the target. Radar-based systems to detect humans often consider the motion of these persons. Because of the micro-Doppler effect, human motion leaves a unique signature in a time-varying representation of the spectrum: the spectrogram, which can be used for the detection. Moreover, exploiting the micro-Doppler effect, allows to use low-cost and low-power consuming sensors, like a Continuous Wave (CW)-radar. The main objective of this research is to develop a algorithm that is capable of making a classification between human walking, human running and motion of other origin. Jointly, an estimation of motion parameters like velocity, height and phase of the gait cycle is performed. As approach, a particle filter implementation is chosen in combination with a model-based approach to analyze the human motion. The Thalmann model is used for human walking, while the Vignaud model is chosen for human running. A radar equipment model is developed to translate the kinematic positions and body dimensions first to a radar signal and thereafter to an estimated spectrogram. Based on the movements of some animals an estimated spectrum for the null-hypothesis was developed. Finally, the likelihood function for the particle filter was derived and the particle filter was implemented. The developed algorithm is tested both with simulated and with measured data. Because of its similarities to human walking, measurements of a walking duck were used to verify the null-hypothesis. For all inputs correct classification results were obtained. For human walking and running, the motion parameters were estimated correctly with satisfactory accuracy. An evaluation of the algorithm showed that Doppler resolution is very important to the performance of the algorithm. For Doppler resolutions poorer than 0.1 m/s the classification was performed wrongly and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the estimated motion parameters increased. Time resolution was found to be non-decisive for the performance. Instead, the number of iterations that could be performed at a certain time resolution determined the performance of the algorithm.","radar classification; particle filter; thalmann model; vignaud model; human motion; detection; micro-Doppler","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-11-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","MTS Radar","",""

Het onderzoek richt zich met name op de integratie van de ontwerp- en uitvoeringsfasen. Het toepassen van Concurrent Engineering in de bouw als strategie vraagt om een andere werkwijze, dit betekent dat voor het toepassen van Concurrent Engineering in de bouw de samenwerking tussen de betrokken opdrachtgevers, ontwerpers en projectmanagers, mogelijk projectleiders van een bouwbedrijf, zal moeten veranderen naar het model van de toepassing in de auto-of vliegtuigindustrie, evenals de werkwijze van de projectorganisatie en de contractuele overkomsten. Dit moet zodanig gebeuren dat er op de eerste plaats geen afbreuk wordt gedaan aan hoe de bouw organisatorisch is ingedeeld en er op de tweede plaats volgens de principes van Concurrent Engineering kan worden gewerkt. Dit om daarmee de genoemde voordelen mee te kunnen behalen voor de betrokken opdrachtgevende, opdrachtnemende en uitvoerende partijen. Conclusie: Door het combineren van de beschreven concurrent engineering ontwerpmethode en het gestructureerde ontwerpproces wordt het gelijktijdige, parallelle, ontwerpen van het bouwwerk en uitvoeringprocessen voor het realiseren van het bouwwerk ondersteund.

In this thesis, we identify and analyze the problem of designing a coherent/consistent memory subsystem in general and then focus on FPGA-based multi-core embedded systems containing general purpose CPUs and dedicated hardware accelerators. We narrow down the range of the problem by targeting only the stream-based applications and developing dedicated application-specific solutions. A flexible Windowed-FIFO communication pattern is proposed to be used by the parallel programs being run on the multi-core system. The software APIs for the FPGA platform are implemented and tested, a customized streaming cache memory is designed, implemented and tested based on the proposed communication pattern and in the end, example embedded systems are developed and tested on the FPGA platform to prove the correct functionality of the APIs, the cache memory and the coherent data communication between the cores. All the tests are done on a Xilinx Spartan3dsp development board and all the hardware and software aspects of the FPGA platform are studied and their influence on the memory system is analyzed. The simulations and analyses show that the developed solution has less complexity and more scalability and portability comparing to existing solutions while it provides a flexible range of functionality that different streaming parallel applications can benefit from.","Memory consistency; Cache coherence; FPGA-based embedded systems; Multi-core; memory sub-system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded systems","",""

(mentor); De Hoog, C.M. (mentor)","2011","Aan het begin van de stadsvernieuwingsperiode was het beleid gericht op het vervangen van technisch verouderde bebouwing en bedoeld om sociale en economische achterstanden in woonwijken te verminderen. In veel gevallen heeft de stadsvernieuwingperiode geleid tot verbetering van de woningvoorraad en de leefomgeving in woonwijken. Na de stadsvernieuwingsperiode bleek dat niet alle problemen waren verholpen, zo bleven in veel stadsvernieuwingsgebieden de sociale en economische achterstanden voortbestaan. Naast dat steden te maken hadden met achterstandproblemen, ontstond er het probleem van een steeds grotere druk op binnensteden door toenemende urbanisatie. In heel Europa steeg van 1975 tot 1995 het aantal inwoners in Europese steden zeer snel; van 1,5 naar 2,6 miljard inwoners. Steden bleven vanaf die tijd groeien en in 2006 werd gemeten dat 70 tot 80 procent van de Europese bevolking in de stad woonde. Daarnaast wordt voorspeld dat in 2020 meer dan 89 procent van de Europese bevolking in steden zal leven. Ook in Amsterdam is sinds de laatste twintig jaar weer een trek richting de stad te zien. De stad binnen de ring is erg in trek als stedelijk woonmilieu en als vestigingsplaats voor bedrijvigheid. In antwoord op deze ontwikkeling is het beleid ten aanzien van het hanteren van deze groei, net als het beleid in andere Nederlandse steden, ook in Amsterdam veranderd en aangepast. De nadruk ligt nu veel meer op stedelijke herstructurering en transformatie van bestaande stedelijke gebieden, dan op stadsuitbreiding. De Oostelijke Eilanden zijn rustige woonwijken in de nabijheid van de historische binnenstad van Amsterdam en het Centraal station. Door de locatie in de stad hebben de eilanden de potentie om een aantrekkelijk leefbaar woongebied met voorzieningen te worden. Echter hebben de Oostelijke Eilanden te maken met diverse problemen. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn de slechte kwaliteit van de woonomgeving, eentonige uitstraling van de bebouwing en het gebrek aan voorzieningen. Deze problemen van de Oostelijke Eilanden zijn ontstaan in de periode dat het sanerings- en reconstructiebeleid van de jaren zestig overging in de stadsvernieuwingsperiode. In deze periode hebben de Oostelijke Eilanden, met een historisch verleden, plaatsgemaakt voor een nieuwe woonwijk, met onder andere eentonige bebouwing en weinig voorzieningen. Onderzocht wordt op welke wijze de Oostelijke Eilanden weer een aantrekkelijk onderdeel van de binnenstad van Amsterdam kunnen worden. Als basis voor dit onderzoek is het artikel van J. Montgomery: ‘Making a city: Urbanity, vitality and urban design’ richtinggevend. Montgomery beschrijft aan de hand van tien punten hoe de leefbaarheid en connectiviteit in binnenstedelijke gebieden vergroot kan worden.","stadsvernieuwing; diversiteit; functiemenging; flexibiliteit; straatleven; connectiviteit","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Studio Urban Regeneration","",""

(mentor); Van Oel, C. (mentor)","2011","The ambition of the Municipality of The Hague for a more unique, attractive, and competitive shopping street was the starting point of this research. All the main shopping streets in the larger Dutch cities look alike; they all have the same brands, the same decoration and the same layout. The Hague has decided to use their international image to counter this trend of look-a-like shopping streets. However, the question has risen as to how they should approach this. The goal of this research, therefore, was to formulate solid advice for the municipality of The Hague on how to maximize the opportunities associated with the international identity of their retail area. The focus was on the Grote Marktstraat, a street which is planned for reconstruction. In this research, the communication of a place identity is defined with the help of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ characteristics. Hard characteristics were defined as the fixed environment, the design and the infrastructure of the place. Soft characteristics were defined as the non tangible aspects of the place, which include the service, the use, and the supply of the place. The important soft and hard characteristics in an international shopping street were identified and examined with the help of expert and expat interviews. The perception of the consumer is tested with the help of a consumer survey, including a vignette experiment. Based on different shopping statements it appears that the expat respondents are more hedonic shoppers, while the Dutch respondents are more utilitarian shoppers. In line with this it appeared that the expats much more combine shopping with other activities compared to the Dutch respondents. Several questions concerning software aspects helped to discover the important software aspects for the consumers. The consumers find an attractive public in an international shopping city essential. In this public space the presence of green is vital for an international shopping street. A high service level is especially important for the expats. High service level includes English speaking employees, English signing in the street and just overall service level in the stores. Longer opening hours is also a way of providing service. The supply of certain type of brands and stores is another significant aspect in an international shopping city. The Dutch respondents fashion exclusive stores in an international shopping streets, while the expats find the presence of exclusive stores and chain stores just as important. With the help of the vignette experiment the perception of an international shopping street by the consumer was tested. This experiment included 11 hardware variables: Green, Height of shop windows, Parcellation of building, Shop activities on second floor, Cyclist in the street, Parking of bicycles, Type of lightning fixtures, Profile dimension, Seating, Zoning of the pavement and the Neatness level. The DCA (Discrete Choice Analysis) of the total sample shows 11 attribute levels have a significant effect on the image of an international shopping street: Trees in the street (p=<.0001), Small profile dimension (p=<.0001), Medium profile dimension (p=<.0001), 3 Zones with small mid zone (p=<.0001), Normal seats (p=<.0001), Chandeliers (p=<.0001), Cleanest neatness level (p=0,0002), Medium neatness level (p=0,03) and no shops visible on second floor (p=0,02). The expats are used for the operationalisation of the important variables of an international shopping street. Comparing the results of the expats with the results of the Dutch respondents reveals the effect of the frame of reference on perception. The expats show a different amount and a different order of importance for the attributes compared to the Dutch respondents. The significant attribute levels for the expats are (in order of importance): Trees in the street (p<0.0001), Medium profile dimension (p<0.0001), Cleanest neatness level (p=0.0003), 3 zones small mid zone (p=0.0007), Chandeliers (p=0.0001), 3 Zones Broad mid zone (p=0.0044), No Racks (random parking) (p=0.0097), Normal Seats (p=0.002), Smallest profile dimension (p=0.0147), No shops visible on 2nd floor (p=0.0308). The expats have a clear preference for the medium profile dimension, which differs from the overall sample. Two levels of the attribute zoning resulted in significant positive utilities, which shows that the zoning is very important for the expats. That is, zoning should be indicated, the level NoZoning receives a negative utility. The expats also grant a positive significant utility to the attribute level NoRacks. The expat prefer randomly parked bicycles above the level bicycles parked in racks and the level no parked bicycles at all. For the Dutch respondents, the order of importance of the significant attributes diff ers from the expats. The significant attribute levels, in order of importance, are: Trees in the street (p<0.0001), Small profile dimension (p<0.0001), Medium profile dimension (p<0.0001), Normal seats (p<0.0001), Chandeliers (p=0.0002), 3 zones with small middle zone (p=0.0034), Cleanest neatness level (p=0.0369) and Bicycles Allowed (p=0.023). Although the attribute levels Profile Dimension Medium and profile Dimension Small are ordered one after the other, the parameter estimate indicates a clear preference for one of the levels. The level profiled Dimension Small receives an utility of 0,85 while the level ProfileDimMedium receives the utility of 0,45. The Smallest profile dimension is clearly preferred by the Dutch respondents, in contract to the preference of the expats.","Retail; Discrete Choice Method; The Hague; International; Identity; Shopping streets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate and Housing","","Retail and Leisure","",""

This research is presented in chapter 2. In the research the waterline and cross sections are compared with the previous years. The following is concluded: there is a strong seasonal variation which influenced the measured data, there is a decreasing trend of erosion at the north side and increasing at the south side of Sirius beach and finally the beach is heading towards an equilibrium. In chapter 3 a research to the breakwater next to Sirius Beach is done. Conclusion of the research is that the breakwater shows a lot of damage. This damage is caused by wave attacks during storms. The stones were to small and could be lifted by waves. Also research is done to the breakwater in front of the Grand Hotel Varna. Conclusions are that there is no good cost-benefit analysis done before constructing the breakwater, the breakwater is never finished which brings with it that the parts of the breakwater are still in stock and the freeboard is too low. So overtopping happens a lot. And finally the entrance is at the wrong position, so in the summer (the period the breakwater is used) the waves enter the harbor. The second day of the fieldtrip the group went to Asparuhovo Beach. This beach at the south side of Varna is described in chapter 4. Two cross sections are made and depth measurements are done by an echo-sounder. The most important conclusion is that a sand bank in front of the coast is observed in this year, which wasn’t at this location in 2010. This might be a result of the weather, because in 2011 the weather was much better than the year before. Future measurements should confirm of reject this hypothesis. An analysis of the breakwater at Asparuhovo Beach gave us the result that in the construction of the breakwater some mistakes are made. A pipe in the breakwater is a weak point, the combination of the tetrapots with the stones is a bad filter and the concrete slab at the top of the breakwater isn’t flexible. Chapter 5 will give an overview of the Sieve Analysis done by the samples taken from Asparuhovo Beach. The most important conclusions are that the calcium percentage in the sand is lower than 10%. So it does not affect the sieve curves. The beach is rather uniform in long shore direction, the finer sand is found off shore and the coarser sand can be found at the waterline and off shore the sand is more well-graded than at the beach. At day four of the trip, two quarries in the neighbourhood of Varna are visited, the Marciana quarry and the Sini Vir quarry. In the Marciana quarry the weight, elongation and blockiness of several stones are determined. Along with these parameters, the determined dn50 and density are presented in chapter 6. Furthermore, based on the estimated significant wave height at Sirius beach (see chapter 3), the required dimensions of the armourstones from both quarries are determined, based on the formula of Van der Meer. The final conclusions are that the available rock in the Marciana quarry isn’t suitable for the repair works of the St. Konstantin groin. The rock in Sini Vir has a higher density which makes it more suitable.","Fieldwork; Varna; Bulgaria","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","Campus only","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

One way of reusing shared spatial data is by creating a new dataset by making use of spatial data available in a combination of external datasets. This has been the central theme in this thesis, as its main objective has been to explore the possibilities of producing a culture codes dataset by making use of external source datasets. Furthermore, the quality of these source datasets, as well as their semantic, geometric and temporal characteristics have been taken into account. The first step has been to describe and analyze a number of candidate source datasets, in order to be able to make a decision on which source datasets to use for the production of the culture codes. This included visual mappings between the classes and attributes of the candidate source datasets and the culture codes. Four source datasets have been selected (AKR, LKI, BAG and TOP10NL), with the choice for these datasets being mainly based on their contents, quality and accessibility. After selecting these source datasets the visual mappings were translated into seventy-one decision rules for the production of the culture codes. Next, these decision rules were integrated into an extensive decision tree. The decision rules and the decision tree have been tested in a proof of concept. This proof of concept has been carried out in four case studies and quality analyses. The results of this proof of concept have been quite satisfying, with 80,3% of all results being right. In order to further improve the results of the production method, a number of additional datasets has to be used and a few decision rules need to be investigated. Furthermore, the large amount of spatial data used for the calculations has caused serious performance problems. This should get special attention when deciding to apply an (automated) production of the culture codes by making use of the proposed production method. However, in general, the thesis shows that producing the culture codes dataset by making use of external datasets should be seen as a serious option.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","GIMA","",""

(mentor); Schnater, F.S. (mentor)","2011","The subject of this thesis is the controversial case of a prison facility; a space with a very unique nature as it aims to enclosure and detention. Even contemporary alternative proposals do not really answer to burning questions like : What services contemporary prisons should offer? Does design matter? or Can architecture be a helping tool in the rehabilitation of prisoners? This project is tackling these issues. A different physical layout of prison facilities was the desired product of this project which would enable a new symbiotic relationship between the prisoners and the world and affect the traditional skepticism towards delinquents. The second aim of this project was the formation of a pilot program, a new approach concerning the services a prison should offer to both “users” and society. The physical layout of the prison would stem from this functional program. The testing location of this new typology is in the area east of the old Haarlem: the scheme locates the new prison in the east edge of the city, where the existing Panopticon prison is. It is considered to be the new landmark for the city, enriching the urban fabric and allowing for an enhanced active communication with relatives/friends/public which is part of the community-based program, contributing to inmate's future integration. The new structure is detached from the ground and the unnegotiable height becomes the “wall” between the prisoners and the outside world. It gives back to the public this part of the city after approximately 110 years of being blocked by Metzelaar's prison. this proposal is to show a dissociation with everything the Dome represents.

(mentor); van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor)","2011","The wake effect from upstream wind turbines is a hot topic recently and many researches on wake modeling have been carried out in the past few years. The wake models have evolved from the simple semi-empirical approach to the dynamic meandering model using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. However, some of current wake models cannot simulate the dynamic wake meandering process while the other CFD models are too complicated for engineering applications. So the purpose of this thesis is to develop a simple numerical wake model including the detailed wake velocity deficits and dynamic wake meandering process in the atmospheric boundary layer. The Simplified Eddy Viscosity (SEV) model is developed based on the simplified Navier-Stokes equation in Ainslie's work. It describes the wake mixing process in the atmosphere and gives an estimation of quasi-steady two dimensional velocity deficits. Furthermore, the turbulence generator is implemented in the SEV model and provides a three-dimensional turbulence flow field in the wake. An experimental validation study of stationary wake deficits is carried out by using measurements from ECN‘s wind turbine test station. Moreover, the SEV model is modified according to ECN‘s measurements and it shows a fair agreement with GH Bladed eddy viscosity model. Besides the stationary wake deficits, a simple dynamic wake meandering mechanism is introduced in this thesis. According to this mechanism, the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model is developed, which is an integration of the wake meandering process, the wake deficits from the SEV model, and the aeroelastic model from GH Bladed. The DWM model is validated with Risoe‘s model and GH Bladed and there is good agreement between these models. The DWM model is used for load analysis and then compared with the traditional estimation method MET prescribed by the IEC 61400-1 standard. The flow fields in the DWM model are closer to the physical processes of wake transportation in the atmospheric boundary layer. The results show a significant difference between the methods chosen for the fatigue damage estimation.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy Research Group","","","",""

(mentor); Poulis, J.A. (mentor); van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor)","2011","In an increasingly competitive energy market, the cost of a wind power plant has become more important. A tubular steel tower supporting a wind turbine can amount to up to 20% of the overall turbine costs and its optimization may lead to substantial savings with regard to the costs and the use of materials. One important aspect of the design is connections between the tower’s sections and between the cans. The towers usually consist of steel segments, made of several welded cans (conical subsections), which are further connected by welded flanges. The welded connections have high risk of fatigue failure leading to the thick tower wall. Also, the flanges are very expensive. This research is focused on improving wind turbine towers by using adhesive bonded joints instead of welded joints and flanges. This idea is investigated and the principles of bonded connection are presented. Fatigue resistance is treated as the main discerning factor between the existing design and the proposed solution in this study. The first part of the project focuses on providing a design solution for replacing the bottom-most flange with the bonded joints. A comparative cost study of the proposed solution is also provided in this project. In the second part, optimization of the thickness has been investigated for the entire tower when the cans are bonded circumferentially using adhesives instead of welds. For the cost analysis of the proposed solution, an 80m reference tower was designed based on the stability and the fatigue assessment of the welds. The approach is use a reference 3MW wind turbine model in GH Bladed. The proposed bonded joint is a tubular-single lap joint based on implementation of simple analytical Volkersen Model. A design guideline for the adhesive bonded joint is presented. Furthermore, particular focus was given to the factors affecting a joint strength and their behavior in a bonded joint. Finally, the benefits in terms of fatigue strength, design simplicity, and cost savings are addressed in detail. According to this study, the replacement of the bottom-most flanges with an adhesive bonded joint provides a maximum cost reduction of 17%. This seems to be an economically feasible assembly solution. For the bonding of entire cans in the tower, only the top two cans can be bonded economically, keeping the remaining cans to be welded to each other. The replacement of welds in the entire tower by bonded joints is possible, however, in comparison to the existing solution it is not a feasible solution in terms of material and cost saving.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Koppels, P.W. (mentor)","2011","Gedurende een lange periode kon de kantorenmarkt als een aanbodgestuurde markt worden beschouwd. Het aanbod was kleiner dan de vraag en nieuwe kantoren werden, ongeacht locatie en kwaliteit, vrijwel zonder problemen gevuld. Daar is inmiddels verandering in gekomen. De leegstand in de kantorenmarkt is groot en er is sprake van een vragersmarkt, waarbij kantoorgebruikers steeds verdergaande eisen stellen aan hun vastgoed. En omdat de leegstand een structureel probleem is, zal deze situatie langjarig aanhouden. In een dergelijke markt is het belangrijk om goed in de huid van de kantoorgebruiker te kunnen kruipen. Dat gebeurt echter nauwelijks. De meeste onderzoeken onderscheiden gebruikers naar bijvoorbeeld omvang of bedrijfssector, maar dat blijven zeer beperkte indelingen. In deze analyse is daarom op een aantal andere manieren gekeken naar de gebruiker en is onderzocht of er een segmentatie (indeling) te vinden die veel beter aansluit op de voorkeuren voor locatie- en gebouwkenmerken. Daaruit volgt de onderstaande centrale probleemstelling: Welk type indeling van kantoorgebruikers is het beste om huisvestingsvoorkeuren van gebruikers aan te koppelen? Vanuit het theoretisch kader zijn daarbij een aantal verschillende manieren naar voren gekomen waarop gebruikers gesegmenteerd kunnen worden:  De eerste type indelingen zijn gebaseerd op bedrijfskenmerken: de sector, de bedrijfsstijl of een combinatie van beiden. Bij de sector handelt het om de bij de Kamer van Koophandel ingeschreven bedrijfssector. Bij de bedrijfsstijl staat de wijze waarop een bedrijf omgaat met een aantal kernwaarden centraal. Hierbij is onderscheid gemaakt tussen bedrijven die gericht zijn Kosten & Efficiëntie, op Klant & Kwaliteit of op Creativiteit & Innovatie.  Bij de tweede indeling staat het type kantoor (hoofdkantoor, front-office of back-office) centraal.  De derde indelingsmethode betreft een clusteranalyse, waarbij de relatie tussen de kantoorgebruiker en zijn voorkeuren andersom bepaald wordt: op basis van overeenkomende voorkeuren worden de gebruikers zo goed mogelijk geclusterd in een zelf te bepalen aantal clusters.  De laatste indelingsmethode is een geografische indeling, waarbij de bedrijven binnen dezelfde deelgebieden geclusterd worden. Om de centrale stelling te toetsen zijn de kantoorgebruikers toegevoegd aan de gebouwendatabase zoals die door Remøy en Koppels is opgezet. De gebruikers zijn vervolgens geënquêteerd, waarbij de vragenlijst met name inging op locatie- en gebouwvoorkeuren alsmede op een aantal bedrijfsmatige aspecten. Bij de analyses zijn vervolgens huisvestingsfactoren gekoppeld aan de verschillende indelingen. De verwachting daarbij was bijvoorbeeld dat gebruikers uit de “creatieve & innovatieve” hoek duidelijk andere voorkeuren voor wat betreft kantoorgebouw en locatie hebben dan gebruikers die “kosten & efficiëntie” opgeven. Bij de indelingen is er gekeken naar de homogeniteit van de huisvestingsvoorkeuren binnen de verschillende groepen. Er zijn echter nauwelijks significante homogene groepen uit de analyses voort gekomen ondanks de ruime significantienorm van 75%. De analyse waarbij de waarderingen van huisvestingsfactoren tussen de verschillende groepen met elkaar wordt vergeleken heeft hierdoor ook geen significante uitkomst gegenereerd. De resultaten binnen dit onderzoek hebben daardoor alleen een indicatief karakter, harde conclusies kunnen niet worden getrokken. Reflecterend op het onderzoek waren de ambities hoog, het koppelen van kantoorgebruikers aan huisvestingsvoorkeuren is daarom ook niet geheel geslaagd. Aan zowel het verzamelen van informatie als bij wijze van segmenteren van de verschillende indelingen zijn verbetering mogelijk. De omvang van het aantal respondenten speelt hier ook een belangrijke rol in. Ondanks dat er binnen deze studie geen harde conclusies kunnen worden getrokken ben ik ervan overtuigd dat het belang van goede indelingen van gebruikers in de nabije toekomst een grotere rol zal gaan spelen. Als de voorgestelde verbetering uitgevoerd worden dan zal dit wellicht leiden tot indeling die wel breed toepasbaar is.","kantoren; kantoor; gebruikers; gebruikersvoorkeuren; tevredenheid; kantorenmarkt; gebruikersgroepen; segmentatie; classificering; indelingen; Amsterdam; Amsterdamse kantorenmarkt; cluster analyse; bedrijfsstijl; primaire activiteit; geografische indeling; kantoortype; Savills","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-11-01","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Managemnt","",""
