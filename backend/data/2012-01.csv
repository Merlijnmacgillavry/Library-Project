(mentor); Van der Zaag, E.J. (mentor)","2012","De hoofdvraag die wij ons ( Joost, Yannick en ik) stelden voor ons onderzoek was: “Hoe kunnen we door middel van architectuur de sociale interactie tussen de bewoners vergroten. Deze vraag komt voort uit een ontwikkeling die al een tijd actueel is. Namelijk de Netwerk Society. De mensen waren eerst veel meer met elkaar betrokken op de kleine schaal in de buurt (beter een goede buur dan een verre vriend). Door de ontwikkeling van de auto, telefoon en het internet, is het nu makkelijker om die verre vriend, bereikbaar te maken.(afb. 1) Dit kan negatief van invloed zijn op de buurt. Buren raken vervreemd van elkaar, waardoor de sociale cohesie en daar mee de buurt, in kwaliteit achteruit gaat. Het is daarom belangrijker geworden dat bij het ontwerpen van woonbuurten extra aandacht wordt gegeven aan de sociale cohesie. Een goede cohesie ontstaat onder andere door goede interactie tussen de bewoners. In ons onderzoek hebben we eerst literair onderzoek gedaan naar architecten die over dit ontwerp hebben geschreven. Zoals Herman Hertzberger en Machiel van Dorst.(afb. 2) Uit dit eerste deel van het onderzoek hebben wij 3 hoofdpunten opgesteld die samen voor een goede sociale cohesie kunnen zorgen. Deze punten zijn: Territory, Oppertunity, Connection.(afb. 3) Belangrijk is wel dat deze punten allemaal gelijktijdig voor komen, omdat de deze punten met elkaar in verband staan. Een plek kan veel verblijfskwaliteit hebben, maar als er geen connectie is met deze plek, is de kans op interactie veel kleiner. Elk hoofdpunt hebben we opgedeeld in een aantal subelementen, die dit hoofdpunt definiëren en waarmee we de case studies konden onderzoeken. om een voorbeeld van de subelementen te geven: Territory: o Personalization. Is er de mogelijkheid om een eigen identiteit te geven aan het gebied rond je woning? o Identity Zit de woning aan de zoveelste straat in de buurt, of heeft het een eigen karakter? Is deze makkelijk te herkennen? Is de woning een onderdeel van een groter geheel? o Physical barriers Zijn er zichtbare obstakels die de ruimtes er achter tot een gebied definiëren? Een voorbeeld van een dergelijke obstakel kan een trap zijn, maar ook 2 hoge gebouwen die samen een soort poort vormen vallen hieronder. Door deze barrières ontstaan er andere gebieden met andere (ongeschreven) regels. Publiek, semi- publiek, semi- privaat, privaat. Tijdens de case studies stelde we ons onder andere steeds de vragen: Is er gedacht aan 1 van deze punten? Zo ja hoe en waar bevinden ze zich? Zijn alle punten in evenwicht? Ontwerp Met deze kennis ben ik begonnen met ontwerpen van een stadsenclave. Stadsenclaves zijn nieuwe woongebieden met een eigen identiteit, die zich op leeggekomen industrie- en bedrijfsterreinen of verouderde woongebieden bevinden. En waar uit onderzoek ook bleek, de kans op een goede sociale cohesie het grootst was. Bij het ontwerpen heb ik de 3 hoofdpunten nauwlettend in de gaten heb gehouden. Ik heb hierbij gelet op een rustige overgang van publiek naar semi-publiek, naar semi- privaat naar privaat. De meest duidelijke grens hierbij zijn de trappen die het publieke van het semi-publieke scheiden (afb.4). Maar ook subtiele overgangen zoals verandering van materiaal. Daarnaast heb ik een groot aantal tussenruimtes ontworpen in het semi- publieke en publieke gebied. Doordat deze gebieden een grote verblijfskwaliteit hebben ontstaat er contactmogelijkheden tussen de bewoners rondom een plein of tussen de bewoners van de pleinen in het meer publieke deel. (afb. 5) Deze gebieden zijn voor alle bewoners makkelijk te bereiken, en van uit de woningen zichtbaar. Hierdoor ontstaat er meer kans dat deze tussenruimtes daadwerkelijk worden gebruikt. Omdat er zicht op is, ontstaat er ‘natuurlijke beveiliging’, wat bijdraagt aan de kwaliteit.","stadsenclave; sociale interactie; Berlijn","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Dwelling","","At Home in the city","",""

(mentor)","2012","The Re-Exploration Of Territory. It takes centuries for a natural landscape to be formed while it only takes decades to replace this for an urban landscape. Since the Industrial revolution mankind has found new ways to demand more and more natural territory, transforming it into human territory. Especially in areas where excessive industrial methods have been used to dig for non-renewable energy resources, scars become visible in the landscape representing the exhaustion of nature. One of the primary most valuable fossil fuels is coal, the black gold. Throughout the world several places have turned into machine like landscapes to dig for coal, supported by thousands if not millions of mineworkers, to bring it up all the way from the deep dark earth into the light of day. But as soon as these natural reserves are running out factories will close resulting directly in a radical decrease of employment. Introducing a new era, in which cities are left with critical and unattractive conditions full of abandoned factories and old mining sites that uninterrupted continue the process of decay leaving its inhabitants without any hope for the future. While the history of these cities is reminded as negative and black due to the huge amount of human labour the future perspective nowadays looks even darker. Belgium is one of the countries where an industrial backbone with a huge image problem as a result of the coal mines can be found. The Walloon region located in the middle of Belgium stretching east to west over 200 km is even referred to as the ""Black Country."" In areas like these territory, from an architectural point of view, becomes not only ambiguous but also scaleless. A successful operation with the goal to reactivate such a large region with an architectural intervention seems completely out of reach far away from the reality of today. It is not only the huge dimension of the area that is, on almost every visible scale, screaming for a gigantic intervention but also the present depressed atmosphere which on a psychological level makes it even harder to handle. There is no escape possible since every element that reminds of this history whether it is an abandoned mine site, railway, waterway or the hills of waste coal present throughout the landscape form a painful confrontation with reality. And this is exactly the problem, the presence of the ghost of history roaming around the Walloon region, leaving an architect completely unable, due to its largeness and extensiveness, to set any serious goal for revival or recovering. While a solution for the WHOLE area is more than needed to create new possibilities with a positive perspective for the future. As often the solution for this problem is housed in the problem itself in which the extensiveness of the mine sites is to play a key role as a starting point to create a fragmentized impact throughout the region. Another main issue is concerning the architectural way of thinking. While architecture itself is often set to be the goal it is an useless concept as such in this case, since the ultimate goal is revival of the region. Architecture has to suit itself in the role as tool, forming a guide to achieve a higher goal. Let us return to the ambiguity of territory, in which 'terra' the Latin word for 'land' is housed. Looking back at the industrial mining landscape in which nature had to cope with severe loss and damage. While the manmade urban landscape is left to the devolution of time the natural landscape, despite all the destruction and loss, has the ability to restore and renew itself. And this is not only opening up new possibilities but it is also creating a new dimension in the problem of territory. Nature created coal – Humans remove coal and leave traces behind – Nature returns and evolves on the old remains. Within this struggle an interesting subject can be found on or near the old mine sites, hills made by man existing out of waste coal (trash). These hills, called Terrils, are closely related to nature but are created by man. To which territory do they belong? Decades after the closure of the first mines these Terrils are the first to be taken back by nature. Evolving, as green archipelagos, clearly present as fragments within the industrial landscape. They house the answer of revival, a huge potentiality, but can it be explored?","Terril; Charleroi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-31","Architecture","Public Building","","Studio Public Territory","",""

Cemetery and Public Park","Saavedra Lux, S.V.","Nottrot, R. (mentor); Van Dooren, E. (mentor)","2012","We are living in a society of the ‘image saturated’ world, where perceptive and sensory qualities are more and more being diminished by the density, the material excess and the speed of modern life. Most designed environments are sterile and highly ordered. In contrast to these spaces stand the terrain vagues, spaces where the passage of time has created an order of a different kind, a fragmentary nature, where the boundaries between landscape and building have become less clear. These spaces offer environments where we can reactivate our sensory and perceptive powers and find a retreat to linger and reflect. They act as an oasis amidst the city, like a pause within the standardized environments that we inhabit everyday. However, the tendency is to transform these spaces into reconstructed spaces, doing predictable designs. Having thoroughly experienced the qualities of vague terrains in the Ruhr area in Germany, the aim of the project was to design a program keeping the intrinsic characteristics of the terrain vague with a minimal intrusion on the landscape. In order to avoid disturbing the character of the site, the shape of the building (both interior and exterior) is directly derived from the forms of the surrounding environment, letting it blend naturally with the landscape. Hence, the building emerges from the landscape, leaving only subtle traces on the territory. The atmosphere of the abandoned industrial territory is retained by keeping the wild vegetation that colonised the terrain during many years of dereliction. The resultant cemetery and public park is a silent space, arousing our inner senses, letting body and mind immerse into total isolation, evoking an architecture were we can pause to contemplate. An architecture which is silent, but changes constantly by the effects of light and shadow, surface and material. A space surpassing the separation between inside and outside and space and time.","Cemetery; Public Park; Terrain Vague; Landscape Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-09","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

(mentor); Koppels, P. (mentor)","2012","Research has indicated that building processes with characteristics of integrated procurement can have a positive effect on the investment costs of a building. However, the relation between these characteristics and operational costs has not often been studied (operational costs include maintenance, cleaning and energy-related costs, e.g. heating, electricity and water). This is a missed opportunity since research indicates that not the investment costs but the operational costs are the majority of the life cycle costs of a building. But even if both types of costs would be foreseeable, building projects still have very different characteristics and are difficult to compare, although this is required in order to find out which building process characteristics influence the life cycle costs. Therefore in this study the main problem to be answered is how to design a method to compare various projects. In this report a method to compare different building projects in the school housing sector will be presented. This comparison is focused on life cycle costs and their relation to building process characteristics. In order to do so an inventory was made of the most important elements (building process organization, life cycle costs and schooling accommodation) and the relationships between them. In three case studies the available data on life cycle costs necessary for comparable cases was assessed in order to identify their relevance and completeness. After conducting case studies the data that were available proved to be insufficient for comparison between case studies. Therefore, no relation could be shown between the building process characteristics and the life cycle costs based on these studies.","Whole life cost ratio; Life Cycle Costs; Essential characteristics of the Construction and Organization Process; School housing","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-22","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Van der Zaag, E.J. (mentor)","2012","De tijd die in de woning wordt gespendeerd neemt af. Door tal van activiteiten die de stad ons biedt wordt meer tijd met collega’s en vrienden besteed in de stad dan in en rondom de woning. Wij zijn hierdoor minder geneigd tot sociale gebondenheid met onze omwonenden en daardoor neemt de herkenning met de eigen woonomgeving af. Het stimuleren van de dialoog tussen bewoners door middel van het toevoegen van collectieve voorzieningen vormde het uitgangspunt voor mijn afstudeerproject ‘At Home in the City’. De gekozen bouwlocatie is gelegen aan de Bernauer Strasse, waar de voormalige Berlijnse muur Oost- en West-Berlijn van elkaar scheidden. Het voormalige patrouillepad dat er nog steeds ligt is de basis voor het herstel van de Bernauer Strasse. Het publiek toegankelijke pad vormt een unieke locatie en verbindt tevens de verschillende plekken in de stad met elkaar. De oude bouwblokken aan Oost-Berlijnse zijde worden hersteld tot semigesloten blokken waar het pad doorheen snijdt. Om het pad publiek aantrekkelijker te maken zijn pleinen aan het pad toegevoegd die gebruikt kunnen worden door zowel de buurtbewoners als passanten. Het ontworpen woonblok is een mix van collectieve en publieke voorzieningen op de begane grond en woningen op de hierboven gelegen verdiepingen. Bewoners hebben op de begane grond de mogelijkheid tot privaat gebruik van de voorzieningen en ontmoetingen met medebewoners. De relatie tussen de begane grond van het woonblok en het publieke pad worden versterkt door de twee pleinen: een publiek plein als centraal verkeerspunt en een recreatief plein voor bewoners. De woningen zijn twee aan twee geschakeld. Tussen elke twee appartementen is een vide en een collectief dek die de woningen ontsluit. De vide zorgt voor extra daglicht in de woningen maar ook voor een visuele verbinding tussen de woningen waardoor het bewustzijn dat mensen samen wonen in de stad wordt versterkt. Voor het reguleren van de privacy tussen de twee appartementen hebben de bewoners twee mogelijkheden. Het gebruik van de open en dicht te draaien lamellen aan de vide en het invullen van de doorgang, of buffer, naar het private terras. Deze buffer kunnen bewoners invullen met planten en andere persoonlijke eigendommen. Het invullen van deze buffer geeft bovendien een persoonlijke uitstraling naar de omgeving: een individuele invulling binnen een collectief domein. Alle appartementen hebben een terras op het zuiden dat grenst aan de woonkamer en is voorzien van een dikke borstwering voor vegetatie. Het begroeide terras versterkt het informele karakter van de publieke tuin en het publieke karakter van de tuin versterkt het sociale gevoel op het terras. Het ontwerp is een antwoord op het wonen op verschillende schaalniveaus van de stad in en rondom de woning. Waar bewoners de mogelijkheid hebben tot privaat gebruik maar ook gemakkelijk in contact kunnen komen met medebewoners als daar behoefte aan is.","woningbouw; Berlijn","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture & Dwelling","","At home in the city","",""

(mentor)","2012","The rise of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data has led to a large number of different and heterogeneous datasets and ontologies published on the Web. This kind of heterogeneity of datasets has created a need to interlink them, i.e. to make explicit that two resources of different datasets in fact represent the exact same concept. This is the task commonly known as ""ontology matching."" This thesis presents work on the development and evaluation of a domain-aware ontology matching approach geared at interlinking domain-specific ontologies to the cross-domain ontology DBpedia. We present a bootstrap method to automatically derive domain knowledge from an initial set of high confidence matches, and show several methods to translate this domain knowledge into an optimized filter that can be used to limit matches to. The domain derivation and optimization is accomplished in a fully unsupervised way. To explore the generalizability of the approach, we perform evaluations on two use cases: Last.fm artists and UMLS medical terms. We show that for ambiguous data such as artist and band names, the proposed approach outperforms a traditional matching approach by as much as 17.1% on an F-score scale of quality. Improvements for highly specialized data such as medical terms are less significant but can be gained by taking special measures. Finally, given an example application of medical training simulators, we show that the domain-aware approach is also potentially very useful when adapted to the semantic enrichment of free text, where a gain of as much as 26.6% is attained over traditional annotation approaches.","semantic web; linked data; ontology alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Engels, J. (mentor)","2012","De stad Den Haag heeft zich in het structuurplan 2020 voorgenomen zich te willen etaleren als een stad met internationale allure. De Noordzeekust wordt gezien als een van de onderbelichte kwaliteiten van de stad, een waarde die de komende jaren door de gemeente extra onder de aandacht gebracht zal worden. In eerste instantie wordt bij het versterken tussen de stad Den Haag en de kust voornamelijk gekeken naar een versterkte relatie met fysieke middelen, bijvoorbeeld door het verbeteren van het openbaar vervoer. In mijn onderzoek werd ik echter aangetrokken door het versterken van de relatie met minder fysieke middelen waarbij ik me voornamelijk heb toegespitst op de mogelijkheden voor evenementen en festivals. Het festival heeft de laatste decennia een enorme vlucht in populariteit genomen. Het festival heeft daarbij ook steeds vaker de rol van stadspromotie gekregen. Middels festivals kan aan een gebied sfeer en identiteit worden gegeven. Door de toenemende interesse bestaat echter het gevaar voor eentonigheid en verminderde kwaliteit. In een aantal situaties zijn evenementen zeer succesvol ingezet als motor voor transformatie. Dit is bijvoorbeeld gebeurt bij de Olympische Spelen van Barcelona in 1992 of bij de Westergasfabriek in Amsterdam. Het voormalige Norfolkterrein gaat door de mogelijke komst van de Olympische spelen & de Culturele hoofdstad een onzekere toekomst tegemoet. Mogelijk zouden evenementen op kleine schaal de mogelijkheden openhouden voor het in de toekomst organiseren van evenementen op grotere schaal. Daarbij zouden deze kleinere evenementen kunnen worden aangegrepen voor het ontdekken van de daadwerkelijke kwaliteiten van dit gebied. Het ontwerp voor het Norfolk omvat een evenemententerrein gecombineerd met een topsporthal en een aantal kleinere paviljoens voor organisatie en onderhoud. De intelligentie van het evenemententerrein zit in de combinatie van een modulair veranderbaar systeem gecombineerd met een ondergrondse parkeergarage onder het plein. Door elementen te veranderen of te verwijderen kan het plein in combinatie met de parkeergarage functioneren. Dit transformeert de garage in deze situatie tot een backstage. In hetzelfde profiel als het evenementenplein vormt zich uiteindelijk een sporthal welke zich los trekt van het eerder genoemde systeem. Doormiddel van verdiepte pleinen wordt hier de relatie tussen de boven en ondergronds versterkt en het bewustzijn van deze twee vertroebeld. Het materiaalgebruik van het gehele gebied sluit middels een grote hoeveelheid beton aan op het civiele karakter wat in het gebied heerst.

(mentor); Koopman, F. (mentor)","2012","The Baixa de Maputo is the historic core of the city of Maputo Mozambique, developed from the 17th century onwards from the Dutch fort Lijdzaamheid, the subsequent Portuguese fortified trading post to the heart of Lourenço Marques, the capital of the Portuguese colony, and after 1976, as Maputo, capital of the independent nation. The introduction of automobile traffic around 1945 favoured development of the new, broadly laid out modernist part of Maputo and caused a slow dilapidation of the Baixa de Maputo. Recently however, new development within the eastern part of the Baixa and the former industrial harbour area is creating a revival, but the city centre is however facing urban transformations with a severe impact on the composition and the functioning of the city. These recent developments in and around the Baixa ignore and deny its quality and by doing so form a threat to its identity of a melting pot of social, cultural and economical classes and activities. The developments de-democratize the city centre and by replacing the existing fabric have a severe impact on the composition and the functioning of the city and the inclusivity of its inhabitants. This project proposes a democratic respond to the current state of the city, matching conservation of spatial, economical and social quality with the accommodation of new requirements and programs. The project reacts on its context by including instead of excluding, enhancing instead of hindering and embracing instead of repelling, and at the same time the project identifies itself with recent developments and suits the evolving image of Maputo as a modern Metropolis. On the urban scale, the implementation of a sequence of spatial moments connects the different identities of the Baixa, develops the waterfront area as an social generator and provides a more accessible connection with the higher eastern part of the city centre. On the architectural and human scale this projects accentuates the most present cultural, economical and social value of this African city, which for me is the public street life and its adaptation and appropriation of space and build environment. The street life is defined by small-scale commercial activities based on gaining maximum necessities trough minimum means, which are provided by street vendors, car washers, parking guards etc and their receivers of service and/or goods. These activities form the complex, active and vibrant part of the public life. The project includes the public life to the architecture and vice versa and by doing so accentuates this typical identity of Maputo. The project accommodates social and economical street activity by facilitating its determinants (flow and gathering of people, bounding objects, shadow and sufficient space) and extra basic needs as water points, public toilets and urban furniture.","Maputo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","RMIT","","Maputo Studio","",""

(mentor); Steele-Dunne, S. (mentor)","2012","Soil moisture is important for the Volta Basin. However, in-situ measurements of soil moisture in the Volta Basin are scarce, only remote sensing observations are available. Remote sensing observations are also provided with limited temporal and spatial resolutions. Also capabilities of the sensors are limited (e.g measuring soil moisture limited in shallow layer), and observations from different instruments do not totally agree. Hydrological model can predict soil moisture. But model predictions rely on assumptions and suffer from input uncertainties. Therefore, data assimilation is used to combine the information from observation and model to achieve optimal estimation of soil moisture. In this thesis, AMSR-E data of volumetric water content and ERS data of relative saturation for the Votla Basin were compared, and TRMM precipitation data were also used to compare with the two sets of soil moisture data. The dataset of ERS relative saturation was further assimilated into the PCR-GLOBWB model for the period of January 1st 2003 to December 31st 2006 in the Volta Basin. An ensemble size of 100 was applied. A key objective of the thesis is to address spatial correlation of data. Uncertainties of the model parameter (storage capacity) and input forcings (evapotranspiration and precipitation) were represented with spatial correlation. Correlation lengths of the parameter and forcings were thus calculated. The outcome of perturbation managed to maintain the spatial pattern of data. In the next part, four EnKF schemes (EnKF (Ind), EnKF (Blk), EnKF (DistMx) and EnKF (NonObserved)) were applied and compared. Results show that the block size is consistent with the correlation length and that schemes which account for spatial correlation produce better and more realistic results than the one without spatial correlation.","EnKF; soil moisture; Volta Basin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (mentor)","2012","In recent years, innovations like Smartphones, 3G (wireless Internet), and social media have entered the Dutch market. These innovations lead to brand transparency because they give customers access to brand related information and and allow them share that information amongst each other. Loyal customers therefore might be tempted to consider other brands for making their purchases. The chance of this possible decrease of loyal customers is enhanced by the financial crisis, which makes customers more aware of their pattern of expenditures. Engaging your customers is a method to block the decrease of loyal customers, and it might even increase the number of loyal customers. Ahold is an international retailer, owning brands like Albert Heijn, Gall & Gall, and Etos in the Netherlands. Retailers are also subject to the possible decrease of loyal customers, and that is why Ahold should focus on customer engagement (CE). This graduation project investigates what CE exactly is, what it means to Ahold, how it can be created, all leading to a concept which creates CE for the customers of Ahold. Literature Study The literature study indicated that loyal customers are the ones that make repurchases at a brand and recommend it to friends and/or family. Engaged customers are one step further; they make repurchases and recommend the brand, but they also collaborate with the brand. Collaboration means that the customers give feedback to the brand, so they put effort in the brand. That effort gives the customer the feeling that he or she puts something of his or her own in the brand, which creates an emotional connection. Besides inidicating what CE is, the literature also described some important topics regarding which brands should be taken into consideration to create CE. First of all, a brand should focus on creating an emotional bond with its customers instead of a transactional one. Repurchases will automatically follow if a customer has an emotional bond with a brand. Secondly, a brand should perform a cross channel strategy to provide its customers with the needed information at the right moments of interaction. This provided information should be transparent, otherwise customers might think the information is questionable and they will consider other brands (as described in the first paragraph). Finally employees are very important, because they form a decisive factor for customers in experiencing a positive or negative interaction with the brand. Research The literature descibed CE from a brand’s perspective, but a customer’s perspective was missing. Therefore the qualitative research method, contextmapping, was performed to find the customer’s needs. The found needs were combined with external values (developments, trends, states, and principles) to define the following four most important factors which describe the customer’s perspective. Authentic newness - Customers like it if a company surprises them with a “new thing” as long as it is brand relevant and does not feel unfamiliar. Transparency - Customers want to be in control, and therefore they want a brand to be transparent. The brand should not have any secrets. Valued - Customers want to have the feeling of being valued by the brand. They want to be rewarded for the loyalty they show to the brand. Sharing - Customers want to share experiences with others, and be part of groups/communities. Innovations like social media increase the opportunity to share experiences and information. Concept The conclusions from the literature study and research were translated into a design brief. This brief described the requirements, wishes, and goals that the final design had to fulfill to create CE for the customers of Gall & Gall. This brand was chosen as a domain to design for, because it had the fewest products and/or services for its customers. The final concept is a product service system (PSS) which has an online and offline part. In the online part customers can co-create drinking experiences. These experiences consists of, by customers added, representative pictures and drink suggestions. Customers can also vote for the experiences they prefer the most, and after two months of co-creating the three top voted experiences will be placed in the Gall & Gall stores (offline part). This offline part consists of three products which represent the three top voted experiences, by showing the co-created pictures in a collage, and each one will also have three matching odors. Customers will first choose one of the experiences based on the collage, and then they will smell the different odors which facilitate a re-experience. Behind each odor is another drinking advice. The customer will ask Gall & Gall’s employee which drinks are advized by the odor he/she prefered the most.","customer engagement; product service system; smell; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The reservation system sets a restriction of 100 million yield data points. Because of the merger of KLM and Air France the Revenue Management systems are combined. Both companies generate about 70 million yield data points and therefore the restriction will be exceeded when the departments are combined. In my project I looked at the possibilities of reducing the amount of yield data in order to satisfy to the restrictions of the reservation system. This problem can be seen as the mathematical set cover problem, which is an NP-hard optimization problem. With the use of two solution methods, I found some surprising results to reduce the amount of yield data.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

These stadiums fulfill their purpose for only one month and afterwards the hosting country will be left with stadiums too big for their own competition or needs. The step from football stadium to multifunctional stadium is already made, in our view the next step is turning a multifunctional stadium into a “multilocational” stadium. This means that the location of the stadium can vary. A variable location results in a transportable stadium, there has been chosen for transport over water. Using the stadium in several countries will save material, space and money. To adapt to different demands of the specific locations and events, a flexible stadium is needed. Building up the stadium out of several modules, able to function on its own and as several configurations is the solution for a flexible stadium. Besides the flexibility, the functionality of the design is normative to create a realistic stadium design. The several modules, a configuration with two tiers (configuration 1) and a configuration with three tiers (configuration 2) are developed for the Innovative Stadium Design. Adaptability and Floating To transport the stadium over water, the stadium will be build on pontoons. For optimal transport, the main requirement was to be able to cross the Panama Canal. This determines the maximum dimensions for the pontoons and guarantees the optimal usage and transportability. All the separate pontoons will have to be stable and will be coupled to one rigid stadium pontoon. For optimal pontoon usage, the stadium has been separated in four elements; the pitch, first and second configuration and the entrance. By using the same entrance pontoons in both configurations, an optimization was made. Assembly and Disassembly To get a realistic and feasible stadium design, the scale of disassembly and the building time are the most important aspects of assembly and disassembly. The stadium design consists of several modules, in which platform design is the starting point. Platform design results in standardization of the modules which limited the number of loose elements and thus the building time. The standardization is visible in the modules which results in the stadium, but also in the added functions like toilets and SUP's. These functions will be added as universal units.","Floating; Assembly and disassembly; Stadium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-01","Architecture","Building Technoloy","","Stand Up Architecture","",""

The purpose is to define their potential use in the building environment as structural skins based on the integration of material properties, structural and daylight criteria. The design of a pavilion, located along the Scheveningen boulevard (NL), is being developed through the exploration of patterns, materials and structural techniques along the different scales. It refers to a communal space open to social activities while its main functions are a small theater and a café. Space continuity, view variation, connection between the inner and outer space, exposure and enclosure, are the main architectural aspects that are being investigated through the design process. The configurative principles of woven systems are translated to tectonic systems in order to address those aspects while at the same time correspond to structural (freeform, lightweight) and daylight requirements. A research on the characteristics of woven systems occurs in order to define the intrinsic parameters of the system relating to surface and structural characteristics. Based on those parameters the form generation process of the pavilion begins through a series of physical prototypes in different scales where patterns, materials and assembly techniques are being explored. The aim is to create a system of pattern variation driven by the spatial, structural and daylight aspects of the desired pavilion space. Through the production of physical models, an empeirical optimisation process is taking place – based on structural observations and daylight tests. The materialisation process of the pavilion focuses on the search of renewable materials which are flexible and rigid at the same time while acquire most of the textile properties. A combination of wood and natural fiber composites (NFC) is being introduced as a system of interconnected layers that ensures the stability and structural reinforcement of the pavilion while pattern differentiation results in different daylight intensities.","textiles; wood; patterns; daylight; natural fiber composites; lightweight; physical models; weaving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Building Technology","","Computational Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","The integration of renewables in electricity systems and urban areas loads have resulted in a wide daily price variation with overnight and off-peak prices which are far less than the prices in peak times or high demand period. The high difference in electricity prices makes it desirable to capture through some storage (technological) solution by storing cheap electricity at off-peak hours and sell that in high demand or peak hours. Different storage technologies provide this solution currently with a reasonably high initial/capital cost, minimal operation & maintenance cost along with low environmental impacts. As the cost of solar panels and wind turbines continues to come down, the return on investment (ROI) and payback period paradigms looks more promising for adding renewables which still is not the case of large (utility) scale storage technologies, despite its potential role and benefits in the electricity supply chain. This study highlights the important aspects of storage technology implementation in renewable energy sector of Spanish electricity market especially in the presence of special regime prices, to evaluate it economic justification for different applications particularly the time-shift benefit in contrast with the market prices. For this purpose the outcomes of a custom build model are analysed which are based on several inputs from the electricity market i.e. production data, different electricity prices and observed cost ranges with respect to different storage technologies (most of which are based on the previous studies in this field. The pumped hydro option was analysed to check how much gain the storage technologies are not obtaining in operational integration with wind farms. Based on these results it was found that due to (mostly) economic (high capital costs and FiT pricing) barriers the storage technologies are far from achieving the breakeven at large scale utility applications especially in time-shifting mechanism and renewables. There are some progressing technologies with better technical and future cost reduction likelihood which can achieve the breakeven or pay back within its life time but that mostly depends on the drastic reduction in cost through market competition, innovation and regulatory and monetary support from governments. Without these factors the progress in making storage as a permanent part of electricity infrastructure might not be realized in short or medium term.","electricity storage technologies; wind energy; time-shift application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","",""

The current crises however emphasize that trends can change quickly and have a lasting effect on the economy. Due to their large, long term investments, ports in particular need a good understanding of the future state of transport and logistics systems. Scenario based modeling can assist in doing this. This thesis presents three distinctive scenarios, the modeling approach and the results. Each scenario has a different geographical orientation: global, regional and local. The scenario of ‘Globalization under Chinese influence’ shows a world where globalization continues with a new market leader being China. ‘Regional production’ characterizes a market driven world with production closer to the market and more flexible supply chains. Finally, ‘Local for Local’ shows what the effects are of a scenario where local production and trade prevails and global trade is dominated by raw materials. A case study is applied to determine the effects of the scenarios on the container throughput in the Port of Rotterdam, a modelling approach is applied. Trade flows are estimated using a growth model based on GDP and gravity. This classical but effective method was applied to predict global trade between all countries. The transportation model that was used has both a global scope as well as a detailed multi-modal hinterland for Europe.","port; rotterdam; scenario analysis; modelling; containers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and infrastructure","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

We use a simulation model based on a case study to test the effects of the agreements on the operational behaviour of both suppliers and customers and the outcomes on the operational performance to demonstrate that the agreements are able to create Pareto Improvements for both parties and incentivize them to adopt the agreements and further exploit the potential benefits by adjusting their operational systems to further synchronize their operations.","Bullwhip Effect; Supply Networks; Supply Chain Management; Incentivizing; Decentralized coordination; Forecast Accuracy Discount agreements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Analyse of problem In the fall of 2008 the credit crunch started in The Netherlands. The financial sector in The Netherlands deteriorated with serious consequences for the Dutch real estate market. After years of increases in real estate investment, the investment volume in Dutch real estate decreased in the second half of 2008 (Debenham Thouard Zadel-hoff (DTZ), 2010 in Mierlo, Y.C.M., 2010). Until now the market conditions are extra-ordinary because few transactions take place. (Mierlo, Y.C.M., 2010) The crisis hits the area development, the real estate sector and municipal development com-panies hard. In many projects, progress is coming to a standstill and the cooperation between public and private is under pressure. Due to the economic and financial crisis, financing of projects has become difficult for both private and public parties. The government is withdrawing grants and banks are critical. This applies to both consumers and the investing parties. Banks only look at projects without risk and with a guaranteed positive return. Even then it is not certain that investments are made and buyers in the market let it fail. This provides the market limited space to invest and investors can take less risk. However, area developments in cities are really necessary. The cities must continue to adapt to new social needs and demands. Stagnation often means (relative) decline. (van ‘t Verlaat, 2007) The necessary redevelopments are especially needed in what is sometimes called ‘problem districts’. In these districts multiple problems exist, actually there is a con-centration of problems. In these districts there are additional questions to solve prob-lems with regard to living, working, learning, integration and security. When nothing is done, these problem areas will elapse even further. The (bad) per-formance of such a district presents many social problems (and costs). To maintain the residents of these districts, to preserve the people in a healthy and liveable envi-ronment to live and to let the children grow up, redevelopment is necessary, even in this time. Bospolder Tussendijken One of the defined problem districts where it is necessary that area development takes place is Bospolder Tussendijken in Rotterdam. Currently, Bospolder Tussendijken belongs to the weakest socio-economic districts of Rotterdam. Bospolder and Tus-sendijken were both on the list of ‘Beauty Districts’ (Prachtwijken) of Minister Voge-laar in 2007. Bospolder Tussendijken has been a problem district for a long time. In the urban renewal period a lot has been invested to improve the neighbourhood. Unfortu-nately until today, all investments have not been sufficient to cure the district. Around 2006/2007 an area conception has been created for Bospolder Tussendijken by the subcommunity Delfshaven, Proper Stok developers and Havensteder, the former housing association Com wonen. Havensteder was formed by a merger be-tween Com wonen and the Patrimoniums Housing Association (PWS) and owns about 70% of the housing, mostly social rental housing. Proper Stok developers got involved in the development because of its expertise in creating design concepts for urban area development problems. In the area conception, the problems of the district have been made visible and a direction is given what needs to be done for the district to function properly again. Based on this conception, a land and real estate exploitation of the design is made. This exploitation gave an operating deficit of about 10 to 13 million euro after which the project came to a standstill. The problems of exploitation was due to a number of different points: - Much capital invested in land development through the early purchase of the land. - A strong increase of invested capital by pre-financing in the real estate ex-ploitation. - A large parking garage. (Proper Stok developers, 2010) Definition of a problem Based on the above problem analysis, the following problem is formulated: 1. The current parties (like municipalities, housing corporations and project de-velopers) fail to obtain the needed (pre-)financing for inner city area devel-opment. 2. However, area development in problem districts is required to prevent fur-ther elapse of the district. There may be other ways to finance the necessary redevelopment. You can search for new value carriers (parties who can invest and can bear the value), by making connections to real estate reports to other social urgencies to support/replace the current parties in the area development. (see figure 1) Figure 1: Parties in inner city area development Main question The question is twofold: What ‘new parties’ can participate in the inner city area development and what value can these 'new parties’ deliver? Is this value enough to boost the area devel-opment back on track with the aim of getting the problem districts healthy and in demand again? The main question is answered by a qualitative and exploratory research. The data were collected through a literature review, a case study (Bospolder Tussendijken) and by conducting interviews with various experts. Theory research The definition of value is a wide-ranging concept. The term value is used in this study in two senses: - Objectively, a number that can be assigned to a property of a business, de-velopment, information etc. This is measurable, based on facts. - Subjectively, the assessment of a business, development, information, etc. by a person. Hooijmeier et al. (2001) divides the subjective values into three main species: - Use value: functional suitability, efficient use, efficient construction, man-agement efficiency, consistency, accessibility, interference. - Experience value: identity, diversity, recognition, significance. - Future value: steering effect, efficiency in time, extensibility. Value in (inner city) area development can be controlled in two ways. In the pro-cess (by involving the right parties at the right time) and in the district (by performing interventions). According to Roestenberg (2008) the process actually starts with the end users and ends with the landowner. The value is determined by what the end user wants to pay. Wingman (2011) indicates that this is determined by three factors: - The expected cash flows. - The risk attached. - The moment of the expected cash flows. Mulder (2006) has developed a theory specially about value creation in existing districts. This theory is about the desired and healthy district in relation to creation of value. The idea is that interventions and consequently investments, lead to a higher satisfaction of the residents what is reflected in the real estate value of the district. An investment means that residents will perform better, which will lead to lower costs for health care or social services. ""A district is healthy is when people live there without stress and worry and if people can develop their talents."" (Mulder, K. 2006, lend, M., 2006) Mulder (2006) indicates that if a district is healthy it is automatically desired and vice versa. (See Figure 2) Figure 2: Creation of value (Mulder, 2006) ""Generating value in the old districts. That is the key in inner city renewal. Whether it is about subjective or objective value, ultimately the aim is to make a positive return on investment and that the district benefits."" (Kam, 2008) The purpose of inner city renewal of an area cannot be characterized. Each pro-cess is a compromise between the wishes of residents, financial and physical capa-bilities, its location, the original design, the historical situation, the actual use and many other factors. (Brouwer, 2008). In this study, the goal of inner city area development in problem areas is that a dis-trict should become a healthy and popular district which provides creation of value of the real estate in the area. To transform a problem district into a healthy and popular district interventions should be made. What kind of interventions that are is dependent on the problems of the district and can range from social participation to the restoration of housing stock. When these interventions can be performed, different values can originate in the district, such as a rise in property value (creation of value). In this study, the parties who receive these value (s) are considered new potential investing parties. To figure out the values originating, the study made use of a case study: Bospolder Tussendijken. Empirical study The case study Bospolder Tussendijken is used to figure out two interventions and see what value is created and which parties receive these values and benefit from it. From the list of benefiters, two parties have been selected to assess the potential value they receive and they can provide themselves. The parties are selected based on three criteria: - Whether the parties have financial capacity to invest in the plan. - Whether the parties are bound to the area. - Whether the parties are truly ""new parties"" in the world of area develop-ment. The health insurer and the energy company are the ""new parties"" in the inner city area development which are selected and examined. In the following two sub-sections, the possible contribution of both parties is discussed. The health insurer The participation of a health insurance company in an inner city area development will not be enough to get problem areas healthy and popular. They can add differ-ent types of values to the process of creating higher real estate values in the district. The health insurer may for example invest in the primary care facilities in the district and can ensure social participation by setting up health care programs in the dis-trict. The views of various different health insurance companies differ as a result of which also the investments of each party may differ. Health insurer Agis is very in-volved in the development of Utrecht. They stimulate and coordinate the process of collaboration with primary care providers in the districts. Health insurer Achmea on the other hand does not promote actively and only coordinates when the caregiv-ers themselves come into motion. The values that may result from the investments of the insurer are objective and sub-jective. Objective due to the reduction of health care consumption in secondary care, saving directly on their spending. Subjective because of the experience value and future value. With the programs they improve their image and their attraction and by starting preventive measures they try to reduce health care consumption in the future. These fall in the list of economic subjective values of Hooijmeijer (2001). This means that after the objective values this will give the most value to the finan-cial management of the health insurer. The objective values are the most valuable in the business case of the organization. These values are converted to direct financial gain. The subjective values are not included in the financial business case but are therefore not less valuable. They cannot directly be added as profit but in the future they can indirectly take care of that. The economic value of investing in the health care services in the district depends on three factors: the risk involved, the expected cash flows and the moment of ex-pected cash flows. As investing in the health care facilities is a long-term investment for the health in-surer, there is risk. Costs should be made now with the expectation that, if the health care facilities start working integrally, savings will be made on health care money in the future. When the customers get a healthier lifestyle now by for example eating healthier, or through more exercise, that can lead to less health care consumption later on. But because the future is unknown, this involves assumptions. Besides, it is also not proven that investing in the health care facilities provides immediate objec-tive value to the insurer. Because it are long-term investments, also the expected cash flow returns will come only after several years. Because of this possible positive returns will show up only after several years. On basis of the above arguments, the economic value of investing in health care services will not be very high for the insurer. Investing in health care programs have less of a risk because the investments are lower and health care insurers have more experience with it. Thus, the effects are better known. But also these returns are only visible after a few years resulting in a lower economic value. Energy company As with the health care insurer, participation of an energy company in an inner city area development is not sufficient to get problem districts healthy and popular again. They can just as health care insurers add value to the process of creating higher real estate value in the district. The energy company can invest in the sustainability of existing housing stock to im-prove the quality of life of the current residents. Because of the fear that the current earning models of production, trade, transport and energy supply are not future-proof, energy companies have to innovate their earning models. The energy companies see new earning potential in various markets. These models focus more on current market demand and have an integrated approach. The market demand now focusses more on a sustainable energy plan to realise a de-sired energy reduction. To answer this question an integral look at the various sus-tainable installation options is needed. Only in this way an optimal cut down can be reached. The new earning models include: advice on several (sustainable) energy systems, the exploitation of (sustainable) energy systems and local energy supply. The values that may result from these investments from the energy company can also be divided into objective and subjective values. Objective as giving advice, the exploitation of sustainable installations and setting up a local energy company can add immediate value to the financial management of the energy company. Subjectively, as the company improves its image by helping the problem districts in innovative ways. Besides it can contribute to the sustainability ambitions of the company such as for example Eneco, by supplying sustainable energy to everyone. As previously mentioned, the economic value of investing in the existing housing stock in the district is depending on the cash flow and the risks. During advising and operating sustainable installations cash flows are fairly stable. During the exploitation an x amount per period will be received. The risk here is that homes become or that homes get demolished within the exploitation period. The risks of locally generated energy are more complex and higher because many assumptions have to be made about the future. Thus it is assumed that the price of energy rises in the coming years (p. 83) making it profitable to generate energy lo-cally. Which does not have to be the case. Also in this case the risk of vacancies apply. Implementation of new parties If the health care insurers and energy companies start to participate in the area development processes they should be involved in the initiation phase. In the initial phase the most value can be gained according to Roestenberg (2007), because at this point the most choices can be made. A disadvantage is that there is also little information known at this stage, complicating the cooperation. When one looks at the supply chain process (see figure 3 the coalition model) both parties participate in the property and management exploitation. With their inter-ventions, both parties are focused on the management and not on the ground and real estate operation. With redevelopment processes, the initial phase is the management phase. This coalition model is aimed at this and thus starts at the current value of an area. Figure 3: Coalition model Implementation in Bospolder Tussendijken The overall objective of inner city area development in problem areas is that a dis-trict should become a healthy and popular district providing creation of value of the real estate in the area. This goal is also pursued in Bospolder Tussendijken. To create value in the district, two specific objectives are formulated: - Increasing the housing quality and diversity of supply of housing and resi-dential environments in Bospolder Tussendijken for the current residents and new residents. - Investing in increasing the opportunities for upward mobility for the current and future residents. An emphasis here is on youth and families with key-words connect and progress. (Theuws, P., and van Haeften, P., 2009). To achieve these goals, a number of interventions have been identified for the dis-trict. In 2009, a regional vision was drafted with ten key strategies for Bospolder Tus-sendijken. These strategies are tested against the interventions from the literature review for consistency and completeness. This produced a list of interventions that can provide creation of value and a healthy and popular district Bospolder Tus-sendijken. Figure 4 shows these interventions. It can be seen that from the cause (to improve the qualitative residential demand and quality of life) the interventions were deter-mined that can realise the goal (of creating value by creating a healthy and popu-lar district) achieve. In Bospolder Tussendijken, Achmea is the market leader in the field of health care insurers and Eneco in the field of energy suppliers. Both parties cannot implement all interventions to get the district healthy and popular again but they can invest in a number of interventions from Figure 4. Figure 4: Cause and interventions in the area development Bospolder Tussendijken Health care insurer Achmea could invest in the intervention of health care services and social participation. They can financially support the care providers in the dis-trict if they are going to migrate to provide comprehensive care or they can insti-gate (health care) programs in the district that improves the participation of resi-dents in the district and make the residents healthier. These investments can be linked to current earning models of Achmea. This can produce objective and subjective value for Achmea. The economic value of inter-ventions is not very high. There are a number of risks and potential returns will show only after a few years. Partly because Achmea thinks that the duty regarding wel-fare is more the task of the municipality, the chance that Achmea will invest in the district Bospolder Tussendijken is not very large. Eneco could invest in the existing housing or in the renovation of rental properties. In cooperation with the housing corporation Eneco could invest in sustainable systems for the housing such as an HR++ boiler or solar panels. This would produce objective and subjective value to Eneco. The risks are not as high in the installation of sustainable equipment. But whether the exploitation is feasible in the district Bospolder Tussendijken is questionable. The houses are losing a lot of energy by the poor quality and facilities by which almost certainly a profit can be achieved. But despite that residents eventually will profit, it is not certain whether all residents are willing to pay Eneco for a sustainable system. Conclusion Bospolder Tussendijken As previously mentioned, the new parties can not improve the area development in such a way that the goal of a healthy and popular district is achieved. They can make a contribution. Both the health care insurer Achmea and the energy supplier Eneco can help to execute the interventions in Figure 4. Both parties are parties that can make small steps in the area. The parties can focus on one or more interventions. To remedy the current (investment) problems of Bospolder Tussendijken, one can look at a step by step development. As was the outcome of the core team Bospolder Tussendijken it is not the time for big (pre-) investments by one party. The core team is aiming to work at one devel-opment at a time, for example, only first the Visserijplein. When this is completed there may be looked at the following development, such as for example the shop-ping area Schiedamseweg. But during these minor developments one have to look at the bigger picture. Does it also fit into the district if only this development is exe-cuted and does if fit in the district as we carry out multiple interventions in the fu-ture?","Crisis; inner city area development; value creation; objective values; subjective values; interventions; benefiter; new parties; health insurance company and energy company","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-03","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","CREM","",""

Woningdifferentiatie draagt positief bij aan het realiseren van een bevolkings-samenstelling, die zich laat identificeren met de specifi eke kwaliteiten en het karakter (identiteit) van Oud-Charlois. Onderzoeksvraag. Welke vormen van woningtransformatie van de bestaande voorraad in Oud-Charlois, kunnen in samenhang met nieuwbouw en stedenbouwkundige ingrepen worden ingezet, met als doel het bewerkstelligen van een grotere woningdifferentiatie? Relevante criteria op basis waarvan deze interventies gemaakt worden, zijn kwaliteit, identiteit, exploitatie en locatie. De gerealiseerde woningdifferentiatie zou het proces van selectieve migratie binnen een wijk als Oud-Charlois kunnen beperken, zonder dat daarbij de huidige bewoners worden verdrongen. Conclusie. Wanneer in Oud-Charlois gedeeltelijke herstructurering en grootschalige renovatie plaats vindt dan is het uitgangspunt om d.m.v. het toevoegen van nieuwe woningtypologieën woningdifferentiatie te bewerkstelligen. Hiermee kan de kracht van het sociale en economische kapitaal worden versterkt binnen de wijk. De ontbrekende schakel qua woonruimte, is de woning met een grootte van 110m2. Deze woning (en de volgende schakel) zou kunnen voldoen aan de groep van gezinnen met kinderen. Deze doelgroep val in de typering van rustig stedelijk wonen. Wat betreft de locatie komt dan duidelijk het huidige terrein van de Voornse Vliet in aanmerking. Tevens biedt dit plangebied in combinatie met de woonfunctie, de ruimtelijke mogelijkheden om functies te realiseren die dicht tegen de wensen van deze doelgroep aanliggen en waarvan verwacht kan worden, dat die hier ook vanuit sociaal en economisch perspectief realiseerbaar en succesvol zijn. Omdat iedere vorm van herstructurering en grootschalige renovatie een ingrijpend proces betekent dat van grote invloed kan zijn op de sociale, maar vooral fysieke binding van de huidige worden gegeven aan dit proces. Dit betekent dat participatie van bewoners gewenst is, maar dat ook de periode waarin de wijk getransformeerd wordt naar een nieuw (uiteindelijk ook weer tijdelijk) doel, juist aangegrepen wordt om deze binding met de wijk te versterken door het initiëren van tijdelijke projecten. Hierbij kan worden ingesprongen op het specifieke karakter van de wijk en haar bewoners; een identiteit die juist sterk aan verandering onderhevig is. De locatiekeuze, is deze gekozen om het rustige stedelijk leefmilieu (grote woontest 2008) dat hier al aanwezig was, te continueren. Hierbij wordt ingespeeld op functies, die dit leefmilieu ondersteunen en in de wijk al aanwezig zijn en kunnen worden versterkt. Hierbij speelt de wederkerigheid van diensten een belangrijke rol. Met name die groepen die hun wooncarrière uiteindelijk willen voortzetten in Oud-Charlois zullen d.m.v. het verlenen van kortingen (woonlasten) gevraagd worden om als tegenprestatie bepaalde diensten te verlenen aan de buurt. Het ruimtelijke model dat hiervoor ontwikkeld wordt, speelt hier op in door het creëren van een schakel tussen de buurt en de woning; het woonerf of buurtschap. Zowel in bestaande buurten kan dit relatief gemakkelijk worden gerealiseerd (ook daar waar vrij veel particulier bezit aanwezig is), terwijl in de nieuwbouw deze tussenvorm als basis kan dienen voor de realisatie van de buurt.","woningbouw; selectieve migratie; woningfdifferentiatie; Rotterdam-Zuid; Charlois; tuin; transformatie; identiteit; allochtonen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-31","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore-lab, Veldacademie","",""

To provide for a permanent erosion mitigation measure and to create residential and commercial area for circa 400,000 people, the Eko Atlantic City project has been initiated in 2008. In front of the eroded coast, approximately 9 km² of land will be reclaimed and protected by a revetment. In this study the long-term and large-scale morphological behaviour of the Lagos coast is investigated and subsequently the long-term morphological impact of the Eko Atlantic City project is assessed. First, a conceptual model is created, in which the historical development of the coast is discussed. The long-term morphological behaviour of the coast downstream of the inlet is determined by two main factors: sediment accumulation at the West Mole and sediment import into the tidal inlet and the lagoon, induced by disturbance of the morphological equilibrium by sea level rise and dredging activities. Using the numerical simulation model Unibest, the long-term impact of Eko Atlantic City is assessed. It is concluded that the construction of Eko Atlantic City will not change the total erosion volumes occurring downstream of the inlet. However, as the revetment of the project retains the coast, the erosion will be shifted towards downstream. Downdrift of the project, the erosion rates are locally relatively high. The shape of the sea defence has been designed to minimize the local erosion effect. A monitoring and mitigation strategy has been recommended to monitor this effect and to instruct coastal protection management actions to be implemented if required.","tidal inlet; coastal morphology; sediment transport; Lagos; Eko Atlantic City; Unibest","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

Reasons for this are for example de size of the project, the amount of involved parties, the interest (financially) and the opportunities. To keep the process going a couple of tools can be used. An important tool is meeting and negotiating. Just putting conflicting parties’ together en trying to find a solution based on arguments. An important aspect of this technique is that the stakeholders know what they are talking about and what the consequences of their words are. This process can be speeded up by giving the community an (equal) say. The inhabitants of a city or neighbourhood can give their opinions and explain what is the current status is and what the needs are. A third solution is by looking less at the end result but more to the process. The final design is not the most import perspective in this point of view, but the road towards the goal. A final tool is making use of and developing instruments that can be used to speed up the process. This could be negotiating techniques but more specifically mathematical models. The advantages of these models are that they are problem oriented, have an interdisciplinary approach, the requirement of giving concrete data, the ability to calculate variants and pointing out conflicts of interest. To make the research reliable it is done based on a current case. This is the urban area development by the city of Katwijk on the formal navy airport Valkenburg in the province of Zuid?Holland. Plan economic advisory bureau Planmaat has given this opportunity and information to use this case. The studied problem is the slow and difficult process of Project Location Valkenburg. The objective here is to develop an instrument (model) that makes it possible for parties to create their own variants to be prepared and concrete in the negotiations. Question that comes with this tool is if it is possible for stakeholders involved in the project to use these kinds of models without having any experience with it. The hypothesis coming from this question is: It is possible for stakeholder to use an urban area instrument without having any experience with them.","Gebiedsontwikkeling; Valkenburg; LP; model","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-03","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","REM, UAD","",""

They offer functionality to compare products and the prices for which these products are offered at different online stores. However, these websites are not without their problems. Based on the analysis of academic literature, current solutions and user opinions, the following issues have been determined. The product comparison websites currently focus on comparing and listing as much as possible products and their specifications. The result of this is that the user is presented too much choice, creating an information and choice overload for the user. This complicates the decision making process for the user and can result in a low decision certainty and decision satisfaction. Furthermore, the current solutions are not based on supporting the user in his or her decision making process. Also, the current solutions do not offer personal product recommendations. Based on this analysis, a focus for a new design has been created. The key point of this focus is that the new design should be much more user-focused compared to current solutions. The most important goals within this focus are to support the user in his decision making process and to reduce information and choice overload. Also, the design needs to use personal input from the user, and react on it. Based on this focus, several ideas have been generated. These ideas have been made to multiple prototypes and have been evaluated by users. Based on this evaluation, one idea was found to match the focus the best. This idea has been further developed into a detailed concept. This concept uses the principal of multi-dimensional similarity scaling, a proven statistical method, to determine the amount of similarity between different products. This similarity between products is used in the design to recommend products to the user. The design asks users to choose one out of three products, which have significant differences between them. This is a relatively simple choice. Based on the user’s choice, the design suggests two new products, which are more similar to the previously chosen product. Then again, the user can make a choice between three products. With every choice, the products that are recommended become more similar and their specifications become more detailed. In the process, the design determines the preferences of the user, based on his product choices. This process of making a choice between three options is repeated until the user has made a final product decision. This concept has been made to a fully interactive prototype and has been evaluated by users. User could compare and choose between a range of coffee machines. From these qualitative tests, positive results have been found. Users could make a product choice with high decision certainty, without experiencing much information or choice overload. Their decision satisfaction was also high. Compared to the current solutions, the users stated that the concept has both a higher usability and that it is more useful to compare products and make a final decision. The most positive points that the users named were the good overview that the concept provided and the simplicity in which they could compare products with it. Finally an analysis has been done to find the most suitable product categories to implement be compared with the new system. These were found to be household appliances (e.g. coffee machines, washing machines), consumer electronics (TV’s, mobile phones, music players) and computer hardware (laptops, tablets, computer parts). These categories combined created an online revenue of around 2.2 billion in 2010 in the Netherlands and are promising categories for market implementation. Based on the positive evaluation of the concept by both users and commercial parties, the graduating student has chosen to continue with the implementation of the design. He is currently involved with a group of people to create a new company and to start a new, user-focused, product comparison website. On this website, the goal is to implement much of the design presented here. He is looking very much forward to do so.","product comparison websites; choice overload; decision making process; interface design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-01-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

However, since the bombardment during WWII, the city became the experiment of doctrine of functionism. Big roads for traffic which disconnect the urban public spaces; tall buildings, on one hand, give a capacity of large amount of people, on the other hand, give the cold feeling to the locals. In order to bring more lively sceneries in the city center, we were more concerned about density in the Lijnbaan area through time in the beginning. By studying density through time, we understood there are two major groups of people using the area: one is who comes here with strong purpose, such as shopping purpose, which we define it as “Heteropic group”; the other is who comes here with his/her daily routine, such as treats the benches in Lijnbaan street as part of his/ her daily life, which we define it as “Isotopic group”. The two major groups create two different conditions: Heterotopia and Isotopia. The two kinds of conditions are influenced by not only people themselves, but also the physical setting of the environment, such as building typology, functions, high, accessibility, and street furniture.By knowing how to create or control the two conditions, we can bring back the density even in the evening in our site, which is currently dead at night. Moreover, by investigating the site mechanism, we know which groups to target in order to facilitate the Lijnbaan area, and what kind of programs could be inserted in our design. In short, through physical settings of street furniture, building typology, functionetc, we will be able to create two different conditions, and allow the two conditions emerge at the same time which is the show time of public realm.","Public realm; Heterotopia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-11","Architecture","Architecture","","Public Realm","",""

(mentor)","2012","This research wants to show how by the historical overlapping of two thoroughly planned paradigms – ‘city’ and ‘highway’ – an unplanned mismatch could come into existence at the intersection of ring roads and city streets. Through a physical analysis of this mismatch and the planned and unplanned reactions in the cases of Amsterdam A10 West and São Paulo Southeast this study discusses possible lessons that can be learned for improving the future interweaving of urban tissue and large scale infrastructure. In a broader sense the research aims to reflect on the interaction between ‘planned’ and ‘unplanned’ and by doing so on how our everyday environment is a continuous – and sometimes very successful – mismatch between past plans and future projections. Triggered by the historical overlapping of prewar plans and postwar visions this study uses Amsterdam and São Paulo to illustrate how the autonomous planning of city and infrastructure - and the conflict that this resulted in - still causes problems today. By using the method of ‘mirror cities’ Amsterdam and São Paulo are used to distill on the one hand general problems that arose from a clash of paradigms and on the other hand to research specific alternative solutions for new design initiatives. Working on three scale levels it first points out how – on the scale of the city – the highway plays different roles depending on its planning history: the highway as border, as center, as buffer zone or as entity squeezed into the city tissue. The knowledge of these atmospheres might proof useful in the re-designing of the old ring and in the future planning of new ‘super rings’ such as the Rodoanel. Secondly, by zooming in on the ‘informal’ parts of the ring and looking at the long lines of the city streets crossing it, this study examines how – and if - the ring functions as a border. This is done by using ‘streetview elevations’ that show how the urban profile changes from inside to outside the ring road. Here the type of intersections proofed crucial. Categorizing these types of intersections at Amsterdam A10 West and São Paulo Southeast and looking at the different ways they combined the city- and infrastructure paradigm show us the different effects of planning decisions. Some types work on the scale of highway and city but have a negative impact on the surrounding neighborhood, others manage to combine the city and highway paradigm in a way that both profit. Here, for example, the São Paulo-case produced an interesting solution with its ‘multiple connected’-type (an informal combination of elevated crossings and a direct highway access of secondary roads) that could be very fruitful in Amsterdam. The findings of the research and in particular the analysis of the junctions between ring road and city streets should be further explored in the architectural design of a museum at one particular intersection in Amsterdam Bos en Lommer.","Amsterdam; A10; São Paulo; infrastructure; ring road; Bos en Lommer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-03","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore Lab / Design as Politics","",""

These increased demands do not pass the roll shops in the steel industry. In the roll shop periodically the rolls from the rolling mill are checked for imperfections. The imperfections are detected by special inspection systems. Improving the inspection systems can speed up the overall process significantly in the roll shop. The request for an improved inspection system results in a new generation inspection system. This inspection system should measure more signals at the same time and process the signals faster. To achieve this result the measurements are digitalized and processed in parallel on a FPGA. Speed and quality demands are also asked from the engineers by designing and maintanance of the inspection system. In this thesis a High-Level Synthesis tool is selected to implement the mathematical model of the inspection system. The tool selection is done based on a comparison between three HLS tools, namely: CatapultC, ROCCC and Compaan. For this implementation Compaan is the most promising one. Compaan is able to split the data streams processing in concurrent systems with distributed memories. With Compaan as development tool the main part of the mathematical model is implemented in four months. This is four times faster than the preceding implementation.","steel roll; FPGA; real-time; inspection system; imperfections; Compaan; CatapultC; ROCCC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","","",""

On an urban scale the UN-plot is an exception to the typical urban structure of New York. It takes six blocks to complete the United Nations footprint. The Northside of the plot consists of a green structure, which has the opportunity to be an asset to the city in terms of development of public spaces. Besides Central Park and some small public parks inside the city, there are not many opportunities to create a new park in this concrete jungle. Through analysis, which lead to our urban masterplan, we wanted to improve the connection between the city and the waterfront along the East River. Improvements like rerouting the FDR underground and bringing the security level down of the plot were important criteria. In this way we could achieve the idea of making the UN-plot a part of a public structure. Instead of a high level secured terrain. Challenging the UN urban island effect, as I would like to call it. The UNEC building design should be a great value in order to achieve this public connection between the city and the riverside. The visual and physical connection between these two worlds runs by the east 47th Street. This street is directly across the UN green structure and defines itself by its profile, which is broader than other streets, and it consists a clear tree structure. Placing the footprint of the building design alongside this ‘green axe’ makes it a contribution in terms of visual guidelines. Next to that it respects the existing green structure. The concepts of connection and interaction were a great inspiration for the UNEC building design. The program consisted of mixtures between private and public functions. The scheme of the design was basically dividing the program into three boxes, private functions, public functions and joint functions. throughout the design process this resulted into three buildings, separated but also connected by an interspace. This interspace also created a visual connection to four viewpoints in its urban surroundings. A view on the United Nations plot, a view towards the city, a view alongside the East River and a view across the East River towards the borough of Brooklyn. The development on how to define the three different elements in terms of structure, connection and composition was an important part of the design process. Decisions made had an influence on different layers like the impact of the composition on an urban scale, but also on the spacial qualities inside the building and thirth, the materialisation of the three elements inside this composition. The structure, dimensions and facade typologies were a direct result of the systematic settlement of the program. Concepts like flexible workspaces, visual and physical connections between functions, and spacial qualities were a great asset in designing a new headquarters for the United Nations Environmental Council.","sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-28","Architecture","Architecture","","Materialisation","",""

Therefore, the goal of this study is to design an underactuated gripper mechanism that is able to establish a final and stable grasp without moving the object. The objects are laying on a flat surface and should be grasped from above without damaging the object. By examining the grasping process, we determine the elements needed to create the new gripper mechanism. A mathematical model and simulation tool are developed to study the grasp performance of the gripper. The gripper performance is measured as the feasible grasp range with respect to the complete grasp range. The complete grasp range is determined by an object size range and a horizontal displacement of the object. We optimise the design parameters of the gripper for maximum gripper performance whilst a minimum coefficient of friction is present. With this gripper mechanism, we created a gripper that can cope with large variance in object size and that outperforms a pinch gripper when low contact friction force is required.","pick and place industry; grasping; underactuation; force equilibrium; friction forces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Minalu already did research to torsion in bridge decks with different types of finite element models. The question when torsion cracks will really occur is still unanswered. This question is the main subject of this research. The focus of the research is on a skew bridge with a skew angle of 45 degrees. In that bridge the largest torsional moments will occur. Beside that also a straight bridge is analysed, the torsional moments in a straight bridge are always lower than in a skew one under the same loading. The loads of Eurocode 1991-2 are used. Two important load configurations governing for torsional moments and shear force are used: a configuration which is used in daily practice at Spanbeton and a configuration developed by Minalu. An attempt is made to model the whole bridge including physically non-linear behaviour with the program ATENA 3D to analyse the torsion effects. With the current state-of-the-art modelling technology that appeared to be impossible. For that reason a simplified model is developed to simulate the stress state and cracking in one ZIP girder. It was concluded that it is important to use more quadratic elements over the thickness of the web to obtain correct torsion shear stresses. From the simplified model it is concluded that, despite some shortcomings, clearly a substantial length at the ends of the girder is uncracked. To be sure that the computer model is correct a calculation of the principal stresses is carried out at the ultimate limit state. The stresses due to prestressing, own weight and the weight of the fresh poured concrete can be calculated by hand. The calculation of the force distribution of the loads on the deck can be carried out using finite element methods. Scia Engineer (orthotropic plate model) and ATENA 3D (volume elements) are used for this calculation. Especially the determination of the torsional moments from ATENA by using an analysis of the rotations is interesting. This calculation results in the torsional moments, bending moments en shear forces acting on the ends of the girder. The main conclusion of this research is that in ultimate limit state no cracking will occur in the end of the considered girder in the skew bridge. This means that only the minimal shear reinforcement must be applied and the full torsional stiffness can be used in finite element calculations. A practical method to check this for other bridges using ZIP-girders is proposed.","Torsion; ZIP; Bridge; Spanbeton; Concrete; Cracking; Principal stresses; Inverted T beams","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

An important part of this study is the methodology used to measure these indicators. To prove that these indicators contribute to the user’s preference, a revealed preference approach is used in which 64 buildings are analysed over the last 5 years. The outcome of this study indicates that there is a statistical significant relation between structural vacancy and the level of flexibility of a standard office floor. The thesis emphasises the importance of factoring in adaptability indicators during the decision-making process of the acquisition of (new) office buildings.

(mentor)","2012","Space debris is becoming an increasing problem requiring a low cost propulsion system capable of disposing non operable satellites and spent rocket stages. To this end electrodynamic tethers have been proposed as a viable alternative to conventional propulsion. Aside from a de-orbit system electrodynamic tethers have a wide range of applications as a power generator or propulsion system being ideally suited to orbital environments having strong magnetic fields for example Jovian orbits. Previous experiments performed in the development of electrodynamic tethers used insulated wire tethers and separate current collection devices, either large passive spheres or active plasma contactors. The subject of this thesis is to design and size an electrodynamic tether experiment for use onboard the Delfi-1 University satellite. The main objectives of the experiment are to provide a proof of concept of bare electrodynamic tether propulsion and deploy and operate a tape tether. A tape tether design has been selected having a favourable geometry for current collection and survivability in the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environment in comparison with ‘traditional’ wire tethers. The tape tether also has favourable drag properties allowing for a rapid deorbit when cut from the main satellite decreasing the risk of collision with operational satellites. A secondary objective for the experiment is to determine if the release of a neutral gas can enhance the current of the tether and the deorbit performance. This experiment is fundamental in the development of a fully passive deboost capability for tether equipped systems. The limited amount of storage and mass, power and data rate available when using a micro-satellite platform for the experiment combined with low complexity and cost requirements inherent to the Delfi-1 project drives the design to a bare minimum required for performing the primary scientific objectives. The baseline design for the experiment is characterised by a passive bare floating electrodynamic tether deployed in nadir direction using a passive deployment mechanism.","electrodynamic; tether; propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-08","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Systems Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","A global and industry wide dataset was data mined for determinants of recovery efficiency. Understanding of the factors that are driving variance in reservoir performance is essential for benchmarking current performance and for the screening of new opportunities. The following insights in the origin of variance in reservoir performance could be extracted from this analysis. Global trends for recovery factor with drive mechanism, reservoir type, geological age, lithology and depositional environment were extracted through subgroup analysis. Other property trends, such as porosity with depth and geological age, were found to be basin specific. The internal structure of the database and correlations was revealed through principal component analysis. Relative importance of the predictor variables was determined using automatic multivariate linear regression. It was found that the predominant variables include: API gravity, permeability and reservoir temperature. Additional data was identified through combination of literature review, dimensional- and statistical analysis. The following variables are suggested: dip angle, flow rate, fractional water cut, and pressure drop. Furthermore continuous scales for heterogeneity and fracture intensity, especially for carbonate reservoirs are suggested. To express the confidence level for each reservoir in the database, categorical variables for maturity and data quality are proposed. This research forms the basis for future data mining of the dataset and further improvement of the TQ EUR TOOL in which the data is stored. In a wider context this report presents a high level overview of observations on reservoir performance based on actual reservoirs worldwide rather than laboratory data or theory.","statistical analysis; reservoir engineering database; recovery efficiency; datamining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor); Van Beek, Y.M. (mentor)","2012","Graduation project for the Dutch company PostNL. Many people are interested in their part-time job of mail deliverer but resign within the first month of employment. PostNL aims for people to work as mail deliverer that have a flexible planning and can make the job a part of their life. One large target group is: housewives. These women do not want a full-time job because they have to take care of the household and the children for the main part of the day. PostNL would like to see that fewer housewives resign from the job as mail deliverer, because these women are able to work hard, like to work outside and are responsible and very loyal as well. This problem forms the objective for this graduation research: Design a nationwide implementable tool for the department of recruitment of PostNL in order to reduce turnover by improving the experience of mail deliverers in the target group of housewives by which they do not resign within the first month. Using literature and interviews research has been done on the motivation of housewives when applying for the job of mail deliverer. Found was that they are looking for a job during the school hours of the children. They do not directly work to earn money, but this is a nice extra benefit to the job. They receive all their personal excitement out of the job when they can perform it as they want to. Their main focus in life is on the children. The mail deliverer is mother in the first place and she will resign when her job interferes with that part of her life. This is especially important for mothers with children in elementary school, in the age that they can not walk home alone. If PostNL wants to keep the mothers from resigning they have to take care that the job fits perfectly in the time that the mom has available to work, the time where she does not have to take care of her children because they are on school or busy with other activities. The new campaign to attract new mail deliverers claims that the delivery of mail can become a part of your life. The next step following to the campaign is to make the job really a part of someone’s life. This can be done by helping the mothers to make the combination of the job and taking care of her family and household. Important to take into account is that the job is harder to perform within the first month. The delivery of mail takes longer than expected because the new mail deliverer needs to get experience with the job and the neighbourhood to get more efficient and faster with the job. When a mother can not make the combination within the first month, they will see the job only as an extra thing to plan into their busy life and experience more negative aspects than positive aspects. The choice is made to focus on the next step after the campaign. In the first place mothers need to be interested with the right expectations. The new campaign states that mail delivery can be a part of your life. Two different products to match the new job into a mother’s life are advised to add to the selection procedure of PostNL for new mail deliverers. Those products are specially designed for mother s with young children who want to work in the time that their children are on school to match the job to her private life. To make the perfect match between the planning of the mother and the hours available to deliver the mail input of the mother and PostNL is needed. The mother needs to get insight in her weekly schedule and has to make an estimation of her hours available to work as mail deliverer. PostNL should give clear information about the hours in which mail can be delivered (between 11 AM and 5 PM) and the length of delivery shifts per day. When a mother understands the boundaries in time set by PostNL and she is familiar with her own boundaries, partly set by appointments of the children, she will be stimulated to move appointments to other moments to make more time available to work as mail deliverer. An Online Check is developed to inform mothers that are interested for the job of mail deliverer. The campaign directs those women to the recruitment website of PostNL. By the Online Check the interested mothers can answer the question: Can the job of mail delivery be a part of my life? The mother is supported by this tool to make an overview of her time available per day of the week to deliver mail. By the Online Check she can choose if she has enough time to deliver the mail and apply for a vacancy that matches the preferred amount of hours. Later on, in the job interview will be discussed how many hours PostNL can match to her preferences. A product in this early stage, before application, makes sure that only the mothers that can match the job to their life apply for a vacancy of mail deliverer. The second advised product is the /Matchmaker. This toolkit will be send to the home address of the mothers who are in the selection procedure indicated as applicants that can need help in finding time to deliver the mail. At home the mother will keep record of all her activities for two days and tries to move appointments to fit time to deliver mail in her day. She will take the /Matchmaker to the job interview. Here a recruiter will try, together with the applying mother and the product, to make the match of her preferred hours and the delivery shifts available in her neighbourhood. When PostNL creates the perfect match of the job and the private life of the mother they will gain happy and loyal mailmom’s as employees.","mail; planning; mother; selection procedure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The main purpose of this thesis is to find a future direction for the engine project for the FWM of the Atalanta project. Based on previous work done by Arjan Meskers [60], it was indicated that hydrogen peroxide is a good candidate as energy source for small scale engines because of its ease of implementation and relatively high energy content. Using hydrogen peroxide as a starting point, further research has to be done to explore different possibilities for the FWM engine. The first step is done in Chapter 1: an exploration of other projects on a similar scale. By learning from these projects that are described in literature, it is observed that certain directions are certainly not suitable for the FWM engine. For example, the bladed turbine has not the potential to become the FWM engine since the performance is too low and the requirements to make the system work are too substantial. Also, there is a clear indication that engines with a traditional cylinder piston assembly are dominated by leakage effects and therefore are also not successful on small scale. With this information a subset of the possibilities for the FWM engine is assembled in the form of concepts. These concepts are selected on their potential on small scale, their potential to be realized in a relatively short time span and their diversity. A candidate that does have potential is the small scale heat engine, represented by Concept 3. The performance is too low of similar projects found in literature, but they are not optimized for the FWM situation. Also, an indication in literature is found that the power density of these types of engines has good scaling behavior. Another potential candidate for the FWM is formed by applying a solution for the leakage problems of the small scale piston cylinder assembly. In Concept 1 flexible material is used between a piston and cylinder such that no fluid can leak through the gap. The blade-less turbine, also called a Tesla turbine, is used in Concept 2. It is described in literature to have a good theoretical potential on small scale, although not much experimental projects are found. The next step is to indicate what determines the performance characteristics for these small scale engines and how it relates to the requirements for the FWM engine. This is done in Chapter 2. The very basics for the thermodynamic cycle theory is the Carnot cycle, which closely resembles the operation principle of Concept 3. This is used as a starting point for approximating the performance of the concepts. The extension of the Carnot cycle is the Curzon Ahlborn model, which shows that the performance is completely determined by a certain potential and the utilization of that potential. The potential determines the magnitude of the incoming energy flow. The utilization determines how much of that incoming energy is converted into useful mechanical work. The nondimensionalization of the Curzon Ahlborn model shows that the utilization of the engine does not depend on any absolute scale, but merely on the ratio’s between certain engine parameters. These findings are tested on a more complicated model of the same system. By introducing the energy balance of the working fluid into the model, a time response of its temperature is obtained. This model shows that similar characteristics can be expected regarding the potential and utilization. This information is used to formulate a search method for finding the optimal configuration of the engine model to ensure maximum utilization for a given potential. By making an estimate of the engine potential based on measurements found in literature, this search method is used to give an indication of the performance characteristics as function of the scale of the engine. The study of Curzon Ahlborn type models is mainly focused on engines that have a compression and expansion step in the cycle and engines that use heat conduction as main energy transfer mode. Also all the models in the beginning of Chapter 2 are based on the assumption that work is extracted by a pressure force. Concept 2, the Tesla turbine, uses a different method of work extraction and has no compression step. Therefore, a separate model is presented at the end of Chapter 2 to characterize this concept. It is observed how the power output can be improved and how the efficiency is influenced accordantly. Measurements are found in literature from Tesla turbines at the exact scale that is opted for the FWM engine. These measurements are done with very small pressure differences, because the tests are done with a different application in mind. By combining the measurement results and the information from the simple model it is concluded that Concept 2 has no potential as FWM engine. One of the selection criteria for the engine concepts was that they all have different operating principles. Consequently, they all have different types of energy inflows. The energy flows of the remaining two concepts are explored more thoroughly in Chapter 3. Heat flow is studied first, since it is indicated by literature as the most significant loss mechanism for small scale engines. The characteristics of the complex real life situation are modeled in a multi physics simulation and linearized around the scale of interest for the FWM. The catalytic reaction is the primary energy inflow for all concepts, but based on measurements done by A.J.H. Meskers [60] it was observed that for Concept 1 the catalytic reaction characteristics might be critical. This is because the reaction time of small drops was found to be in the same order as the opted cycle time for the FWM in its current size. To study the characteristics of the catalytic reaction in more detail, a model is constructed based on the energy balance and fitted to the experimental data. The last energy flow identified is the exhaust fluid flow in concept 1. Due to time restrictions a full detailed analysis of this subject needs to be done in future work, but a basic analysis using the theory of gas dynamics is given. By approximating the shape of the exhaust as a round nozzle and assuming that friction has not much influence, the mass flow is given as function of a pressure difference. The findings of Chapter 3 are used in Chapter 4 to construct two models for the two remaining concepts. A numerical method for finding the steady state of these models is discussed and tested by comparison with analytical results. The performance of the models is obtained using these steady states. For Concept 3 it is observed that the performance is too low for the FWM in its current size, but has potential if the geometric scale of the system is reduced. This is due to favorable power density scaling of Concept 3. Of course this is only true if the operation principle of the real engine closely resembles the model. In the model a fixed temperature difference between the two heat sinks is assumed. This might be problematic in a real situation because it will be more difficult to accomplish a temperature difference when the geometric scale is reduced. For Concept 1, the engine model is a combination of the energy balance of the species inside the cylinder and the exhaust flow model described in Chapter 3. To reduce the sensitivity of the conclusions to the uncertainties of these models, two sets of parameters are used. One is considered optimistic and the other pessimistic. It was found that the performance for both sets is in the right region for the FWM engine requirements. This suggests that among the considered concepts, Concept 1 is the best way forward for the engine project of the FWM.","micro","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

This is resulting in the problem of reservoir capacity reduction. With water still coming from different rivers, the future will be inundation. In this matter the recommendation for this problem is check dam(s) and changing land use, stated by the local government, Perum Jasa Terta II (PJT II). These solutions can both reduce sediment transport in the river by respectively decreasing flow velocities and reduction in erodibility. The Cilalawi River and reservoir Waduk Jatiluhur are located in the province of Purwakarta, West Java, Indonesia. Cultivation, forest and buildings surround this river. Residents in this area are using the river for waste disposal, private fishing, washing and recreation, while chemicals and excreta heavily pollute it. What is more, the PJT II manages the policy for rivers in West Java region. On the contrary, there is currently no policy concerning the Cilalawi River, although, recommendation has been written for the described problem. Therefore, the goal is to use the design of a functional check dam to estimate the impact of the civil structure on erosion and sedimentation in the watershed. Land use changing is no option, because of the large surface area to treat, the additional high expenses and the essential sawah existence with high erodibility. The research questions to the theme and to achieve the goal are: 1. Which characteristics of the Cilalawi River and watershed are responsible for the sedimentation and erosion? 2. What would be the design of the functional check dam for the Cilalawi River? a) What are the requirements for the new check dam? b) What will be the time horizon of the check dam till its expiration? c) What does the designed check dam look like in the phase of preliminary design?","Cilalawi River; Indonesia; Citarum; check dam; erosion; sedimentation; modelling","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Janssen, M. (mentor); Barjis, J. (mentor)","2012","Software as a Service (SaaS) has been utilized as a means to deliver an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system since the last decade. This software delivery model enables Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) to outsource the system from vendors based on pay-per-use or pay-per-period without having to do prior investments. Yet, SaaS model is still immature in concept and the unforeseeable uncertainty is relatively high because of different application specificity and behavioral acceptance for adopting a SaaS-based application. In the field of ERP and SaaS, there is no literature, which discussed about what benefits can be achieved from adopting a SaaS ERP system. Moreover, differences in opinion about SaaS benefits have emerged from the perspectives of critical actors, e.g. an agreement toward cost-savings and time-savings among vendors and adopters. This research explores the benefits of delivering SaaS ERP system within SMEs by considering three perspectives, which are the perspective of vendors as SaaS providers, the perspective of SMEs as SaaS adopters, and the perspective of lifecycle process of SaaS. In order to accommodate differences which might arise when conceptualizing these perspectives, each perspective is directed to a set of common goals and benefits, namely the benefits of Service Oriented Computing (SOC). For this reason, we developed a methodology for assessing benefits of SaaS that consists of three main steps, which are understanding, conceptualizing, and estimating the benefits of SaaS. Research data was collected from interviews and questionnaires to appreciate benefits from the three perspectives. Following this, the structures of SaaS benefits were conceptualized for each perspective. Then, we estimated the benefits of SaaS qualitatively by indicating such benefits whitin a case study, and quantitatively by applying Partial Least Squares (PLS) Path modeling method within which the structures of SaaS benefits were developed through SmartPLS software. Our findings show that the proposed methodology can be used to realize the benefits of SaaS in more structured way through the models of SaaS benefits that accommodate the three perspectives. Although the models are weakly validated due to limited research data, rich descriptions of SaaS benefits pertaining to the delivery of SaaS ERP system within SMEs can be gained from the structures of SaaS benefits. Furthermore, a sound understanding to overcome differences in opinion about SaaS benefits can be expected through this comprehensive methodology since each perspective in realizing the benefits is directed to the achievement of the benefits of SOC. Yet, we suggest further research for the task of validating the models with more reliable research data. The comprehensive methodology can be improved by enhancing variables and factors that define the benefits and can be used as a best practice to improve readiness of adopting a SaaS-based application in general, and a SaaS ERP system in particular.","Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Software as a Service (SaaS); Service Oriented Architecture (SOA); Benefits of Service Oriented Computing (SOC); Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Reflection","","ICT","",""

(mentor); van der Zaag, E.J. (mentor)","2012","Research conducted by our group, within the At Home in the City graduation studio, started with a notion of changes brought in by increasing presence of digital technologies in everyday life. Mobility of electronic devices has lead to a new way users approach spaces. Tasks and activities that were previously bound to specific places or environments can nowadays be performed in a more flexible manner. Private life is blending in with the public realm and these programmatic changes are dynamically allocated, depending on a current need, mood, weather conditions etc. From a point of view of an architect it is the most interesting to see why users tend to choose some spaces over another. Why is it so that people prefer to work in a public or collective place rather than in a specifically designed for this task office. All the above led to our main research questions which focused on investigating spatial qualities of spaces preferred by the users and determining if it is possible to adapt some of these characteristics in mostly residential projects to allow them hosting dynamic programmes. A total of six case studies, mostly co-working spaces, was analysed. In order to investigate rather subjective notion of spatial conditions and qualities a methodology based on phenomenological approach was applied, with main fundaments found in works of Juhani Pallasmaa, Steven Holl, Peter Zumthor and Alberto Perez-Gomez. During the design process an individual part of the research has been carried out in order to further elaborate on spatial qualities that seemed to be preferred by dwellers and other users. An idea has been developed that also dwelling itself has to conform to the needs of certain dynamic programmes. Created rooms should allow inhabitants to easily change function when needed. Moreover, continuing the research thread on the everyday presence of technology, home has started to be seen as a necessary, physical counter-balance for the digital realm. Following words of Pallasmaa and Perez-Gomez, a statement was made that technological, and thus visual/intellectual, reality should not be a dominant part of private life. Bodily experience is as important as mental one. Therefore it is important for a dwelling to stimulate its through multiple senses. Designed housing units feature a number of elements that allow user to give them a function by position of the body and its dimensions. Same object can be used for relaxing, working, dining, storing, reading and many other activities. These living spaces are always integrated with kitchen, which is seen as a place at home where most of the 'real' human to human contacts occur, regardless if we think of a family dining together or a group of students partying. Kitchens also react with many of our senses like smell, taste or feeling of warmth. Material choices for the project also aim in providing engaging sensual experiences. Use of wood, brick or raw concrete gives the design a set of rich and not repeating textures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Dwelling","",""

(mentor); Person, F.E.O.K. (mentor)","2012","A strategy does not last forever. For companies it is recommended to analyze and renew their policy continuously. A company which is renewing its strategies and themselves is BR-ND. This company executes strategy transformations at an emotive (based on emotion) level. BR-ND has learned in their work that the support of the stakeholders of a defined strategy is not sufficient at the implementation. Involvement of these stakeholders in the strategy transformation will create support. This report is redesigning the service portfolio of BR-ND with the goal to involve all relevant stakeholders during the strategy transformation. The biggest gap is between the defined strategy (defined by a project team, including board members), and the workplace with the most important stakeholders of a strategy: the employees. Next to the lack of involvement of the stakeholders in the strategy transformation, the values and meanings of BR-ND towards branding are changed but these were not included in their service portfolio. BR-ND believes today in emotional based strategies, created with co-creation of the client and cool tools. Their meanings are changing towards an inside-out approach where the image and identity are close together. The brand or strategy is created from within the organization and occurs at an open and transparent manner. In this report an external and internal analysis is executed. The external analysis researches the competition and the society. The approach of people towards brands is changing, with help of social and technological trends. Consumers want to create by their own, they don’t accept coercion and they create their own environment/communities. The technological trends of internet and mobility support this. Competition of BR-ND is reaction on this with a simpler, enjoyable strategy transformation. The position of the strategist is changed to a facilitating role with an ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders. Due to the analysis some main focus points were revealed about the service portfolio of BR-ND. The most important is that there is no continuous communication to the stakeholders during the strategy transformation. During this process, the stakeholders should be involved; they should understand the fundamentals of the strategy. Next to this, the services portfolio with the supporting tools is not visible and there is no distinction between creation and documentation tools. During the next phase, the redesign phase, the new redesigned service portfolio is divided into three levels; the documentation, the tools and the communication to the stakeholders (platform). A characteristic of the strategy transformation is that it is intangible in the the creation. In this project this is resolved by a choice of attractive documentation methods and documentation methods of the ongoing process. Multi sensory (using multiple senses) plays a role in these documentation methods. The current tools are revised and additional tools are created. The continuous communication to the stakeholders is resolved in the concept ‘Brandroom’. This is a room within the office building of the client dedicated to the strategy. People bond, acquire and learn about the strategy in a transparent and accessible manner. The main upcoming trend where future is for strategy transformations is the need for strategy monitoring and refining. The world is changing fast, the strategy must follow closely. There is a need for sustaining the strategy after implementation. This will provide the fourth step; after analysis, strategy creation and design of manifestation, ‘living strategy’ will be a new service.","design; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Strategic product design","",""

(mentor); Lemstra, W. (mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor)","2012","The last 30 years saw an enormous increase in communication technologies and services. The world has become a smaller place due to Internet, computers and mobile phones, which enable people to communicate from anywhere quickly and effectively. Along with these changes a new industry, the Information and Communications Technology Industry (ICT), has grown as a result of the merging of Information Technology and Telecommunications industries. The ICT industry has a complex structure as it incorporates industries that produce very different products and services that must interact together to provide the end user with a complete, functioning product and/or service. Martin Fransman has mapped the ICT industry with a layer model with a vertical chain structure. In this model customers are located at the top with the industries providing products and services piled on top of each other as can be seen below. Layer Industry Example 6 Customers 5 Applications Amazon, eBay, Skype 4 Navigation & Middleware Google, Microsoft 3 Connectivity AOL, Tiscali, Alice 2 Network Vodafone, KPN, AT&T 1 Equipment & Software Nortel, Lucent, Nokia Table 1: The Infoc-ommunication Industry – A layer model (Fransman, 2001) Telecom Operators, who provide connectivity (e.g. Internet, Telephone, Mobile Phone etc.) to customers and industries, are located in the second and third layer of the Fransman Layer Model. Their services are vital for the entire ICT industry, yet despite their strategic position they currently face profit erosion. The diffusion of the Internet among customers allows industries in the upper layers (4-5) to provide services previously exclusive to Telecom Operators, for example Voice Over IP (e.g. Skype), in addition to new services such as video-on-demand. Customers demand increased bandwidth to use these services requiring infrastructure investments by Network Operators, who simultaneously face profit losses due to horizontal and vertical competition. This particular situation is the so-called Telecom Operators Dilemma: increased network traffic on one side and decreased in profits on the other. To make a comparison, it is similar to the relationship that exists between car manufacturers, road builders and petrol companies. Without roads cars would be useless, without fuel cars would not be able to function, and without cars there would be no need for roads. This results in a situation where these three industries are closely related and interdependent on each other. In the ICT industry, telecom operators function as both the road builders and petrol companies investing massively on building roads in order to make money off of fuel sales. The problem is that in the ICT industry car manufacturers are building faster, fuel efficient cars and the clients who buy these cars are demanding bigger and better roads. This results in road builders needing to provide better roads with less profit due to petrol market erosion. To fight this market erosion, Telecom Operators are attempting to integrate vertically into the value chain by merging with and acquiring stakes in different sectors of the ICT industry in order to become integrated ICT providers. Vodafone,a telecommunications company based in the UK, is active in more than 30 countries with 371 million customers. Similar to other telecom operators, Vodafone is looking to avoid becoming a so-called “dumb bit-pipe” and one of their strategies is to become a “Unified Communications” provider. Unified Communications (UC) is an industry term used to describe all sets of products and services aiming to break down the barriers preventing people from using different modes of communication, media, and devices enabling them to communicate to anyone, anywhere, at any time. This thesis will investigate the role Telecom Operators play in the deployment of Unified Communications. As part of this thesis a case study on Unified Communications has been performed with Vodafone Netherlands. The subject of this study was to determine the possibilities and potential solutions for implementing and integrating Microsoft OCS/Lync (a UC solution created by Microsoft) with Vodafone Office Voice, Vodafone’s fixed voice offer for enterprises. Given the problem description a main research question and three sub-questions have been formulated: MRQ: What role can telecom operators play in the deployment of Unified Communications? SRQ1: What role can Vodafone Netherlands play in the provisioning of Microsoft OCS/Lync? SRQ2: What are the key features of Unified Communications for telecom operators? SRQ3: How can telecom operators use their know-how to deliver Unified Communications? To answer these questions case study methodology has been used together with literature research. To structure the research the STOF Business Model framework has been chosen for its strong focus on service design and the value network. The STOF business model is a framework that emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach in analyzing business models and consists of four interrelated domains: Service, Technology, Organization, and Finance (STOF). The scope of this thesis is not to create a complete business model, but to analyze Unified Communications the role telecom operators play in relation to it. Due to the limitation of the data available, this thesis will not investigate the financial domain of the STOF model. The STOF framework has been applied in two different parts of this thesis. First, in a case study to analyze a new service that Vodafone Netherlands is planning to launch by structuring Vodafone’s current proposition and then improving it with a step-by-step approach (the STOF Method). This resulted in managerial findings, an answer to sub-question one and important implicit knowledge that contributed to the second part of the thesis. The STOF framework was then used together with the Fransman Layer Model to re-define and analyze Unified Communications from the perspective of a Telecom Operator. This analysis, together with the implicit knowledge acquired from the case study, provided the necessary information to conclude the research and answer the main research question and its sub-questions. In response to the first sub-question the research has identified two network architectures for Microsoft OCS/Lync that would lead to two different roles for Vodafone. With the “on customer premises OCS/Lync” architecture Vodafone would play a marginal role in UC provisioning, while with the “Hosted/Managed” architecture, Vodafone could become a Software/Platform as a service provider giving it a leading role in the provisioning of Unified Communications to customers. In response to the second sub-question telecom operators were found to provide three key features for Unified Communications: connectivity, both fixed and mobile; presence information, mainly telephony status information; and single number, a unique number for every phone the user owns. In response to the third sub-question the research identified two ways in which telecom operators can use their knowledge to deliver Unified Communications. First, their extensive experience in dealing with business customers can help in delivering complete and customized UC solutions. Second, telecom operators can enter a new market and become Software/Platform as Service Providers delivering full ICT solutions. The main research question has been answered by identifying three roles for Telecom Operators in the deployment of Unified Communications. First telecom operators are fundamental for the provisioning of some key services such as connectivity, presence and single number. Second, they can play a leading role in the provisioning of Unified Communications by providing tailored UC solutions to customers. Third, they can become SaaS/PaaS providers and play an active role in the UC industry.","Unified Communications; STOF Model; Fransman Layer Model; Vodafone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-01-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organization, Law and Games","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2012","Since the stone age the human race seeks for strategies to extend its viewing range. With the rise of technology in the twentieth century, cameras are found to be a very useful tool to survey a large area with limited resources. With an increasing numbers of cameras, it becomes more difficult to watch every monitor and prevent incidents in the surveillance area. For the last decades, research seeks for possibilities to automatize the process of video surveillance. For this thesis, we approach the surveillance task from the human perspective: we try to emulate what human operators do when they watch the monitors. To perform this task, state-of-the-art techniques from Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence are applied. An object tracking technique called P-N Learning is used that enables the tracker to learn from its mistakes. The Java Agent Development Framework (JADE) is used to enable communication between agents in the FIPA Agent Communication Language standard. A surveillance system model is designed that detects suspicious behavior in a non-public area. Its task is to alert the operators about suspicious events to give them the chance to investigate and take action. Two prototype applications are implemented and experiments are conducted to show the performance. We showed the proof-of-concept of a system which is able to emulate operators and can potentially outperform a human being. Once the system knows what is considered suspicious behavior it can be automatically detected.","video surveillance; multicamera; security; tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction Group","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","This study is intended to propose an innovative mobile service for the African and Middle East countries where the operator Orange-France Telecom is present. The countries under study include seventeen countries located in North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East. The African context is particular on several fronts: on average 60% of the population is rural, the main economic activity is agriculture, the population is sparsely spread, the mobile phone penetration is the lowest in the world, and infrastructures are precarious as well as public service provision. Taking this into account traditional business models have not and will not work for the African continent. To figure out new business models tailored to the African needs, it is necessary to innovate the way of addressing the market. The first phase for reaching this goal includes the recollection of valuable data in order to understand what the needs of the African people are so that the services offered cover these demands. In order to visualize the relevance of the data collected, a tool has been designed and created. This tool, developed in Microsoft Excel, displays each country’s score in twelve different indicators through tables and charts. Broadly speaking, the tool provides information of the elements that characterizes a country such as the main economic activities, literacy rate, fertility rate, etc., which helped in identifying the critical features of each country. In a second phase, a benchmark has been done worldwide with a focus on America. The objective of this benchmark is to have a picture of the types of services offered in each country and to get ideas of services existing elsewhere and having the potential to be implemented in Africa. The countries chosen for the benchmark are reduced to those countries worldwide that are similar to the African countries in the indicators analyzed in the first phase. This was done in order to cut the number of countries for the benchmark because of limitations. From the benchmark, two ideas of services emerged. The first service proposal is Push-To-Talk Over the Cell phone (PoC), widely deployed in America; and the second proposal is a personal design and idea that intends to address the different reality of liquidity in Africa. The final phase of the project is to describe the service proposed and present its technical and economic analysis. In this phase a deep study of the PoC service is done, what the technical solutions are, different business models, the marketing strategies operators have developed, and history of successes and failures worldwide, in order to assess the potential replication of the service in Africa. PoC resulted to be an interesting service as it is a cheap service allowing instant voice messaging, addressing the problem of low purchasing power, and adapted to the illiteracy problem. This study aims at providing insight of the PoC service necessary for taking a posture on whether to go further in the study and implementation of the service or dismiss it as a non feasible idea. Besides focusing on the PoC solution, the second proposal of an original financial strategy for charging the clients emerged as a logical and innovative solution after having studied and understood the context and the telecom market in Africa.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Department of Technology, Dynamics and Sustainable Development","","EPA-EMIN","",""

(mentor); Tavasszy, L. (mentor); Meijer, S. (mentor)","2012","Since 1919 KLM operates from its Hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS). Besides the air transport of passengers and cargo, KLM performs ground processes at AAS. Of which one is the handling of the passenger baggage between the airplanes and the baggage handling systems of AAS. Every year KLM’s division of Baggage Turnaround Services (BTS) handles around 35 million pieces of baggage of 130.000 flights at AAS. Including the baggage from Sky Team airlines and other client airlines of KLM BTS. The aim of BTS is to provide a safe and reliable service for KLM and its client airlines. The reliability of this service can have consequences on the customer satisfaction of the passengers, the departure punctuality of the outbound flights and the costs for KLM in redirecting mishandled bags. In 2010 KLM BTS was responsible for around 450.000 mishandled bags which costs KLM  50 million only for the redirecting of the baggage. A mishandled bag (MHB) is a bag that does not arrive on time on the final destination of the passenger. The consequences in terms of customer satisfaction and departure delays are not even included in this amount. Benchmarks of the Association of European Airlines (AEA) show that KLM`s European competitors perform (transfer airlines: Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa) structurally better than KLM based on the number of mishandled bags per 1000 passengers (=Irregularity rate). KLM has the ambition to become the most reliable European airline in terms of baggage handling within two years. In order to realize this KLM BTS needs to better understand how its (non-)performance is being caused. This research will provide these insights for KLM by answering the following research questions: What are the main influences on the operational performance of KLM`s Baggage Turnaround Services? To answer this research question a research approach that combines different qualitative and quantitative methods is designed. The approach consists of an actor analysis and a process analysis which generate potential influences divided into internal and external stakeholders of KLM. These potential influences are subsequently tested with statistical and data mining methods. The data mining methods consist of classification trees and neural networks. The operational performance of BTS is being defined as the Irregularity rate (Irrate in MHB`s/ 1000 passengers) to reduce the scope of the research and because of the limited data availability. As 98% of KLM`s Irrate score is caused by baggage that has a transfer at AAS, the research is concentrated on the transfer baggage flow. The qualitative research has generated first insights in how the Irrate can be influenced. It shows that the Irrate is influenced by many different factors of which a great part do not lay in the power of BTS. The major influences are classified in four stakeholder groups and some external influences which cannot directly be influenced by any stakeholder. The four stakeholder groups consist of: KLM, AAS, BTS and external stakeholders. These different groups can each in their own way have an impact in the baggage handling performance: 1. KLM influences consist mainly of network related factors as the distribution of flights and connection times but also the defined arrival and departure punctuality targets. KLM’s network targets are conflicting with the operational performance of BTS. Short connections are attractive for the potential passenger but difficult to realize in terms of baggage handling for KLM BTS. The same accounts for the on time departure (D0) target. 2. AAS determines the capacity and functioning of the baggage handling systems but also the distribution of the baggage of all non KLM BTS flights over the day. With respect to the baggage handling performance AAS has the same goal as KLM BTS. Nevertheless AAS also has to cope with the interests of three other ground handlers and more than 100 different airlines. 3. The group of external stakeholders that influences the Irrate consist of the outstation that load the airplanes and also often influence the arrival punctuality, customs that can perform all kind of security checks in the baggage basements and air traffic control who influences the arrival punctuality by assigning landing strips and prioritising certain flights. The load compliance, the choices to scan or check specific flights or the changes in arrival times all influence the difficulty of the task and therefore the performance of BTS. 4. KLM BTS itself can change process handling rules, buy more and or better materials and information systems and train and hire more personnel. The results of the quantitative research are for a large part determined by the data availability of the potential influences described above. First of all a regression analysis has shown the causal relation between the arrival punctuality (AO) and the Irrate score on a daily level. The A0 performance can explain 32% of the variance in the Irrate performance. No further significant relations have been found on a daily aggregation level. The use of the classification trees has emphasized the importance of the connection time of the transfer baggage. Baggage with short connections are far more vulnerable. Furthermore the lead time of the process between the arrival of the flight and inserting the baggage into the baggage handling systems influences the chances of baggage becoming an MHB significantly. The use of the neural networks have confirmed some of the insights obtained from the use of the classification trees and most importantly it has shown the difficulty in predicting MHB`s with the current available dataset. Neural network could only predict 47% of the MHB`s. This confirms the lack of useful and reliable data of the sub processes performed by BTS. Most important conclusions for KLM are that many of the variations in their performance are based on the performances of non BTS divisions or organizations. Where possible the impact of the variance in these factors on the Irrate or MHB percentages is provided. Furthermore a list of opportunities to minimise these influences is composed. Most important opportunities for KLM BTS are to focus more on the inbound load (collaboration with outstations), set specific arrival punctuality targets for inbound flights with many short connections (collaboration between divisions within KLM), exchange more data with AAS(collaboration with AAS), and focus on KLC outbound and ICA inbound processes (BTS) as these are more vulnerable for MHB`s. The research approach has confirmed some of the gut feelings that existed within KLM BTS and it has provided KLM with some new insights of vulnerable processes in their baggage handling. Nevertheless the full potential of the data mining methods can only be reached if more lead times of the different sub processes of BTS are being gathered and if the dataset is fully reliable in terms of BASS scan moments. This could generate models with a higher prediction accuracy in terms of MHB`s and it would provide more insights about the critical sub processes within BTS.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-01-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Infrastructure","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Vreeburg, J.H.G. (mentor)","2012","Osmotic power is a form of renewable energy which is currently not used at a commercial scale, but it might have the potential to be exploited in a sustainable manner in the near future. It uses the principle of osmosis, which is known for over a century and is used since recent years for several membrane applications. The salinity gradient between fresh river water and salt sea water, separated by a membrane, causes an osmotic flow which can be converted into electricity by using one of the two types of osmotic power generation, PRO or RED. Interested parties have already concluded, by conducting laboratory studies and operating pilot plants, that osmotic power is a promising source of renewable energy in the future. An energy unit rate of 8 cents/kWh should be possible for a commercial-scaled power plant. However, what is lacking in these studies is the actual design of the osmotic power plant. Scaling up of an osmotic power plant to a commercial scale will have a major impact on the design of the main infrastructure. The question is whether a commercial osmotic power plant is feasible if the capital costs of the main infrastructure are included. Answering this question is the objective of this thesis. The research question is answered by conducting multiple case studies with a varying capacity. By considering the revenues and investments over the lifespan of the power plant, the energy unit rate of each power plant is obtained. The general conclusion is that, with the present technology and knowledge, the energy unit rate deviates too much from a marketable energy unit rate. The high capital costs of the intake and outfall system and pre-treatment facility, and the low power plant efficiency ensure that a commercial osmotic power plant is not economically justified. The commercial exploitation of an osmotic power plant is therefore far from being feasible. However, when a number of expected and recommended developments are considered, the energy unit rate will approach a marketable value. The commercial exploitation of an osmotic power plant could therefore be feasible in the near future. Though, the occurrence of these recommended developments seems to be an utopia. The answer to the research question is therefore that the future commercial exploitation of osmotic power is not feasible.","osmosis; osmotic; blue energy; PRO; RED","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Coenders, J.L. (mentor); Schipper, H.R. (mentor); Borgart, A. (mentor)","2012","Recent years have witnessed the realization of multiple concrete curved surface structures. The often complex geometry of these structures led to new challenges in the final design and production phase: design of the reinforcement is one of these challenges. Current reinforcement modelling software is not capable of properly dealing with NURBS curves and surfaces. The absence of proper reinforcement tools for curved surface structures renders the structural engineer less effective in designing the reinforcement. This can lead to missing out on potential through ill-informed design decisions. The computational strategy proposed in this thesis provides a way of improving the design process of reinforcement in curved surface structures. It includes all necessary steps of raising an architectural curved surface model to production level in terms of reinforcement. Three design aspects have been distinguished: geometrical control, structural analysis, and production. Corresponding to these design aspects, three concepts have been developed: the SolidModel, FEM Analysis visualization and Rebar DNA which help to control them. The developed Reinforcement Toolbox supports the strategy by offering structural engineers a tool which can be used to control the design aspects of reinforcement in curved surface structures. It sets out to help remove the current split between draftsman and structural engineer by offering a design environment which offers the possibility to simultaneously model and verify reinforcement for curved surface structures. Functional requirements which emerged from the computational strategy formed important input for the developed architecture of the Reinforcement Toolbox. Use cases helped to identify different scenarios in which the software application is likely to be used. The system architecture of the Reinforcement Toolbox has been developed with strong attention to the multifaceted design process of reinforcement in curved surface structures. It builds on existing 3D modelling software, Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, by adding custom components. The Reinforcement Toolbox has been developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and written in C#. In accordance to the possibilities offered by this object oriented programming language, the Reinforcement Toolbox uses a collection of custom objects which can be considered the building blocks of the Toolbox. For the first version of the Reinforcement Toolbox several components have been developed. Together they offer the necessary functionality for a structural engineer or CAD draftsman to design longitudinal reinforcement groups and reinforcement meshes for curved surface structures. A first version of the Reinforcement Toolbox has been developed and tested. It can be applied to both complex curved surface structures as well as non-complex structures, making it a widely applicable design tool. Users can apply the Reinforcement Toolbox at their own discretion within any given stage of the reinforcement process either to quickly research different reinforcement design alternatives, or use it to build extensive reinforcement models. The parametric reinforcement models are easily adaptable to design changes, which makes them valuable throughout the entire reinforcement process. The Toolbox has been designed considering user friendliness, and freedom of use. The modular setup allows users to combine components at their own discretion allowing for the intended freedom when designing reinforcement. It has been demonstrated to a group of structural engineers, who recognize the potential it can bring to the reinforcement process, especially when its current functionality and scope will be expanded.","curved surface structures; concrete reinforcement; computational design; Grasshopper; C#; Parametric design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Segeren, M.L.A. (mentor); Raaijmakers, T.C. (mentor); Luijendijk, A.P. (mentor); Bai, W. (mentor)","2012","Wind energy has experienced an enormous growth in the last years and is becoming more and more popular as an alternative for conventional power. Large growth numbers are also expected for the coming years, for onshore as well as for offshore wind energy. Currently, a wind power capacity of almost 4 GW is installed offshore in the European Union, meeting 0.4% of the European electricity need at this moment. More than 137 GW of offshore wind energy is being planned, consented or under construction in the European waters. This total of offshore wind power capacity could provide approximately 14% of the European demand for electricity. With an expected offshore installation of 1 MW per year, 9.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions can be avoided annually [EWEA (2011b)]. The first offshore wind park in The Netherlands is Offshore Wind park Egmond aan Zee (OWEZ). The 36 wind turbines in this wind park have a capacity of 3 MW, together producing sufficient renewable energy for more than 100,000 households, approximately the size of the city of Eindhoven [NOORDZEEWIND (2011)]. In order to reach the mentioned numbers for the offshore wind energy, some engineering challenges need to be overcome. One of these challenges in offshore wind park construction is the bed protection around the turbine foundations. Surveys of the bed levels around the wind turbine foundations in OWEZ have shown that just beyond the scour protection edge scour develops. This can cause damage to the electricity cables buried in the bed. A damaged electricity cable results in down time of the wind turbine and the wind turbines connected to it further in the string. The required burial depth of the cables is therefore governed by the location and depth of the edge scour hole. Edge scour is not very well understood and therefore difficult to quantify. Improved insight in the development of edge scour is valuable for science and industry. The present exploratory study revealed that more research is needed to compute edge scour development correctly with the software package Delft3D-Flow. However, even if the model results in Delft3D-Flow would be perfect, considerable or even unacceptable computational times need to be overcome. Therefore, a less time consuming method to calculate the edge scour depth would be very valuable. In order to develop such a method for calculating edge scour depth, the following objectives have been studied: 1. Gain insight in the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes around the foundation of an offshore wind turbine with bottom protection, focussing on edge scour. 2. Explore the possibilities of applying Delft3D-Flow for modelling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes around the foundation of an offshore wind turbine with bottom protection, focussing on edge scour. 3. Develop a model to predict the depth and rate of edge scour around the foundation of an offshore wind turbine. The research reveals that tidal asymmetry is of major concern in the development of edge scour. Edge scour develops mainly downstream of the wind turbine for the dominant tide. In addition, lee-wake vortices downstream the wind turbine play an important role in the formation of the edge scour holes. The performance of Delft3D-Flow is rather poor in this specific situation. A lack of resemblance between the bed levels computed with Delft3D-Flow and the measured bed levels in OWEZ exists. Most likely this is due to mediocre performance of the two-dimensional model with respect to the hydrodynamics in this specific situation. It is recommended to investigate this in more detail. Due to the lack of detailed measurements of the hydrodynamics, it is difficult to validate the model results. In order to calculate the edge scour depth, the Edge Scour Prediction Model (ESPM) has been developed. This is a model based on mathematical relations of development towards an equilibrium in time and empirical relations for the equilibrium edge scour depth and characteristic timescale. The Delft3D-Flow model is applied to assess the amplification factor as input for the ESPM. The ESPM has proven to reproduce the edge scour depth as function of time in OWEZ reasonably well. In addition, it can be a valuable tool for a first impression of the edge scour depth in new designs at other locations.","edge scour; offshore wind turbine; Delft3D-Flow; offshore wind park Egmond aan Zee; tidal asymmetry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The correlation between the fMRI activity traces of distinct brain regions indicates to what extent they are functionally connected. fMRI connectivity data typically consists of a matrix of correlations, also denoted as functional correlations, either at the voxel level or averaged over anatomically defined brain regions using an anatomical template such as the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL). In this thesis, we present methods for the interactive visualization of functional brain connectivity, both for region-based connectivity matrices and for correlation data at voxel resolution. The techniques were implemented in two different visual analysis applications, containing different representations that are coupled, supporting linked interaction. A GPU-accelerated raycasting technique was used to enable the real-time visualization of the voxel-wise functional brain networks. We have evaluated our tools via case studies with domain scientists at two different university medical centers.","visualization; brain connectivity; GPU raycasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Deptartment of Intelligent Systems","","Section Computer Graphics and Visualization","",""

(mentor); Bouwmans, I. (mentor); Correljé, A.F. (mentor); Gorkum, K. (mentor); Broekhans, B. (mentor)","2012","The emergence of green gas is a promising development within the Dutch gas market. Green gas is biogas with natural gas quality and can lead to a significant (up to 70%) greenhouse gas reduction. It therefore contributes to several sustainable energy targets and might partly solve some economical and geopolitical issues within the gas market. Currently, the green gas share is about 0,5% and ambitions for a share of 50% by 2050 are posed. Related to and included in the green gas sector, Bio-CNG is the most mature and sustainable renewable transport fuel and has the most potential on the short term. Unfortunately, several obstacles are present within the emerging Dutch green gas market in general and within the Dutch (Bio-)CNG market in particular. The exact problems (and its consequences) that hinder the further development are not clear at present. Likely, new concepts (comprising technical and institutional aspects) for the distribution of green gas to fuelling stations could take away these problems. With that in mind the main research question for this study is: What are feasible socio-technical concepts for the Dutch distribution system of (Bio-) CNG to fuelling stations, that take away the identified problems within both the green gas market and the (Bio-)CNG market? First, a thorough problem analysis is executed. Based on the identified needs, functional requirements are developed. Non-functional requirements are identified via a stakeholder analysis and via boundary values within certain institutions in place. In addition, the institutional analysis gives insight in the current participating organisations, their resources and the interactions. Specific institutional economic aspects are identified, that can influence the (institutional) design largely. Hereafter, the technical design alternatives are constructed, based on the functional requirements and the possible technical tactics. Subsequently, these alternatives are evaluated on their performance via a score on the non-functional requirements. Additionally, these evaluations comprised several scenarios. After the selection of four feasible technical alternatives, the institutional design embedding took place. In some cases, the institutional design choices gave reason to redesign the technical design slightly. Finally, the conclusions and recommendations considering these combined technical and institutional designs are posed. Eventually, a generic design approach for infrastructure systems (or even socio-technical systems) is abstracted from this research. This approach combines several techniques in order to be able to derive at feasible socio-technical conceptual designs. The interaction between institutions and technology is included prominently, as are the aspects of requirements engineering, scenario development and the creation and evaluation of technical design alternatives.","green gas; sustainable mobility; CNG distribution; high-pressure gas network; multi-disciplinary systems design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2012","In Bihar, India, arsenic rich aquifers are used as a drinking water source by millions of people, even though the arsenic concentration in some places is so high it causes serious health issues. The arsenic concentrations in the aquifers show a large spatial variability, one that is presently unpredictable. The most important factors which play a role in arsenic distribution are the source (natural occurring minerals) and the redox conditions, which enable the arsenic to be released from the minerals. There is a relation between fluvial deposits and redox conditions. In addition, fluvial deposits are known to be heterogeneous, which has large influence on flow regimes. The objective of this study is therefore to investigate the fluvial deposits in the region, and to predict the control they have on the distribution of arsenic. To do so, the architecture of a point bar attached to a clay plug is mapped in the region of Bakhorapur, Bhojpur District, Bihar, India. This was done by interpreting Google Earth satellite images, with executing a transient electromagnetic survey and by drilling two boreholes of 50 m (including well logs); the cores were ultimately studied in detail. The three methods indicate that up to 28 m, two stacked, heterogeneous and laterally continuous 10-15 m thick point bars are present. Below these extensive conglomerate and coarse sand bodies of braided river origin are recognized. The end result is a geological model concept, in which fluvial reservoir architecture elements of importance for flow regimes are highlighted. The geological model concept suggests that both the initial place of release and the spreading of arsenic are to a large extent controlled by the 3D architecture of the fluvial deposits. The concept can be turned into a static model and used for flow calculations such that the user is able to predict arsenic spreading in the case of arsenic release from specific fluvial sediment bodies. Considering the region being full of similar point bar deposits, the concept is generally applicable throughout the region. With this, arsenic safe drinking spots can be located, helping a great number of people.","contamination; sedimentology; point bars","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Jansen, R. (mentor); Wallrafen, H. (mentor)","2012","Compared with people with normal vision, blind and visually impaired people (B&VI) suffer from not only limited accessibility to public buildings but also poor experience of these buildings. However, the keen senses of sound and touch of B&VI, which are honed through daily practice and compensated by the loss of vision in brain, could be utilized to make up the inexistence of sight in navigation functionally and experientially. By exploring the possibilities of sonification, this project was intended to design an auditory navigation system of the interior of a public building for B&VI users. The aim of this system is to help B&VI to navigate in a building independently without any difficulties and to satisfy their curiosity to explore the building as well. The main approach of this project is research by design. The research includes field explorations of several public buildings and a literature study. According to the findings of literature study, B&VI have the same ability to perceive, process and understand spatial concepts as people with normal vision do, but that they do so more slowly and in different ways. Visual information can provide direct spatial relations of objects, while the auditory or tactile information that can be used for recognizing spatial relations have to be stored in memory and processed one by one. Previous studies showed that the main difficulty in indoor navigation and orientation is the missing of known landmarks. Based on the results mentioned above, a scale model for indoor navigation with auditory landmarks of known sound could help B&VI to establish sense of spatial relations. Designing such a scale model needs two steps: selecting the representative auditory landmarks and integrating the auditory landmarks to the scale model. User interviews were conducted to obtain insights of general navigation strategies of B&VI, which contributed to the designing of the frame of the model. Basic design requirements were generated and eight common landmarks, including landmarks for toilets, receptions, canteens, offices, elevators, staircases, doors, and smoking rooms, were selected for further development. In addition, a sound test with blind participants was conducted to select representative sounds. In order to better analyze how people perceive space through auditory information and how to make the best use of auditory landmarks for indoor navigation, two user studies were conducted with blindfolded participants. These studies showed that the most effective auditory information tends to be clear signal sounds rather than environment sounds recorded in reality. Through iterative building-and-testing cycles, the final concept Audigator was designed. Audigator is an interactive sound system, which could be applied to interior scale models, for navigation inside public buildings of blind and visually impaired people. With the help of a finger sleeve in blue color, Audigator could track the hand movement of users in the scale model by color detection with a webcam. Sound will be processed and played according to the relative position of finger and the preset positions of sound sources in the scale model. Quadraphonic sound setting of four speakers is applied to provide surround sound. Combined with the tangible objects representing sound sources, which are installed in the scale model, the sound play can help users to recognize the main functional objects or areas in the scale model and provide navigational information to the users.","auditory; navigation; blind; indoor; public building; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2012","The worldwide struggle to renew the human energy supply to high environmental friendly standards has led to creative and innovative solutions for the supply of `green' energy. The financial benefits of conventional energy sources restrain the widespread use of renewable energy sources, like wind or solar energy. This competition requires ingenuity and sometimes the reinvestigation of possibly prematurely dismissed solutions, such as the luminescent solar concentrator (LSC). In this research an inorganic thin film LSC is characterized experimentally in detail in terms of all the separate light transport steps that result in the concentration of sunlight. A 3 um thin film of Eu3+ doped Lu2O3 was chosen for of its large Stokes' shift, which excludes all transport losses due to self-absorption and allowed to study losses caused by scattering at interfaces of the LSC. A model is presented which can be used to calculate the LSC light transport efficiency as a function of LSC surface area. This model needs the easily measured linear attenuation as input, which characterizes the transport efficiency. A second more elaborate analytic model is developed to separate the losses in the film and in the substrate. This model also considers the non-uniformity of the attenuation length. The quantum efficiencies of our LSCs following from the measurements are in the order of 15%, which is less than ideal, mainly due to a poor 34 - 44% luminescence quantum efficiency and a 53 - 65% waveguide efficiency. Measurements have shown some discrepancies. Both the absorption spectrum and the time resolved luminescence spectrum did not show the expected behaviour upon change of europium concentration. The directional output measurements did not show the expected relative intensities of the film and the substrate. Qualitatively, however, the model and measurements are similar. Complimentary measurements could reveal the causes of these quantitative differences. A possible reason could be that some waveguide modes are not supported by the film. The modelling reveals that, in order to have building integrated LSCs simultaneously acting as windows, the linear attenuation length in the LSC should be longer than one meter. This is in contrast to the values in the order of tens of millimetres, which have been measured for the LSCs in this work. If such attenuation lengths are realised, power efficiency calculations reveal power efficiencies of up to 16% for the appropriate combination of luminescent material and solar cell.","LSC; luminescent Solar Concentrator; Lu2O3:Eu3+; thin film luminescent solar concentrator; solar cell; PV module; photo voltaic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Radiation, Radionuclides & Reactors","","Applied Physics","",""

Groynes are traditionally constructed to ensure adequate water depth for navigation, so the interaction of navigation and groyne fields is nearly guaranteed. The Hungarian Danube section – which is part of the 7th European transport corridor – has a great importance, however, there are several places where the minimum 25 dm navigational water depth is not available in low water regime. As the River Waal (a branch of River Rhine), which falls in the same category of navigable waterways as River Danube, in my TU Delft based research I used that particular Dutch river as case study. The goal of this graduation project is formulated as follows: What kind of effects does navigation have on river morphology? This was investigated on physical basis by means of a numerical model. First, the influence of push towing on morphology is investigated by analyzing the bed shear stress distributions, then the impacts on groyne fields. It could be concluded that primary waves caused by push tows increase the bed shear stresses around the ship, moreover, groyne fields are also affected, especially their zone close to the main stream. The impact of different ship sets on shear stresses was also studied. It was found that the most significant effect was caused by the ship velocity, the sailing distance between ship and groynes, a moderate one by the ship’s width and a minor one by the ship’s length. A numerical morphological model could offer a more detailed insight in the morphological changes than analyzing the bed shear-stress distribution, only, a recommendation for future studies is therefore the implementation of such a model. FINEL2D’s capability of predicting the flow changes at groyne fields caused by navigation have been shown, although FINEL2D only uses advective momentum transport (but suffering from some numerical viscosity) to predict the flow, while in the groyne fields inhomogeneous turbulent processes are supposed to be dominating. Nevertheless, FINEL2D showed a sufficient match with physical model results.","groin; river groyne; river training; navigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The electricity demand of households in the Netherlands has been growing rapidly for the last decades and will continue to grow in the near future. This is specifically the case during peak periods. High peak loads could exceed the available capacity, resulting in overloaded network components (assets) which lead to an excessive reduction in life expectancy of these assets. The present aging distribution network will not have the capacity to cope with these future peak loads. The increase of electricity demand by the end-users therefore seriously reduces the reliability and safety of the electricity distribution. This poses an important problem for the Distribution Network Operators, who are responsible for the transport of electricity, maintenance and management of the regional electricity distribution networks. The traditional method to cope with capacity availability during peak periods is to invest heavily in placing more electricity cables. However, Demand-Side Management programs using load-shifting techniques also show good potential for reducing the peak loads in the network demand pattern. Load-shifting focuses on scheduling smart household appliances from peak load periods to off-peak periods. The aim of Demand-Side Management is to increase the efficiency of the system by bringing both demand and supply to the best possible low value. To measure the effectiveness of Demand-Side Management, the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) “Levelling Effect” (LE) and “Height of Peak loads” (HP) are used. LE measures for a day the deviation of loads from the average load of the network. HP measures the highest load (in W) that occurs during a day in the network. Both the traditional way of improving the network, and a Demand-Side Management approach will require high investments. To ensure that such investments are economically viable, DNOs should now the extent to which Demand-side Management of households will affect these KPIs. Assessing load-shifting potential by scheduling smart appliances: Because load-shifting takes place through the individual scheduling of household appliances, the focus lies on a the household’s appliances level. On this level, the irregularities of the demand pattern are important, which are caused by the simultaneous usage of household appliance. We therefore constructed a simulation model using an Agent-Based Modelling approach, which takes into account these aspects. This simulation model represents a low-voltage network with one hundred households connected to it. Each household owns appliances, which build-up the electricity demand of the household. Smart appliances are modelled as individual agents to allow the scheduling of these appliances. Non-smart appliances are combined and generate the “other-loads”. The scheduler uses a “lowest-point” principle for the scheduling of smart appliances. Furthermore, all appliances are always scheduled and they cannot be rescheduled. The model simulates the demand pattern on the network during one working. External influences (e.g. weather) are ignored. From the literature and the available data, we made a trade-off between the required accuracy and computation, and opted for a time step of 15 minutes. Simulation results: As expected, the introduction of a smart system to the network was found to level the demand pattern and lower the peaks by a maximum of 13%. In this simulation, 16% of the total demand could be shifted. Non-cooling appliances (dishwashers, washing machines and tumble dryers) represent about 8% of the total load, and cooling appliance (refrigerators and freezers) the other 8%. The rescheduling of appliances did however increase the number of excessive peak loads, which in real life could form a serious risk for overloading the network. The scheduler does not take into account the profile of the smart appliances when scheduling. Appliances with a low start demand could therefore be scheduled to a low load timeslot while the load on subsequent timeslots could increase to peak loads when the appliances reach their full demand. More advanced scheduling algorithms that also take into account the appliance demand profile should resolve this. Apart from the above mentioned aspect, a closer examination of the smartness variable also showed some additional interesting developments. As expected, better forecasting and longer operational horizons will give better results. Unexpectedly however, was the lack of effect of the scheduling schemes. This is most likely because appliances are always scheduled, which results in a lack of advantage of being first in the schedulers queue. More advanced scheduling algorithms that allow appliances not to be scheduled may resolve this. The sequencing of the cooling appliances created a layer of smart cooling load that absorbs all the small irregularities in the demand pattern. Because of their short operational time, cooling appliances may therefore successfully be used for smoothing of the network demand pattern. Scheduling appliances using a “lowest-point” principle proved to work very well, but only for non-cooling smart appliances. The multiple usages of the smart cooling appliances caused them to turn on less in low-peak periods but more on the slopes towards peak loads. This scheduling artefact is caused by the time-step of 15 minutes and a too simplistic scheduling algorithm. Too few timeslots were available for effective scheduling of these appliances. Using a smaller time step in combination with a more advanced scheduling algorithm should improve the scheduling of smart cooling appliances. However, a smaller time-step would not necessarily increase the quality of the result, this also applies to a better representation of the non-smart “other-loads” profiles. A smaller time-step would increase the variation in irregularities on the demand pattern, but the overall network demand pattern would stay the same. Although the scheduler does take into account these small variations on the demand pattern, the general network demand pattern determines the areas were the smart appliances are scheduled to. Conclusion of research Our study has shown that load shifting by scheduling smart appliances is likely to produce more levelled demand pattern. Peaks in the network demand pattern can be reduced by 13% and the gaps are filled resulting in a more levelled demand pattern. A time step of 15 minutes works well for non-cooling appliances, but it limits the effective scheduling of (the present) smart cooling appliances. But a shorter time step would not necessarily have produced better results. The overall network demand patterns, and thus the overall scheduling places of the smart appliances, will most likely stay the same. What potentially could make a difference is a more advanced scheduler. Allowing rescheduling and the possibility for smart appliance not to be scheduled could result in a higher effectiveness of the scheduling schemes and more optimal scheduling of the smart appliances.","Demand-Side Management; Load-shifting; Agent-Based Modelling; Smart appliances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","SEPAM / Multi Actor Systems","",""

(mentor)","2012","In this thesis the effect of gas diffusion between bubbles on the bubble-size distribution and capillary resistance to foam flow in a bubble train is investigated using an idealized 2D pore model. First the shape of the model pore is discussed and how a lamella moves through it. Then the physical forces (lamella curvatures and pressure differences between bubbles) in the pores are explained and how they affect capillary resistance to foam flow. Next the parameters of the dimensionless model are related to measured fluid properties. Under certain conditions (large film permeability to gas, large surface tension, low pressure, small pores, and low velocity of flowing gas) it is possible that characteristic diffusion rate can be greater than imposed convection rate, and that all gas transport is from diffusion across lamellae, not bubble movement. We present model results for different ratios of characteristic diffusion to convection rates. If bubbles are smaller than pores, diffusion reduces the number of bubbles and increases average bubble size, whether convection is imposed on the foam or not. If convection is imposed, lamellae disappear not in pore throats but after first colliding in jumps across pore bodies. If bubbles are larger than pores, diffusion does not increase average bubble size. Diffusion increases the capillary resistance to flow; the increase is greatest when the characteristic rate of diffusion is close to the convection rate. Diffusion increases capillary resistance to flow because lamellae spend more time in positions of greater curvature than in the absence of diffusion. For characteristic diffusion rates much greater or much less than the imposed convection rate the effect of diffusion on capillary resistance to foam flow is modest. These results suggest that by itself, an increase in diffusion rate through lamellae does not make foam flow with less resistance. With diffusion lamellae spend more time in pore throats where capillary resistance to flow is greatest.","Diffusion; Foam; Bubble; Size; Distribution; Gas; Mobility","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Zuidwijk, R.A. (mentor); Quist, P. (mentor); Oosting, M.W. (mentor)","2012","Dordrecht Seaports (DS) is an inland port located next to Rotterdam with a direct connection to the North Sea. Since the first of July 2011 the Port of Rotterdam Authority (PoR) is taking over the management of the port from the municipality of Dordrecht. In the current situation not all companies are port related. The port related companies are active in the storage of liquid bulk and dry bulk with especially ore & scrap. The yearly throughput of the DS is around three millions tons (3,2 million ton in 2010). After an analysis of the productivity (dry and wet), it can be concluded that this port at the moment is not used as a sea port, but as an inland port. With an analysis is shown which segments can optimize the port. This analysis is done from three different analysis pillars, namely: area, stakeholder and vision. In the first pillar (area) is concluded that the DS is surrounded with other business areas in the surroundings. The maritime industry has settled its roots here and is still active in this area. For adding values to the cargo, which has to be exported from or imported by the DS, new business areas can be used which come available around DS. Those areas are Dordtse Killen III and IV, Logistic Park Moerdijk and Nieuw-Reijerwaard. Besides that, the DS can contribute as an added value in the (port) network of Rotterdam. With enlargement of DS in the network of PoR, PoR can also contribute on advantages. The second pillar is the pillar of stakeholders. With the analysis of their interests and issues the importance of the different stakeholder are determined. Next to the PoR, also the municipality of Dordrecht, the companies within the DS and the Drechtsteden are the most important stakeholders. Their main issues are accessibility and the economic progress of the area. The last pillar of analysis is the framework on the vision of PoR on DS. Based on the Business plan and Havenvisie 2030 of PoR, the relevant elements are taken into account for the development of the DS. From the Havenvisie 2030 the growth percentages of each segment are the base for the determination of the growth percentages of the DS. With a band width between the Low Growth (LG) scenario and Global Economy (GE) scenario, a translation of the growth percentages is determined, based on the history trend lines and some special factors. The expected growth of the throughput of the DS in 2022 is between 3,5 and 3,9 million ton per year with a large increase for the segments coals and ore & scrap. The segments other dry bulk and other general cargo decrease within this time horizon. From those three pillars the potential segments are determined to optimize the port. This is done with a multi-criteria analysis per pillar. Maritime industry and other general cargo have a high potential level, which is in contrast with the segments short sea and Ro/Ro. With the fulfillment of the potential segments in the basins an ideal situation is sketched. It is concluded with this segments classification in the basins in combination with extra implementations to optimize the port, a new throughput is expected between 6,5 and 6,9 million ton for 2022. With a case study of damping a basin it is shown that more throughput can be realized. The business case is not profitable in first instance, but this is quite normal for damping business cases. With some minor changes in the variables of the incomes, this will be profitable. This means that PoR has realistic options to optimize DS.","Port Development Plan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

One approach to model driven software development is the design and development of domain-specific languages allowing programmers and users to spend more time on their core business and less on addressing non problem- specific issues. Language workbenches and support languages and compilers are necessary for supporting development of these domain-specific languages. One such workbench is the Spoofax Language Workbench. Within Spoofax, parsers are generated from SDF syntactic definitions and compilers are specified in the Stratego programming language. The Stratego programming language is a powerful tool for specifying software rewriting systems, but has one drawback: it is untyped. The absence of a (static) type system exposes the programmer and the user to risks of runtime failures, and inherently exposes the user to the internals of the compiler. To attempt to mititage these risks and to serve as a basis for further development, this project has been dedicated to designing and implementing a set of static analyses for Stratego code.","Spoofax; Language workbench; Language engineering; Domain Specific Language; DSL; Stratego; Static analysis; Type checking","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Technical Informatics","","Software Technology","",""

Neither of the current navigation tools nor the accessibility design could fulfill both the functional as well as the experiential demands for indoor orientation. To fill up the above-mentioned blank, a navigation tool named Haptic Guide was developed. It consists of eight haptic icons for reception, cloakroom, toilet, door, elevator, stairs, café and smoking room of a public building, by means of redesigning the geometry shape of a representative object and incorporating specific material features. Haptic Guide is used with a 3D scale model, which contains a drawer structure allowing users to explore the lower floor better. By placing the haptic icons in certain positions, the 3D scale model facilitates B&VI people to recognize the above mentioned eight places or objects, and their locations in the represented building in reality. Based on the spatial layout information provided by the model base, users are able to plan routes to these places or objects and to use them as landmarks with their own navigation strategy. The Haptic Guide could be universally applied to diverse public buildings. The modular design makes it promising to combine auditory or other information sources, which would make it even more functional and interesting.","tactile; navigation; the blind and visual impaired; public building; scale model; accessibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Spinean, B. (mentor)","2012","The performance gap between processors and memory has grown larger and larger in the last years. With the emergence of the multicores this problem is additionally accelerated. Stalling row changes in the DRAM increase this gap even more, because the maximum theoretical bandwidth cannot be reached. The solution that is proposed in this thesis is to reorder the requests originated by multiple processing elements inside the memory controller. More data is accessed in burst mode and less stalling row changes are needed when the requests are reordered. The proposed memory controller has a modular setup and does not require any changes of the CPU or the executed software. A few reordering policies have been considered, but one has been implemented as it showed the best expected results in the preliminary analysis. The speed-up that is obtained by reordering requests varies, but is up to 1.58 for a 3D-FFT and 1.40 for a Conjugate Gradient (CG) workloads with just 64 entries in the sorting array. Power analysis on the DRAM and memory controller shows that the activation power of the DRAM is lowered up to 40% because of the reordering. The total energy that is necessary for each application is reduced with a maximum energy saving of 26.6% for the 3D-FFT and 13.2% for the CG application. This shows that the bandwidth utilization of the DRAM interface is increased while saving energy by using reordering of requests.","DRAM; memory controller; reordering; bandwidth; DDR SDRAM; reduced energy; requests; 3D-FFT; CG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Electron Microscopes (EMs) are able to take images from the inside of materials with atomic resolution and thus, are widely used in material science, biomedical and nanotechnology research. (S)TEMs, unlike optical microscopes, can reveal the internal structure of materials at higher magnifications, i.e. on nano scale, since an electron wave has smaller wavelength compared to a photon wave. The electromagnetic objective lens is one of the most important components of the (S)TEM optical system and its properties determine the quality of the acquired images. An objective lens can cause so-called ‘optical aberrations’ which are undesirable. To correct these aberrations, so-called aberration correctors can be developed. The correction of these aberrations of which the defocus and two-fold astigmatism are two main aberrations of (S)TEM objective lens, is essential, since defocus can cause image blurring and two-fold astigmatism can reshape an image. Unfortunately, the current aberration correction procedure takes relatively too much time which is undesirable. The time dependency, accuracy and reproducibility are crucial aspects and should be taken into account in order to obtain a high quality operation. Hence, it is essential to develop a defocus and two-fold astigmatism corrector from the systems and control perspective, by means of closed-loop control on the basis of defocus and two-fold astigmatism measurements. To apply closed-loop control, a sensor capable of measuring aberrations from (S)TEM images, is needed. This necessitates, essentially, a careful survey of different available defocus and two-fold astigmatism measurement methods, using (S)TEM images, to be able to define their restrictions and, finally, to find a suitable measurement method. Also, an implementation of the selected method, in Matlab, is required in order to be able to study the behaviour of the defocus and two-fold astigmatism sensor. These topics will be discussed and the results will be presented.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","In the field of video surveillance, a large problem is often the acquiring of video feeds of specific scenarios as test or training data. Even if privacy and safety concerns are not taken into account, it is often much cheaper to generate a virtual scenario rather than record one using real cameras, especially when the camera placement was not as perfect as desired when shooting the scenario. While recent advances in the field of crowd simulation have led to more and more realistic behavior, little attention has been given to the potential reuse of the crowds simulated in these scenarios. Not having to redefine a crowd for every scenario would make the authoring of simulations much easier, as the reuse of the environments already does. This thesis introduces a new crowd and agent model, that emphasize the reusability of the crowd. By semantically enriching the entities in the environments with information on what they can provide, the agent model is decoupled from specific environments, thereby allowing the agents to walk around in other environments. The crowd model is furthermore split into two components, one of which does not depend on any specific environment instance, while the other component remains inevitably dependent on such instances, otherwise the crowds would not be able to ‘know’ where to enter the environment. As a proof of concept, a prototype simulator for the crowd and agent models is also introduced, along with graphical editors for them. To assess both the models and the simulator, four test scenarios are created using the new crowd and agent models. Although the crowds can be inserted in any environment, they will not automatically work in all environments if the authoring process was not done with reusability in mind. Therefore several guidelines are constructed from the results of the scenarios, that will help with the authoring of both reusable crowds and reusable environments. With the crowd model introduced in this thesis, and the help of the accompanying authoring guidelines, virtual crowds may be reused more easily. By reusing the crowds as well as the environments, virtual scenarios can be developed more easily, thereby allowing more time to be spent on the tools that the scenarios were meant to test or train.","semantics; reusable; crowd simulation; crowds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Game Technology","",""

(mentor)","2012","The main objective of the study is to understand the effects of breach properties (e.g. the top width, the depth and the bottom width of the breach) on the breach flow. The breach flow was modeled as flow over a compound broad-crested weir. A laboratory experiment was carried out with a fixed weir model in a flume. Five cases with different breach properties were tested. Firstly, the discharge coefficients for all cases were quantitatively determined. The calibrations were done under two flow conditions, namely emerged flow conditions (flow only through the breach) and overtopping flow conditions (flow through the compound cross-section of weir). In perfect weir situations, it turned out that the values of the discharge coefficient were below 1 and rather different in the two flow conditions. Particularly in the case of overtopping flow, the linear combination of traditional discharge equations was verified for predicting the discharge and the discharge distribution over the weir. In imperfect weir situations, submergence coefficient was introduced in emerged condition. Secondly, the dependence of the energy head loss caused by the weir on the upstream discharge and the downstream water depth was discussed in imperfect weir situations. The Form Drag model for estimating the energy head loss was proved to be applicable for the modeled breach flow. Thirdly, the local hydraulic characteristics of breach flow were described by means of velocity distribution, water level elevation and flow patterns appearing behind the weir. At last, the numerical model (Delft3D) was verified on the modeling of the present experiment by comparing with the experimental data. The report provides the information for the breach flow which can be of use in the development of breach models, inundation models and compound weir design.","breach flow; weir; experimental study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""
