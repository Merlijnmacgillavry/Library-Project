(mentor); Koppels, P.W. (mentor)","2012","Dutch developers are thought to have been able to outcompete the owners of existing office space on rental pricing (the phenomenon). For tenants it was more inexpensive to move to newly proposed (not yet existent) office space than to remain where they are, or move to other existing office space. Three theoretical reasons were identified for the phenomenon to exist: 1) rent price lagging of existing assets to new market information, 2) lower production costs for the new development and 3) the creation of margin between development costs and asset selling price. Especially the latter has had influence on the phenomenon's existence. Three main aspects are identified for the creation of margin: 1) A period of Yield Compression (2004-2008) enabled great selling prices to be obtained. Thereby margin was created. It also led to a decrease in financing costs and allowed for the neglect of given lease incentives by developers, 2) the use of the normative residual land value method enabled margin to exist altogether and allowed for additional margin to be created, and 3) the use of Lease Incentives by the developer has shown to have an amplifying effect: Profit Sharing/the High-Low Method effectively lowers the rent level of the tenant by making maximum use of the created margin. Sources used: literature, expert interviews, key-actor interviews, dataset analysis and sensitivity analysis.","incentive; lease incentive; effective rent; contract rent; market rent; high-low method; hoog-laag; price lagging; yield compression; real estate; office; vacancy; normative residual land value; residual land value; residual land value method; municipal competition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-31","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

Since the deployments of WSN are often made in inaccessible or hazardous area, the inspection operation can have a high degree of risk. In order to facilitate these intervention, the design and implementation of a WSN mobile monitoring tool is proposed.The tool is composed of an application built for a Neo FreeRunner smartphone which interfaces a TelosB mote via USB. The TelosB mote acts a sniffer and sends the data to the smartphone which analyzes it and displays packet information. The system is also able to use passive or active monitoring and track other nodes using a method of estimating distances to nodes using the RSSI value. The tool can be also used as a debugger for WSNs by replaying the last session and setting breakpoints. To evaluate this prototype, the localizing method is tested, together with the capacity of the sniffer mote process packets and the collision detection accuracy.","smartphones; wireless sensor networks; sniffer; monitoring; inspection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Henze, L.A.R. (mentor)","2012","Launching a new product involves the efforts from design development and market development, which requires cross-functional collaboration. When the novelty of a project is high, it would be rather difficult for co-workers to cross boundaries since the shared knowledge is relatively limited. These knowledge barriers might lead to communication problems, which decrease the efficiency of collaboration. The process of collaboration requires certain facilitation to bring up the team performance. Some artifacts are created to help design engineers to present their research outcomes from new product development, such as prototypes, documents and technical notes. However, these artifacts still seem insufficient to support cross-functional collaboration. Based on the upper mentioned problem, this graduation project aims at finding a design solution to help design engineers to “sell” their ideas or designs to internal stakeholders via artifacts, thus to reduce the barriers in collaboration. “Selling” ideas and designs is a process of sharing understanding between different disciplines. The main approach of this project is research through design: testable prototypes were built to reflect on the finding of research. The project started with a contextual understanding, followed with a literature search and a context study. A cross-functional team was selected as the target for the research. The grounded theory method was used for data analysis. According to the findings of literature study, there are two approaches for knowledge integration in R&D collaboration. One approach is to traverse knowledge by transferring, translating and transforming it, thus the individuals with different expertise could share and assess each other’s knowledge by crossing knowledge boundaries. The other approach is to transcend knowledge instead of clarifying the knowledge differences. Actions are taken to minimize the knowledge difference and aim at finding solutions for design problems. Thus the new product development could be done without understanding tacit knowledge in depth. The studies on the R&D team showed that telling good stories of their research outcomes is quite essential during new product development. To convince clients, design engineers need to show how they take the feedback from clients into account, and how they manage risks to ensure that the concept could be launched in the market successfully. In addition, besides knowledge barriers, creative tension also exists among stakeholders. Design engineers have to face various choices and deal with uncertainties. Based on the upper mentioned findings, six design directions were generated, which would be further explored in the design phase. To better guide the design phase, a design statement was generated, which is to design an artifact/ artifacts that help R&D team to better demonstrate their research and development process, thus to improve the communication among stakeholders and working performance of the team. Increasing interactions and presenting rich and clear information in the new product development process are the two focus of the final design. Further context research was conducted to narrow down the design direction. In the end, a system design was delivered. There three main usages of the system, which are rich research outcome demonstration, flexible prototype presentation, and facilitating effective and direct discussion. The system design consists of four items: the Container A, the Container B, the Carrier and the Wall rack. The Container A is a paper box for storing finished prototypes. The Container B is used as a temporary storage for the prototypes that are still in use. The carrier is designed for users to carry prototypes around in a decent and safe way. The wall rack is designed for organizing prototypes storage and presenting research outcomes. The design could encourage the users to present and make use of the research outcomes, and noticeably, it could bring different roles involved in the project together. Furthermore, by gathering and organizing information, design engineers could be aware of the situation and have a better understanding of common knowledge.","designs; artifacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

This thesis explains why reusability can be a problem, how importance-weighted active learning removes some of the barriers to reusability and which obstacles still remain. With theoretical arguments and practical demonstrations, this thesis argues that universal reusability is impossible: because every active learning strategy must undersample some areas of the sample space, classifiers that depend on the samples in those areas will learn more from a random sample selection. This thesis describes several reusability experiments with importance-weighted active learning that show the impact of the reusability problem in practice. The experiments confirm that universal reusability does not exist, although in some cases – on some datasets and with some pairs of classifiers – there is sample reusability. This thesis explores the conditions that could guarantee the reusability between two classifiers.","active learning; importance-weighted active learning; sample reusability; importance weighting; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Pattern Recognition Lab","",""

(mentor); Sjoer, E. (mentor)","2012","Op basis van de DNR zou het communicatieproces in de design- en engineeringfase sturing krijgen. Dit blijkt echter niet het geval; projectleiders geven zelf richting aan het communicatieproces. Dit proces bestaat uit verschillende stappen die doorlopen worden om alle informatie definitief te krijgen. In elke stap vindt communicatie plaats. In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar drie aspecten, namelijk: drijvers, BIM in het communicatieproces en de knelpunten die kunnen ontstaan in het communicatieproces. Deze aspecten worden hier dan kort besproken. Het communicatieproces wordt beïnvloed door drijvers (contractafspraken, inkoopafspraken, fasering en fysieke samenstelling van het team). Deze drijvers hebben invloed op verschillende stappen in het proces. In het communicatieproces wordt BIM gebruikt bij een aantal stappen. Vanaf het moment dat informatie gegenereerd wordt is BIM ingezet bij de verschillende cases. Tot het moment dat oplossingen gezocht moeten worden, vonden de stappen plaats met gebruik van BIM. In het communicatieproces kunnen knelpunten ontstaan. Deze knelpunten kunnen om vier verschillende redenen ontstaan: werd over de juiste inhoud gesproken (“wat”), vindt de communicatie plaats tussen de juiste personen( “wie”), vond de stap plaats op het juiste moment (“wanneer”) en werd het juiste middel gebruikt (“hoe”)? In drie stappen zijn frequenter dezelfde knelpunten voorgekomen. Dit is (1) bij het afstemmen van randvoorwaarden, (2) het coördineren van informatie en (3) het oplossen van problemen en het zoeken van een verantwoordelijke. Niet in alle stappen ontstaan echter knelpunten voor alle vier de redenen, “wie”, “wat”, “wanneer” en “hoe”. Dit is alleen het geval bij het coördineren van informatie. Dit komt onder andere door het gebruik van BIM. Naast de knelpunten in de specifieke stappen ontstonden er ook knelpunten gedurende het gehele proces. Veel van de knelpunten gaan iteraties tegen. De iteraties die mogelijk zijn in het communicatieproces zijn nodig voor het ontwerpproces. Wanneer deze worden tegengehouden zullen problemen niet, of te laat naar voren komen. Knelpunten kunnen niet alleen iteraties tegenhouden, maar zij kunnen ook onnodige iteraties veroorzaken. Door verkeerde communicatie kunnen onnodige iteraties ontstaan. Concluderend is in dit onderzoek het communicatieproces in kaart gebracht en vormgegeven, is het proces geanalyseerd op knelpunten en is de rol van BIM in dit proces aan de orde gekomen. De knelpunten in het communicatieproces bieden kansen voor optimalisatie in de toekomst.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-31","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design for construction management","",""

It moves with you like a “flying carpet”. In the previous projects, the RooT concept has already been developed until a first prototype. This first prototype was still a very primitive version of what RooT will become. The first prototype only had the function to test the flying carpet experience in a forward acceleration and deceleration. It is not able to steer. The assignment is to develop a prototype that is able to steer. The functioning of the suspension system must be incorporated in the design. The end product must be a fully functioning prototype that is able to do test drives with test persons. The aesthetics are not the main focus for this assignment, but they will also be taken into account. For getting a deeper understanding in some aspects that where important for the new design, some research was made. This can be found in the Analysis part. From every research area, the conclusions will be summarized. The conclusions will eventually lead to the design brief, this is a list of demands and wishes for the new design on which the new prototype should fulfil. With the Design brief as the basis, the first ideas are drawn as a set of possible Solutions. Parts of these Principle Solutions can be documented into a morphological chart. From this chart, all the best combinations of ideas will be brought together into ideas. The best ideas will be developed into concepts. In the embodiment phase, the final concept will be chosen. First all concept series will be modelled with the help of Working model. The chosen concept series can be equipped with multiple types of steering mechanisms. The best steering mechanism will be chosen. With help of the J-Bike6 software, the chosen steering mechanism will be analyzed. With all the test data from Working Model and J-Bike6 in mind, and the latest design features, the final design could be made. The final design was completely done in Solidworks. The last hand drawings and sketches where made right after the working model tests. In this chapter the final design process is reported. After the design was made, construction started. The building process took a few months and is summarized in the chapter Final Testing and Design. In the final part of this chapter also the driving tests of the new build prototype will be discussed. To continue the project after the graduation, some recommendations are written down that can help improving a possible next prototype. Also the references, and additional information that was not present in this thesis can be found with the help of this chapter.","Electric; Scooter; Mobility; Driving Experience; Prototype; RooT; Novox; Steering Mechanism; Tilting Mechanism; Vehicle Dynamics; J-Bike6; Two wheeler Dynamics; Driving Tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-10-31","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Photolithography is the engineering field where micro-chips are made by creating minuscule patterns on a plate of silicon using light. The patterns are made in a photoactive polymer layer, called a photoresist which was applied to the substrate. These dissolve easily when they are irradiated with light, but resist dissolution during the development process if they were in the shadow. Traditionally, these layers were only a few micrometers thick and only used to create planar patterns. However, recently thick photoresists are getting more attention. In addition, it has also become possible to control the local irradiation accurately enough, such that we can create complex relief-typee3D structures, using grayscale exposure techniques. The potential applications in the field of micro-mechanical devices include micro-sensors and actuators, microoptics and micro-fluidics. Unfortunately, designing the proper light exposure profile and choosing the development time for a specific 3D micro pattern is complicated by the non-linear nature of the processes at hand. Therefore, the most widely used approach is based on trial-and-error designed exposure conditions and manual repair of the design by an engineer. In this research a systematic design approach is developed, based on computational process simulation, associated adjoint sensitivity analysis and optimization techniques. The computationally created designs were fabricated and compared to the desired shape to show the power of this approach.","automated optimization; grayscale masks; 3D micro-structuring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

The ASSET department of the Delft University of Technology uses a concept which consists of a flexible Leading Edge Inflated (LEI) kite, which is connected through a tether to a drum on a ground station. By autonomously flying the kite in crosswind patterns, high tension forces in the tether cause it to be unwound from the drum, this mechanical energy is converted into electricity via a generator. This kite power system has the potential of becoming a new player in the wind energy sector. The development of such systems creates a demand for kite models, which can be used to optimize the performance of tethered wings. By using aeroelastic models, which simulate the Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI), the flight dynamics of a flexible wing can be studied. In this thesis an aerodynamic analysis tool is presented, which can serve as part of a quasi-steady aeroelastic model for kites. The New Tool The Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and 3D panel method were identified as acceptable aerodynamic modeling methods with the best balance between model complexity and computation time. Because the tethered wings in AWE systems mostly y at high angles of attack, close to stall, an extension is implemented. This extension corrects for the non-linear aerodynamic phenomena that occur at high angles of attack. A non-linear potential ow solver is used, where viscous corrections on both lift and drag are implemented by using airfoil data of the analyzed wing. The method combines the capability of a VLM and 3D panel method to incorporate effects of finite, non-planar wings with the capability of viscous airfoil analysis to predict non-linear effects, including stall. The method is implemented in an already existing analysis tool for airfoils, wings and planes, named XFLR5 which is programmed in C++. Several approaches within the method are considered where, with a trade-o_ validation procedure, the method with the best performance is selected. Because the applied corrections in the method largely depend on viscous airfoil data, an investigation is performed on the single membrane airfoils used in LEI kites. Results are compared for high-fidelity 2D CFD simulations, the 2D integral boundary layer panel method XFOIL and an existing polynomial regression model based on single membrane airfoil CFD simulations. The polynomial regression model is considered most promising, though improvements on the current available model could significantly increase accuracy of the non-linear methods. For the chordwise pressure distribution, an approach is given where XFOIL is used on-the-fly.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","In recent years the role of suppliers in the supply chain has shifted. Traditionally, a contract between the organization and a supplier simply prescribed all duties of the involved parties. Nowadays, organizations demand pro-active behavior from their suppliers in order to improve the business relationship in the long term. Many different methods exist for the evaluation of suppliers in terms of performance. These methods mostly cover both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Although, qualitative aspects certainly play a role in business relationships, they have an emotional dimension too. The role of emotion in the evaluation of a supplier may obscure the final verdict regarding the performance of that supplier. Furthermore, in current literature is described that organizations may benefit from stable long term business relationship, especially organizations with a high supply risk. Scholars indicate that for the commitment of these organizations in long term relationship with their suppliers, inter-organizational trust is one of the most important aspects. However, currently no method is found that relates supplier performance directly to inter-organizational trust on solely quantitative grounds. Therefore, this master thesis research has the following objective. “The design of a model which enables organizations to quantitatively evaluate trust relationships with their suppliers.” The model is designed by the input of five procurement experts from industries characterized by a high supply risk. The final model is rooted in fuzzy theory and evaluates the key aspects (i) cost level, (ii) service level, and (iii) quality level by means of several quantitative key performance indicators. The number of key performance indicators for each level is four, four, and three, respectively. The key performance indicators are assigned an individual weight factor by the experts and according to these weight factors a rule base is formulated. The rule base prescribes a (fuzzy) output for the three trust levels, which is called the trust performance. Additionally, the experts have assigned the three trust levels a weight factor, from which a second rule base formulated. The three trust performances are used as input factors for this second layer of the model. The application of the second rule base to these input factors results in the overall trust level for a specific supplier. An organization may rank their suppliers according to their overall trust level and find the current status of their supply base. However, the model primarily enables organizations to identify bottlenecks at suppliers, which need to be at a certain level before committing their selves in long term business relationship with these suppliers. Moreover, the identification of bottlenecks may lead to the establishment of an improvement plan in order to get the supplier at the required trust level. Especially in business environments with a high supply risk an improvement plan is recommended, since organizations often are dependent on certain suppliers. Still, the fuzzy model has its limitations and needs further research. The main focus of this master thesis research project is on the design of the model. The implementation of the model in the business environment is out of scope. Furthermore, the expansion of the pool of experts may reveal similarities and discrepancies between the viewpoints on inter-organizational trust across industries. This helps to fit the model to the characteristics of the different business environments. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis in Matlab and the feedback from the experts indicate satisfactory robustness, correctness, and simplicity for a prototype model with the potential to improve. For example, the focus on testing and training the model against corporate data may result in the design of a data-driven (neuro-) fuzzy model which is capable to adapt to changing environments, like different industries. Nevertheless, this master thesis indicates that the topic does belong on the agenda of both scholars and organizations.","buyer-seller relationships; inter-organizational trust; fuzzy model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Informatie en Communicatie Technologie","",""

In this context the urban design discipline, which is traditionally focused on urbanization and sociology-economical issues, should also incorporate the natural system. The outcome of the project is an urban design for the south of the Rotterdam metropolitan area. The design shows a scenario for this area in which nature and urban regeneration benefit from one another. The starting point of the design is a governmental plan for a water connection ‘the blauwe verbinding’ that responds to several issues regarding nature, recreation and water management.

In what way can urban design create conditions for biodiversity? Different approaches towards this were explored.

(mentor); Van Leuken, T.G.R.M. (mentor)","2012","Navigation systems using pulsar signals have been of great interest ever since the discovery of pulsars in 1967 and various studies were carried out ever since to determine the feasibility of such systems. The successful working of a navigation system using pulsar would mean that spacecraft can maneuver through the deep space with very little help from earth. Another notable aspect of this navigation mechanism is that pulsar signals are available throughout the cosmos, so this sys- tem could be used for a wide range of orbital configurations such as Low Earth Orbits (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Geosta- tionary Orbits (GEO) and Interplanetary orbits enabling a universal navigation system. In this thesis, a software framework has been developed to replicate the environmental setup for a pulsar navigation system. This frame- work can be used to design a high level system design of the pulsar signal processing unit which will be a part of the navigation system. The framework can be used to generate pulsar templates as it can process the raw data from a receiver. The generated templates will be used in the final navigation system in the stages of correlation and detection. The software framework was developed using a very novel system design approach using SystemC-AMS, which consists of C++ classes that felicitate high level system design involving analog and mixed signals. The design approach, implementation, results and limitations of this framework is also presented. Based on the conclusions derived from the framework, a road-map is provided for future development.","Pulsar Navigation; Dispersion; Inter Stellar Medium (ISM); Fast Fourier Transform; Polyphase Filter Bank; SystemC; SystemC-AMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Boelhouwer, P.J. (mentor)","2012","De term Landmark is een veelgebruikt begrip in de stedenbouw. Enkele bekende voorbeelden zijn de Eilffeltoren, Petronas twin-towers en het Opera House in Sydney. In de literatuur zijn er wat discrepanties over de definitie. In dit onderzoek ben ik tot een eigen definitie gekomen: Landmark Buildings zijn iconische gebouwen of objecten die door middel van een afwijkende architectuur een prominente plaats innemen in het stedelijk gebied. Hiermee creëren ze identiteit voor de gebieden waarin ze gelegen zijn. Landmarks kunnen grote positieve effecten op stedelijke gebieden hebben. Deze invloeden staan ook wel bekend als externaliteiten. Volgens de literatuur kunnen Landmark externaliteiten waarde afgeven aan nabijgelegen woningen. Door de financiële crisis van 2008 zijn er minder financiële mogelijkheden vanuit de overheid om te investeren in gebiedsontwikkelingen. Dit is voornamelijk door demografische veranderingen en noodgedwongen bezuinigingen. De investeringen voor deze (her)ontwikkelingen dienen dus vanuit de private sector te komen en om dit aantrekkelijker te maken zal er dus een manier gevonden moeten worden om investeerders aan te trekken. In dit onderzoek heb ik geprobeerd deze positieve externaliteiten voor een tweetal Landmarks te kwantificeren. Een positieve invloed op omliggende woningwaardes zou kunnen bijdragen aan de haalbaarheid van gebiedsontwikkelingen en derhalve interesse van private investeerders. Er werd in dit onderzoek uitgegaan van de volgende hypothese: Externaliteiten (zowel positieve als negatieve) van Landmarks worden gekapitaliseerd in de waarden van het omliggende vastgoed. Op basis van het literatuuronderzoek werd de hoofdvraag als volgt gedefinieerd: In welke mate en onder welke omstandigheden genereren Landmark Buildings externaliteiten en kunnen deze externaliteiten gekwantificeerd worden voor nabijgelegen woningen? Uit het literatuuronderzoek sorteren de deelonderzoeken die zullen bijdragen aan het beantwoorden van de hoofdvraag. Deze zijn: - Welke karakteristieken moeten Landmark Buildings bezitten om positieve externaliteiten af te werpen? - Welk ruimtelijk proces ligt ten grondslag aan deze externaliteiten? Investeerders vinden het vaak lastig om aan deze vooraf gecreëerde identiteit harde Euro’s te koppelen. Internationaal zijn er enkele onderzoeken naar dit onderwerp verricht. Helaas is dit nooit vertaald naar de Nederlandse context. Er is dus een wetenschappelijk hiaat ten aanzien van dit onderwerp. Tevens zijn er in de afgelopen jaren een hoop Landmark initiatieven op financiële gronden afgeblazen (zoals de “Belle van Zuylentoren, de Coolsingeltoren en het Nationaal Historsich Museum). Op zichzelf genomen waren ze dus niet haalbaar, maar op gebiedsniveau (door stijgende vastgoedprijzen) zouden ze wellicht wel haalbaar geweest kunnen zijn.","Landmarks; Externalities; Hedonic; SS-Rotterdam; Erasmusbrug","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-30","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor); Biloria, N. (mentor); Sobota, M. (mentor)","2012","The project deals with the creation of a new train station in Almere Pampus, which is now an empty undeveloped area, included in the Almere 2030 Vision. The first stage included analyses and criticism on the existing proposed context. The city of Almere is a relatively young city and up to today it serves as a “sleeping-city” for Amsterdam, which concentrates a great part of the economy and the services sector, and has a shortage in housing. Consequently the research was oriented towards a way to enhance the mix of functions in the area and reduce the phenomenon of “zoning”. The outcome of these ideas was to design a process of functional growth, which could provide a differentiated, highly connected and optimized urban constellation. This constellation was further evaluated through the development of a series of patterns of evaluation. The development of the design and the process were data-driven, inspired and guided from a variety of input: social, architectural, structural, formal and environmental. The method included a computational approach that embodied input of the relevant architectural intentions from the associating domains. Due to its indigenous nature and technical restrictions, a train station is merely a structural development. Consequently, the results of the structural analyses and evaluations were constantly informing the final configuration. Patterns either as analytical or as synthetic tools were again developed in order to control the variety of possible decisions. The further architectural gestures included a mixture of top-down and bottom-up approaches that represented important decisions for the project. The top-down decisions were for example, the relation between the station infrastructure, its functional and spatial demands and the surroundings. The bottom-up customized approaches refer to the functional distribution, internal circulation and accessibility analyses and the responsive character of the building to the environmental and contextual parameters. The project was developed in a variety of scales; in an adequate extend, from urban and social, to interior. In terms of architecture, the project addressed issues of environmental concerns in its most visible feature: the façade, in order to meet the current and also predict future requirements in respect to energy efficiency. The exterior skin of the building will be a new milieu for the generation of renewable energy. In general, the project contains an integrated and thorough impression of non-standard architecture that elaborates and responds to multi-scalar problems. It contains several levels of investigations evenly distributed among diverse but important fields of architecture.","Non-Standard and Interactive Architecture; hyperbody; train station; computational; pattern; megastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-31","Architecture","Architecture","","Hyperbody Research Group","",""

In fact, the importance of lighting has been extensively studied in material perception. From standpoint of retail design, however, the proper illumination of the products sometimes is overshadowed by atmospheric aspect of lighting. Since most of the consumer purchases are driven by sensory attraction and good feeling, retailers and retail lighting designers need new approaches to evaluate the merchandise appearance, so they can enhance the sensory attraction, and eventually respond to consumer expectations. For many materials and shapes, computer simulation is sufficiently capable of realistic demonstration of the effects of lighting. However, in case of textiles, simulation is too complex and rather inaccurate. This study has attempted to find a practical solution to help retail lighting designers predict the effect of illumination on textile materials. Having a clear overview of the literature and the context, an experimental research framework was developed, and two experiments for acquiring necessary materials for designing a physical probe to diagnose the effect of lighting are carried out.","Material Perception; Apparel Textiles; Retail lighting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Hong Kong is of course one of those global cities belonging to such a growing network. The politics of space comes in when the city needs new built environments. When people work in these spaces, they also require homes, services. In my design project, I will not do a Hong Kong urban space discussion on aerial view which cannot accurately reflect the daily life of urban status. In contrary, I will explore urban space of Hong Kong from microscopic, bottom-up (cultural), and ethnographic-historical points of view. When Hong Kong citizen discover that culture is difficult to be found, the fact is that they cannot see what is there. A kind of developing urban space in Hong Kong which experiences too fast makes people living in old or traditional community almost lose their collective memory and sense of belonging. As a result, my general research question goes to what kind of change was presented by 'urban space meaning' combined with cultural protection in Hong Kong. It is a research on Post-colonial Hong Kong’s urban space and cultural protection under globalization. In order to give a further study on this general research question, I found some problems need to be solved in my selected site after a site analyzing. Here I try my best to keep, or to say protect, two kinds of culture, one is traditional culture that facing disappearing and scattering named wedding-card making, the other is low culture in typical Hong Kong style named street market. Both of these cultures are located in a really high density community. And of course both of them have a close relationship to daily life. According to all mentioned before, my specific problem goes to first How to enhance space quality of communities in WanChai, second how to make interference without breaking community characters on history (Tong Lau) and culture (street market), and third what kind of protection can we make to keep culture on wedding card and avoid culture disappearing. I pay more attention on three important components as follows: street activity, transportation Mode and high density community. All methods of analyzing and problem solving leads to my final design, which will first keep and protect two kinds of culture I mentioned before, and then at the same time better the daily life and space quality of high density community in Wanchai where the two kinds of culture are located.","architecture; culture; history","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-31","Architecture","Architecure Design","","DSD","",""

For achieving a low power solution the digital baseband architecture needs to be carefully optimized to reduce the total power consumption. Particularly for the computationally intensive synchronization phase that detects UWB signals in noisy input data, low-power correlation architectures are crucial. In this thesis, a low power exploration is performed at different levels of abstraction. The architecture of the correlator is designed and optimized to support several modes of operations efficiently. Deviating from a memory dominant design, our improved architecture is based on circular register buffer and a corresponding partitioning method. The impact of biased representation is studied in terms of power and area. The possibility and the influence of voltage reduction is also investigated by changing to the Lvt cells and pipelining the critical path. Our design is implemented and simulated in a Cadence based design flow, targetting 90 nm process technology.

Therefore, the effect of the dynamics of the treadmill’s moving parts on the re-calibration process is not known. In addition, the GRF and CoP accuracy requirements are not known for systems identification and parameter estimation (SIPE) experiments on instrumented treadmills. Here, a technique is described to comprehensively recalibrate a split-belt, instrumented treadmill, while it operates under experimental conditions, for SIPE of the lower extremity dynamics during gait. Re-calibration matrices are created with datasets that were generated under static and experimental treadmill operation and are assessed on validation datasets. No relationship was determined between the treadmill’s dynamics and the GRF and CoP errors. The dynamic re-calibration resulted in lower root-mean-square GRF and CoP errors than the static re-calibration did and was more rapid to calculate. The dynamic re-calibration matrix was additionally validated by performing SIPE of a load on the treadmill, which resulted in a relative error of 2%.","force platform; force plate; calibration; center of pressure; ground reaction force; gait; treadmill; accuracy; motion analysis; optimization; system identification; parameter estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Results show that current residential demand does not match current supply. More three-room dwellings and more apartments are needed. Application of a model called Pyramid model shows how the development of the elderly population influences the increasing demand for convenient dwelling. The model elaborates the convenience of the dwellings by classifying them as one-star, two-star or three-star dwellings. In 2030 a deficiency of 1.650 one-star dwellings is expected for the total market. However 200 less two-star dwellings can be realized. For households aged over 55 with a lower income 800 – 1.550 social two-star dwellings need to be realized by 2030. This can be done either by constructing new dwellings or by upgrading current supply. Since the future development is surrounded by uncertainty it is important to monitor the development of supply and demand by using key figures like the success rate or the residential perspective. For the accomplishment of new supply the municipality has to negotiate performances within the current network of housing associations and look for new partners able to develop part of the required dwellings. Only when the municipality has a land position she has a strong negotiation position to ask for compensation. Also for upgrading the existing social supply the municipality has to negotiate with housing associations. For upgrading the private supply a specific information campaign is needed. A financial incentive can stimulate the upgrading of private dwellings.","housing; elderly; mismatch; steering instrument","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Sustainable Housing Transformations","",""

This thesis proposes an application that can be used as an interface between RDF Gears and users. We introduce a new design of the user interface and new features to improve the usability of RDF Gears. More support for editing nested workflows, query editor, interactive nested node copier and property editor are some of the features that are introduced to improve the usability and the interactivity. RDFGears Function Definition Language is introduced to improve the extensibility of RDF gears engine. Core functions or user defined functions of RDF Gears can be extended without worried of the UI support. We also introduce a type system that implemented in the user interface.

(mentor)","2012","At the heart of physics of fluids are particle distribution functions. If all of these functions of a fluid are known, the state can be fully described. With a universal theory of particle distribution functions, physics of fluids is done. Of particular interest is the radial distribution function (rdf), which is related to the second particle distribution function, because the average excess internal energy, pressure and isothermal compressibility naturally follow from it. Here the function is obtained for `soft' particles by calculating the density profile around a particle fixed in the origin, acting as an external potential. This is called the test-particle method. In order to theoretically describe `soft' particles, the short ranged (repulsive) forces and the long ranged (usually attractive) forces of the interaction potential are separated. The repulsive forces are calculated from a weighted density theory (FMT) and the long ranged forces are added as a `small' perturbation. The FMT has been proven to be accurate, but in order to describe the perturbation well we need to know how particles correlate for larger inter-particle separations in inhomogeneous systems. In particular for inhomogeneous systems it is difficult to say something about this but we can distinguish approximations for high and low densities. The result is a 1D non-linear integral equation with squares, cubes, fractions and logarithms in the weighted form of the unknown for the reference system and a perturbation which is linear in the unknown. The results are satisfactory for high and low densities, but for the intermediate range the results are less satisfactory. For a range of high densities we obtain a measure for the short-ranged correlations by fitting with MD results.","DFT; FMT; correlation function; statistical physics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","Computational Science and Engineering","",""

Novel DES are shifting to polymer-free (PF) drug delivery in order to avoid the problem of late stent thrombosis associated with long term polymer presence in the vessel lumen. The scope of this study was to assess the potential of a microporous layer of TiO2 produced on Nitinol by means of electropolishing followed by plasma electrolytic oxidation (EP+PEO) to act as a PF carrier for 6-mercaptopurine, which is a novel anti-restenotic drug. The surface porosity obtained was characterised and the roughness and hydrophilicy of the samples were measured. The drug has been loaded by spray coating and its release in acidified Phosphate Buffered Saline over a period of 5 days was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained were compared to those obtained from electropolished samples loaded under similar conditions.The findings revealed that EP samples had a drug loading efficiency of 26.8%, a drug reservoir capacity of 18.2?g/cm2 and released 95% of the loaded drug within 10 minutes of immersion. On the other hand, EP+PEO samples, with a surface porosity of about 10%, showed a drug loading efficiency of 41.9%, a drug reservoir capacity of 30.6 ?g/cm2 and released 42% of the drug within 10 minutes and a total of 52% within the 5 day immersion period studied. PEO treated surfaces showed two-phase release kinetics where a short fast release phase was followed by a long-term slow release phase and was therefore modelled by means of a two-phase Fickian diffusion model (r = 0.99866). The preliminary findings of this study indicate that PEO-treated NiTi surfaces have potential as PF drug carrier for DES.","Nitinol; Drug Elution; PEO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Eris, O. (mentor); Steltenpool, M.H. (mentor)","2012","This thesis provides an overview of the results of a graduation project at Shell which was focused on researching Generation Y, those born between the late seventies and mid nineties. Results of the various research stages were subsequently leveraged towards identifying opportunities for Shell in using (digital) technology to reach out to this target group and attract and retain them to the Shell retail brand and stations. This ultimately led to the development of a digital promotion application concept named Shell Deals. The focus of Shell Deals is on offering retail customers rewards and promotions connected to the Shell retail sites while taking into account several key insights on the needs, wants and characteristics of Generation Y motorists. Research in this project focused on three key pillars: the target group Generation Y, Shell (retail) and (digital) technology. First, a Generation Y literature research was performed to create an understanding and feeling for this target group. To understand Generation Y on several levels, a multi-angle approach was taken by studying literature from several fields of study. This initial research gave insights on how Generation Y might differ from previous generations such as the Baby Boom who have been motorists and Shell customers for years. Next, an explorative study was done for (digital) technology trends that could be promising enablers for connecting and engaging with Generation Y consumers. Research on Shell was performed by using internal and external sources and by speaking to key stakeholders within Shell. This gave good insights in the status quo at Shell, what Shell and Shell Retail’s business interests are and how this lines up with the Generation Y motorist. Following these three elements of research, an external approach was taken to deepen the understanding of the target group. Two methods were applied sequentially. First, one-on-one interviews were executed with Generation Y participants. The key focus of these interviews was on comparing several earlier identified Generation Y characteristics externally and on eliciting more information in areas that are specific to this project, such as mobility, social media and smartphones. Second, an online survey across a sample of 105 Generation Y participants was performed. The key focus here was on comparing insights from literature and interviews across a larger sample and on eliciting specific knowledge on key areas actionable towards the end goal of the project. After all stages of research it became apparent that Generation Y has a strong connection with current (digital) technologies and the ubiquitous role they play in daily life. This makes smartphones and mobile communication an excellent tool to connect and interact with them. Furthermore, it was concluded that these consumers are, due to several reasons, more inclined towards instant gratification. Additionally, for several reasons, they have a strong appeal for solutions that are focused on hassle-free interactions for instance through an integrated digital approach. In terms of mobility, it became apparent that cost and convenience are two key influencing factors and are much stronger priorities in this respect than for instance sustainability concerns. Combining key insights from the different research efforts, a total of seven opportunities were identified and defined which Shell could develop in order to attract and retain Generation Y to the Shell retail brand and stations. By creating an assessment framework, the different opportunities could be evaluated equally. These assessments were used as a guide to arrive at a decision on which opportunity to develop further within this project. Eventually the opportunity of creating a direct digital promotion channel for Generation Y was chosen for further development. After a phase of idea generation and selection, the Shell Deals concept was developed. This concept focuses on three main areas: retailer deals and promotions, activity deals and Shell brand and product promotion. Retailer deals and promotions allow retailers, who are often independent in Shell’s operating model, to enter the mobile channel to promote deals and rewards digitally towards customers through the app. Activity deals focus on discounts on 3rd party activities offered by Shell in return for buying Shell fuel. The third main element proposes a multimedia approach leveraging the full potential of modern smartphones to create compelling and engaging information about Shell products that customers can buy at retail sites. The value propositions integrated in the app concept as well as a possible implementation of these propositions were evaluated with participants from the target group using both photographs storyboards and a clickable app interface prototype. Several improvements were made to the concept afterwards. The Shell Deals concept looks after the interests of three key stakeholders: Generation Y motorists, Shell (independent) retailers and Shell. Generation Y motorists benefit because rewards and deals are offered to them in an integrated hassle-free digital solution in an understandable way, saving them money on various items on Shell sites. Shell’s (independent) retailers benefit because the mobile channel is unlocked for them to promote in various ways to customers. This allows them to increase location loyalty and boost fuel and convenience retail sales. Shell benefits because the solution drives customer retention in the long run, activates the brand and actively drives fuel and CR sales. A possible projection of monetary value for Shell was estimated which showed that the concept could be a valuable financial opportunity for Shell. It would be valuable for Shell to extend research on Generation Y motorists in the future across larger and more international samples than in this study. Furthermore, further exploration and development of the identified opportunities and the Shell Deals concept could potentially benefit Shell in strengthening the Shell retail business and its brand.","Generation Y; mobile applications; customer loyalty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-10-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Vreeburg, J.H.G. (mentor); Olsthoorn, T.N. (mentor); Van Riel, W.A.P. (mentor); Beuken, R.H.S. (mentor)","2012","Door verouderende infrastructuren, aankomende vervangingsgolven, verandering in vraag en de steeds drukker wordende ondergrond staan netbeheerders van ondergrondse infrastructuren voor een gezamenlijke uitdaging, waarin de rol van beheer en informatie een prominente plaats heeft. Reageren op basis van storingen wordt hiervoor niet meer als voldoende gezien. Het gevolg hiervan is dat netbeheerders rationeler willen omgaan met het beheer van de netwerken. De manier waarop zij dit (willen) doen is aan de hand van assetmanagement. Assetmanagement is een nieuwe/andere naam voor beheer en zoekt een balans in prestatie, risico en kosten over de gehele levenscyclus van de bedrijfsmiddelen. Aan het nemen van effectieve stuurmaatregelen (beheeracties) zijn een aantal voorwaarden verbonden. Informatie van de omgeving en de infrastructuur is hiervoor cruciaal. Uitwisseling van informatie tussen netbeheerders is op dit moment wettelijk gedreven door de Wet Informatie-uitwisseling Ondergrondse Netwerken, maar dit beperkt zich tot de locatiegegevens voor graafwerkzaamheden. Een andere vorm van informatie-uitwisseling is het delen van de korte termijn planning. Door verdergaande informatie-uitwisseling, worden verdere mogelijkheden gezien voor het beperken van kosten en overlast voor de afnemers van de diensten. Om deze reden is het doel van dit onderzoek een verkenning te maken naar informatie die netbeheerders nu verzamelen en een potentiële meerwaarde te vinden in onderlinge uitwisseling van deze informatie. De meerwaarde is uitgedrukt in mogelijkheden om informatie te delen dat bijdraagt aan het beheer van de netwerken. De beschouwde netwerken in dit onderzoek zijn: drinkwater, riolering, gas, elektriciteit en telecom. Doordat er overeenkomsten worden verwacht in gebruikte materialen voor de netwerken en het feit dat de netwerken zich in dezelfde grondlaag bevinden, wordt in dit onderzoek eenzelfde vorm van informatiebehoefte verwacht voor het beheer van de beschouwde netwerken. De verkenning is uitgevoerd door middel van literatuuronderzoek en interviews. Het literatuuronderzoek geeft een theoretisch kader van de informatiebehoefte van de netwerken en in welke mate netbeheerders daar zichzelf nu in voorzien. In het literatuuronderzoek is een inventarisatie gemaakt van: ? de gebruikte materialen en het aandeel daarvan in de beschouwde infrastructuren. ? de beheerinstanties, de belangen en wettelijke verplichtingen. ? verscheidene benaderingswijzen van beheer en de rol van informatie daarin ? de faalmechanismen van de netwerken. ? de huidige informatie inwinning van de netbeheerders, zowel informatie die zij uit het netwerk halen als uit de omgeving van het netwerk. De interviews zijn voor: ? verdere verdieping van het literatuuronderzoek ? verkenning van de vraag in de praktijk De inventarisatie van de gebruikte materialen en de faalmechanismen van netwerken, laat een overeenkomst in informatiebehoefte zien. Naast graafschade zijn zaken als externe corrosie, belasting door verkeer en wortels, zettingen en druk op vrijwel alle beschouwde infrastructuren van invloed. Informatie over de omgeving is belangrijk voor zowel voor het bepalen van de conditie van de leidingen, de gevolgen van falen, als het afstemmen van werken. Hier worden mogelijkheden tot delen van informatie gezien. Informatie uit het systeem is onderverdeeld in algemene en netwerkspecifieke informatie. Algemeen verzamelde informatie is de registratie van de locatie en van storingen. Door registratie van storingen kunnen analyses uitgevoerd worden op het gedrag van het systeem. Ook kan het aandeel van een specifieke oorzaak van storingen aangetoond worden. Storingsregistratie geeft een objectief beeld van het gedrag van de netwerken. Delen van storingsgegevens kan leiden tot het vinden van relaties in faalgedrag. De ondergrond bindt ons Wouter Bosch © KWR & TU Delft - v - oktober 2012 Netwerkspecifieke informatie-inwinning is onderverdeeld naar: onderzoek naar materiaalgedrag, metingen in de openbare ruimte en bezoeken bij afnemers thuis. Uit de interviews is naar voren gekomen dat op deze drie gebieden naast het uitwisselen van informatie, ook het combineren van werkzaamheden is mogelijk en wenselijk. De interviews hadden een semigestructureerde vorm. Hierdoor kan het zijn dat enkele beschouwde onderdelen diepgang missen. Het resultaat van de interviews is een verkenning van de vraag naar informatie van andere netbeheerders en de aanwezige wil om verder samen te werken. Het resultaat van het onderzoek is een zevental suggesties voor mogelijkheden tot het uitwisselen van informatie, namelijk: 1. gezamenlijk onderzoek naar gemeenschappelijk gebruikte materialen 2. uitwisselen van storingsgegevens 3. verdergaande uitwisseling van basisgegevens 4. informatie over de lokale invloed van de omgeving op de kansen en gevolgen van falen 5. de lange termijn planning 6. het verder combineren van werk in het veld 7. uitwisselen van ervaringen rond de transitie van bouwen naar beheren Op deze gebieden is mogelijke meerwaarde te vinden dat uiteindelijk tot kostenbesparing kan leiden. Dit wordt bereikt doordat er meer informatie over de conditie van de netwerken en de omgeving aanwezig is bij de netbeheerders. Zo kunnen risico’s beter ingeschat worden. Verder worden er mogelijk kosten bespaard en wordt overlast verminderd door het combineren van beheeracties. De belangrijkste aanbeveling van dit onderzoek is om de strekking van dit onderzoek een ochtend of middag in de praktijk te brengen in een zogeheten “basale middag”. Tijdens dit dagdeel kunnen netbeheerders stap voor stap laten zien waar zij dagelijks mee bezig zijn in het besluitvormingsproces en welke informatie zij daarvoor gebruiken. Hierdoor kunnen eventueel nog meer mogelijkheden gevonden worden voor het uitwisselen van informatie. Dit dient op regionaal niveau plaats te vinden.","assetmanagement; asset management; ondergrondse infrastructuren; drinkwaterleidingen; gasleidingen; riolering; conditiebepaling","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

The quay wall and terminal yard are then raised to a level well above mean sea level to insure safety against inundation. The resulting ‘conventional terminal’ requires large volumes of good quality fill material often dredged from the sea which is costly. Royal HaskoningDHV developed the concept of a container terminal with a “polder yard”. The yard would lie below the outside water level and be surrounded by a combined quay wall flood defense structure. A water drainage system is required to drain excess water from the polder. This master thesis investigates the technical and economic feasibility. Important conditions for the feasibility of a polder terminal are low conductive (impermeable) subsoil, which limit the amount of seepage water entering the polder, and high reclamation cost. The polder terminal is technically feasible; a conceptual design is made for a case study in Tuas, Singapore. The ‘polder terminal’ could save 10 to 25% of the total cost (investment and risk) due to the lower reclamation cost. The exact saving depends on the polder depth which is bounded by uplifting failure of the polder yard. The increase in cost due to the risk of inundation and water drainage system is insufficient to counteract the large savings possible. The investments, risk and total cost of both the conventional and polder terminal are shown in the graph, where the minimum total cost of the polder terminal are lower than those of the conventional terminal.","polder; polder terminal; container terminal; flood risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

A proposal was made, that shows how to redirect the strategy of Zagato to the segment of small city vehicles without losing their traditional image. This visual strategic overview shows how the initial requirements of the assignment are met. The research question was: “How should personal city transportation look like in 2016, remaining true to the values of Isetta?” Isetta link The original Isetta was specifically aimed at city use. The car was considered to be the embodiment of the changing movement at the time. In with people wanted to distinguish themselves from the status quo through the youth culture. It resulted in a new vehicle concept which was positioned in between a motorcycle and a car. Nowadays the vehicles in this segment are used for different activities (work, compulsory activities and entertainment). Furthermore the busy city environment has its affect on human behavior inside the car. The daily driving routes are repetitive and therefore their unconscious takes over their driving activity. While doing so the occupant can digest all the things happened in life. This concluded in the domain of the Isetta: Digesting everyday life in European metropolitan areas Research was done in the changes within this domain. These showed people within the domain were subject to an information overload. Leading to accidents in traffic or burn-outs. This led to the desired goal: “I want people to feel stimulated after a routine trip by providing distraction from their train of thought while travelling.” For this to be accomplished the occupants should feel as if they are singing along with their favorite songs. This interaction led to the embodiment of the advanced concept. An intermediate concept was then realized as a step towards this advanced concept. Within this concept several features where included that instigated the intended future use of the vehicle. Since this vehicle is a step in between the original Isetta and the advanced concept, it also needs to relate more to the original. In order to remain coherent throughout the strategy, characters of the vehicles were determined on beforehand and used to accomplish the shift. Certain similarities can be found in the thought of the vehicle compared to the original Isetta. Both vehicles are a step in between a motorcycle and a car, without compromises or existing paradigms on vehicle architectures. The intended future use is determined for the vehicle, this intends for city use specifically, aiming at leisure activities and commuting similar to the original Isetta. Several recommendations are made to further elaborate the technical package and intentions of use.","Automotive; Zagato; Isetta; mobility; vip; advanced; city transportation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Advanced Automotive Design","",""

The question from the Fatboy stakeholders is: Can licensing the Fatboy brand be used to generate extra revenue, as if so, how? Licensing is a form of brand extension that enables a secondary firm to use the name, logo and tone of voice of a brand owner in order to develop, market and sell its own goods in turn for a royalty fee. All within an agreed territory, for an agreed period of time. To be able to provide tailor-made advice, we first examine the Fatboy brand as is. This helps us to understand how licensing could fit their business. In this context, theory is reviewed regarding branding, portfolio extension, and licensing in particular. All to be find in appendix A. Illustrations are provided to compare licensing to other brand extension types (i.e. outsourcing and co-branding). These illustrations (appendix D. and attached poster) include the actor network, value chain, and a criteria flow when to opt for which option. Combining theory with the Fatboy brand objectives, culture, and past experiences, the author advices Fatboy to only use licensing if: New knowhow is needed that is not (yet) available to Fatboy. A distribution channel is needed which is not available and in which Fatboy can not or will not invest. However, in both cases Fatboy should adhere to a strict set of criteria to make a go, no go, decision. Key is whether the new proposition fits the Fatboy brand concept. In case of choosing licensing anyhow, several steps are conducted to set up a proper licensing deal (page 38 and the attached poster) Licensing brings great benefits for companies who want to extend their portfolio with non-core business products without the need for unique design or radical innovation. Part of the Fatboy brand equity are their unique category interpretations and product design. Strict control is therefore recommended should they want to ensure that all brand extensions are designed consistent with the brand values. Moreover, Fatboy should also determine which parts of the value chain they want to control under all circumstances. To do so, Fatboy may consider to always do the concept development and detailing themselves. This implies that a licensee would only produce and distribute the portfolio extension.","brand; licensing; extension; Fatboy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Malan, F. (mentor)","2012","Minimally invasive refixation by cement injection is a novel technique, performed at the Leiden University Medical Center for the revision of failed hip implants. During this procedure, the surgeon inserts needles into the periprosthetic space of the femur, to inject new cement for the fixation of the prosthesis. For that, two intra-operative imaging modalities are used: computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy. Still, this combination is not optimal, because of the inherent disadvantages of both modalities. The surgeons would appreciate a better workflow, to avoid computed tomography intra-operatively and to follow a fluoroscopic-based procedure, only. In striving towards this goal, we implemented HipRFX, an integrated system for planning and guiding minimally invasive refixation. In our planning approach, the surgeon performs the operation virtually, using data from a single pre-operative CT scan. Then, the system uses the information from the plan, to simulate pseudo-fluoroscopic images. These images realistically imitate how the plan would ideally look on the fluoroscopic monitor. Intra-operatively, we propose a stepwise guidance approach. The surgeon uses the two-dimensional simulated radiographs with additional information embedded, as guidelines for the operation. Post-operatively, HipRFX offers cement filling uncertainty visualization, for the assessment of the outcome of the surgery. In order to test our implementation, we conducted a domain expert review, during which we simulated the visual environment of a refixation procedure. Additionally, we performed other user-in-the-loop validations, concerning the user interface design and, especially, cement filling uncertainty visualization. The final evaluation of the HipRFX workflow was an in situ experiment, on 5 cadaver legs. Our main contribution is a first practical investigation of a complete system, to assist orthopedic surgeons in planning, guiding and assessing minimally invasive refixation procedures. This new workflow has advantages over the current approach, where CT and fluoroscopy are combined, but also over a fluoroscopic-only approach. Our system is based on a single pre-operative CT scan and does not require intra-operative scanning, or new hardware. Moreover, we introduced cement filling uncertainty visualization, as a means of post-operative assessment, based on pre-operative information.

(mentor)","2012","In this work a new location fingerprinting-based localization algorithm is proposed for an underwater medium by utilizing ultra-wideband (UWB) signals. In many conventional underwater systems, localization is accomplished by utilizing acoustic waves. On the other hand, electromagnetic waves haven't been employed for underwater localization due to the high attenuation of the signal in water. However, it is possible to use UWB signals for short-range underwater localization. In this work, the feasibility of performing localization for an underwater medium is illustrated by utilizing a location-based fingerprinting approach. Existing algorithms for an indoor environment are evaluated in this project for an underwater medium. These algorithms are based on a neural networks or maximum likelihood estimator. Further, we also consider a classical k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach. In addition, by employing the concept of compressive sampling, we propose a sparsity-based localization approach for which we define a system model exploiting the spatial sparsity. Moreover, a recently proposed grid mismatching algorithm is also adapted to the current localization framework and its performance is evaluated. Finally, the performance of the proposed methods is compared with the existing fingerprinting-based localization approaches.","UWB; fingerprinting-based localization; compressive sampling; sparse recovery; LASSO; OMP; neural networks; maximum likelihood; KNN; WKNN; underwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This paper is based on empirical studies, which reveal doubts on the universal preference of the golden ratio (?) proportion. The empirical study, preceding Gustav Fechner’s publication “Vorschule der Aesthetik” in 1876, was conducted in South Korea, Japan and Germany in order to examine differences on ‘preferences of proportions’ on the golden ratio (?). The research was conducted with 877 subjects between the ages of twenty to fifty in South Korea, Japan and Germany with the question on their preference on proportion showing ten choices of different proportions of rectangles. The data clearly revealed that Koreans and Japanese preference on proportions was 1:1.414, called root ratio (?) and the Germans preference was 1:1.618 known as the golden ratio (?). These results of the experiment contradict previous studies conducted in the Western cultures presenting the universal preferences on proportions on the golden ratio (?). It considers the possibility that ‘preferred proportions’ are different by country. Moreover, proportions are determined by mathematical logic, however ‘preferred proportions’ arise from cultural influences and experience. Therefore, the aspects of this result provide deeper insights of the influence of the design process in specifically on the design form. Within this point of view, the paper continues to examine and analyses various traditional and modern objects and architectural structures in Korea and Japan that exemplify the research results.","proportions; Aesthetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

However, these simulations are computationally intensive and time consuming, which limits this study. High-performance FPGA-based platforms are being utilized to accelerate these simulations. However, the transformation of sequential code to a data flow graph, the scheduling of operations for an efficient use of resources, the generation of hardware description code, the simulation and synthesis are tedious and time consuming tasks. Furthermore, the design space is huge and various scheduling algorithms need to be evaluated based upon variants of area-delay cost metrics to make decisions. An open source tool has been developed at TUDelft to automate this process, which considerably reduces the implementation time. This tool allows us to schedule, plot, explore the design space and generate VHDL code. We have utilized this tool in order to implement in hardware, a detailed neural network model of the inferior olive module in the brain. In order to support the model's mathematical requirements, we have extended the tool with three more operations and added the support for floating-point arithmetic. Based on various cost metrics, two Pareto points were chosen for synthesis. The neural network model was synthesized at the granularity level of 1, 2 and 4 neurons. Performance analysis of the synthesis results shows that, in the best case, we were able to achieve a speedup of 80% over real-time execution for 500 neurons. We have also showed that using smaller neuron cells results in higher speedup and better area utilization.","high-level synthesis; Neural models; FPGA; Scheduling; DFG; VHDL; List; ASAP; ALAP; Pareto points","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","MPSoCs offer more and more processing capability to embedded systems. As a result, an increasing number of applications run on one system, sharing MPSoC resources. Some of these applications are streaming applications and may have real-time demands, e.g., guaranteed throughput, hence their temporal behavior has to be verified at design-time. Moreover, applications may start and stop at run-time, creating a set of use-cases. The interference at shared resources introduces fluctuations in the temporal behavior of applications that may invalidate the results of the design-time verification. The CompSoC platform eliminates this interference by virtualizing shared resources, enabling independent, per-application design and verification. However, currently CompSoC requires that the entire source code to be compiled and linked into one executable. This code may belong to different applications and the developers of these applications have to hence share their source code, which is not always possible due to IP protection issues. Furthermore, resources may be wasted because a core's memory must be sufficient for all applications that ever run there and not only for the most demanding use-case. In this thesis we augment CompSoC with dynamic loading and task migration mechanisms that allow separation of executables per application, enable memory reuse between use-cases, and, in general, increase flexibility, making possible, e.g., workload balancing. We implement this mechanism at application level, hence in a separate system application. This ensures that loading and migration do not interfere with running applications. More precisely, applications have independent temporal behavior from the moment they start until they are paused or stopped. Moreover, the dynamic loading and task migration processes execute in bounded time, thus are predictable, which makes them suitable for streaming applications. We implemented the dynamic loading and task migration on an FPGA prototype of CompSoC. Experiments indicate that that the temporal behavior of a running application is not influenced by dynamic loading and task migration of other applications. We investigate the performance of the dynamic loading process for a jpeg decoder and an image rotation application and we detail the performance overhead involved in task migration. Furthermore, our implementation does not affect the critical operating system execution and the memory footprint overhead is only 4KB.","MPSoC; NoC; Task migration; Dynamic loading; Real-time systems; Composability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Onur, E. (mentor)","2012","Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is used for communication among sensor nodes operating on, in or around the human body in order to monitor vital body parameters and movements. A typical sensor node in WBAN should ensure accurate sensing of the signal from the body, carry out low-level processing of the sensor signal, and wirelessly transmit the processed signal to a local processing unit. One of the main limitations of the WBAN radio receiver at Imec-Holst Centre, is its poor performance in the presence of excessive interference in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. Several WLAN, bluetooth and Zigbee devices are expected to operate in the same band, causing interference to the WBAN system. The ability to tolerate the presence of unacceptable interference in this band is crucial in order to minimize the energy consumption of the WBAN system. By designing suitable spectrum sensing algorithms using network cooperation, all the available spectral holes (white spaces) in this band can be obtained accurately and efficiently, thereby improving interference tolerance level of the WBAN system. This thesis work focuses on developing energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing algorithms, that would enhance the interference tolerance capability of WBAN system in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band. The available spectral holes in this band are expected to be accurately and efficiently obtained by introducing adaptive scheduling techniques in these spectrum sensing algorithms. The challenge lies in designing these algorithms when considering multiple interferer's in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band, since numerous devices of different applications are expected to be operating in close proximity, using the same band. The proposed algorithms are investigated and compared with respect to various sensing parameters including accuracy, efficiency, energy and complexity.","WBAN; Cognitive Radio Network; ISM band; Cooperative Spectrum Sensing; Energy Detection; Multi-Channel Interferers; Sensing Performance; Sequential Sensing; Parallel-Sequential Sensing; Spatial-Temporal Diversity; Hard Decision; Soft Decision; Adaptive Scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dijkstra, J. (mentor); Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor)","2012","In this thesis a method is developed to regain the geotechnical behaviour of undisturbed quick clay by reconstitution of remoulded natural quick clay samples. Quick clay is characterised by a high sensitivity; the ratio between the undisturbed and remoulded strength is very high. Because of the high water content they behave fluid-like after remoulding. As the change of material structure during remoulding is irreversible, a special method is required to rebuild this structure. With such a reconstitution method physical model testing on quick clay can be simplified. Firstly, samples can be reconstituted in any shape without the need of sample disturbing techniques, like sample handling and cutting. Secondly, it decreases the need for expensive in-situ undisturbed sampling, and natural quick clays can be reused for reconstitution. Finally, such an material could be a suitable material to investigate sample disturbance. In this study firstly the geological genesis and geotechnical characteristics of quick clays are discussed, the concept of structure is introduced, and several models to describe the development of sensitivity in quick clays are presented. Furthermore, it is shown that approaching quick clays from a colloid chemical perspective provides a useful framework to understand development and breakdown of structure and sensitivity. The theoretical framework is used to set up an experimental programme. Firstly, the used natural quick clay material is characterised. Hereafter the influence of the depositional environment (influence of mixing methods, water content and varying salinity) and consolidation under self-weight in a geotechnical centrifuge (with varying loading rates and varying sample thickness) are studied. Finally, the influence of leaching (both by diffusion and by application of a hydraulic head in a geotechnical centrifuge) is investigated. Initially, tests are performed on a small scale 14 mm diameter tubes to establish what is the most promising method. This reconstitution method is thereupon tested with 50 mm samples. It is shown that increasing salinity increases the sediment void ratio, both after settling and consolidation at 1-g and 87-g. The loading rate during consolidation appears to be unimportant, because the salt provides structural integrity. This reconstituted salt material has significant strength and behaves only slightly sensitive. However, when compared to the natural material as equal stresses, the undisturbed strength is lower and the remoulded strength higher. As a result of leaching, even when the reconstituted material is carefully leached with an hydraulic head, the undisturbed strength decreases with almost 90%. However, because the remoulded strength is reduced to immeasurably small strengths the sensitivity is increased drastically. It is proven that the flux of water itself does not affect the strength. Therefore these changes should be attributed to the change in salinity. Leaching with a hydraulic head is preferable over leaching by diffusion, because hydraulic head leaching is less time-consuming and the effectiveness of diffusion for development of sensitivity could not be proven in this study. The result of this reconstitution method is a very sensitive and weak clay (c_u = 1.2 kPa, when e = 2.4), which behaves like a quick clay upon remoulding. This low undisturbed strength is the main limitation of the proposed method. However, based on the experimental results it is expected that by adjusting the consolidation conditions the method can be improved. The developed reconstitution method is not tested on physical model scale samples. However, there are no major differences in slurry composition and stress conditions between the performed experiments and reconstitution of such large sample, except for time scaling effects. Therefore is concluded that the method will be feasible for physical model scale samples. The results of this thesis can be used as a starting point for future reconstitution studies. It provides a useful framework, and shows both in a theoretical and experimental way which methods and procedures might be feasible to improve the results.","reconstitution; quick clay; sensitive clay; structure; sensitivity; flocculation; leaching; centrifuge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ten Veldhuis, J.A.E. (mentor)","2012","In deze studie is gekeken naar de invloed van het tijdstip van neerslagpieken op inboedel- en opstalclaims. Deze invloed zou verklaard kunnen worden door de variaties in neerslag over de dag, maar ook de mogelijkheid van mensen om schadebeperkende maatregelen te treffen. Als mensen slapen of niet thuis zijn kan het zijn dat er vaker of meer schade optreed. Hiertoe zijn neerslaggegevens van 26 KNMI-weerstations over een periode van 1992 tot 2010 bekeken, waaruit onafhankelijke buien zijn ge¨extraheerd. Per bui is het uurvak waarin de hoogste intensiteit werd waargenomen aangemerkt als het referentietijdstip van de bui, met een bijbehorende datum en locatie van het weerstation. Per referentietijdstip zijn de verzekeringsgegevens, binnen een straal van 10 km rond het weerstation en van de desbetreffende datum, samengevoegd voor verdere analyse. De gebruikte verzekeringsgegevens zijn het relatieve aantal claims (aantal claims / aantal polissen), gemiddelde claimhoogte (totale claimhoogte / aantal claims) en relatieve claimhoogte (totale claimhoogte / aantal polissen). Uit de analyse van de neerslaggegevens blijkt dat in de zomer ’s ochtends minder neerslagpieken voorkomen. Uurvak 8 (07:00-08:00 UT) bevat met 21% minder dan het daggemiddelde het minste aantal pieken. Deze pieken hebben ook een lagere intensiteit, tijdens uurvak 9 is de gemiddelde intensiteit 16% lager dan het daggemiddelde. In de namiddag komen vaker neerslagpieken voor en deze hebben ook een hogere intensiteit dan het daggemiddelde, respectievelijk 30% en 20%. Voor de winterperiode is ook gevonden dat het aantal pieken ’s ochtends lager (10%, uurvak 9) is en in de namiddag hoger (25%, uurvak 18), maar de intensiteit van deze pieken wijken niet significant af van het gemiddelde. Uit de analyse van de verzekeringsgegevens komt naar voren dat tijdens de zomerperiode het aantal inboedel- en opstalclaims, behorende bij neerslagpieken in de ochtend, lager uitvalt dan het daggemiddelde. Het relatieve aantal inboedelclaims is 38% lager tijdens uurvak 8, voor opstalclaims is dit 33% tijdens uurvak 10. Voor de relatieve claimhoogte is dit respectievelijk 52% tijdens uurvak 7 en 40% tijdens uurvak 8. Dit lag in lijn der verwachting aangezien het gemiddeld gezien minder hard regent in deze periode. Hoewel het in de namiddag gemiddeld harder regent, is dit niet terug te zien in een verhoging in het aantal claims. Voor de winterperiode zijn deze afwijkingen niet gevonden. Voor zowel de zomer- als winterperiode is geen variatie in de tijd gevonden voor de gemiddelde claimhoogte. Op basis van deze studie is niet te zeggen of de mogelijkheid tot het nemen van maatregelen bijdraagd aan het verband, of dat dit alleen op neerslagvariaties berust. Door middel van een andere aanpak in het indentificeren van buien, een betere ruimtelijke resolutie van neerslag, en nauwkeurigere verzekeringsgegevens zou dit in een vervolgonderzoek verder onderzocht kunnen worden.","neerslag; schade","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Gezondheidstechniek","",""

Due to the sheer size and complexity of these datasets, machine-learning approaches, such as predictive models, play an important role in the extraction of knowledge from these datasets. Most biological research is however not primarily concerned with the predictive capabilities of such models, but is, in fact, aimed at gaining insight into the roles and interactions between biological elements in the biological process measured by the dataset. This requires predictive models to be interpretable in terms of the importance of both individual features and feature combinations. Currently however, most predictive models elude interpretation. We present an approach that applies a frequency analysis to the internal structure of trained Random Forest classification models to score and rank features and feature combinations on their estimated importance in the overall classification of the model. The analysis accounts for the presence of correlated features in the dataset by diffusing scores between similar features and feature combinations. An application of the approach to simulated dataset instances was able to rank predictive features and feature combinations in the datasets correctly. The diffusion was found to be essential for the correct analysis of datasets with correlated features. Applying the analysis to a real dataset predicting gene expression (RNA-seq) from chromatin modification features (ChIP-seq) yielded a notable improvement in the interpretability of both individual features and feature combinations. Obtained results were consistent with known roles of the analysed chromatin modifications in the regulation of gene expression.","random forest; chip-seq; histone methylation; interpretation; variable interaction; variable importance; classifier; epigenetic; scale-space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics","","MSc Computer Sciences: Bioinformatics","",""

Through personal in-depth interviews it has been possible to gain insights in the purchase behavior and the satisfaction level of the consumers with the company and the products offered by Dr. Schaer.The outcome of the customer research provides the requirements for the new product concepts. The third phase consists of the external analysis and describes the environment of the company in the Netherlands. In this phase the competitive environment, and the trends and developments within the Dutch food industry are analyzed.This analysis leads to the opportunities and threats for new product concepts. The conclusions of the internal and external analysis and the customer research are summarized and evaluated through a SWOT analysis (phase four). The most relevant factors were selected and compared to each other. The analysis has been used to determine the challenge for which the new product concepts should be developed and leads to the description of the current situation that is used as the starting point for the fifth phase, the idea generation phase.To generate ideas and to come up with new concepts, an adapted ViP approach has been applied.The ViP approach is believed to generate innovative concepts and comprises several steps including different activities. These steps have led to two product concepts with variations, which then have been tested with the consumers through a quantitative research.Therefore, an online questionnaire was developed and published on the Dutch forum for celiacs. Through the analysis it was possible to select one concept which was finally improved based on the outcomes of the quantitative analysis.The last part of the project presents the final product concept and provides advices for the marketing and launch of the product to the company Dr. Schaer.","food industry; special dietary needs; gluten-free food products; customer research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The market for electric guitar is expanding; the instrument itself, being a relatively new one, has scope for evolving further. From market analysis and technical research, the need for an instrument focussed on ergonomics was determined. Rather than competing against major players such as Fender and Gibson, a business strategy that taps a void in the market is proposed. Guitar players tend to be conservative in terms of preference of instruments; any radical change in the design of the instrument involves a lot of risk. However, an attachment that helps overcome any ergonomic limitations of the instrument offers market potential. It offers a low cost alternative to buying expensive custom guitars that fit the body better. So, it is also important that the attachment works well with existing guitars. The design will provide more freedom to the user in various playing scenarios such as two handed tapping, percussive playing etc. by allowing the instrument to be manoeuvred during the act of playing. Hence, the scope of the assignment encompasses designing, prototyping and testing an ergonomic attachment to evaluate acceptance of ergonomic designs in musical instruments amongst users. This design could be the blue print for a next generation instrument.","applied ergonomics; electric guitar; zero gravity; weight balancing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Supercritical CO2 (s-CO2) Brayton power plants present advantages like the possibility of using external thermal energy sources (concentrated solar radiation or biomass combustion), high conversion efficiency at moderate temperatures, and possibly low operational and investment costs. This work stemmed from the observation that the optimization of the thermodynamic cycle and the design of the system components can be integrated into a single calculation procedure, which can be subjected to an automated constrained optimization process. The objective of this work is therefore to perform a preliminary assessment of the envisaged methodology. First, the thermodynamic analysis is performed and consists in the study of three s-CO2 power cycle configurations. The thermal efficiency is prescribed to 50% with a power output of 18.7 MW respectively. The effect of the components operation on the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and regeneration load is studied. The recompression Brayton cycle configuration allows to comply with the specified performance with the lowest turbine inlet temperature (787 C) and at moderate maximum pressure (272 bar). The operating conditions given by this analysis are used as inputs for the design of the regenerator and the cooler. The models of these heat exchangers are validated against the design and performance data of an existing s-CO2 heat exchanger, and well-known commercial design code. The methodology that combines the thermodynamic analysis and the components design is tested with two study cases. The first one is aimed as a first assessment of the adoption of a s-CO2 closed Brayton gas turbine for aircraft propulsion. The s-CO2 power system is designed such that it exceeds the performance rating of a cutting-edge turbofan, and at the same time the weight of the system is decreased as much as possible. The calculations show that the regenerators have a weight of minimum 5 tonne, which is almost the weight of the reference engine. The second study case regards the design of a power plant using a solar tower power as the heater, with the same power output and efficiency as the ones adopted for the thermodynamic analysis (18.7 MW, 50%). This exercise provides key characteristics of the power plant: 636 heliostats that occupy an area of 300 m2, the regenerators weigh 17 tonne, the dry cooler also 17 tonne, TIT is 647 C, and the compressor discharge pressure is 245 bar.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","Energy Technology (SPET)","",""

A series of workshops with the SD&I managers was conducted to identify the reasons that are currently keeping them from initiating more ideas. Currently the focus of the team is still very short-term and internally orientated. By generating a external focus and projecting this to the future a long-term orientation can be created. The process that has been developed in order to create this long-term orientation is called Looping Forward.

(mentor)","2012","Because the amount of knowledge in the engineering domain nowadays is huge, while being opaque, heterogeneous, distributed and informal at the same time, it is incredibly time-consuming for an engineer to find the knowledge (s)he is looking for and to reuse that knowledge. Furthermore, the amount of knowledge is growing exponentially, while the amount of qualified engineers is decreasing. To increase resource effectiveness and enable engineers to focus on what they do best (come up with creative design solutions) these time-consuming and non-creative tasks need to be removed from the engineer’s plate. This study set out to investigate and offer solutions to the issue of knowledge reuse relating to the knowledge contained in engineering rules, in context of a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) based Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) framework, called the Integrated Design and Engineering Engine (IDEE). This research has investigated the different rule types that are required for capturing engineering rules. It was shown that these can be captured by a production rule language. To formally capture this knowledge, this research has identified the available technologies and based on this, extended the ontology based Knowledge Representation Model (KRM) of the IDEE with the production rule language RIF-PRD. Engineering rules are integrated into the KRM by means of a rule ontology that embeds the RIF-PRD expression. It was found that expressing formulas would benefit from an additional extension, which was added in the form of the mathematical language Content MathML. Formulas expressed in Content MathML are embedded into RIF-PRD. To increase the effectiveness of the IDEE approach, an implementation has been created by the author that provides the means to capture and reuse engineering rules in a more user-friendly way; from the point of informal capture to the generation of KBE application code usable by a KBE system, and the generation of process workflows usable by Simulation Work Flow Management (SWFM) tools. In addition, the implementation incorporates a reasoning engine in the form of elREy. This provides the IDEE with reasoning capabilities, used for instance to instantiate workflows. From the use cases it became apparent that all identified engineering rules were able to be captured by the extended KRM via the implementation. The implementation facilitated the modeling considerable. Because of the guidance the user gets, it is even for beginning rule modelers impossible to make a syntax error. For experienced programmers, the semi-graphical modeling might go somewhat slower, though, also due to annotation steps, but the value this brings in return is huge. The annotation provides so much information regarding origin, author, explanations, etc. that it makes the rules and the rationale easy to understand, even long after the creation of the knowledge. Because rules are stored separately they can be managed easily and directly linked to. Due to the capture of the semantics the knowledge contained in rules is easy to find, update and reuse, saving time (and money). Moreover, non-creative tasks carried out in order to reuse knowledge can be automated (e.g. generation of a KBE application). In addition, rules are platform independent and centrally stored, making sure that the knowledge they contain will not be lost and one consistent model is used in the entire framework.","Knowledge Based Engineering; KBE; knowledge engineering; engineering design framework; rule; engineering rule; reasoning engine; semantic; RIF; Rule Interchange Format; MathML; RDF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

For the purposes of this thesis a goal of up to four times the initial throughput was set, on the Range Trie for address lookups. Various partitioning configurations were examined to determine the most advantageous one for performance and feasibility. Apart from throughput, partitioning proved to be beneficial also for power. Synopsys tools were used to synthesize the design along with a UMC 90nm process. Power figures were extracted for a variety of configurations for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, up to 16M prefixes large.

Zij ondervindt het probleem dat de leverbetrouwbaarheid van het bedrijf te laag is. De onderzoeksvraag luidt waarom SGS een lage leverbetrouwbaarheid heeft en wat er zal moeten veranderen om de leverbetrouwbaarheid significant te verbeteren. Om deze vraag te beantwoorden is aan de hand van de Delft Systems Approach een analyse uitgevoerd en wordt er een oplossing aangedragen om de leverbetrouwbaarheid te vergroten. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de leverbetrouwbaarheid van Stork Gears & Services gemiddeld 54% bedraagt, waarmee de gestreefde leverbetrouwbaarheid van tenminste 85% niet wordt gehaald. Deze lage leverbetrouwbaarheid is een probleem in de beheersing van het proces. Het blijkt dat de evaluerende functie van de planningsfunctie bij SGS ontbreekt, waardoor de afgegeven planning en de normen waarmee gepland wordt, niet geevalueerd of indien nodig bijgesteld worden. Hierdoor kan niet worden voorkomen dat de afgegeven planning onhaalbaar is. Anders omschreven blijkt het systeem van SGS niet zodanig te zijn ingericht, dat het in staat is er voor te zorgen dat de opgestelde planning altijd realistisch/haalbaar is. Op basis van kwantitatieve data uit het informatiesysteem van SGS blijkt dat in de praktijk ook regelmatig voorkomt dat in elk geval de planning die wordt afgegeven aan de machinale afdeling, daadwerkelijk onhaalbaar is. Hierdoor is het onmogelijk het proces van de uitvoering bij SGS volledig te beheersen en dat van de productieafdelingen te vragen. Oftewel, doordat de planning van de productieafdelingen nu geregeld onhaalbaar is, is het voor SGS onmogelijk om altijd op tijd te leveren en worden bovendien verscheidene andere problemen veroorzaakt. Overige oorzaken van levertijdsoverschrijdingen, bijvoorbeeld ten gevolge van kwaliteitsfouten in zowel de product- als informatiestromen, worden bij SGS momenteel bestudeerd en aangepakt in verbeterprojecten.

(mentor)","2012","Artificial wetlands are used at different locations in the world as a treatment facility for wastewater of different composition. In order of Rijkswaterstaat several artificial wetlands are constructed for road runoff treatment. In all cases the artificial wetland is preceded by a sedimentation basin / storage buffer. One of them is located along the A1 near ‘t Gooi. A research on the purification efficiency of this wetland shows higher metal concentrations in the effluent in wintertime (Tromp, Helofyteninfiltratiesystemen voor zuivering wegwater, 2005). This is probably due to de-icing salts. The given solution is to bypass the artificial wetland in wintertime to avoid metal flush out. This research strives to deepen the insight into metal mobilisation in artificial wetlands under the influence of de-icing salts. The main question of this research is worded: “What is the influence of de-icing salts on the remobilization of heavy metals in an artificial wetland?” For this research six artificial wetlands located at traffic junction Raasdorp, A5 and A9, are available for measurements. Visual inspection reduced this amount to one due to various deficiencies in the other five. This resulted in a sub question: Does the filter function hydraulically as it is designed for? By use of a water balance, visual inspection and gathered data by use of divers an indication of the hydraulic functioning is made. Since high iron concentrations were measured it is concluded that groundwater is leaking into the artificial wetland. The other option, iron is leaching out of the filter substrate, is rejected by the column test results. Here the iron concentrations are decreasing which should not be the case if it is originating from the substrate. Artificial wetlands are characterised by enhancement of treatment performances because of the presence of vegetation. The main processes which are introduced by vegetation are summarized by the term phytoremediation. Vegetation is able to bind heavy metals in the root zone and also storing them into their biomass. To get insight into the heavy metal concentrations in several parts of the treatment facility water samples were took. The question in relation to the water samples is: “Do heavy metals and PAH occur in the influent of the artificial wetland and is there a difference with the effluent of the artificial wetland?”. Elevated levels for heavy metals were observed at the influent of sedimentation basin and artificial wetland. The highest concentrations were measured for copper and zinc. The other four measured heavy metals were: cadmium, chrome, nickel and lead. These metals did not show significant higher concentrations. In most cases here, the concentration was below the detection limits of the laboratory analysis.PAHs were also measured but in most cases the concentrations were below the detection limits of the laboratory analysis. Because of this less attention is paid to the behaviour of PAHs in comparison to heavy metals. The results of the measurements display a pattern where in general the pollutant concentrations are highest in the influent of the sedimentation basin, followed by the influent of the artificial wetland. The lowest concentrations were in general measured in the effluent of the artificial wetland. This proves the expected behaviour of the treatment facility. The goal of measuring the conductivity at location is to get an answer onto the following question: “Can the presence and movement of de-icing salts be quantified and evaluated based on the measured conductivity into the treatment facility?”. An increase of dissolved salt causes an increase of the conductivity. In wintertime rise of the conductivity in the treatment facility was measured and the results are providing insight in the movement of deicing salt through an artificial wetland. As a last step a column test is carried out to investigate the influence of de-icing salt on a possible flush out of heavy metals. The column test is filled with a soil sample what is took out of the original artificial wetland. Four different runs are carried out where for each consecutive run the de-icing salt concentration in the influent is increased. The question on which an answer should be found here is: “Is for the column test effluent an increase of heavy metal concentrations measured by increasing conductivity of the influent per run?”. The results of the column test did not show the expected increase of heavy metal concentrations into the effluent of each run. The first two runs did show elevated concentrations of copper and zinc but for the last two runs concentrations were considerably lower. For the third run an significant elevated concentration of lead is measured where this concentration is for the other three runs near the detection boundary. The effluent of the fourth run should according to the hypothesis contain the largest heavy metal concentrations, but this was not the case. The measured concentrations of the de-icing salt related ions did show the expected behaviour for the four runs. The concentrations in the effluent were increasing for each consecutive run as was also expected based on the conductivity measurements.","artificial wetland; heavy metals; de-icing salt; remobilization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

We introduced the wedge concept, which consists of a patient-specific wedge and two screws. Two different experimental evaluation methods were used to assess the concept. Finite element modelling was used to determine the angle of screw insertion with the highest possible failure load. Physical wedge fixation experiments were used to investigate the effects of shear on the errors of the 6 correction parameters (3 translation, 3 rotations). If screws with an insertion angle of 10 degrees are used for the fixation of the wedge to the bone, the wedge concepts satisfies all demands and requirements. Additionally, the repositioning errors of the wedge concept were lower than other fixation technique studies for corrective distal radius osteotomies.","corrective osteotomy; distal radius; wedge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

One trend for automotive electronics design is pursuing higher level integration. System level integrated circuits are needed to simplify the automotive electronics design and increase the reliability of automobiles. In this thesis, a prototype of linear voltage regulator is designed for system level integration. Instead of conventional PMOS linear regulator topology, a NMOS power transistor is chosen as the pass device on considerations of smaller silicon area and better dynamic performance. The characteristic differences of PMOS and NMOS linear regulators are analyzed. Based on the frequency behavior analysis of these two types of regulators, a frequency compensation scheme for the NMOS linear regulator is purposed in this thesis. This purposed scheme is able to accommodate the wide frequency variation of the NMOS linear regulator output pole. The effectiveness of frequency compensation is examined by both mathematical modeling and transistor level simulation. The over-current protection of the NMOS linear regulator is also designed, which is realized by applying another current regulation loop to the voltage regulator. This NMOS linear regulator is able to maintain a constant output current around 250mA in over-current protection scenario. Compared to the existing PMOS linear regulator counterpart, the off-chip ceramic capacitor of this NMOS linear regulator can be reduced to 220nF (10x smaller) without sacrificing the ±2% output voltage accuracy within -40C~175C. The regulator quiescent current at no current load scenario is 12?A. Owing to the introduction of adaptive biasing scheme, the maximum quiescent current is 1.31mA. This adaptive biasing only degrades the current efficiency by maximum 4%. At the end of the thesis, possible maximum load current and external capacitor scaling abilities of this NMOS linear regulator are discussed.","NMOS; Linear Regulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2012","The commercial aviation industry is a very competitive market. KLM is struggling with the difficult economic climate due to ever climbing fuel prices and the results of the global- and euro financial crises. Yet KLM wishes to become the best service oriented airline in the world, as a way to stay competitive in the current and future market. As part of the overall inflight service, the passengers on each KLM-flight are offered catering services during the flight. The sort and amount of services depend on the flight length, the time of day of the flight, the destination and the booked class. For European flights (EUR), the entire catering load for both the outbound- and homebound flight can be loaded at KLM’s main hub, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. However, for the much longer intercontinental flights (ICA) this is not possible. This means that the catering load for the homebound flight must be prepared and loaded at the outstation (a destination where catering activities occur). KLM has a contract with a caterer at the outstation, which encompasses the responsibilities concerning loading of the homebound flights, responsibilities concerning the local inventory management and responsibilities concerning the preparation of business class meals. Because KLM wishes to serve the same products on each flight, there is a need to distribute catering products to the 58 outstations. N.B. In this context the same product means that for instance the same sort of soda can is used for a specific soda, not that the entire catering product is the same on each flight. Cabin Inflight Management is the department that is responsible for the catering activities of KLM. The product portfolio for the three different product groups (1) World Business Class (WBC), (2) the intercontinental economy class (ICA-M) and (3) European (EUR) is developed and maintained by the sub department Product Management. The operational management of the product portfolio is the responsibility of the sub department Network Supply Management (NSM). Therefore, NSM is responsible for the actual ordering and distribution of the catering articles. KLM has chosen to have a central warehouse at Schiphol Noord and distribute the catering articles to the outstations from the central warehouse. The distribution of articles to the outstations is done either by sea freight, airfreight or by pantry outfits. The most important performance indicators are defined as the reliability of the inventory, the quality and the costs. However, there is neither absolute and objective knowledge about the performance concerning these indicators nor knowledge about the possibilities to influence these important process parameters in a controlled manner. Given the difficulties KLM faces, it is important to realize cost savings by improving the efficiency of the company, while maintaining or even improving the satisfaction rate of customers. Therefore, the need for objective information about the performance of the distribution network and the ways to influence the performance is evident...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The potential of flapping wings lies in their efficiency at small scales and their large flight envelope with a single configuration. They have the possibility of performing both energy efficient long distance flights as well as hovering flights. Most studies on Flapping Wing MAVs (FWMAVs) have focused on the design of the airframe and making them able to fly. Currently, the state-of-the-art permits investigation of the necessary autonomous flight capabilities of FWMAVs. Most previous studies have made important preliminary steps by using external cameras or an onboard camera with the FWMAV flying in a modified environment. However, since autonomy is most useful for flight in unknown areas, it will be necessary to use an onboard camera while flying in unmodified environments. Research in this direction has been performed on the DelFly. In particular, the well-known cue of optic flow was found to be rather unreliable for the determination of 3D distances, and it was complemented by a novel visual appearance cue. Since the combination of these cues may still not be sufficient for robust and long-term obstacle avoidance, this study focuses on a different well-known method to extract 3D information on the environment: stereo vision. The potential advantage of stereo vision over optic flow is that it can provide instantaneous distance estimates, implying a reduced dependence on the complex camera movements during flapping flight. The goal is to employ stereo vision in a computationally efficient way in order to achieve obstacle avoidance. The focus of this study is on using heading control for this task. Four main contributions are made: The first contribution comprises an extensive study on literature in the field of computational stereo vision. This research has been done for decades and a lot of methods were developed. These mainly focus on optimizing the quality of the results, while disregarding computational complexity. In this study the focus was on finding one or more time efficient methods that give sufficient quality to perform robust obstacle avoidance. It was concluded that Semi-Global Matching is a good candidate. The second contribution is that for the first time it has been investigated what the requirements are for a stereo vision system to do successful stereo vision-based obstacle avoidance on FWMAVs. In order to achieve accurate stereo vision results, both hardware and software aspects are found to be of importance. FWMAVs can carry only a small amount of payload and therefore there is a large restriction on sensor weight. The third contribution is the development of a systematical way to use the 3D information extracted by the stereo vision algorithm in order to find a guaranteed collision-free flight path. The focus was on dealing with the limited maneuverability of the MAV and the limited view angle of the camera. The fourth contribution is in giving an indication on the usefulness of stereo vision based on multiple experiments. These focus on determining the accuracy of the obstacle detection method as well as on validating the functionality of the obstacle avoidance strategy. The designed system proved to be successful for the task of obstacle avoidance with FWMAVs. The DelFly II successfully avoided the walls in an indoor office space of 7.3×8.2m for more than 72 seconds. This is a considerable improvement over previous monocular solutions. Since even reasonable obstacle detection could be performed for low-textured white walls, the experiments clearly show the potential of stereo vision for obstacle avoidance of FWMAVs. In combination with existing methods for speed and height control the proposed system has the potential of making fully autonomous (flapping wing) MAVs possible.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The purpose of this 28 week research and design project, was to design a series of interactions (suitable for children aged 4 -6) that together formed the behaviour of MyRo. These interactions consist of a relationship between the available input and output possibilities; predetermined by the technology in the MyRo prototype developed thus far by WittyWorX. The input possibilities of MyRo were: detection of movements, sounds and touch. The output possibilities of MyRo were: dynamic eye animations, sounds, and body movements. The designed interactions based on this input/output relationship, were aimed to stimulate the emergence of an intuitive and natural relationship between users and MyRo and to provide possibilities for open ended play. My aim was to provide children the freedom to create their own games revolving around the behavioural characteristics of MyRo. The overall structure of this project followed a ‘design for research’ process. Research questions were formulated, tested and evaluated with over 30 participants along 4 user studies (De School Met De Bijbel, Benthuizen and Korein Kinderplein, Eindhoven), each with a dedicated protoype design. The designs of the interactions evolved along design cycles on basis of the results derived from the dedicated user studies that preceded. Initially a thorough analysis was made to form the basis of this design project. The findings in this analysis covered; MyRo’s purpose, technical aspects, interactive properties, consumers, competitors, current trends, and the user, which together formed the basis of the design goal and design direction that were formulated. The design direction focused on providing and stimulating open ended as well as child directed play between user and MyRo; more specifically Free Play and Guided Play. This direction was narrowed down to focus only on the Free Play aspect of MyRo. Based on this direction, conceptualizations were initiated along 4 design cycles to design and improve a Free Play framework with focus on Free Play and open ended play. A Free Play framework was designed that consisted of nine unique and distinguishable emotions/ states that together formed the behaviour of MyRo. The emotions and states included in this framework were: Idle, Bored, Sleep, Loving, Fearful, Frustrated, Grudge, Sad and Excited. This framework was tested on participants in both virtual and tangible prototypes. The findings in this research were distributed amongst 4 areas; (1) Gameplay possibilities and social interaction patterns (2) Learning perspectives (3) Fun factor (4) Users’ understanding of the designed dynamics. Each of these categories had their own dedicated research questions and were used to guide user study setups and the evaluations made thereafter. Results from user studies indicate that the interactivity provided is generally enjoyed, and easily understood by participants. Out of the available input possibilities in the Free Play framework, participants enjoy ’teasing’ MyRo the most. On the other hand, MyRo has shown to stimulate both violent behaviour and nurturance between various participants and MyRo. This conflict between participants’ interests generates minor conflicts and a possibility for children to become more aware of their actions and consider other’s perspectives over time. The Free Play framework provides various game play patterns such as Multiple individuals vs. game, cooperative play and team competition and indicates that more game play and interaction patterns are likely to emerge over time. MyRo is currently a concept that is under development by WittyWorX. Until the beginning of this project, little design and development had been achieved in forming its behaviour. The significance of the completed research is to convince WittyWorX of the relevance of implementing natural and meaningful interactivity that promotes Free Play interaction and open ended gameplay possibilities.","Interactive; Robot; Open ended Play; Free Play; Guided Play","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-10-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Conceptualization and Communication","","","",""

If software developers don’t properly share their architectural knowledge with team members, the team will act based on an incomplete or even possibly incorrect view on the code base, and this can lead to architectural degradation. Recently there has been a surge of collaboration, communication and sharing with the advent of Web 2.0 applications. In this thesis we have investigated how Web 2.0 can be used to support software architecture management. In particular in the area of architecture documentation, architecture retrieval, and collaboration. We created an approach which applies Web 2.0 concepts such as traceability, integration, usability, navigability, and user experience, to software architecture management. This approach is supported by a prototype tool called ArchWiki, which has features such as traceability between different artifacts (e.g. source code, architectural diagrams, architectural documentation), context-sensitive views, hyperlinks, notifications, tags, and bookmarks. We performed an initial evaluation study to assess ArchWiki. In this study we found that Web 2.0 has the potential to support software architecture knowledge management.","Software Architecture; ArchWiki; Web 2.0; Collaboration; Architecture Knowledge Management; Program comprehension; Traceability; Awareness; Software evolution; Wiki; Notifications; Documentation; Context-sensitive; User Centric; Integration; The Long Tail; Social Experience; Meta Data; Action Tracking; Sharing; Usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering","",""

The conclusion of this study for the safety of retainer wires is the following. Short wires up to 32 mm can be considered RF safe for a clinical 7 tesla MR head scan. Longer wires are not always RF safe. A solution to heating due to longer wires is to fully cover the wire with a non conductive spacer such as a silicone sports mouth guard to ensure RF safety.

(mentor); Albayrak, A. (mentor)","2012","Pacemaker leads transfer an electrical signal from the pacemaker or internal defibrillator cardioverter (ICD) to the heart and the leads measure the electrical activity as well. The pacemaker or ICD processes the feedback to determine when a signal needs to be transferred. Pacemaker leads can be placed via the endovascular approach and the epicardial approach and leads can be placed at either the endocardium or the epicardium. Research points out that lead placement at the endocardium is favorite since then the pacing lead will be close to the electric guiding path. However the endovascular- and the common epicardial approaches possess some drawbacks. Therefore a literature study has been carried out which shows that the transapical approach is an interesting approach to use as starting point for the development of a pacemaker lead insertion device. This resulted in the following design statement, which has been the start of the design process: Design a device which is able to insert a pacemaker lead via the apex, while not harming tissue and any adjacent organs. The device should make sure that the surgeon places the lead(s) on the right spot. A minimal amount of movements may be needed to perform this procedure. Efficient and effective are the keyword of this procedure. During the design of this device, first there was focused on the main features of the device by creating a morphological overview of all possible (sub) solutions. Later on during the process, the usages has been included in the design and a focus group, which existed of cardiothoracic surgeons, has been used to gather insights. At the end of the design process, a prototype was established which meets the demands which were set before. The prototype test gave furthermore interesting results which are used for the recommendations. This process can be seen as a first step to a innovatory product. In order to reach that level, multiple processes like this are necessary.","Medisign; pacemaker leads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-10-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor)","2012","Transnational transmission presents a possible source of income for power producers and a way to decrease costs for consumers. The difference in neighboring countries' market prices encourages traders to profit from it by selling cheaper electricity in the market that has price it higher. Since the parties that own the transmission (TSOs) lines cannot generally participate in the market by regulation, they must allocate the Rights to transport electricity through transnational lines. Parties interested in these rights are usually power producers and other market agents seeking to exploit the rents that come from the price differences. Even though the auctioning of Transmission Rights (TRs) is not motivated by commercial interest, these rights have a commercial value. Then the issue becomes finding a way of valuing the asset according to benefits that it will generate in the future. One problem to deal with, consists in assessing how the agents in the system can hedge against the potential impact of transmission capacity constraints. Two simple ways to hedge against transmission congestion risk are the so-called Financial Transmission Right FTR one hand and the Physical Transmission Right PTR on the other. Both of them could be treated as financial instruments (options). In order to hedge the risk of a PTR an option pricing model can be used. Herein, for the particular case of France and Spain Interconnection was used the Margrabe formula for the exchange option with stochastic volatility by diagonal BEKK models. The model used here has a lot of properties that make it suitable for pricing it as a option, but also has some assumptions that usually don't hold in electricity prices. A more detailed study of the methodology could provide a tailored solution to this valuation problem. The model proposed by Cartea y González-Pedraz (2010), could be extended to the valuation of transmission rights and become able to price the option with zero strike price. This kind of model to derive a closed-form solution that allows for stochastic volatility has proven very difficult.","Transmission rights; Interconection Value; GARCH; Stochastic Volatility; Option Pricing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis EMIN","",""

Our results reveal that relevant content used to estimate expertise scores should be selected on the basis of both full-content and tags. Due to the sparsity of CF appreciation data in the dataset, EI strategies that complement content relevance scoring with appreciation scoring for the estimation of expertise scores, perform equally well as strategies based only on content relevance, in terms of ranked lists of experts. As such, we recommend that future work retests the EI strategies with the constructed prototype, using an ESM dataset that contains more CF appreciation data.

(mentor); Bakker, H.L.M. (mentor); Mooi, H.G. (mentor)","2012","Project management has always been an interesting topic and has received much attention, not only because of the method but also in its application. It has been observed that in literature ‘mega-projects’ receive much attention while little is written about small projects. There can be several reasons for this, but it is believe that this is mainly due to the idea that the project management practices can be used for any project, occasionally leaving some prescribed project activities out or by using a scaled version of the activity when applied to small projects. The developed project management bodies of knowledge provide guidelines for project execution. These guidelines are referred to as ‘traditional’ project management practices, as they are focusing on planning and controlling the project. Traditional project management approaches are based on a predictable, fixed and relative simple model with little focus on behavioral and complexity aspects. Nowadays, environments are much more dynamic compared to the environment where the traditional project management approach was developed. Adaptive project management can be seen as a derivative of traditional project management but is less focused on tasks and activities but more on a strategy-based management approach to achieve maximal benefit of the project. Adaptive project management is of importance for the smaller projects, because the project management approaches can be too cumbersome for this kind of projects. Adaptive project management is not in conflict with traditional project management, but it ensures that the activities used are made fit for purpose towards the project. Royal Dutch Shell has developed a project manual for downstream projects with expenditures over USD 100 million. This manual is also used for the smaller projects at the refinery of Shell Pernis but the question is whether this improves or hinders the efficient execution of small projects. The goal of this thesis is to investigate and contribute to knowledge on project management for small projects and to provide recommendations for the current situation for small projects at Shell Pernis. To reach this goal, a qualitative research study at Shell Pernis was carried out. The research started with exploratory interviews as there was little specific knowledge on the topic available. These exploratory interviews led to the identification of four themes: project classification, fit for purpose execution, project team and front end development. These themes refer to possible improvement areas for the execution of small projects. Literature review was provided to define the themes in more detail and to compare the project management approach of Shell (called Opportunity Realization Manual - ORM) with the information found in literature. The following step was to identify possible issues that were not apparent from the literature study and comparison with the ORM. This is done via surveys, in-depth interviews and project data. The data is analyzed and ranked to find the most important issues that influence fit for purpose execution of small projects. Improving these issues is likely to increase fit for purpose execution. Fit for purpose is used to describe that sufficient and efficient effort must be undertaken in order to reach a goal successfully. The top six issues that were identified are: 1. Difficult cooperation between stakeholders 2. Unclear tasks and responsibilities of team members 3. Different performance indicators per stakeholder group 4. The usage of the same project structure for every project 5. The lack of a good and complete scope definition 6. The business model of the engineering contractor and the communication with Shell In order to prevent these issues from occurring, the following minimal requirements are identified in order to enable fit for purpose execution of small projects:  Project team formation and integration  Focus on contracting and procurement  Stakeholder management  Usage of a project assurance plan  Scheduling (including ‘the way forward’ of a project)  Opportunity framing for proper scope development (including lessons learned)  Risk management","small projects; project management; fit for purpose execution of projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

Contributing roughly one third to the total submarine weight, these hulls provide a watertight envelope that must bear the hydrostatic external load. The design of such a structure can be complex as the whole submarine has to reach neutral buoyancy. Hence, the addition of structural hydrostatic load bearing capacity is not a straightforward operation. Increase of structural weight is not an option as it decreases the weight budget of the payload, engine and other performance related features. Obviously, the use of a lightweight pressure hull opens the door to a performance increase. In the search of a lightweight pressure hull, it is found that use of composite materials can be a solution. However, a composite pressure hull design encapsulates the design of the composite itself. For this reason, pressure hull finite element models are created that include the composite related material mechanics. Suitable weight minimization techniques are performed on these models and results were compared to the conventional heavyweight pressure hull. As a result, it is demonstrated that pressure hulls made of sandwich-constructed composite offer a promising weight reduction of 28% with respect to the conventional reference design.","lightweight design; submarine pressure hulls","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker, S. (mentor)","2012","This project came into being in response to the growing appetite in China for grape wines. Alterego has an expertise business in food & drink, culture and marketing, and it is also eyeing the emerging Chinese market, therefore the mutual understanding between the Chinese and the grape wine needs to be addressed, and this will be accomplished in this project by embedding cultural and economic value into the design and activation of this new grape wine brand for China. Project assignment: The assignment of this project is to create a brand of grape wine from France to China market, and create a brand activation plan for short term. In the long term, the brand concept will act as a guideline in further design, communication and promotion. Research activities: The research defined who the target group is, what to communicate, how and where to the brand interact with target group. To reach these objectives the research was performed in steps of data collection, data analysis, conceptualization, and brand activation design. 1. Data collection: collect information about grape wine culture, Chinese social-cultural context, current China market and competitors there, consumer characteristic and needs. Data collection was conducted in multiple methods, from academic papers, books, business report, fieldwork interview, observation, wine tasting experiment and internet anecdote collection. 2. Data analysis: Data analysis can be divided into two aspects of internal analysis and external analysis. Internal analysis covers the existing business of the company, its strength and weakness in creating such international brand, and the grape wine itself, i.e. classification and function of grape wine. External analysis bigger social context, consumer analysis and competitor analysis. 3. Conceptualization: After interpretation of analysis result, brand concept was build and selected. 4. Brand activation design: Based on the brand positioning concept and key aspects for interactive touch point, brand activation design was developed. i.e. physical product, interaction channel, and distribution channel. Final results: The main benefits proposed by the brand to consumer are pleasant taste, relaxing south France ambience, modern western lifestyle. And the core target group is the 20-35 year-old young adult living in urban area, with mid-high income. The final brand activation deals with 3 aspects: 1) product design, 2) communication & interaction, and 3) distribution channels. It includes a design brief and a visual example of physical product, brand interaction plan, and a distribution channel mix for the first year after launch. The final results also include a business case that integrates the branding project into market context with 4-Ps: Product, Price, Place and Promotion, and a forecasted cash flow, and break-even analysis for 1st fiscal year.","wine; intercultural; brand; design; China market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Wind power generation is predicted to increase massively within the next years. In this direction, offshore wind power is anticipated to play an important role in the future renewable energy share, especially in the North Sea countries. These trends have posed new challenges for transmission system operators to supply consumers with the required quality of service. Transmission system operators are responsible to ensure the adequate security of power system operation which implies system stability and satisfactory damping levels. High voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system technology is the only technically feasible power transmission system solution for the connection of large offshore wind farms which are located far from the shore. Additionally, the plans for the construction of a multi-terminal dc offshore network in the North Sea region would advance the integration of offshore wind power and would further improve the European electricity markets. The VSC-based HVDC transmission is considered a mature technical solution for the development of multi-terminal dc networks. The main focus of the present thesis is the interaction of the Dutch interconnected power system with voltage source converter (VSC) based HVDC transmission systems which are facilitated for the integration of large amount of offshore wind power in the Netherlands. Special attention is given in the transient stability of critical generators in the Dutch power system in situations with large amount of onshore and offshore wind penetration. Individual and MTdc connection of offshore wind parks have been investigated both facilitated by VSC-based HVDC. A generic modeling framework for VSC-based HVDC transmission system which is compatible with the Dutch power system dynamic model of TenneT in PSSE software package is developed to carry out transient stability analysis. An averaged model of the VSC converter along with the dc cable network model is used for transient stability simulations of meshed ac-dc networks. The interaction between the Dutch power system and different VSC-based HVDC transmission systems is investigated under ac side three phase faults. In addition, different dc network power management strategies based on closed loop dc voltage control and dc droop characteristics are proposed to ensure smooth system operation and proper power sharing among the grid-side converter stations. The three basic power market dispatch schemes were studied and the basic differences in terms of dc voltage performance were discussed. A power oscillation damping (POD) controller that operates at the grid-side converter is proposed in order to introduce damping of electromechanical oscillations in the ac power system. The POD controller operates at the active power control loop of the GSVSC and performs active power modulation. It was shown for a multi-machine test system that it is possible by the proposed control strategy to introduce damping of power oscillations in the system that the grid-side converter operates. The 2010 dynamic model of TenneT has been used to represent the Dutch high voltage transmission system. Grid reinforcements which are planned for the years 2025-2030 were introduced. Additionally, certain assumptions have been made in terms of conventional generation and unit commitment. Having applied all the necessary changes, it has been achieved to build a 2025-2030 grid situation dynamic model. Seven interconnection points were considered within the former UCTE system for the connection of large amount of offshore wind power (three in the Netherlands, three in Germany and one in Belgium) according to the NSTG project. Three types of VSC-based HVDC transmission system configurations were studied. Namely the individual connection, the multi-terminal dc network connection per country and the transnational multi-terminal dc network connection which extends from Germany via the Netherlands to Belgium. A total 5200MW offshore wind power and 4700MW onshore wind power is introduced into the power flow of the Dutch power system. Furthermore, for the German part of the UCTE network, 7500MW offshore wind power is considered. Three snapshots of the Dutch power system are taken into consideration reflecting situations with different conventional generation, load and power exchange. From the simulation results it was deduced that the specific amount of wind power interconnected to the Dutch power system did not create transiently unstable situations. With regard to the performance of the grid-side converter stations in the three types of HVDC transmission system configuration, it was found that the main difference in the dynamic response is the active power overshoot of particular grid-side converters. All grid-side converters have illustrated capability to support the ac voltage with reactive power and contribute limited short circuit current in all three HVDC configurations. Additionally, the connection of the converter stations in the existing 380kV substations of the Dutch power system did not introduce considerably negative interaction between the generators and the converters.","MTDC grids; VSC-HVDC; Dutch Power System; Transient Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Sustainable Electrical Power Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Mast, C. (mentor)","2012","Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is being used for the treatment of several phobias, such as fear of flying. A system for VRET has two users, the Patient suffering of a phobia and the therapist who controls the session and the system simultaneously. Research mainly focuses on the patient experience and the effectiveness of the treatment. The focus of this study is on the interaction therapists have with the system. The graphical user interface (GUI) for the therapist can be very complex and introduces a heavy task load for the therapist, which means that the therapist has less energy to spend to the patient during the session. This thesis focusses on the analysis and improvement of this therapist GUI in order to decrease the task load for the therapist. To achieve this, field observations were performed in order to construct a detailed task analysis of the VRET treatment. The direct observation data of six therapists during a total of 14 sessions with patients, showed some consistency between sessions and other findings, which were used to construct three paper prototypes. These were evaluated by therapists and then subjected to a heuristic evaluation. During the final approach, a high-fidelity generic prototype design was developed, which allowed therapist to select specific and automatic flight scenarios with predefined flight phases. This final prototype was again evaluated by seven therapists in a Wizard of Oz setting, where the facilitator was simulating all functions that were not implemented in the prototype. Results showed significant usability improvements and led to five design guidelines. To evaluate the generic layout of the final design of the therapist GUI, several GUI design examples for other purposes than fear of flying were given. All of these examples were designed using the generic design layout. The trend is towards a treatment-oriented user interface instead of a simulation-oriented user interface.","Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; generic; graphical user interface; prototyping; observations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Mediamatics","","Interactive Intelligence group","",""

(mentor)","2012","As wind energy technology continues to take the helm of renewable energy deployed throughout the world, and wind farms become a more common sight on the horizon, increased emphasis is placed on wind farm aerodynamics. Obtaining insight into this complex flow problem requires a deeper understanding of the nature of individual wind turbine wakes, and subsequently wake interactions. The topic of wake stability and wake meandering, has received particular attention in recent years. Recent work by Larsen et al. [1] investigated this wake meandering phenomenon based on the hypothesis that the wake behaves as a passive tracer, governed by large-scale lateral and horizontal turbulent components. In contrast, Medici and Alfredsson [2] propose that a meandering mechanism similar to bluff body vortex shedding is responsible for the wake oscillations of their two-bladed model. Thus conflicting views with respect to the triggering mechanisms of wake instability exist and are addressed in this thesis. The approach taken was to use a simple inviscid vortex ring (VR) modelling method to represent the developing rotor wake. This allows for a straight forward investigation and comparison of the impact of uniform, yawed and sheared flow conditions on the development of the wake, with the additional possibility of including ground effect. The phenomenon of vortex filament interaction or leapfrogging, could play a role in the observation of unsteady phenomena and is therefore also addressed. Such a study is hence performed in light of recent conflicting views on the causes of wake meandering. The main conclusion from this study is that the presence of the ground and external perturbations, most notably changes in the wake pitch and the rotor thrust coefficient, can significantly affect the steady development of the wake. The phenomenon of vortex filament leapfrogging, whilst displaying interesting periodic behaviour, does not correlate with periodic wake behaviour reported in Medici et al. [2]. However, in the absence of unsteady inflow, it is shown that the wake of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) is certainly prone to displaying unstable, dynamic behaviour caused by these additional factors.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Koster, R. (mentor)","2012","This thesis describes the development an innovative reusable bottle and beverage enhancement system that will be used to kick-start the recently founded company Oto. The Oto Bottle brings convenience, fun and sustainability to the creation of on-the-move beverages. As such, the thesis is carried out in parallel with two Strategic Product Design Masters students who focus on the brand and strategy elements of the company’s origins. Problem Definition Current attitudes towards personal hydration promote the use of disposable bottles. Whilst offering convenience, the benefits come at a price, literally and environmentally due to the waste involved. The main objective of this graduation thesis is to develop an alternative to packaged beverages through understanding users needs and bridging the gap with innovative and attractive product offerings. Methodology The project iniated with research into the driving factors behind the bottled water industry. This was used to understand consumers’ motivations and structure a research method that would identify opportunities. An intensive qualitative research process was undertaken employing observations, interviews, focus groups and user tests. The user research was then analysed and translated into design specifications and user needs. These were summarised in personas that provide an overview of the users context and motivations, This rich information was then used to support the design of concepts suitable for those users needs. A range of concepts were developed and analysed compared to the design specifications, user needs and brand values. The strongest concepts were then further developed and analysed through prototyping and 3D development of their mechanisms. An emerging design direction was then developed further until proof of concept, using prototyping techniques including 3D printing. The design and interaction was then tested with target users in order to identify their preferred interaction qualities. Once selected the emerging concept is then further detailed and analysed within the context of the Oto brand. Target Market The target market for the Oto Bottle is predomenantly young, active professionals with busy high-stress lifestyles. They have high demands from their products and have little free time to enjoy their lives. These users are passionate about products that allow them to achieve their goals. Concept Proposal The Oto Bottle and Drops take the form of a compact and convenient mobile beverage creation system. The bottle provides storage space for 5 beverage enhancement ‘Drops’ and can contain 600ml of water. The Oto Drops contain different performance or flavour enhancing ingredients that allow the user to customise their daily beverage consumption. When loaded with Drops and Water the user twists the selection tray to align with the dispensing button. After which, the active ingredients in the Drops emit effervescence and create the desired beveage. One of the key differentiating factors is that Oto aims to support its users by incentivising sustainable attitudes. This also helps to reduce the small amount of waste that is used in packaging the Drops. Through comparisons with similar, yet less functional, products on the market, it is anticipated that Oto can be competitively priced encouraging users to buy into the system. Evaluation The thesis concludes with a final product evaluation from users with no prior knowledge or experience of Oto. The main reason for this, is to analyse the effect that the design has on users’ perception. It can be concluded that the Oto Bottle and Drops system achieves its intended goal of providing ‘proof-of-concept’ for the new product category of ‘portable beverage poduction systems’","design; reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-10-08","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Due to limitations in surgical equipment, ENSBS is not always a viable option. This research attempts to address these limitations through the development of a highly manoeuvrable, actively controlled, shape memory instrument. A design of such an instrument is proposed which achieves shape memory control through remote cable actuation. Motions are transmitted from a series of segments in the handle, to identical segments in the tip of the mechanism. The design includes a fully mechanical shape memory mechanism incorporated inside the handle which should allow the tip, through motion transition from the handle, to follow a custom defined path in space. The design has been prototyped on large scale and its working principle evaluated. Results showed a design flaw with respect to cable motion in the handle. This flaw was caused by the applied steering principle and sequence of segment cable connections. Partial validation of the feasibility of a fully mechanical highly manoeuvrable instrument with shape memory control has been achieved, and increased understanding into the design working mechanism has been obtained. Finally, a redesign of the original concept is provided, including a discussion on the opportunities for miniaturization, and an analysis into the additional necessary future developments for this instrument.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

This thesis discusses the possibilities of using beamforming with a two microphone array for smartphone applications. The goal of the project is to realise a beamforming algorithm for smartphones to improve on current Signal to Noise ratios attained by standard noise reduction methods. By means of a literature study, three beamformers were investigated and presented: Delay and Sum (DAS), Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) and the Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC). Due to time constraints the DAS and MVDR were chosen for further simulations and testing, based on the terms of reference. Both beamformers were extensively simulated and tested in Matlab. The results were used to compare the two beamformers based on their white noise suppression, punctuated noise source suppression, frequency range and computational complexity. Results showed that the white noise suppression for both beamformers is the same. For the suppression of punctuated noise sources however, the MVDR beamformer is more reliable, because it adapts its response to the main noise source. Furthermore, the MVDR beamformer performs better on the frequency spectrum of interest. The only advantage of the DAS beamformer over MVDR is a lower computational complexity. It is concluded that beamforming with a two microphone array is possible. Considering the terms of reference, the MVDR beamformer is the better option of the simulated two for implementation on smartphones.","Beamforming; Two Sensor; DAS; MVDR; GSC; Matlab; Smartphone; Bachelor Thesis; Noise Reduction","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Multimedia Signal Processing","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Cargo transport is important for supplies of goods and food worldwide. The goods and food are transported by inland transport modes, like road, railway and inland waterway transport. Due to a growth in world population the demand of goods and food increase, which results in an increase in cargo transport. More transport leads to more traffic on roads, railway and inland waterways. Roads and railways are at their limits of capacity, while inland waterways have the ability for an increase of waterway traffic. The European waterway network for inland transport is wide and connects sea ports and the European hinterland with each other. While inland waterway transport is cheaper and slower compared to road and railway transport, it is also less reliable than the other transport modes. The reliability is the ability to perform and maintain the agreements made between actors involved in the cargo transport during normal circumstances, as well as during unexpected circumstances, like delays. A disadvantage for inland waterway navigation is the locks in the waterway network. Locks maintain the water on a certain level, so that inland vessels can navigate without the risk of grounding. Locks also cause congestions when the lock capacity is lower than the amount of vessels that want to pass the lock during a certain time. These congestions cause delays for the vessels, which do not increase the reliability of the waterway transport mode. To stimulate the inland waterway transport, so that cargo transport over water will become more compatible with road and railway transport, the reliability for inland waterway transport must be increased. This can be done by decreasing the waiting times at the locks in the waterways. The interarrival times of inland vessels have an influence on the waiting times for vessels at locks. So when the arrival times of vessels at a lock are controlled, the waiting times can be controlled. A simulation model is designed to simulate what the effect of controlled arrivals of vessels is on the waiting time at locks. The simulation model is able to adjust the velocities of all vessels that navigate on the waterway towards the lock. With the adjustments in velocity of a vessels, the arrival time of that vessel is controlled by the model. The adjustment in velocity can let the vessel navigate faster and slower. When a vessel slows down it´s travel time on the waterway increases. A lower velocity and a longer travel time means that the fuel costs decrease and the operation time increases. That could result in a higher total travel costs. Therefore the simulation model can minimize the waiting times or the travel costs. With the minimization of costs the waiting time is minimized as well, due to the fixed operating costs a vessel has, which are the travel costs without fuel costs. Variables in the simulation model are the length of the controlled waterway, the service time of the lock and the lock capacity. The length of the controlled waterway determines the size of the system and the area where the vessels are controlled, the service time is the time it takes to pass the lock and the lock capacity determines the maximum number of vessels that can enter the lock chamber during one service run. As an input for the simulation model each vessel has its own entering velocity and entering time during a day. The entering velocities of the vessel are between 10 and 20 km/h and can be adjusted between 5 km/h and 110% of the entering velocity of the vessel. The entering time is distributed by a Weibull distribution. Since inland waterway transport is not yet a full 24/7 industry, the distribution is in such way that the majority of the daily vessels that pass the lock will enter the system between 06:00 and 20:00 hour. The settings used for the variables in the simulations are based on situations at four locks between the two largest sea ports in Europe, which are Rotterdam and Antwerp. The locks are the Volkerak, Krammer, Hansweert and Kreekrak lock and the waiting times at those lock are expected to be as long as 3 hours in the next decade. The output of the simulation model are waiting times at the lock and the total travel costs for each vessel in an optimized situation, which is a situation with minimized waiting time or travel costs. Optimized results of the simulation model are compared with the simulations that represent the four locks with the expected waiting times. The simulation model shows a reduction in waiting times of more than 80% compared to the expected waiting times for the next decade. If this can be achieved in reality the inland waterway transport mode can be stimulated due to smaller unexpected delays and an increased reliability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2012","Formula Zero Delft is een raceteam dat sinds 2007 racevoertuigen met een fuel cell bouwt. In dat jaar nam de stichting deel aan de eerste competitie voor waterstof karts. In de twee jaar hierna heeft het team nog twee karts gebouwd waarna de overstap naar Formula Student auto's is gemaakt. Na twee jaar in de Formula Studentcompetitie gaat het team verder opschalen naar raceauto's voor grote circuits. De toekomstplannen van het Formula Zero team zijn de directe aanleiding voor onderzoek naar po- wertrains voor fuel cell raceauto's. De kern van dit onderzoek vormt dan ook het ontwerpen van een powertrain van een fuel cell aangedreven raceauto. Daarnaast geeft het onderzoek inzicht geven in de stand van de technologie op gebied van verschillende onderdelen van powertrains. Het onderzoek is opgesplitst in een aantal onderdelen. In hoofdstuk 4 is aan de hand van component specicaties een groot aantal componenten voor fuel cell powertrains in kaart gebracht. Daarop gebaseerd is een keus gemaakt en onderbouwd om een fuel cell te combineren met ultra-capacitors. Vervolgens is onderzocht welke topologieen, zijnde de manier waarop verschillende componenten aan elkaar geschakeld worden, geschikt zijn om een fuel cell powertrain op te baseren. Op basis van maximaal vermogen, ecientie en realiseerbaarheid, is gekozen om drie verschillende scenario's meer gedetailleerd te simuleren. De DC-link topologie, een powertrain met twee omvormers en een hoogspanning DC-link en twee vormen van de fuel cell-link topologie, een powertrain met e en omvormer en een link waarvan de spanning bepaald wordt door de fuel cell. Deze worden allen beschreven in hoofdstuk 5. Met de specicaties verkregen bij het onderzoek naar componenten en aan de hand van een voor- onderzoek is een eerste schatting gemaakt van het nominale en maximale benodigd vermogen van de auto. Deze resultaten dienden als uitgangspunt van een meer gedetailleerde simulatie om verschillende topologieen te vergelijken in SIMULINK. Dit gedetailleerde model benadert de fysieke gedragingen van de powertrain door verschillende componenten apart te modelleren en te verbinden volgens de schema's van de verschillende topologieen. Uit de resultaten van de simulaties blijkt dat een fuel cell-link topologie met lage bufferspanning ongeschikt is door de zeer hoge stromen die bij piekvermogen door de omvormer moeten lopen. Dit heeft als effect dat de buer niet in staat is om maximaal opgeladen te worden als deze leeg is, dan zijn immers de stromen het hoogst. De DC-link topologie en fuel cell-link topologie met hoge bufferspanning presteren in vergelijking tot elkaar vergelijkbaar, maar door de extra massa van de DC-link topologie presteert een fuel cell link vermoedelijk beter. Uit het onderzoek volgt dat een powertrain met een 85kW fuel cell, een ultra-capacitor buffer en een fuel cell link topologie geschikt is om op verschillende circuits competitief te racen tegen raceauto's met conventionele brandstoffen. Wel is het bij een fuel cell van een vermogen van 85kW vereist om gebruik te maken van regeneratief remmen.","Fuel cell; Powertrain; Raceauto","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Bachelor","",""

Dit algoritme dient daarna te worden toegepast in een game voor mobiele telefoons. Voor de detectie kan gebruik gemaakt worden van verschillende hardware in telefoons, maar vanwege een te laag voorkomen of te hoge onnauwkeurigheid van de overige hardware, gebruiken we in ons algoritme alleen de versnellingsmeter. Het detecteren van een gooi is relatief simpel, aangezien dit gekenmerkt wordt door een vrije val. Het is lastiger de duur van de gooi, en daarmee de hoogte, te bepalen. Ook moeten nepgooien worden gelterd. Na een poging om de benodigde sleutelwaarden te bepalen aan de hand van opvallende punten in grafieken van de versnelling van een telefoon, kwamen we erachter dat dit erg lastig werd zodra de telefoon in de lucht draaide. Omdat het berekenen van het tijdstip van de top ook een lastige opgave was, hebben we besloten ervan uit te gaan dat de telefoon even hoog wordt gegooid als gevangen. Met behulp van een neuraal netwerk hebben we geprobeerd hoogtes te bepalen, maar ook dit gaf niet de gewenste resultaten. Het uiteindelijke algoritme is gebaseerd op fuzzy logica. Met behulp van verschillende fuzzy verzamelingen wordt een beslissing genomen over een mogelijke gooi. Als beslist wordt dat er een gooi was, wordt deze nog gevalideerd om er zeker van te zijn dat de gooi bijvoorbeeld geen na-stuiter was. Het ontwerp van de functiebibliotheek heeft als uitgangspunt de integratie in andere applicaties. De bibliotheek is geïmplementeerd in Java, gebruik makend van de Android API. De game `Catchy' is geschreven met ondersteuning van de engine AndEngine. In de game kan de speler verschillende spellen spelen waarin een bepaald doel bereikt moet worden door de telefoon omhoog te gooien. Ons algoritme is gevalideerd met een testopstelling waarbij de echte sleutelwaarden en hoogte vergeleken zijn met de door het algoritme berekende waarden. Met behulp van de resultaten is het algoritme verbeterd, wat een algoritme heeft opgeleverd met een gemiddelde fout van nul centimeter, en een standaardafwijking van nog geen twee centimeter.","accelerometer; versnellingsmeter; mobiele telefoon; gooidetectie; catchy; android","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor)","2012","An embedded electronic camera system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) was developed in the scope of the final bachelor project at the TU Delft in 2012. The aim of the project was to develop a prototype for a new UAV competition. The electronic system of the prototype had to able to track an object, make a picture of it and send it to a ground station, where the picture and flight data is visualized. To whole project is divided into three subgroups each designing a specific part of the system. This thesis provides the design choices and performance results regarding the image processing and object detection of the whole system. It was considered that a literature study would usefully supplement the choice of hard- and software. The literature study was extended by creating an overview of existing hardware for embedded video processing. To perform embedded image processing the hardware components were selected first. It was decided that the system consists out of a camera, a processing board and a power converter. As camera a webcam was chosen, because it is robust, fast, small and it has the ability to buffer data, so no buffering on the processing board was needed. The Beagleboard, an ARM based prototyping board, was picked as a processing board, because it is the fastest of the compared boards. Furthermore it doesn’t use much power, is compatible with the hardware used by the other project groups and enough drivers for peripheral devices are available. A buck converter was selected to down convert the voltage of a battery to the lower input voltage needed by the Beagleboard, as it had the highest efficiency of the considered converters. The Beagleboard had to be capable of multiple sensor communication, real time image processing and running location and velocity estimation algorithms. It was decided to run Linux on the Beagleboard, because it allows high level programming. For prototyping reasons, C++ was used to implement the algorithms, because it is easy to implement, fast and can be handled well by the Beagleboard. The Open Computer Vision library was selected to make the implementation of the readout of the webcam fast and the implementation of the algorithms facile. Algorithms were implemented for colour detection, real location estimation of the object and velocity estimation. Different object detection approaches were considered and colour detection by thresholding each pixel of the captured video frame, was selected as the most convenient algorithm, because it is the fastest and least complex algorithm of the compared methods. The design brief laid explicit constraints on a high frame rate such that colour thresholding was selected, as being the fastest algorithm. The pixel coordinate of the object in the frame was found by a centre of mass calculation of the selected pixels. A moving average filter was implemented to remove noise from the object detection algorithm. Trigonometric based algorithms were deduced to estimate the real location from the pixel coordinates. The velocity of the object was found by the displacement of the object between two frames over the time between those frames. The designed prototype was tested in two different approaches; a test setup with a static camera and one with a moving camera, mounted on a quadrocopter. In both configurations it was shown the built system is capable of reliable object detection, location and velocity estimation. From the results of these experiments, it could be concluded that the system can achieve an accuracy of up to 99 % in the static and 90 % in the moving camera setup for the estimation of both the location and the velocity. Furthermore, around 14 frames per second on a resolution of 320 x 240 could be processed using the Beagleboard and running all algorithms described above. The prototype built within this bachelor project and documented in this thesis, is able to fulfil the tasks defined in the assignment. It therefore meets the specifications regarding the image processing and object detection defined in the design brief of the clients. Some suggestions for future improvements of the system are testing it on the fixed wing UAV and further enhancing and optimizing the various algorithms. Although the system is not ready for the UAV competition yet, the first milestone on the way to a UAV with camera system has been reached within this thesis. The work performed in the scope of this thesis clearly contributed to the electronic system of the final fixed wing UAV demonstrating the task of the new UAV competition.","AR.Drone; parrot; UAV; camera system; object recognition","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Maas, B. (mentor)","2012","Introduction Floods are a threat to millions of people who live in lowlands like the Netherlands. Therefore the Dutch government has been given re-quirements for primary flood defence systems like dikes. The current condition of most of these dikes does not fulfill to these requirements based on flood risk analyses of RWS. The most logical step is to take measures by constructing new structures or planning regular maintenance activities over time. It is most commonly used to focus on economical most beneficial measures and maintenance intervals for a primary flood defence system like the Afsluitdijk. Research goal RWS aims to launch a certain risk-driven maintenance concept named RAMSSHEEP which should be developed by the current market. The objective is to assess whether or not RAMSSHEEP can be applied as a risk-driven maintenance tool for primary flood defence systems based on the results of the existing method of Probabilistic Approach. By describing the two approaches of a flooding problem more insight will be gained in the advantages and disadvantages of RAMSSHEEP. Methodology and approach A general flooding problem has been ap-proached by analyzing the system on its main functions. Subsequently, a probabilistic analysis has been made by estimating the possible damage and its annual probability of occurrence which together lead to the monetary risk. To decrease this probability of occurrence some measures can be taken which will cost a certain amount of money. Eventually these investments will be analyzed whether or not this amount is lower than the expected level of damage in the old situation, so is the criterion of gaining safety larger than the improvement costs met? Moreover, it is not always profitable to take such investments in an existing system. There-fore maintenance can be applied to decrease the probability of occurrence temporarily. Dominant failure events have been approached by describing scientific deterioration models which illustrates decrease of strength over time. A maintenance optimization describes the most economical beneficial time intervals in which maintenance should be applied based on the deterioration model. Eventually these results form the basis for the translation to RAMSSHEEP requirements. This result illustrates which requirements have been used and which not. This comparison (Proba-bilistic Approach vs. RAMSSHEEP) gives more grip on the assessment of the correctness of RAMSSHEEP as a risk-driven maintenance tool in the hydraulic engineering. Conclusion and recommendation The probabilistic analysis always gives the most economical beneficial solution which forms the main driver of all the problems in society. RAMSSHEEP has proven not to be able to use as a risk-driven maintenance tool with economics as the main driver. By combining the probabilistic analysis and maintenance optimization, it is recommended to apply a new given model named EMAR.","probabilistic approach; RAMSSHEEP; economical optimization; maintenance strategies; reliability; availability; afsluitdijk; primary flood defence system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Probabilistic Design and Flood Risks","",""

(mentor)","2012","Ever since the beginning of manned flight, engineers have been inspired by nature in many ways. Birds have been flying in formation for as long as man remember and military aircraft followed suit. In the light of rising fuel prices, crowded airspace and stringent environmental regulations, formation flight could just be another leap forward in commercial aviation as well. This study aims to provide an insight in the implications and prerequisites of close formation flight in commercial aviation. In this research, a wake vortex model for the Boeing 747 commercial jet is developed. The optimum separation between aircraft in a formation is determined. The location of the sweet spot and the drag reduction that are determined with the wake vortex model, are in good agreement with previous research. The location of the sweet spot can however differ from off-line predictions due to e.g. wind and simplifications in the model. It is found that the classic autopilot of the B-747 is not suitable for formation flight. A new autopilot is therefore developed and evaluated. The new autopilot is based on a multiple loop architecture and is developed for a linearized model of the B-747 in cruise condition. It is shown that both in the linearized and the nonlinear model, the controller design complies with regulations and the aircraft successfully tracks the sweet spot under the influence of wake vortex effects. To circumvent the problem of an uncertain sweet spot location, the autopilot is extended with extremum seeking capability. By estimation and maximization of the induced angle of attack, the aircraft automatically finds and tracks the location in which maximum drag reduction is achieved. For applications in commercial aviation, a number of practical issues is finally considered. Different strategies for sweet spot approach, formation flight in a turbulent atmosphere and multiple aircraft formations are considered and it is investigated how passenger comfort is affected. A considerable mean thrust reduction is achieved with the new autopilot set to extremum seeking, without causing disturbances to the passengers.","formation flight; wake vortex; fuel saving; extremum seeking; gradient descent; passenger comfort; boeing 747","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

First, experimental determination of the mixing induced by the ultrasound irradiation at different power input was studied using a high speed, high resolution camera. The particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was used for these studies. The experiments showed that when increasing the power of the ultrasound processor, the velocity increased subsequently. Also, when power was increased, vorticity was increased. After, the heat input given by the sonotrode was studied using high speed camera and liquid crystals which change the color with temperature. The particle image thermometry (PIT) method was used to determined 2D temperature profiles. From the 2D temperature measurement 2D supersaturation profiles was determined. Experiments showed that when temperature increases, supersaturation decreases. The distribution of supersaturation and temperature were assessed at the same moment. Lastly crystal nucleation was performed at power inputs of 50% and 75% and different insonation time from 30 to 120 seconds. The solution used in these experiments was lactose. It was found that when power input increases, the amount of lactose crystals formed was also increasing. With higher power input and increased insonation time, the number of the crystals increased as well as the mean diameters. However there were exception. Above a certain level of insonation time the volume based diameter did not correspondently grow.","ultrasound; supersaturation; macro streaming; nucleation; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); Particle Image Thermometry (PIT); number of crystals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Intensified Reaction & Separation Systems","",""

When optimising intermodal rail-road networks, organising large transport volumes on transport links is key for bringing down the costs per container-kilometre. By bundling container flows in Twin Hub Bundling (THB) networks, thereby integrating the flows of the Dutch and Belgian seaports, the Twin Hub project aims to stimulate intermodal rail-road transport in North-West Europe. The goal of this thesis is to create a bundling tool that finds the most promising THB networks based on projected container flows. In this thesis, a modelling is presented of the THB problem, introducing three innovative features: the organisation of intermodal transport services in batches, the introduction of indirect trains, and the integration of train and truck services in one service network. We then prove this problem to be an NP-hard optimisation problem, and present an exact algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) as well as a relaxation of that formulation. An experimental evaluation shows that both the exact algorithm and the combination of the relaxation and the ILP algorithm (cascade algorithm) are capable of producing good-quality solutions to real-world sized instances within 24 hours. Finally, we present the bundling tool itself, which provides an easy interface for running the algorithms, evaluating the results, and selecting the most promising THB network to be implemented in a pilot operation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics","",""

The objective of the report is to find a suitable greenfield port location at the east coast of India, to develop a technical feasible master plan for this location and to determine the financial viability of this master plan. With respect to the objective conclusions are drawn. The northern part, i.e. the states of West Bengal, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, have the most potential to develop a port. Though, because of environmental and political issues the states of West Bengal and Orissa are not preferable. Andhra Pradesh is eager to develop a greenfield port. In the north of Andhra Pradesh the designated greenfield port location of Bhavanapadu has the best potential for the development of a greenfield port. This location is further elaborated. The following boundary conditions are considered in this report. Environment The project area is in a pristine environment of wetlands with a rich biodiversity. It is close to the ecologically fragile Naupada swamp which houses migratory birds. The construction and operation of the port will have a large impact on the environment. The siltation, sediment transport and ecosystems will be influenced. Current area occupation: Several villages are located in the vicinity of the greenfield location. The inhabitants depend on the local salt fields and the fishing harbour. The government has tried to develop the fishing harbour but the project failed due to sedimentation problems in the mouth of the creek. Marine and geotechnical conditions: The monsoon on the east coast of India results in a yearly seasonal reversal. This influences the wind and wave climate and the current direction. The project location is in a cyclone hazard zone which results in harsh design conditions. The water depth at the project location is between 0 and 10 m. The main soil material is sand. In the area severe sedimentation occurs. The direction of the sediment transport depends on the monsoon. Stakeholders: Private investors in combination with the state of Andhra Pradesh will develop the Bhavanapadu port on Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis. Market study: A market study is conducted in which the distribution of the traffic forecast is determined for the years 2025, 2035 and 2045. Vessel size: The governing vessel size is a fourth generation Panamax vessel. Master plan: The following elements are the most important subjects covered by the technical feasibility. Phasing: To meet the growing traffic the construction of the port is divided in three phases:  Phase I: 2020 – 2030, capacity of the port based on the throughput of 2025.  Phase II: 2030 – 2040, capacity of the port based on the throughput of 2035.  Phase III: 2040 – 2045, capacity of the port based on the throughput of 2045. Preliminary design conditions: The port is designed for a lifetime of 50 years. The preliminary layout is designed for Phase I and Phase II, while taking Phase III into consideration. The three commodities dry bulk, break bulk and containers are subdivided into a dry bulk terminal, general cargo terminal and container terminal. An overview of all the elements through the different phases is shown Figure 3. Wet infrastructure: The wet infrastructure of the port includes the following: an inner approach and an outer approach channel. A turning basin inside the port basin and an emergency turning basin half way the outer approach channel. There are berthing areas available for all terminals. Breakwaters: The port is protected by two rubble mount breakwaters. The northern breakwater is protected by quarry armour as armour layer. The southern breakwater is protected by concrete accropode blocks as armour layer. Port utilities: he port includes all the important elements like: infrastructure, navigation, security and safety utilities and offices. The power is supplied by the neighboring power plant. For the water supply a solution has to be found. For the processing of fertilizer a packing factory is constructed. Hinterland connections: Future hinterland connections will connect the port to the main road NH5 and the main railway. Port layout: The layout of the port is based on the navigability, draught and required areas for the different terminals. The port utilities are placed on strategic locations. Quay walls: The dry bulk quay wall is constructed as a jetty. The general cargo quay wall and the container quay wall are constructed with sheet piling.","greenfield port; Andhra Pradesh; general cargo port; India","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The weighted consensus and covariance intersection perform both with errors smaller than two degrees Celsius. However, the weighted consensus does require assumptions that covariance intersection does not.","distributed Kalman filter; gossiping; Broadcast Gossip; covariance intersection; consensus; Kalman filtering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Wolf, K.H.A.A. (mentor); Bruining, J. (mentor)","2012","We investigate non-isothermal compositional flow in methane-rich geothermal aquifers by coupling a thermodynamic model and a dynamic flow model. For the thermodynamic model, we develop a MATLAB program, which calculates the thermodynamic equilibrium of the H2OCH4-NaCl mixtures at high pressure conditions and reservoir temperatures. In the same program we calculate the transport properties. The dynamic flow model is solved using finite element simulations with the NegSat solution approach. We add artificial diffusion and adaptive mesh refinement to obtain a stable solution. Our interest is in the extraction of geothermal energy and our field of study is a reservoir in the Delft Sandstone Member (2200 m depth) and a reservoir in the Main Buntsandstein Subgroup (4000 m depth), both in the West Netherlands Basin. We consider the production of hot methane-rich water and the injection of cold water without methane for both reservoirs. The objectives of the study are to: 1) determine under which circumstances free methane gas can be present in geothermal reservoirs; 2) quantify how heat recovery is influenced by gas evolution in the reservoir (i.e., the release of solution gas into a free gas phase), and 3) analyze the possibilities for optimal operational conditions for heat recovery and the gas-to-water ratio. Given the pressure, temperature, salt concentration, thermodynamic equilibrium and gas-water ratio, we can determine the initial phase state of the reservoir and the possibility of gas evolution during production. Solubility and phase density calculations of H2O-CH4-NaCl mixtures are included in the thermodynamic model. In our simulations, the methane that the reservoirs contain initially is dissolved in the salt water and we investigate cases for different methane concentrations. For high methane concentrations, gas evolution occurs upon the pressure drop at the production well. Using simulation results we show that, even if the initial amount of dissolved methane approaches the solubility limit, the influence of gas evolution on heat extraction is very limited during production and injection. Furthermore, there is no noticeable effect of gas evolution on the water production rate and the production gas-water ratio. Gas saturations throughout the reservoir remain lower than 0.5% and are too low to alter the heat transfer and to cause upward migration of the evolved solution gas. The low gas saturations have a very low mobility and methane is therefore trapped in the gas phase. As the compositional front of the injected water, with high methane concentration downstream and no methane concentration upstream, progresses into the reservoir, the trapped methane gas will dissolve again in the injected water. Furthermore, the effect of a two-phase region on the relative permeability of water is very low for the conditions studied by us. Near the production well, where an increased pressure drop causes higher gas saturations (up to 2.2%), water flow rate is only reduced by 0.5-1.8% at maximum and changing operational conditions to optimize the subsurface flow regarding this two-phase flow would not result in noticeable improvements.","geothermal; methane; solution gas; compositional flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","The lifetime of geothermal projects mainly depends on the thermal breakthrough (thermal breakthrough occurs when a cold water front reaches the producer). Currently, geothermal-energy production is marginally economical because of its uncertainties and risks associated with the subsurface such as lifetime, flow rate, temperature. Lifetime of a geothermal reservoir plays the most important role in the use of geothermal energy because it mainly determines whether or not geothermal-energy production is economically viable. Through optimization of the well positions from one or more geothermal doublets in a homogeneous or heterogeneous reservoir, the profitability of the project, which is largely dependent on the time of compositional breakthrough, temperature breakthrough and the rate of temperature decline, can be improved. This thesis studies optimization of the well positions such that the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project is maximized in a 2D geothermal reservoir for the selected heterogeneity structure. For this purpose an automated, gradient-based optimization method is used. The approach is based on the concept to surround the wells, whose locations have to be optimized, by so-called pseudo-wells. The reservoir simulations are performed using the Finite Element Method in the program COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2a. The major features of the simulation results are discussed in detail. The compositional front moves faster than the thermal front (the ratio of these two is the thermal retardation factor). Breakthrough of water with altered composition will therefore occur at an early stage in the doublet lifetime. Reservoir heterogeneities influence the time at which thermal and compositional breakthrough occur and also determine the rate at which temperature and composition decline after breakthrough. The temperature and compositional decline curves after breakthrough are generally steeper in a homogeneous reservoir than in a heterogeneous reservoir. Therefore, the thermal breakthrough does not necessarily mean the end of the lifetime of a doublet. It is also shown that the effect of heterogeneities on the thermal retardation factor is small. Three successful optimization sequences in two different reservoirs are described in this thesis. It is shown that, from an economical standpoint, is makes little sense to assume a doublet lifetime of more than 30 years. Furthermore, the effectiveness at which a geothermal doublet is able to deplete a reservoir (recovery factor) and profitability of a geothermal doublet are closely interlinked. However, a higher recovery factor does not necessarily mean that the doublet is more profitable and vice versa. There exists an optimum well spacing for doublets positioned in homogeneous reservoirs, such that additional gain of later breakthrough (when placing the production well further away from the injector) is negated by the loss in pressure support of the injection well. This optimum well spacing is found to be an important factor, influencing the profitability in homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs. In addition, it is found that the optimum well spacing of a doublet for greenhouse heating is the same as the optimum well spacing of a doublet for spatial heating. The heat production from an aquifer can be maximized through the usage of multiple doublet layouts. It is found that, even in a heterogeneous reservoir, it is best to use a checkers-board well arrangement, which is more effective than a tramrail well arrangement.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van der Hoek, J.P. (mentor)","2012","The increasing occurrence of organic micro pollutants (OMPs) detected in river- and surface waters raises concerns for safe drinking water supply. Riverbank filtration (RBF) might be able to provide an effective barrier against most OMPs; however the removal mechanisms in the riverbank are not yet fully understood. The purpose of this study was to understand the main mechanism (biodegradation and/or sorption) for removal of OMPs during RBF. RBF was simulated by performing batch experiments using river water and riverbank sand from the river Lek near drinking water company Oasen in Bergambacht, the Netherlands. A distinction was made between biodegradation and sorption by comparing bottles treated with and without sodium azide, a biocide which inactivates the bioactivity. Furthermore different experimental conditions were studied; the effect of the river water matrix and the effect of dosing an additional C source (acetate) at regular intervals. The experiments were performed under oxic and anoxic conditions to mimic different redox zones in RBF. Anoxic conditions were present, established by the reduction of nitrate. No nutrient limitation was observed under oxic and anoxic conditions. Furthermore, results showed that the dose of 0.4 g/L sodium azide was too low to completely suppress the bioactivity. This led to an underestimation of the biodegradation of OMPs in this study. Therefore the determined biodegradation only gave an indication but did not represent reality; gemfibrozil, 2,4-D, diclofenac, and diuron showed the highest biodegradation. OMP removal did not vary significantly between different experimental conditions. This may indicate that the OMP dose per mass of sand was too low in the batch bottles; meaning that not enough OMPs were available for microorganisms to be able to determine differences in removal. Furthermore, this report showed that measuring parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), bioactivity (ATP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) gave a better representation of the occurring processes in the batch bottles when measured in the sand phase than in the aqueous phase. Finally, it was concluded that the amount of proteins and carbohydrates present in the biofilm in riverbank sand was directly related to the bioactivity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Introduction Flood risks can be reduced by either reducing the probability or the consequences of a flooding. These consequences can be quantified with flood damage models. Such models determine flood damage based on the water depth and the land use. This thesis will investigate the need to also use the flood duration as input parameter. Problem definition Besides the water depth, also other factors determine the resulting flood damages. These factors are often not taken into account in flood damage models. One of these influences is the flood duration. The longer a flooding lasts, the larger the material damage, and especially damage due to interruption will be. Flood duration causes interruptions and extra material damages. Taking into account flood duration can, therefore, theoretically make flood damage models more accurate. Flood duration predictions are, however, at the moment rarely done. This thesis aims to get both a qualitative and quantitative understanding of flood duration and the importance of flood duration for damage assessments. Research This thesis aims to explore the possibilities of assessing flood duration for flood risk management. This is approached by the following steps. 1. Development of a better understanding of flood duration. By looking at different areas and flood threats, a flood type categorization was developed and durations were estimated for each flood type 2. Exploration of the influence of flood duration on damage. A modeling method to roughly estimate the duration-dependent damage was developed. The framework of this method may also be useful for future duration dependent flood damage models. 3. Two case studies were carried out to study flood duration and its influence on damage in more detail: First the Betuwe and Tieler & Culemburgerwaard area was studied and secondly the area threatened by a breach at the Parksluizen in Rotterdam was focused on. Different scenarios were used with varying breach locations, measures and use of outlet and drainage structures. Results 1. The most important factors which determine the flood duration are duration necessary to repair the breaches, the possibilities for drainage by gravity, the elevation and elevation variation in the area and the magnitude of the flood event. Flooding durations in the Netherlands vary between hours and about one year. 2. Adding flood duration as input to flood damage models adds a little extra accuracy. This is limited because flood duration is correlated with the water depth. With the current flood damage accuracy, incorporating flood duration is only useful for specific cost benefit analysis related to measures that aim to change the flood duration. Conclusions and recommendations Flood duration can be significant for large floods in low and endyked areas. In these cases flood duration can also have a significant impact on the damage. However, a complex economic model is necessary to quantify this. Therefore, flood duration can only reach its full value as an input, in combination with better economic modeling.","flood damage; flood damage models; flood duration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2012","Due to the high demand of energy and steel, new dry bulk terminals have to be build and existing terminals are being forced to expand. Conceptual design of dry bulk terminals is one of the main activities which is conducted at Heavy Industry and Logistics, an Advisory Group of the consultancy firm Royal Haskoning DHV (RHDHV). It would be beneficial if designers could gain a quick insight in the required characteristics of main terminal components based on demands and possibilities, without the need to perform many calculations or to develop a new calculation model for each new project. Furthermore, there are some design aspects which cannot be easily evaluated using conventional methods. Added insight could be achieved with the help of a design support tool. The objective of this thesis has been to develop a design support tool which can be used during the conceptual design of a dry bulk terminal. The tool should function as a guide during the early stages of the design of a terminal. It should give a better understanding in the different options which can be chosen and should be able to create a terminal model based on key parameters provided by user input. Dry bulk terminals are worldwide used as a buffer between an incoming flow and an outgoing flow of bulk solids material. Each dry bulk terminal has a ‘sea-side’, a ‘land-side’ and an ‘internal terminal’ part. Depending on the flow direction of the bulk material, the terminal is called import terminal or export terminal. A terminal is characterised by its two functions: handling and storage. Handling can be divided in different sub-functions or processes. To these processes different terminal components and means of transport are related. To keep the model generic it is chosen to only implement functions and components which can be found on every terminal. The characteristics and common performances of all these components, processes and means of transport are investigated, which has led to empirical values and capacity ratios (EV&CR) which are used in the design support tool...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""
