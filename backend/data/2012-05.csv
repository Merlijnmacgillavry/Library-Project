Fatigue cycling of coupon specimens was performed in order to find a relation between the SERR and the delamination growth rate. A power law (Paris-type) relation was established. Using this relation and the relation between SERR and delamination length, delamination growth predictions were produced. This predictions agreed well with the results of the coupon tests.

Comparing professional practices between industrial designers and mechanical engineers in perceptions and procedures during product development","Xu, C.","Badke-Schaub, P. (mentor); Coimbra Cardoso, C.M. (mentor)","2012","The objective of this research is to find differences between industrial designers and mechanical engineers in perception and procedures during product development. This research has focused on cooperation between multidisciplinary teams’ participants - both industrial designers and mechanical engineers, because current innovation processes require more and more cooperation between many different disciplines. Multidisciplinary cooperation is a valuable research topic to bring more productivity and better understanding to team members. And one of the most frequently seen cooperation in product development projects is the cooperation between the industrial design and mechanical engineering disciplines. Differences between these two disciplines in professional practice are in need of research. Doing this research can provide analyzed results which may reveal the fundamental causes and phenomena. It can provide insights which can help improve performance in projects involving these two disciplines for later cooperation. During this research, eight face-to-face interviews have been performed. Four professional industrial designers and four mechanical engineers have participated in this research. One industrial designer and one mechanical engineer are from the same design agency or organization which has been involved in multidisciplinary projects. Some interesting findings and results have come out. Trainings have been fundamental in forming these professionals’ way of thinking, their way of problem solving and their way of carrying out their skills. Trainings contain two parts - academic training and career training. Academic training influences their knowledge foundation, while career training influences their current approaches on projects with the other discipline. Self-perception and perception of the other discipline have the consistency that designers focus more on shaping and forming the outside of products while engineers focus on functions inside of the products. Industrial designers are more familiar with iterative approaches to diverge and converge in ideas with the aim of getting closer to an optimal solution; Mechanical engineers are often taking a straight-line approach where one solution is worked out in great detail, with the aim of meeting clients/customers’ requirements. Industrial designers see the value of a multidisciplinary team in helping them realize their concept or idea, allowing them to see real progress into prototyping, or even into production. Also they emphasized on how it can improve the quality of products’ credibility. Mechanical engineers see the value of a multidisciplinary team at the social level, helping them learn to communicate with industrial designers. With some success and failure projects which interviewees had experienced, expectations from both sides have been mentioned. The ideal scenario for a working environment, how the working procedures may be improved, and how to solve time and budget limitations are all elaborated. Interviewees also have put some recommendations forward. Their recommendations cover communication issues and issues caused by mutual perception bias. Differences and commonalities of these two disciplines, issues that occur during multidisciplinary cooperation, and new insights have all been written with a general conclusion. This report notes several limitations of its research, and some recommendations for further study will be presented at the end.","industrial design and mechanical engineering; multidisciplinary cooperation; differences; perception; product development; issues; empirical research; professional practice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kester, L. (mentor); Bakker-Wu, S. (mentor)","2012","This thesis was performed in cooperation with the Amsterdam-based strategy-consulting firm Spring Associates. This firm is specialized in providing strategic support for a wide range of companies in financial services, new business development and sustainability. However, Spring Associates is facing difficulties in efficiently attracting new clients in the latter segment. The firm invests a disproportionate amount of time and effort in preparing client meetings to make sure they convince the potential client of the firm’s knowledge and problem solving skills. An internal analysis revealed that this approach is not satisfactory, mainly because of the need for in-depth knowledge to determine relevant items for the specific client, and the need to increase client focus during these meetings. The aim of this thesis was to design an analysis tool that Spring Associates can strategically apply for sustainability consulting during client meetings. This thesis focused on the food industry as this high-impact industry directly influences our lives, economies and the environment. Many researchers studied the theoretical definition of sustainability, its implications for the food industry, and company specific ambitions and motivational factors. It can be concluded that sustainability has many definitions, of which the ‘Environment, Social and Governance’ dimensions abstractly explain its broad scope. The ‘life cycle approach’ identifies more concretely how sustainability may affect each step within a product life cycle. However, the exact implications of sustainability in different businesses, and the food industry in particular, remain ambiguous. For example, identified company drivers for sustainable development appear to be highly diverse and theoretical frameworks for implementation and integration are often too abstract to be applied in practice. These conclusions led to the definition of research questions for further qualitative research on sustainability in practice. A total of 14 interviews were conducted with representatives of companies in all steps of the food industry cycle. The main findings described the general top-down integration process of sustainability within these companies, i.e. strategic incorporation is often followed by departmental implementation. Furthermore, all aspects of a company, such as growth drivers, strategy, chain position and company type, influence their sustainable development scope. It is demonstrated that companies’ ambition, strategy and implementation methods are important input parameters for the degree of their challenges and opportunities for further sustainable development. The study has also revealed some interesting market developments in the food industry in particular that highly affect their sustainable development processes. The above insights were evaluated in the synthesis phase, which determined the framework for the final analysis tool design. This framework focuses on the first meeting(s) between Spring Associates and their potential client, as this meeting determines the first impression of both parties and the wish for a follow-up. The framework specified the recommended approach and steps for this meeting. Spring Associates’ employees were closely involved in the steps of the tool design process, namely: user-oriented product development, internal concept testing and beta tests. After and during each step, the analysis tool concept was challenged, prioritized and optimized. The three beta tests demonstrated clearly that the analysis tool prototype performed highly satisfactory for both parties in all different test situations. Spring Associates and the client users provided their useful feedback of the tool effectiveness. This resulted in the final tool design: The Spring 360°. The Spring 360° is an A1 discussion document that effectively facilitates the co-identification and co-evaluation of a client’s situation and sustainability ambition during the first client meeting(s). The tool consists of seven identification steps that are organized in the same top-down way as the food industry integrated sustainability: starting with abstractly discussing ‘What is your vision on sustainability?’ to ending concretely ‘What methods do you apply for sustainable development?’. This client-focused approach allows for effective analysis of the client situation, value propositions of Spring Associates and thereby an efficient follow-up strategy. Recommended preparation efforts are similar to Spring Associates’ current approach, making it easily implementable. The final deliverable consists of a Spring 360° template, and a thorough preparation manual, implementation and follow-up strategy.","consulting; sustainability; analysis tool; strategy; food industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-31","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Van Overeem, J. (mentor); Onderwater, M.C. (mentor)","2012","This master thesis aims to determine the best design option and the feasibility of an artificial sandy beach along the Old Boulevard of Batumi, Georgia. The coastline south of Batumi is affected by erosion problems. The coastal stretch between the port in the north and the Chorokhi River south of Batumi should be protected. In 2010 Alkyon/ARCADIS proposed a detailed design to protect this coastal stretch. The beaches of Batumi originally consist of pebble. In the northern part of the coastal stretch, the so called Old Boulevard, a lot of tourist activities takes place. For this reason sandy beaches where requested by the client along this part of the coast. In the design proposed in 2010, pocket beaches have been envisaged here. In this thesis an alternative design for the pocket beaches are proposed. This design should contain more sand and less visual structures, opposed to the pocket beaches proposed in the 2010 study. In order to determine suitable measures and alternatives, the morphological impact of the measures and the corresponding sediment transports have been considered. The sediment transport rates have been computed using numerical models. For the longshore transports the model UNIBEST-LT is used and the cross-shore losses are determined with the use of the XBeach model. With the use of gained information of the behaviour of a sandy beach and possible measures to optimise the design of an artificial sandy beach, 7 alternatives are proposed. The 7 alternatives are compared and assessed with the use of a Multi-Criteria analysis (MCA). From the MCA can be concluded that a perched beach with a beach placed parallel to the boulevard is the most promising alternative. A preliminary design has been prepared for this alternative. The perched beach consist of a sandy beach with a width of 135 meter. At approximately 180 meter from the shoreline a submerged breakwater is present with a submergence of 0.5 meter. The pocket beaches as designed in the 2010 study and the preliminary design of the perched beach as designed in this study are finally compared. The pocket beaches have a partly sandy beach and contain some undesirable visual structures. The perched beach fulfils the wish of a fully sandy beach with almost no visual structures, the costs are however considerably higher than for the pocket beaches, 25.5 M versus 56.6 M. It can be concluded that the two options have their own benefits and drawbacks. The preference depends on which aspect is valued as most important and/or which aspect is valued as least important.","erosion; sediment transport; perched beach; Georgia; artificial sandy beach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kumar, S.S. (mentor)","2012","Transactional memory is a lock-free parallel programming model, which aims at replacing conventional lock-based threaded programming techniques, currently used by multi-core systems. These techniques are difficult to implement and impose unnecessary overheads caused by conservative programming practices. In this thesis, the scalability potential of a transactional memory system, called TMFab, was explored for different numbers of processors and it was concluded that for more than 4 processors the system presents reduced scalability, due to an increase in the validation overhead. In response to this observation, a novel validation scheme was proposed which reduces this overhead, first by allowing multiple transactions to perform their validations and commit operations concurrently, and second by removing the need for broadcasting messages between the active transactions. A distributed shared memory scheme was used to increase the validation and memory access throughput, as well as allow for transactions to commit concurrently on different memory partitions. The two architectures were compared by means of SystemC simulation, and a maximum of 2.5x validation speedup was observed for the modified design, together with a 2.7x reduction in memory access latency. In total, the modified design achieved a maximum execution speedup of 30% over the original, for the benchmarks that were used. Furthermore, the modified system guarantees sequential consistency even in corner case scenarios.","Hardware Transactional Memory; TMFab; TMFv2; Concurrent; Validation; Chip Multiprocessor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Digital maps, based on which navigation systems in vehicles operate, require frequent updates to reflect changes in real world. These changes currently being issued using off-line mechanisms are cumbersome in nature as well costly. Therefore a need exists, to come up with a wireless solution which can not only perform updates without human intervention but also be cost effective. IEEE 802.11p a standard, enabling vehicles to communicate with each other to form a Vehicular Area Network (VANET), is being pushed as a technology for future safety in vehicles. The high data rates and communication range capabilities of the technology lead us to investigate it as a viable solution for providing map updates. Our thesis work is first of its kind where real world mobility traces are used in study of VANET. These traces, obtained from GPS devices used for navigation in vehicles, are collected for all vehicles moving in and around the country of Netherlands for entire 24 hours. No existing network simulators have the capabilities to work with them due to the enormity of the traces. In this article we propose our own simulator DC-PIC, which is simple and scalable in nature. It is designed using concepts of divide and conquer and particle in cell, which are widely used in the field of high performance computing. The feasibility study of application of map updates involves investigation into the degree of support required from Road Side Unit (RSU). We analyze influence of various parameters of RSU on spreading updates to vehicles and based on which we propose values for these parameters suitable for our application. The empirical analysis of mobility traces is performed to provide insight into suitable locations for potential RSUs. Further, empirical analysis is conducted to obtain insight into mobility patterns and communication capabilities of vehicles in VANETs. Finally, we propose a simple and distributive dissemination algorithm named Adaptive and Distributive Broadcasting algorithm (ADB) which provides spread of updates comparable with that of flooding algorithm but without the unnecessary overhead of excessive redundant messages and collisions.","VANET","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-05-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2012","The development of social networks has changed the way we communicate from a personal conversation into a broadcast with a world-wide audience. Social networks have proven themselves useful during protests and natural disasters by providing a platform to share ideas and offer help to those in need. However, due to the reliance on the Internet there have been situations where social networks were unable to function. Examples are broken submarine cables and countries that have restricted Internet access for residents, such as Egypt and Libya during the uprising in the beginning of 2011. Alternative communication methods are available, such as mobile ad-hoc networking, but suffer a common problem, large quantities unwanted messages, better known as spam. We propose a novel approach called ""Hearsay"" to combat spam. Our approach suppresses spam in gossiping networks by utilising social network information. Gossiping networks are characterised by users carrying devices capable of creating ad-hoc communication links with devices nearby. Messages are exchanged using a gossip protocol, spreading them throughout the network. Without suppression a message would reach every user making it ideal for spamming. Prioritising messages based on personal and social relations keeps messages within a social group. Users assign a rank to each user they interact with and based on that rank messages are forwarded to other members. Through simulations we show the feasibility of Hearsay, as a large-scale deployment is not possible within the set time frame. We ran our simulations within the multi-agent modeling environment NetLogo, which showed the effectiveness of using trust to suppress spam.","spam; pocket switched networks; trustrank; social networks; mobile; trust; ad-hoc networking; gossiping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor)","2012","This project focuses on the Peulen company. The Peulen company is currently active in the woodworking industry as a) machine supplier. The first phase of this project is the internal analysis of the Peulen company concerning the current state of the company. This is done in order to establish the strengths and weaknesses of the Peulen company. In addition to this, the open innovation model literature is analyzed and compared with the panel car: a product that has been developed by Peulen based on open innovation. Through the internal analysis it became obvious that Peulen did not fit perfectly within the ideal definition of a business-to-business company, and the same applies to their open innovation project: the aforementioned panel car. The second phase is the external analysis which includes the environment which the company Peulen belongs to. In this phase, the competitors, trends and developments within the woodworking industry are also analyzed. This provides information concerning the opportunities for and threats to the company. The most interesting opportunities are the (use of?) biomass energy and the growing CnC woodworking machine market. From the competitor analysis it is obvious that the main competitors of the company Peulen are already selling CnC woodworking machines, and it is clear that Peulen lags behind on this point. Using the results of the internal and external analysis, the SWOT analysis is carried out in the third phase, in order to evaluate Peulen’s strengths, weaknesses, oppor¬tunities and threats. This analysis has been used to generate a strat¬egy and to determine the best future direction for the company. This analysis leads to the two business search fields: the use of? biomass energy and entering the CnC woodworking machine business for the Peulen company. To determine which industry is more attractive for Peulen, Porter’s Five Forces model has been applied. This resulted in the choice to go further with the business search field biomass energy. The fourth phase is about further exploring the new business search field: the use of biomass energy for the woodworking market. By conducting market research into this field, some criteria were obtained which Peulen should focus on when entering this market. To gain more insight into this market for Peulen, relevant literature about the use of wood burners in different industries and the different types of wood burners was consulted. Apart from the literature, the results of a questionnaire about mulch burners were also looked at. , Based on this research, some criteria for the new product in the biomass energy market have been created for Peulen. The criteria for a wood burner are as follows:  Power capacity = < 100 kwh  Automatic input of the fuel  Fuel: Mulch (wood) Within this kind of market of the biomass energy , the competitors for this kind of burner have been examined and the final criteria for the new concept have been determined. This resulted into two burners with different power capacities: one with a power capacity of <20 kW, and the other 60-100 kW. The fifth phase concerns the open innovation model strategy. Through adding the business model of the internal analysis, the possible implementation of the open innovation model within the current business model of Peulen is examined. This is based on the literature about open innovation. The sixth phase is based on the mulch burner. This product/concept will be developed using the results of the market research on biomass energy and the open innovation model strategy. Therefore, it serves as an example for the new direction and the open innovation strategy. Finally, this report finishes with conclusions and recommen¬dations for the continuity of the project.","open innovation model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Solar photovoltaic (PV) modules are able to compete with the electricity grid in more and more European countries. Combined with the current sustainability trend, predictions can be made of a market growth for PV systems. However, conventional PV modules are not considered visually attractive by a lot of consumers. This statement is confirmed by user research performed in the analysis phase of this project, along with a preference for PV systems that are easily installed, have low maintenance, and are customizable. Users indicate that attractive PV modules should look good and be well-integrated in the building they are placed on, i.e. not look like a late addition. This project aims to find opportunities to meet this request for an attractive module system by means of literature research and contact with Ubbink Solar, a PV module producer. Technical possibilities of PV cells have been researched in terms of alternatives in efficiency, price, colors, and transparency options. The existing PV system has been researched in terms of module structure, manufacturing, materials, balance of system, and connecting PV systems to the grid. PV modules on buildings have been researched, focusing on the buildings of Europe, placing modules on buildings, and renovations in Europe. Additionally, an overview of the PV market in Europe is described. Finally, now that the possibilities are known, a survey is used to identify and prioritize requirements for a PV system according to the user. The results of the analysis have been used to formulize a design goal: ‘Designing a PV building envelope system that is: esthetically pleasing as well as fitting in the environment, easy to install, has high efficiency, and interacts with the user, to be employed in the renovation of residential buildings in Europe as from 2014.’ In the conceptualization phase, several ideas have been generated. After evaluation, the decision is made to design Ivy, a solar conservatory system that not only provides light, panoramic view and an attractive design, but also utilizes PV technology to generate green electricity for any kind of home. Conservatories are a popular choice as a means to bring more light into your home and offer a nice view into the garden. They will add considerable value to any real estate property. Some people are discouraged by the amount of work, mess and labor costs required to install a conservatory; the same concerns arise if installing PV modules. The Ivy addresses these concerns while also generating green energy for your home. Semi-transparent modules are placed in the conservatory to allow the user to actually see their solar cell generate electricity while enjoying a view to the garden. The modules are slid up into elegant aluminum profiles to fasten them, and at the same time connecting them electrically thanks to a new junction box system. This will provide a clean look to the design while decreasing the time and money required for installation. Users who will want to increase the generated power may expand by installing matching opaque modules on the roof. The opaque modules replace conventional roof coverings such as shingles or bitumen as they are weatherproof. The Ivy brings the advantages of a PV system and a modular conservatory together into an elegant solution that will fit most European homes, hereby meeting the goal set for this project.","PV; Solar; Industrial Design; Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Television has been an integral part of our lives since the 1950s and watching television is still one of our favorite activities today, providing us viewers with news, information and entertainment. In fact, TV shows are the most common conversation topics around the world and the subject of more than a billion tweets. Nevertheless, aside from television sets being evolved with ever improving specifications, the way we watch television remained a passive activity. Meanwhile, new technologies offer new opportunities in the way we watch television. On-demand viewing and other digital or Internet-based services offer viewers freedom of choice; to view what they want, when they want and where they want. Social media is used to share TV experiences and to find out what others are watching at the same moment. Mobile devices, with tablets as the latest addition, facilitate this trend and change the way we watch television in a truly interactive and multi-screen experience. Furthermore, people use these devices as a ‘second screen’ for browsing relevant information or consuming related content on the Internet A multitude of second-screen websites and apps have already been developed. However, aside from several tailor made applications, none of the general applications released in the Netherlands has been an innovative newcomer yet. All the general applications only have basic functionalities and miss real added value for viewers in comparison with other existing applications or websites. Therefore, a user study has been conducted to obtain to obtain rich and deep insights into the needs and dreams of prospective users regarding second-screen applications. With the knowledge and insights gained during the user study and the analysis phase of the project, a second-screen application has been designed for watching a football match live on television. Its key features are the possibilities to listen to commentary on matches by other users, instead of annoying reporters on television, and to watch video recordings of match moments uploaded by fans in the stands. The final design clearly fulfills a need, because a lot of football fans are annoyed by irritating commentaries on matches by several Dutch football reporters. Furthermore, the application enhances the engagement of the viewers with the matches broadcasted on television and enables real social interaction between football fans. In addition, the application has excellent future prospects concerning feasibility and marketing opportunities, and after a successful introduction, new concepts will possibly proceed for other sports or even entertainment shows.","second screen; television; social media; social TV; football; commentary; annoying reporters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Human Information & Communication Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The goal of the design is to improve the way in which information is provided to parents. Parents need information that is up-to-date regarding the illness and the state of affairs in the hospital. Also, the possibility to read information afterwards, which was given to parents orally, and the possibility to ask questions at any time will improve communication between parents and medical staff. A child who is diagnosed with cancer will be treated in an academic hospital and for less complex care they sometimes go to a local hospital. Treatment consists of outpatient appointments and admissions in the hospital. During the treatment there are many different disciplines involved. An academic hospital is partly an educational environment en therefor there is a constant flow of employees and students. The day-to-day structure of a hospital is often perceived as being chaotic by parents. Parent and child are often both present while receiving information. Information is provided in many different forms. Most of the time, the doctor explains and the nurse translates. Information is mostly one-way; the parent and child only receive the information. Due to lack of space, conversations that are private are sometimes conducted in a shared room or in the corridor. Especially when the treatment progresses for a longer time, the structure in providing information diminishes. Next to personalised information, the hospital also provides standardised information. This information is often managed in a top-down way and not up-to-date. A lot of ad-hoc information is processed as notes to keep parents, the child and employees informed. This information is not centrally controlled. Medical information on the child is stored in different electronic systems and paper documents, depending on the discipline. These systems are not user friendly, sometimes due to the usage by employees, sometimes due to the design of the system, but often due to a combination of these problems. Bottlenecks are often solved by employees in their own way and they see these problems as a ‘fact of life’, something which they don’t really think about. The chaotic day-to-day structure and all the meetings don’t contribute to transferring information in a good and clear way. Although it is the child who is ill, the parents have the need for information. Teenagers try to focus on the nice things in life instead of on the disease. The information to younger children is mostly about preparing them for the upcoming treatments. Because the parents have the need for information, they often go on the internet to find that information, even more because hospitals don’t provide medical information on their websites. The best way to provide information is to give the right information at the right place at the right time. The internet doesn’t comply with these aspects. This is the reason why I chose to focus on a digital information system which will try to comply as much as possible with these aspects. From the analysis and vision described above I designed the structure of a digital information system. After that I made a toolkit in which I describe how to provide information with this system. The information system runs on a smart tablet. You can take it anywhere and it can provide assistance when the user is talking to an employee of the hospital. The system is divided in 3 parts: a personal database, a general hospital database and a community database. The latter serves as a platform for different kinds of initiatives. The general hospital database is designed to prepare the parents for the stay in the hospital and practical issues. The personal database serves as a diary, agenda and other personal information. Only authorised people can access this database. The toolkit is a guideline, and it explains how to provide information in the best way possible. After designing the system I evaluated and tested it for one particular form of cancer; the neuroblastoma. The smart tablet I used was an iPad. The 2 parents with whom I tested the system were very enthusiastic about the design. To know if it will work in practice, more testing, research and design will be needed. I hope this will be the start of a digital (r)evolution in the hospital!","informatiesysteem; ouders; NKOC; kind; kanker","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor)","2012","Door toename van omvang van de zeescheepvaart en door schaalvergroting in de zeevaart zal de zeetoegang IJmuiden over enkele jaren niet meer voldoen aan de eisen. Er zal daarom een nieuwe en grotere sluis worden aangelegd in het bestaande sluizencomplex. In een locatiestudie uitgevoerd door Rijkswaterstaat is vastgesteld dat de beste locatie voor de nieuwe sluis zal zijn tussen de aanwezige Middensluis en Noordersluis. De beschikbare ruimte voor de nieuwe sluis is daarom beperkt. Een rechte roldeur, die normaal bij brede zeesluizen wordt toegepast, is door de grote noodzakelijke breedte naast de sluiskolk niet mogelijk in de nieuwe zeesluis. Uit een variantenstudie naar mogelijke sluisdeuren voor de nieuwe zeesluis in IJmuiden bleek de gekromde roldeur het gunstigst uit de multicriteria-analyse te komen. Vervolgens is een onderzoek gedaan naar het toe te passen steunpunt voor de gekromde roldeur. Mogelijke opties waren steunpunten loodrecht op de deur, loodrecht op de doorvaart en in de richting van de boog. Bij een oplegging in de richting van de boog worden de krachten in de boog geminimaliseerd, daarentegen zijn de krachten in het sluishoofd groot en moeten zware pinnen worden toegepast om de deur te fixeren in de richting van de boog. In geval van steunpunten loodrecht op de doorvaart treden er grotere momenten op in de deur en is er alsnog een ingewikkelder systeem noodzakelijk die de deur zal inklemmen tussen de deurkas/deurnis loodrecht op de doorvaart. Bij de derde optie, een oplegging loodrecht op de deur, treden de grootste momenten op in de deur. Het bewegingswerk en de oplegging daarentegen kunnen simpel worden uitgevoerd waardoor bewezen technieken kunnen worden toegepast. Gekozen is daarom voor de steunpunten loodrecht op de deur. Er is een ontwerp gemaakt voor de gekromde roldeur met steunpunten loodrecht op de deur. De hoofdconstructie bestaat uit 9 horizontale liggers aan de binnen- en buitenzijde van de sluisdeur. Deze horizontale liggers zijn per laag met elkaar verbonden door middel van horizontale vakwerken. Daarnaast worden drijfkisten in de gekromde roldeur toegepast om het eigengewicht van de deur tijdens verplaatsen te reduceren en om in geval van onderhoud de deur drijvend te kunnen verwisselen met de reserve deuren. De nivelleerschuiven bevinden zich onder de drijfkisten. Ter plaatse van de drijfkisten en de nivelleerschuiven zijn de horizontale vakwerken vervangen door platen verstijfd met troggen. Aan de binnen-en buitenzijde van de deur is een huidplaat verstijfd met troggen aangebracht om positief en negatief verval te kunnen keren. De troggen zijn verticaal aangebracht en worden onderbroken door de horizontale liggers. Het ontwerp is vergeleken met het ontwerp van een puntdeur en sectordeur. Uit deze vergelijking blijkt dat de gekromde roldeur qua kosten, afmetingen en bewegingswerk gunstiger is dan de sectordeur en puntdeur. De stichtingskosten voor de sluisdeur en het bewegingswerk samen zijn ongeveer 115 miljoen euro. Dit is lager dan de stichtingskosten van de puntdeuren en sectordeuren met bewegingswerk. Vooral in oppervlaktebeslag is de gekromde roldeur een stuk gunstiger dan de puntdeur en de sectordeur. De gekromde roldeur neemt qua oppervlak weinig ruimte in en is daardoor een goed alternatief voor de rechte roldeur om grote sluiskolkbreedtes te overspanning wanneer weinig ruimte aanwezig is of ruimte erg schaars is.","sluisdeur; gekromde roldeur; Nieuwe Zeesluis IJmuiden","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering and Structural Engineering","","Steel structures and hydraulic structures","",""

(mentor)","2012","Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) makes the vehicle follow its predecessor at a close but safe distance, and uses information received from other vehicles to accomplish this task. In literature and in practice, the control method mostly applied for CACC is proportional integral derivative (PID) control, possibly with some refinement for gear shifting or comfort. The control method called model predictive control (MPC) can also be used for CACC, and from literature it appears to be more promising than PID, because of its ability to anticipate future situations and to implement constraints directly into the control algorithm. MPC applies the first input of a control input sequence that optimises a performance index calculated from predicted system behaviour, based on a prediction model, subject to operational constraints, in a receding horizon approach. Furthermore, literature has shown that with PID the use of state information from the second predecessor or the platoon leader, in addition to the direct predecessor’s states, can improve the CACC performance. Therefore, in this thesis the approach of using such additional communicated information from either the second predecessor or the platoon leader is combined with the use of MPC as control method. The goal is to investigate whether any of these two configurations give an increase in performance compared with similar configurations with PID as control method, and compared with a more basic configuration that uses just the direct predecessor’s state information with either MPC or PID. Also, the possibly added value of using communicated predicted states, in addition to current states, with MPC is investigated. The CACC controllers are designed to control the throttle, the brakes, and the gears, subject to operational constraints on acceleration, velocity, and vehicle-to-vehicle distance. The PID-based CACC controller contains a proportional feedback of the errors in velocity, position, and acceleration, combined with an automatic transmission scheme, and the control input is restricted at time instants at which a constraint is (almost) violated. The MPC-based CACC controller at each time step minimises the expected errors in position and velocity and the corresponding input variation. The MPC prediction model is obtained by approximating a nonlinear vehicle model by a piecewise affine (PWA) model, and converting the MPC optimisation problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. In this project, tuning is done by applying simulated annealing for a scenario involving four CACC-controlled vehicles following a platoon leader. Then, the tuned controllers are implemented in a validation scenario comprising a larger platoon undergoing a longer simulation. The results from simulating this validation scenario show that the PID-based CACC controller has a low responsiveness, compared with MPC, and lets the first two vehicles crash. With MPC several peaks and oscillations in throttle/brake input and acceleration occur, and it is expected that with the MPC-based CACC controllers as designed and tuned here, string stability will not always be achieved for increasing platoon lengths. It is expected that properly retuning will result in better performing controllers. However, due to limited time, this retuning could not be performed within the scope of this project, and is therefore left as a recommendation. Therefore, only preliminary conclusions can be formulated, which are that MPC should be preferred over PID as a control method for CACC, because it is safer. Moreover, with MPC it should be preferred to, in addition to the current states of the direct predecessor, at least use the current states of the second predecessor and/or the predicted future states from the direct predecessor, in order to achieve better string stability.","system & control; model predictive control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Zolezzi, G. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor)","2012","Local geometrical perturbations in alluvial channels can generate a pattern of alternate bars. Each bar is accompanied by a pool at the other side of the channel. This pool can decrease the strength of the bank, which can result in bank failure and bars can hinder navigation. Furthermore, non-migrating alternate bars are considered to be a possible cause of meandering. Previous linear analyses and laboratory experiments showed that these bars arise downstream of perturbations in the relatively narrow and deep channels corresponding to subresonant conditions, but both upstream and downstream of perturbations in the relatively wide and shallow channels corresponding to superresonant conditions. Previous numerical computations reproduced alternate bars under subresonant conditions, but failed to do so under superresonant conditions until the recent 2D depth-averaged computations using Delft3D. This study is an advance on the former modelling work of van der Meer et al. and has the objective to assess to what extent the numerical results agree with linear theory and experimental observations and to investigate the development of bars upstream of a bend under superresonant conditions. The model is validated by reproducing the few available superresonant experiments in a U-curved flume. Downstream of the bend, the numerical model and experimental observations clearly matched. The numerical model, however, was not able to reproduce the development of non-migrating alternate bars upstream of the bend at the experimental conditions. It appeared that the point of resonance was over-predicted by the numerical model. The observed wave lengths and bed-topography spectra complied with the literature. The numerical simulations were unstable for realistic values of the horizontal eddy viscosity (O(10-5 m2/s) for small-scale models). The latter was therefore increased to stabilize the simulations. This increase was the cause of overpredicting the point of resonance by the numerical model. For the bedload transport procedure Delft3D offers two options, the ‘upwind’ procedure and the ‘central’ procedure. The former introduces numerical diffusion, whereas the latter is less stable. The shortening of bars for large width-to-depth ratios, as observed by former numerical simulations, is probably the result of numerical diffusion. The ‘upwind’ procedure causes sediment deposits and scour to be concentrated near the banks, because the higher modes (for example the central mode) within the alternate-bar spectrum were damped. Therefore ‘upwind’ bar peaks are higher and can become inactive, because these bars run dry before they are fully developed and consequently have a smaller wave length. The alternate-bar pattern upstream of the bend under superresonant conditions was found to develop from downstream to upstream, in accordance with linear theory, only if no perturbation was applied at the upstream boundary. A development from upstream to downstream dominated in case of a perturbed upstream boundary. The computed alternate bars migrated invariably downstream, under both superresonant and subresonant conditions. I ascribe this to nonlinear effects, since the bars did migrate upstream under superresonant conditions, in accordance with linear theory, as long as their amplitudes were very small. This study has shown that alternate-bar formation cannot be solely understood from linear equations. It seems therefore recommendable to investigate the contribution of non-linear effects in a more quantitative way. The numerical model can become more accurate by improving the transverse bed slope effect formulation.","alternate bar; Delft3D; numerical analysis; overdeepening; superresonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P. (mentor); De By, R. (mentor)","2012","The relational data model is now more than 40 years old. It's good for very diferent scenarios and can handle certain types of data very well. But it isn't perfect. An increasing number of non-relational systems are being worked on, collectively called the 'NoSQL movement'. NoSQL is an umbrella term for a loosely defined class of non-relational datastores and best described as 'Not only SQL'. Examples are Google's BigTable and Amazon's Dynamo. These systems may provide advantages over relational databases, but generally lack the relational robustness for those advantages. In an atempt to modestly contribute to the current research in the field of geographical information systems, this research reports on a comparison of one such NoSQL datastore called Neo4j with the traditional relational database PostgreSQL when storing and querying spatial vector data. The goal of this study was to determine whether a traditional relational database system like PostGIS, or a NoSQL system, such as Neo4j-Spatial, would be more efective as the underlying technology for operating OpenStreetMap data. Neo4j is an embeddable graph database. Embeddable because it can be added to a Java-based application and used just like any other library, and graph database because the data model it uses to express its data is a graph, storing nodes and relationships that connect them, supporting user defined properties on both constructs. Multiple aspects are of interest when comparing spatial database systems. The evaluation methodology designed to compare the two, involves both objective measurements and subjective measurements based on documentation and experience. The objective tests include processing speed based on a predefined set of queries, disk space requirements, and scalability. Subjective tests include maturity/level of support, stability and ease of use. Meanwhile, the assessment framework applied for the objective tests could be used as a test suite for evaluating the performance and reliability of new spatial datastores. A test environment have been created using the same OpenStreetMap data in both the graph database and the relational database. While the systems have fundamental diferences, identical operations have been developed that provides equal results from diferently sized study areas. Regarding the objective measurements, the results of this research show that the graph database is most beneficial when queries can be expressed as traversals over local regions of a graph. Queries that are well-suited to this approach are, for example, shortest path analyses or connectivity queries. Bounding box queries were faster on the relational database. Regarding the subjective measurements, Neo4j provides a lot of functionality. Transaction support is a welcome addition and there are numerous ways to execute queries, for instance using Java, CQL or a geopipeline. The database model is schema-less and allows additions or adjustments to the schema without any major impact on the data model. As a Java component, it is relatively easy to implement Neo4j-Spatial as an embedded component in any Java program. PostgreGIS is by far the more mature database with a lot of functionality, documentation and support. Overall, this research shows that, in some cases, Neo4j should be considered as an alternative for specific tasks. A buyer's guide has been created in the form of a fow diagram to decide whether Neo4j- Spatial or PostGIS is suitable for a project. The two technologies, relational databases and non- relational database, will remain in usage side by side, each with the perfect fit for its own capabilities.","GIS; Geo; databases; NoSQL; Neo4j; PostgreSQL; measurements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","GIMA","",""

(mentor)","2012","Railway networks, such as the one in the Netherlands, form an important means of transportation, both for passengers, as well as for transporting goods. Train services carrying passengers often run according to a predefined schedule or timetable. When those train services are delayed, for example due to accidents or malfunctioning rolling stock, the affected train may not be able to run according to schedule any longer. When the railway network is dense and hosts different kinds of services, such as local and intercity services, this initial delay is easily passed on to other train services in the network, due to different stopping patterns and drive speeds. Human dispatchers, possibly aided by computer systems, make temporary modifications to the way the network is used by the trains running in the region of the disturbance. However, due to the high complexity and the limited time, these decisions may be optimal for only the designated area of the dispatcher, but far from optimal from a network perspective. Therefore, a railway network operator could have a major benefit from a system able to compute globally optimal decisions in the case of disturbances. This thesis is written as part of the development of such a system. Specifically, this project aims at applying Model Predictive Control (MPC) to railway networks. In MPC, a model of the system is used to predict the future behaviour of the system within a prediction horizon. The principle of receding horizon control is employed to compute an optimal future input sequence, such that a certain cost is minimized. This cost is the total delay in the network within the prediction horizon. The inputs of the controlled system are associated to the order of a train pair on a track. Train orders can be swapped at stations and junctions. As there are many of those points present in the network, swapping orders offers the most possibilities and is effective in a wide range of delay scenarios. Therefore, in this thesis only order swaps are considered. The system is modelled within a max-plus algebraic framework, which allows for a structured representation and systematic approach, where the latter is especially useful for future endeavours to exploit max-plus system theory, such that for example model reduction can be applied to the generally very large railway models. The algorithm presented in this thesis forms the basis for an MPC algorithm for railway networks. The development of a tailor made receding horizon control algorithm for railway networks, has not been carried out before. First an extension of the existing maxplus linear model is presented, such that a model which is uncertain in the parameters is obtained. This model already contains controllable train orders. The problem of finding the optimal order swaps, such that the total delay in the network is minimal, can be written as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. Several test cases were derived to highlight the various aspects of the receding horizon control algorithm, such as how it copes with different parameter estimations at various points in time. Through the use of a time-based control horizon, a significant reduction in computation time was achieved an provides a very good method to overcome the computational complexity encountered during optimal control of railway networks. Although the prediction horizon is defined in the discrete event domain, the algorithm is easily modified to also contain a time-based prediction horizon, allowing for more freedom in tuning of the prediction horizon and thus also computation times.","System & Control; Mechinal Engineering; Horizon Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Van Prooijen, B.C. (mentor)","2012","In this study the focus is on modelling turbulence anisotropy in open channel flows with the SWASH model. Turbulence anisotropy significantly influences the flow features of: channel flows with heterogeneous roughness conditions, curved open channel flows, compound channel flows with different floodplain depths, etc. The SWASH model is a non-hydrostatic wave-flow model, mainly used to predict the transformation of surface waves from offshore to the beach. For this study, adaptations were made to this SWASH model, in order to model turbulence anisotropy. Two different modelling approaches were used: RANS modelling and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The SWASH model is extended with a non-linear k-? closure to the RANS equations, since the standard linear closure does not take turbulence anisotropy into account. A 3D subgrid model is implemented to perform LES. The performance of the LES code and the RANS model with the non-linear k-? closure is tested on two flow geometries: an open channel flow with homogeneous bottom roughness conditions and an open channel flow with parallel smooth to rough bed sections. Results of the RANS computations, for both horizontal homogeneous and non-homogeneous open channel flow, show good agreement with laboratory measurements of Muller and Studerus [13], Nezu and Rodi [17] and Wang and Cheng [32]. Although there is a number of closure constants involved with the non-linear k-? model, additional tuning of these coefficients was not necessary for this study: both the homogeneous and non-homogenous test case were simulated successfully using the standard values proposed by Speziale [25]. With its low computational costs and robustness, the non-linear k-? model appears to be a useful extension to the SWASH wave-flow model. LES results for horizontal uniform flow are validated with DNS data of Moser, Kim and Mansour [12]. Especially near the bed the LES results deviate from the DNS data. The mean velocity, as well as the transverse and vertical turbulence intensities, is seriously underestimated. The deviation from the DNS data is related to the use of non- periodic boundary conditions, the coarse grid resolution, the size of the computational domain and the amount of numerical dissipation that is involved. Since it is the bottom region where secondary currents are generated, the use of the present LES code for problems involving heterogeneous roughness is not appropriate.","turbulence modelling; turbulence anisotropy; heterogeneous roughness; SWASH; k-?; non-linear; secondary currents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The problem is defined as computing the optimal continuous and discrete switching control to minimise a quadratic cost function that weights the states and the continuous controls. The original SLQR problem does not handle constraints on states, continuous or discrete controls, and there is no probabilistic behaviour. This thesis focuses on the discrete dynamics in a SLQR problem. The first part of the thesis describes the SLQR problem with discrete constraints, whereas the second part is dedicated to probabilistic switching behaviour. The problem with discrete constraints is described as finding the optimal hybrid switching policy that minimises a quadratic cost function, weighting states and continuous controls, without violating the discrete constraints. The problem with probabilistic switches is defined as finding the optimal hybrid switching policy that minimises an expected value of a quadratic cost function, weighting states and continuous controls. For the SLQR problem with discrete constraints a general relaxation framework is developed to simplify the representations of the value functions and the corresponding control strategies. It is shown that the closed loop performance of the obtained solution with the relaxation framework can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal solution. For the SLQR problem with probabilistic switches it is shown that a relaxation framework can only be developed when there are no discrete constraints involved. Finally, the thesis concludes with a few case studies to illustrate how the optimal hybrid control sequence is computed.","System & Control; Mechanical Engineering; LQR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The railway sector in the Netherlands is facing challenges in demand for higher capacity, aging safety systems, European demands to realize interoperability, implementation of modern rolling stock with less shunting performances and the need to standardize technologies. These challenges raise the question whether the Dutch train detection system, which detects the presence and absence of trains in railway sections, is prepared for these challenges and can ensure high performance levels in the light of these future developments. Through interviews with experts from the railway sector insights were gained in evaluation criteria for future train detection systems and (together with literature study and desk research) performance of current train detection systems was analyzed. A Multi Criteria Analysis gave further insight in what alternatives were possible solutions for these challenges . Adaptive Policy Making was applied to setup a first design of a migration strategy, which considers unknown events in the future to unfold and inevitability affect the implementation of the desired policy. Furthermore, a stakeholders’ analysis gave insights in how to engage with stakeholders during this process. From above mentioned findings it is concluded that the current train detection system shows good performance levels, but for how long? Experts from the railway sector have an almost unanimous consensus that a least there is an urgency to decide now about train detection strategy for the long-term. It is suggested to further develop and implement the proposed adaptive migration strategy.","Train Detection; Adaptive policy making; Migration path; future-proof; Multi Criteria Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-31","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport policy and Logistics' Organisation","","","",""

(mentor); Wisse, M. (mentor)","2012","Prevention of falling is of major importance in the practical application of humanoid robots. This thesis focuses on the hip-ankle strategy as a method to maintain balance when subjected to a large disturbance. This strategy is characterised by a large rotation of the hip joint which repositions the Centre of Mass (CoM). The hip-ankle strategy is compared to the ankle strategy which locks the hip joint and compensates for a disturbance by applying ankle torque. Various hip-ankle strategy controllers have been presented in literature of which three implementations on humanoid robots are known. However, none of the research provided experimental evidence that a humanoid robot can withstand larger disturbances by using the hip-ankle strategy compared to the ankle strategy. The goal of this research was therefore to provide experimental evidence that a humanoid robot can maintain balance for larger distur- bances by using the hip-ankle strategy than solely using the ankle strategy. First, simple models were used to investigate the theoretical maximum allowable disturbance for the humanoid robot TUlip. The Inverted Pendulum Model (IPM) was used to simulate the ankle strategy where ankle torque was the only control input. The hip-ankle strategy was simulated using the Inverted Pendulum plus Flywheel Model (IPFM) where flywheel torque served as an additional control input. The hip-ankle strategy was implemented by using bang-bang control input profile on the flywheel. Disturbances were applied in horizontal direction to the CoM of the model and measured in terms of applied impulse. In these simulations the hip-ankle strategy was able to maintain balance for disturbances 33.6% larger than the ankle strategy. Next, a control algorithm was developed for the humanoid robot TUlip. In the control algorithm, the hip-ankle strategy was implemented by the application of virtual forces and torques on the trunk of the robot. These virtual forces were then transfered to joint torques by means of Virtual Model Control (VMC). The Instantaneous Capture Point (ICP) of the robot was controlled to a desired location by modulating the Centre of Pressure (CoP) of the robot. If the CoP is sufficient to keep the ICP within the foot, the control algorithm will lock the hip joint and balance using solely the ankle torque. In case the ICP crosses the edge of the foot, a large virtual torque on the upper body is applied in the direction of the ICP which results in a rotational acceleration of the upper body. The ICP will then be pushed back into the foot and the application of ankle torque will then be sufficient again to maintain balance. In order to evaluate if it is physically possible for the humanoid robot TUlip to maintain balance using the hip-ankle strategy control algorithm, a simulation was performed. The Double Inverted Pendulum Model (DIPM) was used as a model for TUlip and constraints in terms of maximum joint torque and range of motion were included. The ankle strategy and the hip-ankle strategy were then subjected to horizontal impulsive disturbances to the back of the upper body of the robot and measured in terms of impulse. The hip-ankle strategy was able to withstand 16.6% larger pushes than the ankle strategy. Finally, the hip-ankle strategy was experimentally evaluated on the humanoid robot TUlip. Disturbances were created by swinging a weight at the end of a pendulum to the back of the upper body of the robot. The applied impulse was measured by measuring the disturbance force over time by using a load cell. Experimental results showed that the hip-ankle strategy implemented on the humanoid robot can maintain balance for disturbances 18% larger than solely using the ankle strategy. The main conclusion of this thesis is that the hip-ankle strategy can be used to improve the balance maintenance on a humanoid robot. This thesis provided the first experimental evidence that a humanoid robot can maintain balance for larger disturbances by using the hip-ankle strategy than using the ankle strategy.","hip strategy; humanoid robot; Instantaneous Capture Point; push recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Van Heur, R.J.H.G. (mentor)","2012","This graduation project is done for Steco metaalwaren B.V. This company produces bicycle accesories and had assigned the case of development of there product, the Baby-Mee bike to me. The goal for this project was to go back to the reason of existence for this product and see what opportunities lay there. The assignment therefore became somewhat broader than just a redesign: “The design of a product to transport a baby on a bike” The project had three main focus points: The connection with the bicycle of the current product is supplied by GMG. This company however will in the near future no longer produce this connection. A new connection with the bicycle therefore had to be developed. The requirement for it was to be as compatible with bicycles as possible. Another point was to reduce the volume of the product while still maintaining the compatibility with as much baby seats as possible. The last element that Steco wanted was an optimized suspension. Besides these three points, Steco was also interested in getting to product tested by independent organization. This was interesting for them, because then they would have proof that the product is safe for babies. Based on these elements, I designed the Baby-Mee Frame. The Baby-Mee Frame is Steco’s new and improved baby carrier for the bicycle. The baby is transported in the Baby-Mee Frame using a Maxi Cosi or other baby seat. It is compatible with the all of the most popular baby seats. Besides that, the product can stil be used when the baby outgrows the baby seat. The baby can then be transported in bicycle seats, which fit on the bracket. The bracket can also serve as a second luggage rack floating above the normal rack. It also adds suspension to the product. This suspension is designed to take up vibrations and quickly balance them out. For this to work properly, the bracket needs at least 70 mm of room above the luggage rack. The Baby-Mee Frame is connected not to the luggage rack of the bike but to the seat tube of the frame. The frame mount makes the Baby-Mee Frame compatible with nearly every bicycle. The product can even be positioned on the front of the some bicycles. This enables the parents to see their baby while cycling and enhances the feeling of safety. The certification by an independent organization turned out to be unobtainable. This was because there are no norms or guidelines for transporting a baby on a bicycle.","design; baby; bicycle; car seat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

To achieve these missions, they should be manoevring with ease, staying aloft and propelling themselves efficiently. Conventional means of aerodynamic force generation are found lacking at this point and the apping-wing approach becomes an appealing or even necessary solution. In contrast to the conventional (fixed and rotary wing) force generation mechanisms, apping wing systems take benefit from the unsteady ow effects that are associated to the vortices separating from the wing leading and trailing edges, which create low pressure regions around the wings that lead to the generation of higher lift and thrust.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

They have the aim to research and design the integration of electric mobility in urban environment. Each faculty delivers specific expertise and skills that, by close multi-disciplinary collaboration, will lead to innovation. In their second project the research group present a plan for redevelopment of a part of the Rotterdam city harbor, the Merwe-Vierhavens. The Hubway This project contributes to that plan by setting out the ground work for a new mobility system. The essence of the project is about telling a story. A story about the future, the way we travel and how we can create a system that is sustainable for the future, will to offer a pleasant traveling experience and will overcome imminent threats cities are facing. That is the Hubway service. The main driver for the system is one open, comprehensive system where all vehicles are accessible for everyone. It is based on the use of travel (getting from A to B) or usership, rather than the use of a vehicle or ownership. This idea offers great opportunities for design in the form of interaction, parking, vehicle supply and more. However it will also present challenges like maintenance or management. Design principles The thesis comprises two main deliverables. One is a set of nine design principles, in the form of statements, that make up a radical framework. It is a new landscape, for mobility in future urban environments. They are the rules that allows the idea of usership to be implemented. Design elaboration The second deliverable contains the building blocks for designing a mobility service in an future urban environment. There are four urban environments and seven modalities. By means of morphological compositon, five hub levels are constructed in a hierarchical order. These hubs in combination with the design statements and a user experience vision are merged into one visualization, or actually a set of illustrations, in the storyboard chapter. This is where the story telling comes in. Three characters depict the working principle and experience of the Hubway during their use of the future mobility service. Diemigo02 case To complete the circle, a first glance at the implementation of the Hubway service is presented in a case study, the diemigo02 case. The study’s main purpose is to illustrate the Hubway principle in hub design. It is primarily focused on one specific location (the HAKA building at the Vierhavens) to showcase a high level hub design.","future vision; urban mobility; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Mobility Research","","DIEMIGO","",""

(mentor); Boess, S. (mentor)","2012","The level of complexity in consumer electronic products is one of the main concerns for Innovation and Development (I&D) departments in companies manufacturing and selling household appliances. Nowadays, consumer electronic products tend to have more and more functions resulting in complexity increase that makes it harder for users to understand these products (Kuijk, 2009). On top of that, the previous user and expert evaluation test from Philips (PRC 1113) noticed an increased number of usability problems with regard the operability of the connected devices to the television. The Philips OneUX (“One User Experience”) is the project program initiated by Philips to offer users a unified way of working their TV sets with their connected devices. Philips features software with the name of EasyLink that shares the functionality between TV sets and connected devices through a cable. This software is present on every Philips device older than 2009. The OneUX intention is the ideal focus towards offering users a shared way of working without usability problems, and thus, the formation of a TV-ecosystem. Besides that, the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach aims to design with and from the user point of view and focuses on innovative solutions that improve the usage of a product, system or service. The reason to adopt a user-centered design approach in usability analysis of consumer electronics products is to come up with a better quality of the interaction between the user and the product-system (Wever et. al 2008). Thus, this thesis follows a UCD methodology based on qualitative research performed in three main stages, namely analysis, ideation and evaluation. A cognitive walkthrough process has been used to assess the usability problems of the considered user-centered functionality resulting in the identification of its origins. Hence, this process has focused on identifying how users use their TV-ecosystem; get their expectations, needs and perceived qualities when interacting with their TV sets so that a thorough design concept proposal could be developed from these inputs. Consequently, the problem definition stated that the origins of the usability problems were due to a poor integration of the system functions causing user unawareness of the functionality. The concept proposal is the solution that resulted from the application of design criteria obtained in this project. The design criteria established three main focuses of functional integration to address the origins of the usability problems. Thus, access, execution and compatibility of system functions should be better integrated with the qualities of the interaction perceived by users to deal with the user unawareness. Consequently, the concept proposal has originated two parts: first, the system function and second, the system functionality discovery, which offers users a faster execution with just one single press through understandable access with familiar keys. The integration for discovery focused on improving the provided onscreen messages to allow users leverage the performance of their TV-ecosystem in a certain activity. Subsequently, the integration for access and execution prioritise the reduction on the number of steps by using the keys that were familiar to users to offer a faster and easier operability. The context of the thesis is situated within my graduation project of the Master of Design for Interaction in the Delft University of Technology (TUDelft) in The Netherlands. The company where the project has been developed is the Philips Television Department, currently known as Philips BG TV Innovation Site, in Eindhoven (The Netherlands). It supports the Business with its innovation and business creation processes. Hence, it focuses on future products, business and works on a continuing program of front-end innovation. Furthermore, it works in partnership with the other innovation sites to drive successful innovation and development programs to enable the Business to deliver key differentiators. This project gives relevant input to the Site on how users perceive the current way of working of their TV sets. In addition, the resulted design concept proposal means to the Site a rich input on how to integrate the system functions to match user expectations and needs. To sum up, this thesis concludes with a suitable conceptual model for TV-ecosystems to improve their user satisfaction.","Mental Models; TV-ecosystem; Conceptual Models; User expectation; Seamless Systems; User Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

New lighter and stiffer materials would be useful to improve the blade design. This research analyses the potential of carbon glass hybrid composites. Three laminates typical of the laminates used in the spar caps and in the trailing edge reinforcement are manufactured and tested: a reference GFRP, a hybrid laminate and a carbon dominated laminate. For the hybrid material, the results show a positive behavior under static tensile and fatigue loads, while relatively low UCS; a positive hybrid effect is denoted. As for the carbon laminate, the high carbon fraction leads to the best performance under all loads but to a poor infusibility during the VARTM process. The experimental research is followed by a computational study using the wind turbine design software package Focus 6 to evaluate the design of hybrid blades. Thanks to the higher stiffness and the better fatigue resistance of carbon fibers, the simulations return very good expectations with the new blade models considerably lighter and slightly cheaper than the baseline model with pure GFRP spar caps. Based on this study, hybrid laminates seem to be an interesting alternative to glass or carbon laminates. Further study on the optimal structure of hybrid laminates is recommended.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor); Van den Boogaard, G.A. (mentor)","2012","In this report the results are presented of the graduation project to decrease social vulnerability with a design solution. The project was executed for the design agency BOOG in collaboration with Stichting DOEN. The graduation project is the final part of the master Design for Interaction at Delft University of Technology. Social vulnerability refers to a dynamic situation where people suffer from the lack of contacts and support, they do not experience social satisfaction. While their problems pile up they can get feelings of loneliness and eventually they can get socially isolated. In social vulnerability the balance between strength and burden is disturbed. People who experience social vulnerability have problems coping with the current situation and difficulties communicating, but are clearly dependent on others. They do not have their life on the role and have little to no influence on this situation. This makes them unhappy. The challenge for this project is to create a design that does not stigmatize the people in need of a solution. If the design is stigmatizing people will almost certainly not want to use the product. A life changing event can have a big influence on the social network. Multiple factors are involved to positively influence the new situation, such as personality and the living environment. As a designer it is possible to influence the environment to improve the living climate, increase the feeling of safety and connectedness with the environment, which can decrease social vulnerability. The group of social vulnerable people is very diverse and has different graduations of isolation. The decision was made to focus on people above 50 without a life partner who just went through a life changing event. This group needs support to prevent degeneration of the situation without the need for support from professionals. Nowadays interventions to decrease social vulnerability involve personal support, strategic advice, activities and service to provide people with the necessary information. Unfortunately many of these solutions confirm people’s vulnerability, therefore it will not reach the target group of this project. A solution needs to be generated that is accepted and can be used by both socially strong and vulnerable people and still has a positive effect on social vulnerability. Trends and developments reveal that trust in government is decreasing and the pressure on healthcare is increasing due to the ageing society and financial cut backs. This inspires people to start searching for solutions closer to home which they can influence themselves: a bottom-up approach. While professional support is often perceived as top-down and stigmatizing, the bottom-up approach is not and therefore very suitable to help the target group back on track. To improve the wellbeing of socially vulnerable people social connections need to be established. To establish social connections people need to meet others in person. This means that socially vulnerable people need to increase their exposure by getting out of their house more often with an open attitude to be able to approach and be approached by other people. The target group for this project is not capable of improving the situation on their own, they need to be supported to influence the situation in a positive way. This support needs to subtly activate them to start looking for new possibilities that can improve the situation. The interaction that is used to achieve this subtle activation is resembled by a gentle push on a swing. It supports people to get moving and gives them the tools to continue moving on their own. In a bottom-up approach it is very important to keep people motivated to actively participate. This motivation can be derived from people’s natural motivation to do good and be altruistic. Performing acts of kindness is a way of doing good. In this project the act of kindness that was searched for needed to have a low threshold to make it possible for the target group to join in. The act of kindness that was selected for this is the sharing magazines with other people living in the same apartment building. Giving away one of your magazines is an act of kindness, one is doing another person a favour by letting him or her enjoy the reading material as well. Becoming aware that such a small gesture can make other people happy provides the target group with new confidence that is necessary to get out of the vulnerable situation. It also provides a certain level of exposure: by sharing a magazine one shows what topic interests him. Becoming aware of the people with similar interests can lower the threshold of approaching them. Since many vulnerable people tend to stay in or close to their own living environment meeting new people nearby is an important step towards social contact. By performing acts of kindness and connecting with (the people in) the environment people’s attitude is opening up and that is exactly what is necessary to start looking for new possibilities to improve the situation to decrease social vulnerability.","social design; vulnerability; Masters that Matter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Guo, C. (mentor)","2012","The Wireless Lighting Control System has drawn intensive attention in the recent years due to the potential for huge cost savings as well as increased convenience. Commonly seen Wireless Lighting Control Systems utilize Zigbee, KNX and Z-WAVE; whereas little attention has been given to Wi-Fi because of unsolved limitations. The purpose of this thesis project was to develop a Wi-Fi Direct based Smart Setup (WDSS) mechanism, in order to make Wi-Fi a proper candidate for the Wireless Lighting Control System. One of the primary limitations of conventional Wi-Fi technology is that the complex setup procedure prevents interface-constrained devices (e.g.lamps) from joining the network. Secondly, the multi-hop Wi-Fi network is not standardized therefore the common Wi-Fi network bears a star topology with only one-hop coverage. The WDSS is an innovative solution, developed on a newly standardized Wi-Fi technology called Wi-Fi Direct, which is being rolled out as standard in Smartphones and other Internet devices. To overcome the first limitation of conventional Wi-Fi technology, WDSS defines a protocol to allow easy commissioning of lamps (and/or other devices) in a Wi-Fi network, adding a major ease of install element to a traditional Wi-Fi based system (without requiring the user interface on lamps). This approach utilizes a third device, namely a commissioning tool, to set up a Wi-Fi Direct link to the lamp, and further instruct the lamp to migrate to an existing Wi-Fi Network in a secured fashion. An additional advantage of the WDSS is that it can also be applied to set up a multi-hop network among lamps. This feature well addresses the second issue, thereby guaranteeing the effective coverage. Unlike many other meshing networks which function in ad-hoc mode, the WDSS multi-hop network is built up in Wi-Fi infrastructure mode, which has been proved to outperform the ad-hoc network in many aspects. The innovation of the WDSS multi-hop network only focuses on the easy setup instead of advanced routing; however, intelligent algorithms and routing methodologies can be compatibly adopted to optimize the traffic flow. As part of this project, a demo has been set up and the WDSS method has been tested on this system.

(mentor); Bakker, C. (mentor)","2012","Slow Design is a design philosophy that aims at supporting well-being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. It encourages people in doing things at the right time and with the right speed and helps them to understand and reflect on their actions. Nevertheless, how can this philosophy be used to create mass-produced consumer electronics that are more sustainable? In this graduation project the Slow Design Principles, as defined by Carolyn F. Strauss and Alastair Fuad-Luke, were explored and applied in order to develop concepts for consumer electronics that are more sustainable. Slow Design was used to enhance the bond between the user and the product, leading to a longer and more sustainable use. A home study and interviews were conducted to gather insight into how, when and where it is valuable to slow people, or processes, down. To demonstrate how the Slow Design Principles can be translated into an industrial product, as well as to test if this method affects the product attachment positively, a product of the Philips portfolio was selected – the centrifugal juicer – and a case study created. For the purpose of understanding the main opportunities and threats and of the current Philips juicer, a user research was conducted. Keeping the insights from this research in mind, the Slow Design Principles were applied with the help of Mind Maps. A selection of the resultant juicer concepts formed the case study named ‘JuicyMo’. This juicer was realized in a mock-up prototype in order to conduct a user test and gather insights into the degree of attachment of the participants to the new device and into whether they can find the essence of the Slow Design Principles in the juicer. Among other things, the results showed that the users stayed involved in the process, a key element for product attachment. Furthermore, all of the applied Slow Design Principles could be experienced and identified by the participants. In conclusion, a user and context research is necessary for the understanding of users’ needs and the results have to be taken into consideration during the final Slow Design concepts selection in order to create more sustainable consumer electronics. Once ‘Slow’ becomes ‘irritating’ and is used in the wrong moment, the product attachment decreases as will the frequency of the product usage. If this happens the goal of creating products that are more sustainable is not achieved. Hence, the results of the research can help to pinpoint the ‘right and important‘ moment in the usage process for the ‘slowing down‘ of some segments and the ‘speeding up‘ of others. A selection of concepts developed through the application of the Slow Design Principles formed the ‘Book of inspiration’, explaining the method of Slow Design, as well as inspire designers.","Sustainability; Design for Emotion; User experience; Product attachment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Mooij, S.C. (mentor); Withagen, F. (mentor)","2012","VelopA-Omniplay is one of the larger suppliers of sports and playground equipment in the Netherlands, which is a highly competitive industry. VelopA-Omniplay is part of VelopA B.V., who’s vision is ‘living  outside  together’. VelopA-Omniplay’s own vision is closely linked, and states that “every child has the right to play, to play sports and to be together.” In VelopA-Omniplay’s product portfolio, the main product category is Play, with playground equipment for children aged 0-14 years old. The second largest product category is Sports & Fitness, with sports facilities mainly targeting and attracting boys. This leaves an underserved target group, the teenage girls, which is the main research topic of this report: What could VelopA-Omniplay offer to involve more teenage girls into outdoor activities? Due to different changes (biological, psychological and social) in the adolescent’s life, the need for security and support is evident. Many adolescents become self-conscience about their appearances and how they come across to others. Especially teenage girls value the opinion of peers: the need for wanting to ‘fit in’ was more important than personal opinions or preferences (Hurtes, 2002). The potential for ridicule from boys or even adults will most likely influence the girls’ desire to participate in any physical activity (James, 2001). The lack of interest in physical activities is also illustrated by a drop in physical activity during adolescence: rates of physical activity among American girls declined by 83% in 10 years (Kimm et al., 2002). In the Netherlands, only 40% of 15-19 year-olds met the norm of at least one hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day (Ewalds and van der Mooren, 2011). Important correlates of physical activities are biological/demographical (age, gender, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic status), psychological (such as motivation, body image, enjoyment, perceived competence), behavioural (such as sport participation), social (parental and social support) and environmental (access to facilities, local crime). Thus, the ‘simple’ act of being physically active seems to be influenced by many factors: some of which are changeable (e.g. attitude or environmental factors), some of which are not (e.g. age). The literature discussed in the second part of the report is mainly based on research done with girls (and boys) in the U.S.A., UK and Australia. There have been some studies concerning Dutch young people, but more research needs to be done, especially in light of outdoor activities. What are their needs and wants regarding public spaces and where do they currently go, with whom and why there? These questions need to be answered in order to provide VelopA-Omniplay with sound recommendations for pursuing its wish to offer ‘something’ to the girls. In order to ask their opinion on the needs and wants of teenage girls, and to tap into their experience with organizing activities for them, a small questionnaire was digitally sent to 25 youth and girl workers, of which 18 (72%) were received back. There are many opportunities for girls to make use of outdoor facilities, such as sports facilities, according to the youth workers. However, girls either just cannot be bothered to use them or do not feel ‘safe’ enough to use them, because of, for instance, the overall atmosphere in a neighbourhood. The supervision of (female) youth workers could convince girls to participate in either outdoor or indoor activities. Using the established connections with these 18 youth workers, a second research was set up to talk to the teenage girls themselves. Three focus groups were conducted in order to find out what the girls thought was important in an outdoor (sports) meeting point with friends. The most important factor in a meeting point for teenage girls in general, is their need of feeling safe. This causes them to choose places that are familiar to them; familiarity by recognition, cosiness or by account of the people who go there in general and the people who take them there. Places that offer cleanness, lighting, just the right amount of green, and the presence of children of their own age, or under. Moreover, the meeting point should not feel childish, which can be accomplished by attributing the meeting point with youthful colours, coloured graffiti, some shelter from the wind and rain (or the sun during summer) and offering activities that fit their age and dexterity. ‘Girly’ shapes such as hearts and flowers or purple colours are not immediately disliked – however, these should be used with caution, as too much could result in ‘girly attribute’ overkill. Next to safe, the location should facilitate the girls to have fun. Products the girls mentioned as fun were for example seesaws, carrousels, swings, cartwheels, a sports field and a skate ramp for climbing. The possibility to engage in a friendly game of sports is not discarded and with some girls even liked, but there should also be the possibility to just sit and talk, and to do nothing – just chilling. The final design delivered in this graduation project is not just a concept of how outdoor equipment for teenage girls could look like, it is also an insight of the many factors influencing their participation in outside activities - the actual design is only one of many. Recommendations and suggestions are made to VelopA-Omniplay on how to incorporate the newly gained insights into the development of the hardware (actual design, locations, surroundings and activities), as well as how to guide customers (a handout), so that the preconditions are right for girls to participate and be outside. These preconditions are also closely related to what is called the ‘software’ in this report: the people factor (mainly the individual and sociocultural factors). Recommendations and suggestions to VelopA-Omniplay are made on how to influence this people factor. Although VelopA-Omniplay will most likely not be able to contact the girls themselves, they could sponsor or partner with for example youth and girl workers who can. Finally, where and how to gain a competitive advantage are presented and recommendations on future steps as well as suggestions for further research are made.","Teenage; Girls; Outdoor; Meeting point; VelopA; Omniplay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Since within the region of Salland (intensive) livestock farming is practised, it is assumed that the utilisation of manure for the production of green gas by means of the anaerobic digestion process has a considerable potential. To comprehend whether the manure can be made available for energy production, it is necessary to learn how manure is currently used and valued by the local farmers within Salland. Due to intensive livestock farming the manure production exceeds the local demand for manure-based fertilisers, which is considered a problem as this (local) abundance of manure urges for a manure distribution system of which the costs are high. Furthermore, circumstances within the (intensive) livestock farming sector are changing especially due to the amendment of policies that monitor farming activities. Changes within these institutional rules and especially the perceptions that these changes occur unpredictably, affect the decision making of local farmers and will influence the condition that underlie the manure distribution system. In order to explore the potential for manure-based energy within this complex system, we developed an agent-based model by means of the MAIA framework. Based on our research we found that the energy potential is low due to several related causes. A clear expectation of what will be gained is lacking due to uncertainties about both the amount of subsidy that will be granted and the order of the specific technology costs. Furthermore, since a sufficient production capacity is required, many small-scale to middle-scale farms will not consider manure-based energy production. A considerable investment capital is required as well, this puts a lot of pressure upon the farmers as they often experience at the same time poor financial situations and ongoing changes in the policies. We state that farmers do not obtain a clear benefit concerning the production of manure-based energy as current issues with respect to the abundance of manure are not solved and meanwhile the produced digestate, almost identical in volume and composition to manure, had to find its way back to the manure distribution system. Although cooperation between farmers should not be taken for granted, we found in case farmers do cooperate, the potential for manure-based energy production to be highly increased. In order to increase the potential, we recommend to create a clear benefit from a farmer's point of view, increase their understanding with respect to manure-based energy and reduce institutional barriers, especially with respect to regulations that control subsidy.","agent-based social simulation; MAIA; manure-based energy; manure distribution system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Section of Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Hofkamp, L. (mentor); Kroesen, M. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor)","2012","Worldwide, the attention and awareness on Corporate Responsibility (CR) increases in the business and social world. More information is available which encourages society. One of the spear points of society are the CO2 emissions. Mapping these emissions showed that aviation has a 5% share within these emissions of which airports are responsible for again 5%. Society became more aware of CR and together with an increased media attention, the pressure on the business world increased. Society expects that the business-world would not only do something about their CO2 emissions, but to become corporately responsible. CR is more than planet alone. It is about the balance between people, planet and profit. Where for many firms the focus was solely on profit, it was suddenly expected to balance profit in relation to people and planet. Firms rushed into CR without really understanding the concept such as with Schiphol Group, the operator of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. This rush caused the over-organized and unstructured CR policy that currently exists at Schiphol. Thereby Schiphol applied CR to its business with the wrong motive. CR was implemented for the sake of having it and to avoid negative opinions of not having CR, which caused several problems Schiphol faces today. The first problem is that the CR policy is unstructured and over-organized today. Second, there is no balance between people, planet and profit in decision-making. Third, there is a blurred view on CR reputation and expectations from stakeholders. This research addresses all three problems, so that the main question can be answered by subsequently answering four sub-questions. Main research question: What is the current role (influence) of CR at Schiphol, how can this be improved and what are the potential benefits for the future (in order to become and stay Europe’s preferred airport)? To answer the first sub-question, a comparison between the scientific CR literature and the practice at Schiphol is made to identify similarities and differences between those two. The definition of CR is broadly the same, except that the Schiphol definition lacks elements as ‘in line with business strategy’ and ‘people, planet and profit’. Combining theory and practice, CR is in this research defined as: Integrating a balance between people, planet and profit fully in a company’s strategy and operations based on intrinsic motivation in order to create value for its stakeholders and itself, today and in the future. The theory at Schiphol shows that nowadays the knowledge about what should be the right motive for CR is present, but in practice the motive for Schiphol is still mainly to maintain support for its position. Because of its big contribution to society Schiphol has the obligation to be corporately responsible. This mix between self-interest and social obligation is good, but the focus is now more on damage control than on optimizing benefits. Scientific theory showed that the right motives for CR are mostly of strategic self-interest: to gain a competitive advantage or grasp financial benefits. When firms are coerced into CR or are doing it for the good cause, CR is far less efficient and effective. Both society and firms are better off when firms use CR strategically than when they are coerced into making such investments. With strategic use as a motive, the implementation process is more efficient and has less resistance. Therefore it is recommended that Schiphol should change its current CR strategy by integrating the CR strategy within its business strategy. Scientific theory showed that strong inspirational leadership, open communication to all stakeholders, an integrated CR and business strategy and projects that balance PPP are essential success elements of this change. Afterwards the intended benefits such as financial profit, increased reputation, employee welfare and in the end a competitive advantage can be reached. There is confusion today due to the from origin profit-based focus and the insufficient existence of the important elements to change the mindset. At the same time this are the opportunities for tomorrow. The seeds to realize a change in mindset are already seeded with examples as the CR Ambassadors, Guerillas and theGrounds. They enlarge the awareness on CR, but it costs time to turn these seeds into a flourishing plant. The answer to the second sub-question focusses on the analysis of the current perspectives that are present at Schiphol with Q-methodology. This is important knowledge in order to increase the chance on successful implementation and raise the shared acceptance for the new required CR policy. The Q-methodology studies the subjectivity of individuals on a certain issue, here CR, by ranking statements from mostly agree to mostly disagree according to a given distribution. The statements are based on the scientific literature and interviews with various people at Schiphol. The respondents with different functions, age, gender and CR involvedness ranked the statements from a ‘me as a Schiphol employee’ perspective. After a factor analysis and varimax rotation, four perspectives were identified: the communicative believer, the strategic changer, the balanced profiteer and the numerical collaborator. The communicative believer consists of relatively many managers and states that “CR is a thing for believers” and “something you have to believe in as an organization, it is a mindset”. Having this mindset, being corporate responsible and being transparent and complete in communication on CR towards stakeholders are a competitive advantage to realize future growth for Schiphol. The strategic changer perspective represents a relative large share of directors and has a more strategic view on CR. Currently Schiphol is capable enough to realize a successful CR strategy but “without profit, there is no airport and no opportunity to give the profit back to people and planet”, while “CR is the reason to exist today and for the long-term future”. However, to get there a strategic change in the right direction is necessary to actually make CR a success. The balanced profiteer represents the old profit-based culture and is more preserved and internally focused. They recognize CR, but profit first, which together with strong leadership and an internal focus on an improved interwoven CR strategy characterize this perspective. The numerical collaborator focusses on collaboration with stakeholders and addresses a sectorial approach. They stand for a good numerical foundation with a no-nonsense Calvinistic approach to deal with CR: “meten is weten”. “CR is part of our life nowadays and given the social function of Schiphol, we should contribute to CR”. “But in the end it is still business and we have to have something left”. The statements which are mostly agreed upon are: 1) strong leadership/management agreement from the top is required in order to successfully implement CR at Schiphol, 2) CR strategy should be in line with Schiphol’s business strategy, 3) CR strategy plays an important role in the license to grow, 4) in order to successfully implement CR and ensure consistency, all levels in the organization should apply and integrate CR, 5) CR gains a competitive advantage. Most disagreed statements are 1) Schiphol should stop with CR, 2) I see CR as something unwanted; an extra effort with no results, 3) Transfer passengers choose Schiphol for its CR reputation, 4) current CR organization and strategy is sufficient, 5) CR related guidelines for decisions-making forms are not needed. These perspectives lead to consensus on 1) Schiphol should continue with CR, 2) the inclusion of stakeholders is important to define the strategy which 3) should be implemented on all levels in the organization to ensure consistency and 4) guidelines for decision-making forms are needed, which is further analyzed by designing a new framework for the decision-making process. But more important are the statements on which there is disagreement: 1) people, planet and profit are equally important for Schiphol, 2) CR will make Schiphol Europe’s preferred airport, 3) decisions on investments always need a positive business case, 4) Image is more important than people and planet, 5) Schiphol should take control and stimulate other stakeholders in a sectorial approach for CR and 6) CR activities should always be strategic and contribute to the competitive advantage of the firm. Hence there are four perspectives present at Schiphol, it can be concluded that the overall view on CR is quite positive with shared and consensus statements. But these different perspectives are present in different levels of the organization, which are a cause of the sabotage of the current strategy. Also there is indeed a difference between saying and doing at Schiphol: the perspectives show the well awareness on the theory but also that change is wanted and required because current actions and policy are lacking. The consensus and mostly agreed statements are highly accepted in the organization and it is recommended to directly implement those as far as possible. Awareness on the existence of the disagreement is necessary and is an opportunity to smoothen the implementation of the CR strategy. Given the conclusions on the Q-methodology results, the following recommendations and implications are relevant for Schiphol: 1) Create a clear, consistent definition on CR which contains the right terminology. 2) Focus on expansion and growth (license to grow) instead of staying in business (license to operate). 3) Create more understanding and insight in the CR-benefits and the contribution to a competitive advantage. For instance by workshops, improved communication and quantification of the CR-benefits. 4) Integrate and align the CR strategy with the business strategy. So no separated CR strategy. Activities and projects should be aligned to this strategy to optimize their contribution. 5) Create incentives and inspiration from the top by showing commitment to and the importance of CR for Schiphol. This improves the implementation of the CR policy as well as the external and internal exposure. This implicates that the CEO is responsible for the CR performance which should also be linked to the salaries and bonuses of managers. 6) Communicate the existence of different perspectives throughout the whole organization by workshops for instance. 7) A positive business case of projects in investments-decisions is not always required. 8) Schiphol should take a wait-and-see role in the sectorial approach to address CR. The answer to the third sub-question is ‘The Balanced Framework’. This framework is designed to create more awareness in the organization on balancing people, planet and profit in the decision-making process. The goal was to create a framework to make a balanced and general valuation of people, planet and profit in decisions whether or not to invest in projects based on the existing process. It is important to incorporate people and planet within the profit measurement systems, to raise efficiency but even more to show the contribution of people and planet to profit. The literature review of scorecards, investment tools and other frameworks was input and inspiration for ‘The Balanced Framework’. Negative aspects were avoided and the positive aspects of those frameworks were taken into account. Based on these, the main requirements were transparency, simplicity, flexibility and accessibility. The framework is transparent by giving more insight in the valuation of a decision and helps to set the balance between PPP, but not too much by still distinguishing the scale and weighting phase. It is simple in use and can be accessed directly; currently the framework is applied to the pilot-project Lounge 2. Furthermore, the framework is able to incorporate lessons learned during use and can be adjusted towards user preferences. The biggest change compared to the current decision-making process is that a project is split up in three components: people, planet and profit. The first phase of the decision-making process is scaling PPP. Relevant aspects per P for a project need to be selected from a list of roughly 15 indicators with corresponding units, which is a selection of Schiphol’s 17 CR themes and others sources such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for Airport Operators. This list of aspects and indicators is mutually exclusive and commonly exhaustive. The contribution of the selected aspects through the project is calculated, after which the impact on strategic objectives of Schiphol for each aspect is determined. This process of scaling towards strategic objectives enforces that all aspects are on the same scale, interpretable by the IC and so that projects are better in line with the business strategy. The scores are filled in on the decision-form after which it is checked by the controllers and submitted to the Investment Committee (IC). The weighting of the aspects by the IC is the second phase of the decision-making process. First the aspects per P are reduced to five, if this not already the case. Second, a sum of 100% will be divided between the 3 P’s. Thereafter this ascribed percentage is divided between the aspects per P. This division is dependent on the current balance between PPP that is determined by the IC and the CR strategy. In a pro CR case: people, planet and profit are equally important for Schiphol, so each gets 33.3%. But more in line with the current situation due to the old habits and current financial crisis, a division of 25% people, 25% planet and 50% profit is more plausible. The percentages and the strategic impact scores are multiplied with each other, so that the highest score represents the recommended project based on strategic impact. This advice is not binding, but stimulates discussion on the go or no go of a project and gives an indication of the effects of people, planet and profit aspects of a project on the strategic objectives of Schiphol by plotting projects on PPP axis to validate the choice-behavior of the IC. The framework is verified with Schiphol employees and the literature on decision-making processes. The validation with a pilot-project Lounge 2 is still in progress, the relevant aspects per P are selected and currently calculated, but the first feedback was merely positive. Essential first step in the road ahead is to let experts define the value ranges of percentages per aspect to transform these to the strategic impact score. Then the framework will be general applicable. Afterwards the framework can be used and will increase the awareness on the balance between people, planet and profit in the decision-making. This will stimulate the CR culture within Schiphol and give ‘hand and feet’ to the forthcoming business strategy which incorporates CR. In the answer to the fourth sub-question, the value of a CR reputation for an airport among transfer passengers at Schiphol is determined. A conjoint analysis with a stated-choice model based on a multinomial logit (MNL) framework suit the use to determine the willingness to pay for and utility of having a CR reputation. The CR reputation is important since it is affects the business performance of a firm. Furthermore, the negative impact or damage of a CR reputation is bigger than the possible positive impact. The transfer passengers are an important stakeholder in the business performance for Schiphol since they account for 40% of the total amount of passengers. A survey among transfer passengers was conducted, whereby they were asked to choose between different airports of transfer (alternatives) on a fictitious flight. The aspect with the most influence on this choice was the transfer time (41%) followed by ticket price (32%), airport quality (18%) and CR reputation (9%). Although the CR reputation is the least important aspect in this experiment, it still accounts for 9% in the decision for transfer passengers, which is if realized a huge increase in passenger amounts given the competitive aviation industry. The utility is only positive when the airport has an excellent CR reputation. Having a poor or average reputation has a negative utility and will not have much influence on the decision by transfer passengers. Furthermore, having an excellent CR reputation is worth 55.29 per passenger compared with an average reputation. So transfer passengers are willing to pay 55.29 extra for an excellent CR reputation. So, for Schiphol it is worthwhile to excel on CR reputation. Based on this experiment with transfer passengers, the CR reputation plays a role in the decisions with 9% and having an excellent reputation is rewarded with 55.29. Given this knowledge, Schiphol should continue to invest in activities and projects that affect the CR reputation in a positive way to obtain an excellent CR reputation. Focus hereby on experience and communication. Make the CR-initiatives, specifically planet related, more tangible and visible to let the passenger really experience CR. Participate in national and international CR or sustainability rankings and use top-rankings for communication. Communicate more transparent and complete towards all stakeholders. Furthermore, conduct further research on the value of a CR reputation among other stakeholders and how the willingness to pay of ±55 can be obtained after an excellent CR reputation is obtained in collaboration with the airlines via airport fees or with the shop-retailers via higher rent or premium prices for products. To conclude, this confirms the theory that a CR reputation pays off and that the investment will be rewarded. Overall, this research provided an overview of the current state of CR at Schiphol. There are four different perspectives, but in the end they represent a positive view on CR. It also showed that a change is required to acquire the benefits of CR, which there certainly are. Hereby, more inspiration and commitment from the top is an important first step to stimulate and activate the belief in CR. It is known on which issues there is disagreement, which should be communicated throughout the organization to increase the awareness on existence. This will unite Schiphol on the CR issues and will incorporate CR in the culture on the long-term. Thereby ‘The Balanced Framework’ that is designed in this research is an excellent tool to support this required change. It increases the awareness on the importance of having a balance between people, planet and profit in decision-making process by making a more conscious decision at all levels in the organization. Investments are required today, to benefit in the future from a competitive advantage.

(mentor); Groenenberg, R.M. (mentor)","2012","AkzoNobel has been producing salt from solution-mined brine since 1919. Production in the Hengelo area started in 1933, and is still ongoing today. Because at some point in time the mineable salt will all be mined and preparations for extension of the concession will need to be made, it is important to know the remaining amount of salt in the Hengelo area. To date no singular method for estimation of these reserves has been adopted. This leaves room for the development of a local method. It was chosen to develop this method in accordance with international standards. Due to its worldwide influence and being recognised by the Amsterdam Stock Exchange that AkzoNobel is registered on, it was opted to use the code of the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM). The geology of the Hengelo area was modelled using a modified version of the ordinary Kriging algorithm to take into account the presence of faults. Kriging was used because it also provides an estimate of uncertainty in the horizons that are modelled. To factor in the uncertainty about the continuity of the salt body, the resources in three areas were calculated: the area was investigated as a whole, and two sub-areas were investigated separately: · Sub-area 1 is the area within 500m distance of any measurement in the area. · Sub-area 2 is the area for which the geology was previously studied in great detail by GeoWulf Laboratories[5]. This area is essentially the area in-between the different measurements. The modelled horizons and their uncertainty values were then used in a Monte Carlo simulation, yielding cumulative probability distributions for the estimated amount of salt in the three scenarios. The total amount of salt was also calculated deterministically, meaning all calculations were performed using expected values. This produced the same values as the expectations of the probabilistic approach. It was decided that the probabilistic approach of the total area produced an over-optimistic value of the total Resource, and to only use the expected values of the three areas to distinguish between Inferred, Indicated and Measured Resources. Reserves were estimated for three scenarios: 1. Salt has been produced in the past in this area using a no longer used leaching strategy that results in large caverns with multiple wells. What would be the Salt Produced if the same locations had been chosen to produce salt using the modern Single Completion Cavern design? And what would be the historical recovery? 2. Assuming no production had taken place in the past, what would be the total Salt Reserve if the field would be developed now? 3. What is the Salt Reserve left in the area? It was found that the recovery percentages per cavern as asked for in scenario 1 were so widespread that no conclusive numbers could be given. The cavern lay-out throughout the area in scenarios 2 and 3 was not optimized, but because the overall estimation process was conservative the numbers could still be used as minimal values in future evaluations of the area. The results of scenario 3 are given in the table below.","salt; reserve; estimate; Hengelo","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); Van den Bos, J. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Muilwijk, M. (mentor)","2012","Interlocking, single layer concrete armour units are placed in a specific grid depending on the type of armour unit. Within this grid, armour units are placed in horizontal rows. The number of horizontal rows of single layer armour units on a breakwater is limited to 20. This limit is proposed in order to prevent major settlements, which might affect the interlocking of the armour units. The limit on the number of rows is based on experience from prototypes and is not yet confirmed in a systematic study. Then number of rows also might have an effect on the load on the first (bottom) row of armour units, which affects the structural integrity of the armour units. The load on the first row of armour units is however unknown. The research presented in this thesis is a study on the load on the first (bottom) row of concrete armour units placed on a breakwater. Both the static load and the dynamic load were examined. The static load is defined as the load on the bottom row of armour units resulting from the higher positioned rows of armour units during conditions without waves. The dynamic load is defined as the load on the bottom row of armour units during conditions with wave attack minus the static load. These loads were studied by physical model tests. The static load was studied in an experiment in which the down slope force on the bottom rows of armour units (Xbloc units of 366 grams) was continuously measured during the placement of 20 rows of armour units on a slope of 37 degrees (slope of 3:4) in a series of 15 tests. The dynamic load was studied in a physical model test in a wave flume. The first row of armour units was placed on a movable frame which was connected to a load cell. The dynamic load was measured during tests with regular waves of 20% to 100% of the maximum wave height corresponding to the used armour unit (Xbloc units of 61.7 gram which were positioned on a typical breakwater slope of 3:4) and a wave period corresponding to an Iribarren number of 3, 4 and 5 for all of the described wave heights. This static load experiment resulted in a relationship of the measured static load on the first row of armour units with the number of rows applied on the slope of the model. From this relationship appeared that the static load approaches a maximum value after 10 rows. An analytical model was developed and validated against the measured results. This model gives an interpretation of the cause of the maximum value. The measurements of the dynamic load showed two clear phenomena. The dynamic load appeared to be a harmonic load with the same period as the waves imposed on the model. The dynamic load is the result of the flow of water along the armour layer. The maximum dynamic load on the first row of armour units occurred simultaneous with the maximum downwash which is in line with expectations. A relation between the downwash velocity and the amplitude of the dynamic load was found. The second observed phenomenon is the increase of the wave averaged load on the first row of armour units during the test. During the tests the harmonic load oscillated around an equilibrium line which showed a positive trend. The measured load after testing was significant higher than the measured load at the beginning of the tests. A relation was found between the wave characteristics and the increase of the load on the first row of armour units.","breakwater; Xbloc; static load; dynamic Load; armour unit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Romero Herrera, N. (mentor); Mulder, I. (mentor)","2012","Contact between neighbours is a logical starting point for making a neighbourhood a pleasant place to live. A scientific research has shown that the area in streets where most contact between neighbours takes place is the hybrid zone. Hybrid zones are the zones between one’s private space (ones house) and the public space (the street); things like gardens, personalized sidewalks etc. This graduation thesis is intended to design to stimulate contact between neighbours in streets without a hybrid zone. This thesis is performed as an addition to a research performed by DE ecotecten on the influence of hybrid zones on communication between neighbours. In order to design something which fits the users’ needs and habits an extensive context analysis is done by using among others, generative techniques, data gathering through crowdsourcing and literature. This context analysis has the purpose to understand everything that has to do with being neighbours, and the experience one has with his street. To find out what the differences could be between different neighbourhoods, and what factors influence its specific contact atmosphere, three different neighbourhoods have been taken as research area in which a total of 20 residents have participated; Blijdorp, Bospolder and Pendrecht. Blijdorp is a mostly “white”, safe and friendly neighbourhood with relatively high educated residents. Bospolder and Pendrecht are both very multicultural neighbourhoods. They are so called “probleem wijken”. Although the last two neighbourhoods seem to be demographically like each other, they differ on architecture. The conclusion that can be drawn from the context analysis is that the best neighbour contact is a modest form of contact. Contact consisting of saying hello, a little chat now and then, and some extra neighbour favours with your direct neighbours. Its main function is to keep up the good atmosphere in the street. Saying “hello” actually means “I want to have it nice here”. Saying “hello” is showing your good intentions. It turned out that we all wish for a street with such good modest contact. In Blijdorp they can imagine this dream street with their current neighbours but one of the problems is that they are busy people, not able to spend much time on the street and so not meeting each other often. This in contrary with Bospolder and Pendrecht, where most people cannot imagine this dream street with their current neighbours. The contact atmosphere in these last two neighbourhoods is one of avoiding each other to avoid contact. It seems plausible that the different neighbourhoods will need a different type of design to solve the problems. The causes of lack of contact in Blijdorp are partly created by the lack of a good hybrid zone. In Bospolder and Pendrecht the reasons for lacking contact are to a big extant attributable to the attitude of the people and only to a small extent to the absence of a hybrid zone. To keep within the scope of the research of DE ecotecten it was decided to design for the neighbourhood Blijdorp in this thesis. The design goal to design for Blijdorp is: to offer opportunities to show your good intentions for the street on own initiative. These opportunities are lacking nowadays because the people in Blijdorp don’t have enough opportunities to greet each other, and because of many upstairs houses, not many people can make a façade yard and show their good intentions in that way. In order to reach the goal an interaction vision was made which resulted in three concepts. A. Streetboxes: all neighbours in one street have the key to a shared showcase. It can be used to give, show, inform, ask etc. B. Street shares: Neighbours can buy a piece of a new product for the street, designed by one of the neighbours, and get their name printed on it. C. Save for a tile: One can save for a customizable street tile at the local shops. After an evaluation with a focus group it is decided to explorer the Streetbox concept further: A multifunctional concept which offers opportunities for individual actions on a collective concern without feeling patronized. Through testing the basic interactions in a real street with real residents it turned out the concept was very much liked, and people would find enough purposes to use it, but they felt a bit uncomfortable acting around the Street box. The associations one has with the concept are very important and should be one of “being proud and independent”. To keep the design realistic for possible future realization of the concept it was chosen to keep it simple and basic. Something which is almost innovative in these digital times, but very natural for contact with neighbours who are after all very close by. The final design is called de Straathoek . De Straathoek is a “corner” situated at a central place in the street. It can be used for all kinds of surprising and convenient matters between neighbours; to give, to share, to ask, to discover and to take what is given by somebody else. De Straathoek can only be used by the residents of the accompanying street. Only they will have the knowledge about the combination of the locks. Everyone who puts something in- or takes something out of the Straathoek, can write a note and/or leave a message on the website; the Straathoek online. De Straathoek contains 4 metal showcase boxes. The showcase boxes are attached to an old construction pile. They each contain a solar cell to power a light which will turn on at night in order to get the real showcase feeling. Besides the Straathoek being an object that offers opportunities to show your good intentions for the street, it also creates little connections between neighbours, and it could function as a meeting place in the street. The 10 days final test of the Straathoek with a mock up model and a website in the Sonmansstraat in Blijdorp was mostly a success and made a lot of people enthusiastic, though some recommendations for future design will be made with regards to the website and some other practical adjustments. Because of so many enthusiastic responses from people who believe a real version will soon be placed in their street, it was decided to try and make it a reality. However, it is not a design anybody can make any money with and the municipality doesn’t have enough subsidies to cover the costs. A solution for this problem could be crowdfunding. The Straathoek is an ideal concept to test the possibilities of crowdfunding for urban issues with. A newly seen phenomenon, which is still in an experimental phase, but might be promising. If enough money is raised and the municipality gives permission, Blijdorp will be the first neighbourhood with a Straathoek in its streets, this summer.","neighbours; contact; social cohesion; hybrid zone; neighbourhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design For Interaction","","Design For Interaction","",""

(mentor); Verwaal, M. (mentor)","2012","The graduation company “ACE ingenieurs - & adviesbureau” have seen opportunities in developing a digital version of the table soccer game. The graduation project was the first part of this development process, in which the desired playing actions were defined and in which the control system was made technically feasible. Table soccer is played all over the world daily; the game is quite popular and timeless. Table soccer is an intuitive game and suitable for almost everybody. There are several user groups (e.g. children, youngsters and professionals) who play on different levels and in different contexts. Youngsters are enthusiastic, fanatic and skilful in playing table soccer. Furthermore, youngsters are the largest user group and the easiest group to reach; they visit many public places (e.g. schools, community centres, sport canteens) and they are growing up with digital products and games. Besides playing games, most youngsters like to socialize with their friends. For these reasons, youngsters were chosen as the target group. The purpose of the assignment was to maintain the characteristics of playing traditional table soccer and to implement new features which were desired by the youngsters. The characteristics of table soccer that had to be maintained were; social play, fun, active play, intuitive controlling and suitable for a wide public (but especially for the youngsters). The desired playing actions for the digital game were defined with the help of user observations and focus groups. It was concluded that the new game would have the same basics as the traditional game. The match will be shown from top view and the players are in line with the eight controllers. Furthermore, rotating the rod will turn the players around their axis and sliding the rod will slide the players in longitudinal direction. During the design and engineering phase different solutions were created, assessed and elaborated. The final product contains the design of the control system which included a motion sensor for detecting sliding and rotation of the rod. There is a blocking system to simulate clamping of the ball. Moreover, a motor system provides sensual feedback when the ball touches the players’ feet. All these parts are combined in a specific composition so that the electronic components and the mechanical system fit in the device. An evaluation research is done with the user group and the help of a working model. Most interesting outcomes were: The product is really loved and desired by the youngsters. The designed working principle of the control system works well, but there were a few points for improvement. Paying attention to the programming of the software of the prototype is important for further development of the product. The next phase of the development process will be enhancing the electronic parts and developing the whole device, including the housing and construction of the product. At the same time the software has to be developed. Further research, with the target group has to be conducted to learn what games and aesthetics the youngsters prefer.","design; digital; table soccer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

It focuses on the enhancement of group experiences, for which tablets are integrated taking advantage of their technological benefits such as sensors and touchscreen properties. Result from this study is a system of collaborative content creation and sharing. It is thought for users housed in a common room, and thus, physically accessible to each other. Ingredients of the system are secondary screens (tablets, smartphones), TV and users. To accommodate the three elements an application is designed. This app connects users’ physical and digital worlds through a serie of interactions and actions for the experience, stepping away from the current aloofness of media and personal devices to put them back towards real and physically social experiences. This dissertation has been developed at the Innovation Site of Philips TV, where the firm explores TV consumer needs and matches them with commercial opportunities. TV industry embraces various stakeholders that may be classified into two main groups: TV content and TV device. Philips TV, as a manufacturer, belongs to the second, for this reason delivering content and services is not within its portfolio. However, electronic products are. From that perspective, the use of the thesis’ design by Philips TV is of a paradigm for technological ideations.

(mentor)","2012","The drinking water in the Netherlands has been aimed to achieve high quality of water along with a low production cost. In-order to produce such high quality of treated water, constant monitoring of the process variables at the end of each treatment step is recommended. These processes are monitored and operated by motivated and skilled operators and process technologists, which leads to an operator dependent, subjective, variable and possibly sub-optimal operation of the treatment plants. Furthermore, the extensive automation of the treatment plants reduces the possible operator attention to the individual process units. The use of mathematical or black-box process models might solve these problems. This thesis thus focusses on the development of soft sensors i.e models that can simulate the rapid sand filter (one of the drinking water processes) process and thus be able to estimate/predict the output variables of interest, such that optimal control schemes could be developed to control the quality of the produced water. Before an appropriate model can be designed, it is necessary to analyse the drinking water treatment processes of the pilot plant. In general the treatment processes are robust, but ignoring the typical process behaviour can hamper the optimal performance. One of the readily available mathematical/white-box model is assessed, only to conclude that assessed white-box model has few limitations hampering the main objective of the research, thus motivating us to use black-box modelling approach instead. Using black-box approach,the water quality parameters to be estimated are determined using subspace and parametric estimation schemes. The strategy for implementing these system identification schemes have been investigated. These techniques have been applied to experimental data collected for the rapid sand filter process and a good fit to the observed dynamics is obtained. Models obtained through these techniques have been discussed and compared using various validation tests.","embedded systems; soft sensors; water treatment; systems & control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-23","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded systems","","3mE/DCSC","",""

A refrigerator is important for a lot of aspects in order to improve the standards of life. The most well-known one is the preservation of food, but also preservation of medicines can be improved by the use of a fridge. The problem is that people in developing countries do not have access to an electricity infrastructure. Therefore a solution has to be identified, which makes effective use of an alternative energy source to empower the refrigerator. On top of this challenge one of the main problems that has to be tackled is the fact that most of these people are very poor. Therefore the initial product costs as well as the costs of use have to be as low as possible in order to develop an affordable solution. Because of the tropical monsoon climate, the region is very warm and moist. These circumstances on one hand favour the growth of bacteria that spoil food and medicine and on the other hand make it more difficult to create the desired cooling effect. This climate barrier needs to be conquered in order to achieve the best result. When designing a product for the rural population in Cambodia, the cultural beliefs and conventions should also be taken into account. These can be an obstacle when designing a product that originates in Europe. However when using them proper they can also become a design advantage which might convince the local people to accept and use the product.","refrigeration; adsorption; BOP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

They are used to minimize the problems associated with sediment in downstream drainage structures, pumps, treatment plants and receiving waters. Problem definition Gully pots clogging problems have gradually been recognized over recent years. Blockage of inflow devices (especially gully pots) is the most frequent cause of flooding, for flooding of buildings and of roads. Gully pot blockages cause the highest numbers of flood incidents and are subject to larger uncertainty than other basic events. Research After literature study, it is clear that my research focuses on large particles clogging problem. To achieve my goal, the approach could be divided in several aspects: 1. In the first place, In order to define the large particles which real clogged gully pot, a field work to interview the on-site workers from cleaning company is done. 2. Based on feedback from on-site field work, 4 kind of new alternatives are proposed. 3. Then a laboratory experiment is designed to test these alternatives and also a new re-designed gully pot provided by Wavin Company. Results 1. The new grating alternatives for original gully pot can significantly reduce the incidence of gully pot clogging problem. They can reduce the covering percentage of the grating during the extreme rain fall event and leave more opening space on the grating. 2. The new gully pot from Wavin Company has a better performance than the original gully pot. But considering the big settling tank and large grating of the new gully pot, it is not fair to directly compare with the other alternatives of original gully pot. Conclusions and recommendations The gully pot clogging problems can be improving by new alternatives design. And the results show that big size of gully pot design also will be a good choice in the future. However, the experiment results show that the new alternatives will cause a higher water level on the testing table. Also the bicycle safety on the road should be considered. For the further research, the experiment method should be improved and the maintenance cost for the new design should be a concern.","gully pot; clogging; Hao Qian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

(mentor); Wenninger, J. (mentor)","2012","Irrigation is the largest user of fresh water in the world. Unfortunately a large part of irrigation is unsustainable and inefficiently causing water scarcity with sometimes terrible effects on the water cycle, ecology, economy and food production. The key in determining the efficiency of irrigation is to investigate how much irrigation water is indeed used by crops for transpiration. Only this part of the total evaporation is used by crops to produce biomass and can be seen as productive evaporation. To separate evaporation into the productive (transpiration) and non-productive (interception and soil evaporation) terms we use stable isotopes 2-H and 18-O. This research investigates the changes of isotopic composition of stable isotopes 2-H and 18-O in the soil over the year in a lysimeter setup in the Netherlands. When the water balance is combined with isotopic values, an isotope mass balance can be made. This is used to separate evaporation fluxes and makes it possible to determine the transpiration flux of vegetation. During a six month period (November 2010 to June 2011) values of stable isotopes 2-H and 18-O in a lysimeter covered with grass were monitored. Furthermore, during a two month period (May and June 2011) a second lysimeter without vegetation was monitored to find out what the effect is of vegetation on isotope composition. When comparing the lysimeter with and without grass cover, it was found that transpiration plays no role in the non-covered lysimeter. In the latter, higher enrichment of soil water was observed and the isotope regression line had a lower slope. Isotope composition changes during the year. In winter (November to February) soil evaporation and isotopic enrichment were low. In summer (April to June) soil evaporation and isotopic enrichment were high. This research shows that it is possible to separate evaporation into soil evaporation and transpiration. During the cold period (December to February) the amount of transpiration was relatively high (75.0 % - 90.5 %) , since only limited soil evaporation could take place. When less water was available during warm periods (April and May), the share of transpiration in the total evaporation term decreased (47.3% - 53.4 %).","hydrology; stable isotopes; evaporation; interception; transpiration; lysimeter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Delta areas are attractive areas to live in. They are valuable due to their major economic potential as well as their large environmental values. However, due to ongoing urbanization, demand for space is still increasing and since delta areas are low-lying, they are vulnerable to flooding. Polders provide opportunities for further developing these delta areas, either by improving existing areas, or by establishing a new living environment. At the same time, polders have their limitations. This research aims at finding possibilities to enhance the application of the polder concept, leading to business opportunities for the different sectors in the Netherlands (government, business sector and knowledge institutes). In this research, a polder is defined as a level area which has originally been subject, permanently or seasonally, to a high water level (groundwater or surface water) and is separated from the surrounding hydrological regime to be able to control the water levels in the polder (groundwater and surface water). The research focuses on increasing safety, sustainability and flexibility in future polder settings. Based on an analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT analysis) it is shown that there are definite opportunities for developing polders in the future. An important strength of the polder concept is the economic aspect. The concept allows applying a flexible design; the construction may be carried out in different phases leading to financial advantages. Moreover, the construction costs of a polder are in most cases (depending on the size and availability of fill material) much less compared with a traditional land reclamation. Weaknesses of the polder concept relate to the operation and maintenance requirements and costs. Polders require a long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) commitment in order to sustain. Due to subsidence and sea level rise, a decrease in safety levels will occur. An opportunity for applying the concept abroad relates to the ongoing urbanization of delta areas and the development in flood prone areas. A threat for applying the concept abroad relates to local governance and administrative weakness. Another threat is the vulnerability of the concept to climate change leading to a discussion on safety. It may be concluded that in the future, the focus should be on urban polders since most development potential can be found in urban delta areas. Urban areas that have an elevation at approximately sea level are getting more prone to flooding due to ongoing subsidence and sea level rise. The most important boundary condition for successful polder development is the presence of the right institutional setting. A qualified and preferably non-political entity (public, private) should be present in order to guarantee the long-term commitment for operation and maintenance. Another important boundary condition, related to the construction and operation and maintenance, is that sufficient financial resources should be available in order to sustain the polder. Possibilities for future business development for knowledge institutes relate to the application and further development of Dutch innovations such as the “Building with Nature” concept, application of smart dikes and prevention of subsidence. Governmental institutions, such as water boards, drinking water companies and municipalities, can be involved in the polder development process by assisting in the set up of an administrative body. The Dutch governmental institutions can also demonstrate their excellent experience with organizing the operation and maintenance in polder settings.","polder; SWOT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

(mentor); Hodgson, D.M. (mentor); Weltje, G.J. (mentor); Storms, J.E.A. (mentor)","2012","As hydrocarbons become scarcer, submarine channelised slope systems have become a focus of exploration due to their reservoir potential. Outcrops of both levee-confined (Unit C) and entrenched (Unit D) channel systems are exposed in the Permian Fort Brown Formation, Karoo Basin, South Africa and have been extensively studied and interpreted. Full coring and logging of six research boreholes behind the outcrop surface has produced a comprehensive dataset including oriented borehole images. Directional features from FMS borehole image logs can be subdivided into direct (cross-bedding and climbing ripples) and indirect (erosion- and amalgamation surfaces and syn-sedimentary faults) palaeoflow indicators. The distribution of these indicators is analysed qualitatively and statistically per well and per (sub)unit to arrive at a solid palaeoflow reconstruction. Distributions of features in unconfined external levee deposits yield the most unambiguous results, whereas levee- or valley-confined features display a higher level of scattering. A borehole-confined, pseudo-2D and a well- and outcrop-confined 3D facies model are built to test the incorporation of the palaeoflow reconstruction. Erosion surface dip azimuths help to locally constrain (sub)unit bounding surfaces. The palaeoflow reconstruction serves to constrain the orientation of data analysis on conceptual facies models and to assign realistic orientations to the representation of multi-point facies patterns. Application of a multi-point statistics (MPS) algorithm maximises use of the available dataset and therefore yields the best results. The approach used is thought to be applicable to analogous channelised slope systems and is designed to work with a subsurface dataset.","Karoo; Laingsburg; Fort Brown Formation; formation micro-scanner; FMS; borehole image; submarine; channelised; slope; directional features; palaeoflow; palaeocurrent; reconstruction; orientation; sequential indicator simulation; SIS; multi-point statistics; MPS; reservoir analogue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","",""
