(mentor); Huang, Yilin (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The transition towards greener mobility will play a significant role in decarbonizing the economy. Hence, policy makers need tools that allow them to test alternatives towards that goal. This drive has led to the development of increasingly accurate transport models, with the latest generation being activity-based transport demand models. These models, however, are hard to build, as they are very data-intensive and complex, therefore in this research project a methodology is conceived which attempts to use readily available data from the Dutch travel demand survey (ODiN) and open source software such as ActivitySim, originally developed as a package in Python to make activity-based models in the United States.<br/><br/>While a very time-intensive task, the data was able to be processed for use in ActivitySim. The data was mostly complete, but needed to be complemented with data from the \textcite{centraal_bureau_voor_de_statistiek_statline_2019}, and information about members of the household other than the survey respondent, and joint tours, is missing. The data, however, can be processed in a way that can be reapplied in the future, which lowers the barrier to develop a model with Dutch survey data.<br/><br/>Choice is modeled as logit discrete choice models, and the estimation of the parameters required is facilitated by ActivitySim, which has built-in functionality to support it, and with an integrated workflow the model parameters can be estimated with little effort. With this procedure, and choosing workplace and school locations in advance, a good degree of accuracy was achieved, but it was shown that the sampling method used to deal with the very large choice set introduced significant bias to the model output, as observed in the travel distances, which were shorter in the simulated output than in the observations in the survey data.<br/><br/>While ActivitySim has a sampling methodology to deal with large choice sets, an alternative method, Stratified Importance Sampling with activity spaces, is implemented based on the survey data, from where the sample is determined using the travel distances observed and which produces more accurate outputs when compared to the default sampling.<br/><br/>The result of this research is a framework to easily develop and estimate an activity-based transport demand model that is able to provide insights on the travel demand, and especially on how to influence individual choice behavior, which can facilitate the procurement of quality analysis for decision support in the arena of sustainable mobility, hopefully helping accelerate the mobility transition.<br/><br/>It was concluded that using ODiN data and ActivitySim presented as advantages an easy and replicable formulation, and the availability of data that can be used for sustainable mobility policy analysis; yet, this formulation fails to account for household interactions, something that activity-based models often promise to do, and the documentation provided by ActivitySim while extensive is still inadequate in some regards to understand how to process the data.<br/><br/>The resulting model is, however, highly accurate, despite needing some considerations and improvements. The model needs to sample destination choice alternatives, because otherwise its big size would bring the model to a halt, and it does so using a sampling method that is programmed into ActivitySim. This method was shown to introduce bias to the simulation output even if the choice model was properly estimated, and hence an alternative sampling method based on Stratified Importance Sampling was implemented, and the model output greatly improved as a result. Hence, we conclude that it is possible to obtain highly accurate and efficient activity-based models using available data such as ODiN and open source software such as ActivitySim.<br/><br/>It is argued that a formulation like this can be highly beneficial to the evaluation of sustainable mobility policies, as it lowers the barrier to obtain the accurate and detailed outputs that other models cannot produce, and it provides accurate destination choices that will then inform other submodels that are necessary to evaluate sustainability impact, such as mode choice, travel distance and travel time to evaluate emissions.<br/><br/>We continue by discussing the limitations stemming from the available data and the lack of information for other household members and joint travel, the trend-breaking nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and is impact on mobility in further years, and the possible untested bias of the newly proposed sampling method; and giving recommendations on how to effectively use of a model developed with this framework.<br/><br/>Finally, further research is proposed regarding remote work, the improvement of the choice models, and on the sampling method used.","Transport Demand Modelling; Transport Modelling; Mobility; Activity-Based Modelling; Sustainability; Sustainable mobility; Netherlands; Choice Modelling; Discrete Choice Modeling; Open source; Simulation Model; Sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","Public repository containing source code, model configurations and data processing scripts https://github.com/davidmatheus002/activity_based_modeling.git","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Experiments have proved the concept of a feature-based rejector works and it is able to filter out unknown unknowns, which is a challenge to the confidence-based rejectors. It also creates better value than the traditional confidence-based rejectors in some cases, especially when the machine learning model is not well calibrated. Further analysis is conducted to understand the behavior of SceneRejector as well. It is discovered that SceneRejector brings better value than confidence-based rejectors when the pretrained model is not well calibrated, and that rejection rate and accuracy of the rejector is also correlated with the value.","selective classifier; rejector; responsible machine learning; value; Crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","High level decision making in Autonomous Driving (AD) is a challenging task due to the presence of multiple actors and complex driving interactions. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been proposed to learn multiple driving policies concurrently to solve AD tasks. In the literature, multi-agent algorithms have been shown to outperform single-agent algorithms and rule-based algorithms. Also several techniques have been employed to facilitate convergence in policy learning such as parameter sharing and local reward design. Further, functional safety in AD has been addressed with techniques such as unsafe action-masking. However, there is a gap in the literature on the study of the effects of entropy regularization and on policies learned with closed-loop stability guarantee to solve AD tasks in MARL. In this thesis, research gaps are addressed in entropy regularization and Lyapunov stability constrained policy objectives applied to Autonomous Driving in MARL. Specifically, it is demonstrated on the lane-keeping task with 2 agents that entropy regularization improves training stability. It was also shown that in stochastic multi-agent algorithms on the lane-keeping task, a Lyapunov constrained policy objective performs better in average episode returns, success rate and collision rate than a policy objective without a Lyapunov constraint with low measurement noise perturbation. However, an algorithm with a stochastic actor performs worse than that with a deterministic actor in stability and lane center proximity on the lane-keeping task.","Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Autonomous driving; Entropy regularization; Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hilhorst, Renate (mentor); van Raaij, Bjørn (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Society is increasingly faced with complex and wicked problems (Hervieux &amp; Voltan, 2019). As a result, organisations face complex and open challenges and design has become more popular as an approach to address this (Dorst, 2011). Due to these global changes, the social design field is growing (Tromp &amp; Vial, 2022). Participatory design is part of this field and has also gained more acceptance over the years (Smith &amp; Iversen, 2018). The concept of citizen participation is experiencing growth due to rules and regulations that encourage this in government projects (e.g. the Omgevingswet (IPLO, n.d.)). Municipalities hire design studios like Zeewaardig to help guide these participatory processes, because of their expertise in the field of participatory design. Literature shows that there is often still a need to demonstrate the value of design to clients (Schmiedgen et al., 2016). This research is commissioned by Zeewaardig, a design studio working on participatory design, who also want to demonstrate the value of their approach. However, little is known about the impact of a participatory design approach on participating residents.<br/><br/>This research proposes the concept of empowered citizenship as a key form of impact that can be made on residents through a participatory design approach. It further details this concept in a framework that outlines the various components that make up empowered citizenship and the participatory design activities that are related to this impact. Empowered citizenship consists of two components: citizen empowerment (which consists of voice, agency and opportunity structure) and responsible citizenship (which consists of a sense of collectivity and citizenship abilities).<br/><br/>This framework was evaluated with designers. Furthermore, it was used to explore how the framework could be used to evaluate impact through a case study analysis. The findings from the case study further validated the framework, but also provided more learnings on participatory design and the measurement of impact.<br/><br/>Based on the learnings from literature and the case study the ‘Are we making impact?’ tool is introduced. This impact demonstration tool consists of a poster and a booklet. Both are set up around the same three elements: 1) What is impact in the participatory design context, 2) How to think about impact in participatory design projects, and 3) Demonstrating impact, step by step. The first two elements use the framework and impact considerations to help designers become aware of impact in their projects, better understand it, and be able to make informed decisions about it with clients in a kick-off. The third element provides an overview of the steps designers need to take to demonstrate the impact of their participatory approach.<br/><br/>The tool was evaluated with Zeewaardig and other participatory design studios. This demonstrated its value as a tool that helps designers to make more effective agreements at the front end of a project. This in turn will give them more freedom to work towards empowered citizenship. In addition, the tool helps to demonstrate impact and thus improve their practice and have more credible arguments towards (future) clients.<br","Empowered citizenship; Participatory design; Impact demonstration; Social impact; Zeewaardig Service Design; Citizen empowerment; Responsible citizenship; Participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, even though routing problems have been widely researched, the solutions provided by algorithms do not always match drivers' expectations. Routing costs used by these algorithms are often based on one or a few parameters, but in real-world operations, many factors and sometimes hard-to-define aspects are responsible for this. Drivers can consider these different aspects and some studies found that experienced drivers often plan better delivery routes than the optimization tools. In this research, we focus on using expert decision data as examples for learning the costs of routing and train a policy that can make decisions more in line with the expectations of the expert. We formulate state-action representations for the TSP and CVRP, which we use to interpret these routing problems as inverse optimization and multiclass classification problems. Additionally, we propose multiple policy training approaches as well as state feature vector transformations that can be used based on the characteristics of the routing problems. These different training configurations are utilized to train different existing algorithms with training data sets consisting of example state-action pairs. The performance of the trained models is compared to each other and the optimal solution. The optimal solution acted as expert example and was used to create the training data. We demonstrate that both inverse optimization and multiclass classification algorithms are able to imitate expert decision-making for new problem instances from example data. However, we also show a large variation in performance depending on the problem, state features, algorithm formulations and training configuration.","Routing; Inverse Optimization; Multiclass Classification; Supervised Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","","",""

(mentor); Pals, Hugo (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The term ""digital transformation"" (DT) has gained popularity, sparking interest across many academic fields and inspiring new lines of inquiry(Hausberg et al., 2019). With the adoption of new technologies helping deliver secure high-quality patient care and drive greater business efficiency, healthcare sector has gained significant benefits from digital transformation. Digital technologies, driven by the exponential rise in computing power, have successfully altered the majority of economic sectors, from finance to entertainment, with one notable exception: healthcare. The increasing advancements in medical equipment and imaging technology serve as evident illustrations of how high-tech medicine is in many aspects. Nevertheless, healthtech companies are still on a learning curve on how to transform their companies digitally, despite billions of dollars being invested in digital health solutions by both startup and established technology companies(Walsh &amp; Rumsfeld, 2017). <br/>This study advances the body of knowledge in the field of digital transformation by identifying the barriers to and enablers of business transformation as well as the role of IT technology as an enabler of business transformation. By creating a theoretical framework for barriers and enablers of business transformation with IT technology as an enabler, it empirically studies Philips to undertake a case study and offers a basis for theory building. On the subject of business transformation, a literature review utilizing the five-step grounded theory methodology was carried out. According to the literature study, this research highlights four primary barriers facing business transformation: organizational, knowledge, financial, and technical. Strategy, people, process, data, and technology are the different categories for business transformation enablers. The theoretical framework for this study is developed using the results of this literature review. A case study is performed on the digital transformation journey of Philips by identifying the IT technologies of the acquired firms that are part of Philip’s healthcare transformation portfolio. This research captures the goal of business transformation while identifying the barriers and enablers of business transformation at Philips by conducting inductive qualitative research by interviewing. Analysis of data is carried out by following the steps stated by Miles &amp; Huberman (1994) and using content analysis to analyze the interview data. The results of this study show that At Philips, the organizational barrier has emerged as the most pervasive barrier to business transformation. This study demonstrates that Philips' organizational structure, or the way they are set up, is a significant impediment to business transformation. The matrix organizational structure of Philips makes organizational change challenging. According to researchers, business transformation begins with establishing a strategy and achieving the organization's aim. According to the research, this strategy is misleading, and that any business transformation strategy should be developed by first comprehending customer demands before being in line with the intended outcome of the business transformation. According to this study, people with proper experience and knowledge in the field of business transformation are the key enabler of business transformation. This study supports the resource-based hypothesis, which contends that an organization has a great chance to outperform its rivals when it possesses strategic resources that can provide it an advantage in the market and could even help it generate sizable profits. This research examines three important IT technologies provided by the acquired companies of Philips, namely Tomtec, RDT, and Capsule technologies as resources that can enable business transformation. According to this study, Philips' business transformation was made possible by the IT technologies' significant contributions to the company's sales and revenues following the acquisition of these companies. By integrating these IT resources into other products in their portfolio to facilitate business transformation, Philips can further develop these technologies and achieve their objective of becoming a fully solutions-based firm. However, the findings of this study also suggest that IT technologies have not yet reached their peak value since Philips lacks the competencies and innovation culture to fully utilize these technologies and add value as a result of preexisting limitations.<br","Business Transformation; Barriers; Enablers; Healthcare; IT Technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

During this process, accurate positioning, speed control, and multiplexing of the beads need to be solved to give high-resolution and high-throughput sequencing capabilities. We identify surface acoustics wave (SAW) devices as powerful tools to achieve both beads transport and massively parallel manipulation. Our hypothesis is that we can increase the efficiency and precision of bead capture and manipulation by using SAW devices combined with a microcavity layer. In this master thesis, we fabricate the SAW device with an average 2 $\mu m$ thick film, and there are cavity arrays on the film. In addition, we investigate the performance of trapping sub-micron objects during the actuation.

Roundabouts are also growing and are popular intersection designs because they are one of the safest types of intersections and improve traffic flow. It is, therefore, likely that in some cities a BRT route will go through a roundabout. <br/>To keep the priority of BRT and the safety effects of a roundabout, the evaluation of roundabouts with BRT based on safety and level of service (performance) of all modes is investigated. Some countries have already developed and built solutions for roundabouts with BRT, where the priority of the buses can differ. One solution, often called throughabouts, is where the exclusive bus lanes go through the centre island of the roundabout, giving full priority to the buses. However, few guidelines have been developed on roundabout solutions with BRT and there seems to be a disagreement about the effectiveness of these types between some countries.<br/>This thesis aims to reduce this research gap by developing an evaluation methodology that compares and evaluates different design solutions of roundabouts with BRT based on the safety and level of service of all modes. The evaluation methodology is also able to determine which design solution is the most optimal.<br/>The methods used to compare and evaluate the designs in the methodology are literature review, multicriteria analysis (MCA), microsimulations and calculations, and a case study.<br/>A case study of a roundabout in Reykjavik, Iceland is used to illustrate and test the methodology. Three design solutions are compared and evaluated where the priority configuration of the BRT is changed for each design. Design 1 is a regular roundabout where the buses drive through the intersection in mixed traffic. Design 2 is a throughabout where there are traffic signals for all entering traffic, and design 3 is a throughabout where there are traffic signals for the conflicting traffic. These designs are evaluated based on the traffic performance indicators of total throughput, travel time, and variation in travel time, and the safety indicators of number and types of conflicts for vehicle – vehicle conflicts and active mode – vehicle conflicts, and costs. These indicators are obtained by the output of a VISSIM model and using SSAM for the safety calculations. MCA is used to compare and evaluate the designs.<br/>This results in that throughabouts with traffic signals for conflicting traffic prove to be the most optimal designs for roundabouts with BRT. They are also both the safest and best performing design solution.<br/>This thesis addresses the research gap of disagreement of the effectiveness of the roundabouts by showing that throughabouts are effective, however, to determine their full effectiveness, further research is recommended on comparing throughabouts with other types of intersections. This thesis developed an evaluation methodology which can be used to evaluate and compare different design solutions which can be used to decide which design is the most optimal for intersections.","Bus Rapid Transit; Roundabout; Safety; Throughabout; Evaluation; Microsimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The recycled content is often known in percentages. Steel is a material which gets recycled almost 100%. However it is not common practice to specify the recycled content for steel products. From a sustainability point of view this information can be very valuable. This thesis identifies the barriers and opportunities for a class notation that specifies the recycled content of a vessel or marine structure. Furthermore, the way certification of steel would influence trust, traceability and transparency of a circular economy in the shipbuilding industry has been investigated. This was done from the point of view of a classification society but to reach the conclusion, the entire shipbuilding value chain has been investigated. Semi structured interviews were held with different stakeholders from the ship building value chain. These interviewees were steel manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, ship yards, recycling yards, classification societies, financial institutions, ship repair yards and shipping companies. Barriers that were found are, amongst others, technical feasibility, steel market, yard logistics, customer willingness to pay, green washing, ship recycling standards, demographic differences, etc. The first conclusion is that, although sustainability is high on the agenda for most companies, the efforts and goals on this matter are scattered and uncoordinated. All stakeholders, except for the steelmakers, see the benefit for certification of recycled steel in terms of increased sustainability. The steelmakers possess the ability to provide all necessary information and there are no technical barriers. This means that they are able to provide steel products with a specified percentage of recycled content. The main barrier for different stakeholders are the extra resources they need to spent to incorporate a new type of certification into their business processes. None of these stakeholders want to take the risk as a single player, but are willing to take part once collaboration amongst all stakeholders are guaranteed. This creates the business opportunity for classification societies to provide this opportunity and take the lead for this innovation. A review of current certification steps for steel products has been made and adapted to include extra steps to certify the recycled contents. The effect of this extra steps with regard to stakeholders downstream has been investigated and validated by means of the interviews. Another topic is the digitalisation. Because of the increased ability to process big data, there are opportunities to tackle certification of recycled products and the subsequent traceability by means of blockchain technology. These opportunities are identified and are proposed as optional further research topics.","Circularity; Shipbuilding; Recycling; Certification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-17","","","","","",""

These challenges should be tackled together through the integral question of ‘what does the area need?’ instead of the more contemporary idea of adding one aspect and the rest will follow. This thesis argues that the territory-oriented approach in relation to current functions and natural and cultural value support urban development to create value in low-lying Dutch polders. In this project, a design for the Benthuizer Noordpolder is created with the use of the territory-oriented approach that regards several aspects of the project, such as urban development, water management, agriculture, and recreation. Through the investment in time, cultural and natural values, integral design, and adaption a design is created that takes a proactive stance toward the current climatic and societal challenges.<br/><br/>This is achieved by using water as a carrier. The hypothesis of a new waterway functions as the backbone of the transition of the area. This transition allows for the reconstruction of a landscape that is related to the natural cultural landscape. Through several steps towards 2100, the vision creates a new type of urban ecosystem that has a beneficial relationship with the landscape. Infrastructure, housing, and open spaces are reconfigured to enhance the system. Through the addition of floodable housing typologies and infrastructure, a new perspective is given on the relationship with the delta which argues for a shift from extreme water management to the creation of boundaries in which the water is allowed its natural rhythm. Through the territory-oriented approach and the use of the physical conditions of the site, the landscape is transformed from barren agricultural landscape to a multifunctional landscape in which there is space for agriculture, living, and recreation. With this design, the argument is made that it is possible to propose urban development in the low-lying polders. <br/><br/>The project’s progression from today until 2100 is not without limitations. Questions have been put about the justness, the involvement of stakeholders, and water management specifications. This design for the area of the Benthuizer Noordpolder conveys that future value can be created by reimagining infrastructure, housing, and open spaces through long-term investment.<br","natural cultural value; territory-oriented approach; sustainability; Spatial Quality; barge canals; Benthuizer Noordpolder (the Netherlands)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Erfgoed Onthuld","52.09207203420591, 4.544386796245165"

With the advent of automated vehicles in the market, it is anticipated to become an even greater problem as the passengers face a lack of predictability of motion and loss of control over the vehicle. This could nullify the host of possible benefits that automated vehicles propose to offer, and therefore affect their acceptance among potential users.<br/> <br/>It is well known that the nauseogenicity of imposed motion is dependent on the frequency content of endured accelerations, with low-frequency accelerations being the primary contributor. This thesis presents a motion planning algorithm targeted towards minimization of motion sickness among passengers of automated vehicles, through targeted reduction of low-frequency accelerations. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework was utilised along with the design of a custom environment and a reward function which incorporates a measure of nauseogenicity of the planned trajectories. The frequency shaping effect of the reward function was evaluated by comparing against a DRL agent trained to optimize general motion comfort described by total acceleration energy. It was found that the nauseogenicity was reduced by 9.6% with the proposed DRL agent. <br/><br/>Further, on-road trials were performed with human drivers to establish a benchmark of driving comfort. The performance of the DRL agent was compared to human drivers as well as against an optimization-based motion planner that computationally maximizes the reward function. The DRL planner displayed comparable performance to the human drivers, and was within 10 to 15% of the discomfort levels of the optimization-based planner for a range of travel times. Meanwhile, the DRL planner offered notable improvements in computational efficiency, taking 1-2 ms to generate a sub-optimal trajectory, as opposed to approximately 5 s as taken by the optimization-based planner. <br","Motion Planning; Motion Sickness; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Automated Drving Systems; Proximal Policy Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Dynamics and Controls","",""

In this study the key considerations and perspectives regarding the (financial) participation, as a means to increase public support, were explored by conducting interviews among the key stakeholders of onshore underground energy storage projects. An empirically grounded, explanatory framework for understanding the role of perceptions of justice in the dynamics of controversy, introducing two assessment trajectories (the formal and the informal) was used to analyse the results. The study found that the definition and perception of technical risks of onshore underground energy storage projects vary considerably. In addition, four overarching themes (national coordination, the damage-handling process, the division of roles and responsibilities, and the distribution of benefits and burdens) were identified. Among the generic characterisation of the themes, there is agreement among the stakeholders. Concerning the conceptualisation of the values, the research findings show that the opinions and perspectives differ. Two processes were identified that are key to the existence of controversies and the effects these have on energy policies, ‘controversy spillover’ and ‘backflowing’. Perspectives and considerations, even if supported by years of experience, will differ from reality when drawing on physical experiences. Therefore, it is essential that in the future, when new procedures and policies regarding onshore underground energy storage projects are introduced, stakeholders’ considerations and perspectives are re-examined. Any new insights or themes identified will support the required adaptation for regulations and policies over time.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This transition is being led by the integration of non-controllable, sustainable generation sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) power. The Dutch wholesale energy market has an imbalance settlement period in which the TSO penalizes or rewards deviations from the last submitted trading program (based on whether the deviations aggravate or relieve the overall market imbalance), and therefore, non-controllable sources are at a higher risks of suffering undesired deviations. The consequences of this are twofold: on one hand, they impose a strain on the grid and an increased demand of ancillary services; and on the other, they risk the economic profitability of the plant.<br/>This issue can be bridged by combining non-controllable generation sources with storage assets.<br/><br/>Although the the dispatch of non-controllable energy sources has been studied extensively, there is a research gap in the proposal of revenue-maximizing strategies for operating hybrid power plants (with wind and PV generation, and energy storage capabilities) in the Dutch wholesale energy market, that account for the stochastic nature of the weather resources and include financial contingency factors.<br/>This thesis aims to bridge that gap by setting up an optimization-based dispatch, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming. The optimization was extended to a scenario-based stochastic optimization, and the Conditional Value at Risk was introduced to account for the intrinsic financial risk of the dispatch under random weather conditions. The resulting problem is a two-stage optimization which was solved using a modified Bender's cut. The intra-day optimizations were also adapted as rolling-horizon dispatches, permitting the operation with periodic updates to the weather forecasts.<br/><br/><br/>The study case for this research was the SWITCH lab, a small-scale laboratory developed by TNO to conduct empirical research on the integration of renewable energies and storage into the grid. TNO also provided the basis for a non-optimized dispatch strategy based on price benchmarking, which was used to compare the performance of the optimized strategy.<br/><br/>The optimized dispatch proved to be an effective strategy for producing maximal-revenue trading programs on all market closings. The optimized revenue provided revenues between 85.8% and 260.1% higher than a generation-alone plant configuration; and an increase in revenue with respect to a generation-only baseline between 300.0% and 8962.9% compared to the non-optimized strategy. Operation under a hybrid configuration using the optmized dispatch also yielded the best economic outlook, having the highest 10-year Net Present Value projections, an average Internal Return on Investment 57.2% higher than the hybrid plant under a non-optimized scheme and a 47.5% lower payback time.<br/><br/>The optimized strategy provided the most profitable trading programs for both the case of deficit and surplus of generation at delivery, turning a positive revenue even under unfavourable market conditions. Conversely, the non-optimized dispatch had the lowest economic outlook of any configuration, with worse NPV, IRR, and payback times than the generation-only plant.<br/><br/>These results highlight the importance of developing dispatch strategies that consider the long-term behaviour of generation and prices, as opposed to here-and-now strategies whose performance was shown to be comparatively deficient; and the synergy between storage and renewable generation sources to bridge the non-controllability problem.<br","Hybrid power plants; Storage; Dutch energy market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

It can reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors and be used for grid balancing services. The energy industry is looking into multiple different system configurations to produce green hydrogen. One such system is an offshore stand-alone wind turbine with the sole purpose of producing hydrogen. The reason for this interest is due to decreasing offshore wind costs, electrolyzer capital expenditure requirements are dropping, and such a system will have high electrolyzer operating hours. Further cost reductions can be achieved by substituting the electrical infrastructure in offshore wind farms as well as on the wind turbine, for hydrogen infrastructure.<br/><br/>When directly connecting an electrolyzer to a non-grid connected fluctuating power source, it will be hard to prevent frequently turning the electrolyzers on and off. That has been found to accelerate component degradation, thereby reducing the system lifetime.<br/><br/>This report aims to address how the system design and the advisory control strategy can increase hydrogen production while decreasing the number of electrolyzer turn-offs. The investigated system comprises a 20 MW wind turbine directly connected to PEM electrolyzers, a desalination system, a<br/>water tank, and a battery. Two PEM electrolyzer configurations were compared, namely 4x5 MW and 2x10 MW. Furthermore, two interesting system additions were analyzed. Firstly, the inclusion of a weather forecast to aid the advisory control with making decisions on when to turn electrolyzers on.<br/>Secondly, an additional storage element that could keep the last electrolyzer idling during a period of low wind speeds.<br/><br/>The individual components of the system were firstly modeled and then connected to get a representative system model. Two different advisory control strategies, which operate the components, were then designed to simulate the system behavior with regard to hydrogen production and the number of<br/>turn-offs, among other key performance indicators.<br/><br/>This thesis project was done in collaboration with Vattenfall, who provided access to 5-second resolution power output data from a single offshore wind turbine. Using that data, different system designs and versions of the two advisory control strategies were simulated with the aim of selecting the best system design and advisory control strategy.<br/><br/>The results showed that the system design and advisory control could significantly reduce the number of electrolyzer turn-offs while producing close to the highest potential of hydrogen. The weather forecast and additional storage element brought substantial benefits regarding the electrolyzer turn-offs but did<br/>not largely impact the hydrogen production.","Maximize hydrogen production; Decrease electrolyzer turn-offs; Operational strategy; System design; PEM electrolyzer; Battery sizing; non-grid connected","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A level change maneuver, with the simulator cabin pitching up and back down, was presented with different maximum pitch angles. After the maneuver, pilots indicated the maximum perceived pitch angle. This motion was presented either with or without a brief (1.25s or 1.5s) heave cue, that was timed to the onset of the pitch motion. Two timings and magnitudes of the heave cue were used to investigate these factors. <br/><br/>The results indicate that the heave cue significantly increased pilot pitch perception by 1.88°, p &lt; 0.001. The maximum pitch angle was 2.69° underestimated without heave and 1.42° underestimated with heave. A higher heave magnitude, relative to a lower, resulted in a significantly larger estimation of the pitch angle, δ = 0.47°, p = 0.009. Earlier timing of the heave cue resulted in marginally significantly higher pitch perception than later timing, δ = 0.43°, p = 0.069. Interestingly, if heave was presented without pitch motion, pilots still estimated 2.66° pitch on average. <br/><br/>The results suggest that heave cueing increases perceived pitch in pilots, even when the heave cues are shorter in duration than cues that would be present in the actual maneuver in flight. Heave cues timed to the onset of pitch motions can thus possibly be used to enhance pilot pitch perception in hexapod simulators.","Heave; Vertical Acceleration; Pitch; Perception; Somatrogravic; Illusion; Spatial disorientation; Spatial Orientation Model; Perceptual Model; Hexapod; Simulator; Pilot Perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Given demographic projections, depopulation will become pervasive in all Serbian environments. However, I would argue that given the extent of the titanic functionalist housing blocks in New Belgrade, depopulation will be felt particularly harshly in the capital. This phenomenon allows us to pose a different question to the ones pressing during the Yugoslav housing construction periods: is a functional dwelling enough?

CO2-EOR method has been largely used in the petroleum industry for several decades, which can contribute to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emission through CO2 sequestration in geological formations besides the elevation of oil recovery levels. Conventionally, CO2 is implemented as a continuous flooding scheme. But CO2 flooding is prone to unfavorable displacements, viscous fingering, gravity segregation and early breakthrough due to the high mobility ratio, low viscosity and low density of CO2. A method to overcome these problems is the alternation of water and CO2 slugs. This method, better known as water alternating gas (WAG) injection, is widely applied through the field. But despite the successes of the WAG injection scheme, the method still suffers from a relatively poor mobility ratio and gravity override. In this experimental study, the performance of the polymer assisted water alternating gas (PA-WAG) EOR method is examined. This method makes use of the high viscosity of the polymer solution in combination with immiscible CO2, to improve the improve the mobility ratio, volumetric sweep efficiency as with that the ultimate recovery of the WAG process. For the polymer, a specially modified polymer is considered, which uses the ATBS (2-acrylamido-terbutylsufonic acid) addition to HPAM in order to improve the stability of the polymer under reservoir conditions. In this thesis, the displacement and recovery performance of the ATBS-modified HPAM polymer is studied via a series of core-flood experiments and the stability is tested via polymer aging in the presence of CO2. The results of this work<br/>have shown that the addition of the ATBS-modified HPAM polymer to the water in the WAG method increased the recovery by 10% over the normal WAG injection, by improving the mobility ratio and displacement efficiency. By implementing the PA-WAG on a carbonate rock saturated with crude oil, a base line experiment with regarding reservoir simulated recovery was established, with a recovery of 76%. The stability test under the presence of CO2 showed that the dissolved CO2 impacts the polymer viscosity. After the initial decrease in apparent viscosity to 54% of the original viscosity, the ATBSmodified HPAM polymer was able to recover its viscosity to 84% of its original apparent viscosity after 29 days of aging. These results were achieved under full saturation of the polymer solution with CO2 . In addition, the impact of CO2 at PA-WAG flooding CO2 concentrations was evaluated, which showed now degradation with the exposure to CO2. The study concludes that the ATBS-modified HPAM polymer performs excellently in the PA-WAG method for enhanced recovery, significantly outperforming the WAG injection method.<br","EOR; Oil and Gas; Oil recovery; displacement efficiency; Core flooding; core flood experiments; polymer; Polymers; polymer stability; sweep efficiency; WAG; PA-WAG; polymer flooding; CO2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","polymer-assisted water alternating gas for enhanced oil recovery",""

This paper presents a non-standard facility location problem (FLP) that arises in the maritime survey industry. The goal is to determine a number of uncapacitated facilities and assign a heterogeneous fleet of both remotely operated vessels and traditional vessels to the located facilities in order to serve the inspection demand of offshore infrastructures such as oil platforms and wind parks. The facilities serve as sites where vessels can refuel and accommodate crew changes. Both current traditional vessels and future uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) are considered in the heterogeneous fleet that respectively combines the distinctive routing behavior of centroid-like hubs and drone-like \textit{one-to-one} trips simultaneously. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is constructed to determine the optimal harbor locations and the associated vessel fleet size \&amp; mix to perform the inspection demand of North-Sea assets over a multi-period time interval. The simulation results are reported for a real case study commissioned by geo-data company Fugro. The results of the model suggest that the effective establishment of facility locations and corresponding fleet allocation can reduce the total costs and environmental footprint of the survey operations in the North-Sea. This research provides a first piece of reflection regarding MIP problems for remote and autonomous operations in the maritime industry. The research pointed out that the complexity of USV operations in combination with traditional vessels is difficult to capture within an acceptably sparse facility location problem. Finally, this study identifies the stochasticity of inspection operations to be the most promising future contribution to automation research in the maritime industry.","Facility location problem; mixed-integer linear programming; centroid-based routing; uncrewed surface vessels; robodocks; maritime survey industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-31","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Investigating the tip vortex inception is important to understand the aforementioned side effect. The water quality, highly related to the bubbles population, surrounding the tip vortex is crucial to the tip vortex cavitation inception. This research explores how bubble moves around the tip vortex and investigates its background mechanisms. A one-way coupled Lagrangian bubble tracking model is applied to the Lamb-Oseen vortex and the hydrofoil tip vortex flow field, where the tip vortex is simulated with an open-usage CFD software, ReFRESCO. A series of capture time models have been developed by exploiting the bubble force (acceleration) balance in the Lamb-Oseen vortex to identify the crucial parameters. The other aspect of the acceleration analysis reflects the role of the lift force as the system's stabilizer, which has long been ignored. In the CFD tip vortex flow simulation, the bubble population evolution is investigated from upstream to downstream. Several kinds of bubble behaviors around the tip vortex flow have been identified via the numerical simulation, and simplified models based on the bubble force analysis have been proposed in order to explain them. Mainly due to the stagnation bubble events, clustering of large bubbles has been discovered a short distance downstream of the foil tip, implying that this may be a possible hotspot for tip vortex cavitation inception. The stagnation bubble phenomenon still needs to be further investigated, particularly in terms of quantifying its dependence on various flow parameters. The results also need to be rigorously validated which has not been possible as of yet due to insufficient measurement data. Still, this research manages to explore the bubble motion around the tip vortex and their fundamental mechanism.","tip vortex; cavitation inception; water quality; bubble entrapment; ReFRESCO; Eulerian-Lagrangian Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

Patient safety defined as ‘the prevention of harm to patients’ is a vital concept in medical teams and is essential in improving quality of medical treatment. Safety culture is defined as “the product of individual and group perceptions, attitudes, values, competencies, and patterns of behavior that decide the commitment to, and the style and proficiency of, an organization’s health and safety management”. The terminology for safety has evolved from a focus on error to patient safety to adopting a safety culture with adequate shared mental models. That evolution reflects a process of shifting responsibility from individuals to the whole organization. More recently, scholars is advocating medical organization to get rid of blame culture and embrace just safety culture. Blame culture is a set of organizational norms and attitudes characterized by being reluctant to accept responsibility or to take risks for errors because of being afraid of criticism or management blame. Just safety culture refers to a culture that encourages open dialogue to promote safer practices. On the face of it, healthcare organizations should quickly abandon blame culture and choose a just culture. However, it’s not easy to deploying a just safety culture in reality. Good implement of just safety culture in a medical team requires much teamwork effort. When it comes to teamwork effort, the shared mental model has received a lot of attention in the literature on medical team performance. A mental model means the intelligence that imitates relation structures of external processes. A shared mental model of a team means a large or complete overlap of the team members’ individual mental models. A useful method to analysis shared mental models of a team is adaptive network-oriented modeling, which refers to modeling complex processes by adaptive networks. The AI technology has the potential to help a medical team deploy just safety culture. But research on how AI can involve in the workflow of existing medical team is limited. Thus, in hoping of solving the problem: How can AI participate in the application of just safety culture to neonatal resuscitation? This study chooses these points to explore: how AI improves the efficiency of team communication, how AI leverages organizational learning, and how AI points out defects and prevents errors. From the perspective of result, these converge into how AI can help improve the performance of the medical team. That leads to the main research question of this research: How to use an adaptive network-oriented modeling method to analysis the AI-coach’s contribution in a medical team’s ventilation operation to save baby in danger?...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","SMILE4Safety",""

Surface water was directly treated with PAC-UF and performance of the system was assessed by looking at membrane fouling and organic micropollutants removal. Combining adsorption and membrane processes in one technique, hybrid membrane processes, enhances performance of OMP removal by membrane processes. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) combined with coagulation and ultrafiltration (UF) is a possible treatment technique for surface water. <br/>Permeability in UF-membranes remains steady, when dosing coagulant. Only a small increase in irreversible fouling of 0.2-0.7*109 m-1h-1 is visible. However, absence of coagulant dosing causes irreversible fouling to increase to 8.7*1010 m-1h-1 and can not be easily reversed with a chemically enhanced backwash (CEB). Inline dosing of PAC alone causes an irreversible fouling of 11.4*1010 m-1h-1 and highest increase in reversible fouling of 11.7*1010 m-1h-1. Addition of coagulant (1.2 mg/l) lowers reversible fouling compared to no dosing, on the other hand addition of PAC to coagulant shows no clear increase or decrease in reversible fouling. Coagulation has a negative effect on capillary blocking, an increase of 4-8% compared to no coagulant or adsorbent. PAC and no dosing did not influence pore blocking. <br/>Highest removal of low to good adsorbable OMP was 10-63% for continuous and simultaneous dosing of 12 mg PAC/l and 1.2 mg FeCl3/l. Increasing filtration time (30 to 60 min) showed highest removal efficiency of 75% of Sotalol and 5-Methyl-1H-Benzotriazole, both good adsorbable OMP. Removal of PFAS varies between a few percent and 37%. Continuous dosing of coagulant (1.2 mg/l) with PAC (10 mg/l) has a negative impact on OMP adsorption including PFAS. With a higher PAC dose (15 mg/l) removal efficiency was not affected. <br/>Addition of coagulant with PAC-UF showed to be effective to prevent irreversible fouling, with direct surface water treatment. However, coagulation is responsible for blocking of capillaries even resulting in a small decrease of permeability. Removal of OMP including PFAS was much lower compared to other PAC-UF systems and therefore PAC-UF with simultaneous and continuous inline dosing of PAC is not a good set-up. Adjustments in set-up should be made in order to make this configuration work. Possible improvements are increase of filtration time between backwash and dosing sequence of PAC and coagulant.","UF; PFAS; Inline dosing; PAC; Coagulant; Fouling; OMP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Hence, it is important to reduce or stop burning fossil fuels to limit the temperature rise to 1.5∘C according to the Paris agreement target. Nowadays, renewable energy sources and distributed generation are increasingly integrated into the electric power system to achieve the ambitious target of the energy transition. Renewable energy sources are inherently fluctuating in their power. Whereas the grid is stable. The interface between these two can be made smooth based on a medium-frequency DC-DC converter. The advantages of increasing frequency are high power density, significant weight and size reduction, dynamic power flow control, and power quality management. All these are possible mainly because of advancements in power electronics in the recent decade. However, these power electronics induce harmonics across insulations, which are fast rising voltages and are repetitive. The dielectric strength of insulations under these fast-rising pulses is to be understood. This thesis project studied oil impregnated paper behavior under pulsed stresses.<br/><br/>To test the Oil Impregnated Paper samples, a source capable of generating repeating pulses with fast rising and lower overshoots is required. This source comprises an AC- DC converter that will power the H-bridge. The pulses from the H-bridge are then fed into a 1:50 pulse transformer to step up the voltage, which is then delivered across OIP (Oil Impregnated Papers) through test components that regulate the pulse’s rising time and overshoot. The process began with identifying critical factors to consider while developing a pulse generator. Following that, a random transformer prototype is created along with another transformer to extract the parameters, which are then modeled in the circuit simulator and COMSOL to predict the pulse. An algorithm was created to optimize the transformer design. Finally, this design method creates a pulse transformer that generates the necessary output.<br/><br/>The OIP samples are then tested at frequency 50&#x1d458;&#x1d43b;&#x1d467; and at various voltages with a rise time &#x1d447;&#x1d45f; ≈ 1.3&#x1d707; &#x1d460;.

This can provide early diagnosis of changes in behavioral patterns in the home environment, without hospitalization, and detect critical events such as falls in a timely manner. In this area, radar-based HAR solutions are attracting the researchers' attention because no optical images are captured by radars, and thus respect of privacy and functionality in darkness can be guaranteed. Furthermore, no sensors need to be worn by the person being monitored.<br/>Most previous work related to radar-based HAR employs image-like data representation such as spectrograms, range profiles, and snapshots of point clouds, and the information contained in these data representation is limited. For instance, spectrograms and range profiles cannot reflect the body shape of the subjects, while snapshots of point cloud do not contain Doppler or intensity information.<br/>To overcome the limitation of these data representations, we propose to utilize the data from a mm-wave FMCW MIMO radar to create a novel data representation of point cloud with Doppler and intensity values, plus temporal information to achieve accurate HAR. <br/>Specifically, this thesis work focuses on the high dimensional radar point clouds and on a pipeline to generate and process this novel data representation. The proposed method combines the spatial information of point clouds with other features like Doppler, intensity/SNR, and time, expanding each point from 3D coordinates to a 6D vector. <br/>Hence, the movement of every part of the body can be expressed by those points. A module consisting of adaptive noise cancelation, frame selection, and resampling is proposed to process point clouds to match the input of subsequent classifiers. <br/>Considering that the core of the self-attention concept matches well the information within point clouds, we investigate three self-attention based models as classifiers. These models can learn the spatial distribution of point clouds with their extra features with self-attention mechanism. The best combination of different input features, the positive contribution of the proposed adaptive noise cancelation method, and the performance of these three models are studied with experimental data from the MMActivity dataset and a purposely collected TU Delft (TUD) dataset.","Human Activity Recognition; Deep Learning; Point Transformer; Radar Signal Processing; Image Radar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-25","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

We derive the backpropagation equations necessary for training and use different configurations in a DNN to test its interpolating accuracy. We distinguish between a-PINNs which use automatic differentiation to evaluate a PDE, and n-PINNs which approximate differential operators in a PDE with numerical differentiation. We compare both PINNs on the harmonic oscillator, the 1D heat equation and the 1-soliton and 2-soliton solutions of the Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) equation. Both PINNs could accurately converge to the solution, except to the 2-soliton solution, where the a-PINN outperformed the n-PINN. Furthermore, we tested a highly nonlinear problem of the KdV equation, which can be described by a train of solitons. We observed that PINNs are inaccurate if insufficient training samples are used for training. Adding training samples on the interior from a numerical solution leads to a good qualitative agreement, though more effort is required to find a better network configuration to obtain more accurate predictions.<br/>Additionally, PINNs were used for inverse problems to derive an unknown coefficient in a PDE and proved to be highly accurate for noiseless data. When we<br/>generated training samples with 10% noise from a uniform distribution, the PINN<br/>results’ relative error stayed within a margin of under 2%. However, inverse PINNs are much more inefficient compared to nonlinear least squares methods like the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.<br/>As of now, PINNs are still very early in development and stand no match against<br/>traditional numerical methods to a known PDE.

In this thesis, one design is proposed to fulfill the requirement of high efficiency, and another one achieves fully integrated.<br/><br/>This thesis proposes a hybrid DC-DC step-up converter with a new architecture by merging a traditional inductor-based (IB) boost converter with a switched-capacitor (SC) converter to boost 3-4.2-V input to 20-30-V output. By serially connecting an IB boost converter and a 1:6 Dickson SC converter, the capacitors take over most of the output voltage stress. As a result, the voltage stress over each switch is limited to 5 V, which makes it possible to implement all the power switches with only on-chip 5-V devices. Thanks to the 5-V devices, the overall power conversion efficiency is improved in various aspects. The switching frequency of the SC stage is decreased by the soft charging technique, which helps further improve the efficiency.

Numerous academics have examined the first-mover advantage literature to determine whether entering first, second, or late is more advantageous. After many decades, there is still no consensus, and it appears that we are in a dialogue of the deaf. This thesis gives a list of first-mover advantages and disadvantages and discusses the symmetry between first-mover advantages and first-mover disadvantages, as well as first-mover advantages and second-mover disadvantages, in order to extent the topic. This list alone is not enough to settle the debate, so we introduce the pattern of development and diffusion. The pattern of development and diffusion contextualises the problem and shows the demonstrates the effect of first-mover advantages on the development of a product category. The relationship demonstrates that a setting can be either dynamic (a market entry has a substantial impact on the product category) or static (a market entry has little effect).<br/>This thesis proposes a model to illustrate the factors that influence the decision to enter the market. Aspects that influence the formulation of a market entry strategy are included in the model. For the sake of simplicity, only the strategy to enter a market has been investigated. Next to the model, we created a flowchart that describes the steps required to develop a market entry strategy. Eventually the goal is to make a well-thought decision. The dialogue of the deaf on first, second or late being most favourable has been the cause of this thesis but the conclusion is none of those. The most important part of first-mover advantages and disadvantages is the effect they bring along with the entry into a market. This thesis claims that first-mover advantages are advantages and disadvantages that may be evaluated over the development of a product category, rather than belonging to any particular order. The weights of (dis)advantages differ over the course of the development so at different points in time, different advantages can be utilised. The first-mover (dis)advantages present aspects that can be utilised at a particular situation. The decision maker should foresee whether, given the current (dis)advantages, after its introduction the situation is most favourable or if the situation is most favourable when you wait, and competitors have entered the market. The combination of the pattern of development and first-mover advantages show this principle and show why the dialogue of the deaf on market order is not useful. The decision to enter a market has never been simple, and it likely never will be. This thesis offers direction for the decision-making procedure and explains how to comprehend it. The complexities of market entry decision making are not yet resolved, but a well-thought decision is getting closer.","First-mover advantages; market entry; Pattern of development and diffusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This thesis introduces an adaptive controller that can cope with the large flight envelope and varying flight conditions of the VTOL drone and can adapt the controller effectively and store previous adaptations with multivariate B-splines during real-time flights.","Adaptive control; INDI; Multivariate B-spline; VTOL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.0126341,4.3555860."

Discontinuities can be physical openings like fractures and joints, interfaces between different material types, or zones with different material behaviour like mortar or reinforcement material. Bulk material behaviour is often determined by the behaviour of the discontinuities by providing preferential pathways for flow or by acting as failure planes. <br/>FEM simulations with continuum elements are typically not suitable for modelling discontinuities with no width, due to the inability to model discontinuous fields. One solution is to represent discontinuities using zero-thickness interface elements. Inserting zero-thickness interface elements allows for discretely modelling discontinuous behaviour between neighbouring continuum elements. The continuum elements are then used to represent the bulk behaviour and the zero-thickness interface elements discretely model the discontinuity.<br/>A new constitutive law for zero-thickness interface elements that expands the cohesive zone model with friction is formulated in this thesis. The tangential stress response of the interface elements consists of a cohesive and frictional contribution. The cohesive component of the constitutive law is based on the Crisfield’s cohesive elasto-damage model, which is characterised by a linear elastic response to increased relative displacement, followed by degradation of the cohesive strength and stiffness. The elasto-plastic frictional component is based on the Dahl friction model and implemented in parallel to the cohesive component.<br/>The implemented new constitutive law is verified in a large variety of loading conditions, including tangential loading, tangential loading with a reversion of loading direction and combinations of mixed-mode loading. The constitutive laws are validated based on shear box experiments performed on London clay where interface elements are used to model a predefined shearing plane.<br/>The cohesive and frictional constitutive law can represent confinement-dependent tangential stress and residual stress at large relative displacements. These features, observed in the shear box experiments, could not be reproduced by the purely cohesive constitutive law. This new constitutive law can be used to better model discontinuities in geomaterials represented by zero-thickness interface elements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The dose calculation algorithms that provide enough accuracy for treatment planning, takes too much time to utilise; therefore there is a need for faster alternatives. One of the alternatives is using a deterministic semi-analytic numerical algorithm for EM interactions. This alternative in its current state is not accurate enough, and therefore it is sought to include the effects of secondary protons on the total dose distribution of the deterministic semi-analytic numerical algorithm, using convolutional methods. In this thesis an attempt is made to find a kernel that, when convoluted with a primary proton flux, produces the desired secondary proton dose. The parameters of two different types of kernels, the Gaussian kernel and Fractional Filter kernel, are optimised and their resulting shapes are presented. Furthermore, the secondary proton dose through the convolution of the primary proton flux and the different kernels are presented. The doses obtained from the optimal kernels are compared with the target dose on the shape and a measure of quality: the gamma index passing rate. Found was that the Fractional Filter kernel can produce both asymmetric doses and symmetric doses, while the Gaussian kernel can only produce symmetric doses. The passing rate was found to be 29.41% for the Fractional Filter kernel and 17.65% for the Gaussian kernel. Thus, the Fractional Filter is better for estimating secondary proton dose distribution through convolutional methods than using a Gaussian kernel. but insufficient due to the low passing rate. A suggestion for improvement is applying skew-Gaussians in the Fractional Filter kernel or by applying other asymmetric kernels.","Proton therapy; Convolution","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The reason is mainly given by their simple design methods. In particular, frequency domain predictive performance analysis and stability methods allow the use of loopshaping techniques. Nevertheless, inherent limitations affecting linear controllers pose constraints on their performance that can only be overcome through the adoption of nonlinear control schemes. Promising findings in recent literature suggest that with reset control, a nonlinear control technique, it is possible to overcome these limitations. At the same time, reset control could also potentially allow the use of straightforward design techniques, thus making it suitable for industrial applications. The main goal of this work is to bring together the different concepts scattered in literature, in order to initialize the construction of a general framework for the design and analysis of reset controllers suitable for an industrial setting. Tuning guidelines for different structures using two classes of reset controllers, the first order reset element and the proportional Clegg integrator, were presented. Two frequency domain methods, namely open-loop higher order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs) and pseudosensitivities computed through analytically derived (approximate) closed-loop HOSIDFs, were effectively applied to predict steady-state performance. Stability was (when possible) analysed through the frequency domain Nyquist stability vector method, which could also be implemented in the design process. The frequency domain analysis methods allowed the use of loopshaping techniques similar to LTI control for the design of reset controllers. The controllers, implemented digitally on an ASM Pacific Technology wire bonding machine, show that through reset control a significant decrease in the root mean square of the settling error compared to an equivalent LTI controller could be achieved. The existing frequency domain analysis methods, its straightforward implementation and the increase in performance achieved in experiments validate the potential of reset control as a suitable alternative to LTI control for industry. Nevertheless, limitations in the explored reset control structures still exist and further work is required in order to achieve the full potential that this technique has to offer.","Reset control; HOSIDF; Frequency domain analysis; CgLp; PCI; wire bonding; Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wagner, Ben (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Entrepreneurial exit can be considered one of the most important moments in the entrepreneurial life cycle. However, within the literature, this importance was only recognized recently. Research regarding entrepreneurial exit went through a few stages; Firstly, the focus was on re-defining entrepreneurial exit and giving it a place in the life cycle. Entrepreneurial exit used to be an event that was associated with failure. Right now, not perse. It’s an event with many choices and can be studied on many levels. Within this study, exit will be looked at the level of the entrepreneur. Secondly, the role of the entrepreneur was considered; this includes variables such as intentions and personality traits. Lastly, state-of-the-art research seems to be looking at team dynamics. Currently, the main focus points were on homogeneity within the team. This study is an exploratory research which tries to link team dynamics and entrepreneurial exit. The found connections can be used for further studies.<br/>To achieve this, the main research question for this study is formulated as follows:<br/>How do team-dynamics in technical firms affect the entrepreneur's intention to exit the start-up and the chosen exit strategy?<br/>To answer the research question, a qualitative method was used, namely the comparative case study by using contrasting cases. The case studies are created by conducting interviews with management team members of technological start-ups/scale-ups. This contrast between cases is created by using a quadrant that divides the cases into “entrepreneurial exit incidents” and starting and more developed start-ups/scale-ups. Furthermore, the semi-structured interview is created by doing a literature review. Out of this literature review, multiple propositions were derived, and a conceptual model was formed. Afterwards, the propositions and conceptual model were the guidelines for the interviews. Lastly, the literature review was based on the sub-research questions.<br/>12 case studies were formed, which were analyzed first individually and second cross-case. For the individual analyses, an open code method was used. For the cross-case, axial coding. Lastly, to find something coherent, selective coding was used.<br/>The conceptual model created with the literature cannot be supported by the case studies. However, out of the cross-case analysis, new interesting hypothesis have been formed. Such as 1. The friendship of the founding team and how they met are directly correlated with the homogeneity of the team. 2. Conflict in the early stages most happens because of a lack of entrepreneurial experience and an unclear separation of tasks. Furthermore, homogenous teams are more likely to have an unclear separation of tasks. 3. Conflict in the later stages of the companies is mostly related to different core values between management team members.<br/>Each of these relationships could be interesting for future research, such as how fast certain milestones are reached within a homogenous founding team and a heterogenous founding team. How could this early unclear separation of tasks be improved? This could be a bigger issue for homogenous teams where people have similar skills and interests. Lastly, how could management team members be selected for long-term value and minimal conflict?","Entrepreneurial exit; Entrepeneurship; Team dynamics; conflict; Management team; Executive team","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","Master Thesis",""

Recently, it has become competitive to use this type of construction to offshore topsides as well. Originally, topsides were built as a lattice structure, mainly for the oil and gas industry. Over the years, it was found that these lattice structures are sensitive to fluid and air leakage. Due to the later development of offshore wind farms with high voltage equipment, topsides were now also required as transformer houses for these farms. This necessitated topsides less sensitive to leakage, using a stressed skin structure.<br/><br/>Stiffened plated structures in compression are prone to fail by buckling. Therefore, each panel must be checked for every possible load case in the lifetime of the structure. There are three methods in which stiffened panels can be checked for buckling: full-scale experiments, FEA and by design code. Full-scale experiments are not cost-efficient because each topside is exposed to many different load conditions. Therefore, the only economically viable methods are FEA and design codes. Compared to non-linear plastic FEA, design codes are most economical and therefore the most cost-efficient choice for larger structures like topsides. However, the design code method yields more conservative results compared to non-linear plastic FEA.<br/>Due to the use of many panels in a stressed skin topside, a demand has arisen for an automated application of the DNV-RP-C201 buckling standard for stiffened plated structures. This automated method opens up the possibility of stiffener placement optimization. This means that the stiffeners no longer need to be modelled in the design. In other words, during the design phase, non-stiffened panels can be modelled. At a later point in time, the optimization method can determine the number and type of stiffeners and stringers needed in the structure to ensure stability according to the DNV-RP-C201 design code.<br/><br/>Buckling analysis is dependent on a large set of variables and design considerations. The developed method sets clear boundaries for the applicability of the method and justifies the choices made.<br/><br/>Design codes have their limitation concerning assumptions which are not close to real conditions. Panels are subjected to uneven, distributed loads. Design codes provide rules for linear distributed loads over non-stiffened panels, but not for stiffened panels. For stiffened panels, because of the effective width method, an average stress distribution over a plate-stiffener is assumed. It was unclear whether large stress distributions over plate-stiffeners would cause a degrading effect on their ultimate resistance. Therefore, a validation study has been performed for uni-axially loaded stiffened panels. Non-linear plastic FEA has been used to determine the ultimate resistance.<br/><br/>From these “numerical experiments”, it can be concluded that the effective width method can be applied in most cases of stiffened panels. However, in the case of a plate slenderness between 3 and 4.28, large stress distributions can have a degrading effect on the ultimate resistance of the plate stiffener. Therefore, for plate of such slenderness, the maximum of a stress distribution should not exceed twice the minimum.<br/><br/>The stiffener optimization method developed in this thesis allows engineers to design stability-governed structures without modelling each individual stiffener. This enhances design flexibility and majorly simplifies the FE model. Later, the method can quickly generate a stiffener placement optimum, which would not be feasible by hand.","Stressed skin; Topsides; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vuik, Cornelis (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The goal of this work is to evaluate the aptness of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for use as surrogate reduced order fluid models. In contrast to previously published work, the focus is placed on analyzing the specific effect of adversarial training, by comparing GAN outcomes with those from an identical generator network trained directly on ground truth (using an L1 loss). A dataset of 10000 simulated examples of stationary flow through a 2D sudden expansion geometry containing a polygonal obstacle was created, alongside two additional datasets for testing generalization. The simulation data was interpolated to a regular image grid, and the neural networks were trained to predict the velocity field based on an image encoding the geometry.<br/>The gathered experimental data show clearly that adversarial training cannot reach the same accuracy as direct training. This was found to be true on unseen examples from the training distribution, as well as on geometries of unfamiliar type. On the other hand, GAN outcomes tend to ""appear"" more realistic, and exhibit a lower continuity residual. The qualitative differences were highlighted by considering bifurcation scenarios which were purposefully included in the data set. When the bifurcation parameter is at its critical value, two very different flow scenarios can occur essentially randomly. In such cases, the GAN essentially predicts just one of the possible flow outcomes, whereas the directly trained model outputs a superposition of both. This exemplifies a fundamental difference in prediction behavior.<br/>It is shown that these results can be well understood as a direct consequence of the different cost functions used during training. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by using a sum of both types of loss functions (adversarial &amp; L1), advantages of both models can be combined.<br/>In other results, the data show that the discriminator output cannot provide a reliable indication of the accuracy of a prediction, since no robust correlation between them was found. Also, it was observed that the discriminator appeared to dominate the adversarial game, and it was shown that improving this balance could lead to better results. Moreover, an investigation into predicting pressure alongside the velocity field was conducted. Results showed that adding an additional channel for pressure to the network architecture can achieve this goal, but is not necessary, as calculating the pressure field from the velocity output produces results of similar quality. In terms of resources, GAN training required a relative increase in computational time by approx. 50%. Additionally, GAN models were also found to take many more training steps to reach convergence. Similarly, for a fixed number of steps, results showed that directly trained models can benefit more from larger datasets. In conclusion, GAN models are likely not the right choice for reduced order modeling in scientific contexts due to their lower accuracy. However, they could hold potential for use in creating visual effects or as an added regularizer during training.","GAN; CFD; ROM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

SMEs are responsible for many greenhouse gas emissions emitted and as almost all companies in the Netherlands are SMEs, this presents an urgent call for change. However, many SMEs are not prioritising sustainability which is not without cause. Many limitations within SMEs withhold them from taking action. The most significant hurdle for SMEs is their size which comes with limited human, financial and technical resources. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the same limitations result in SMEs’ lagging use of digital technologies. This lagging use of digital technologies is unfortunate because ICT can positively contribute to environmental goals if an SME uses ICT in their business. A way to improve environmental sustainability with ICT is through telecommunication (telecom). <br/><br/>However, there is still no broadly adopted manner in which SMEs can use current telecom technologies to be less harmful to the environment. The telecom sector is in a position where it can enable its customers to become more sustainable and reduce scope 3 downstream emissions. Nevertheless, as the role of enabler is not yet optimally utilised by telecommunication companies (telcos), customers are not yet decreasing their emissions. Therefore, there is potential for KPN to guide SMEs with their sustainability expertise to transition them towards sustainability through using telecom. <br/><br/>SMEs face challenges when open to adopting sustainable telecom practices. The explorative research in this thesis has shown that six different topics influence whether an SME can or is willing to adopt a sustainable telecom practice. These topics are; the right means for an online way of working, collaborative effort, education of digital sustainability, management decisions for sustainability, office building restrictions and reducing physical presence. <br/>To enable SMEs to use their telecom more sustainably, telcos should keep these topics in mind while working towards solutions. Furthermore, elements that are valuable to SMEs to adopt sustainable telecom practices are knowledge, inspiration, community and guidance. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a platform is designed with which KPN can support SMEs by being the provider that connects telecom to sustainability by facilitating SME customers with inspiration, guidance and education on suited sustainable telecom practices while considering specific context challenges that SMEs face. With the platform, KPN educates its SME customers by communicating sustainability information to provide the customers with sufficient knowledge to start acting. As a result, the SME customers of KPN can be inspired to use telecom more sustainably. Furthermore, the platform includes a community of stakeholders connecting KPN to customers and customers to each other to exchange sustainability knowledge. The development of the platform allows KPN to become a partner in sustainable telecom use for SMEs.<br/><br/>To work towards the proposition of being a sustainability partner, KPN should prioritise sustainability in their organisation and introduce it in the SME market. To do so, KPN should educate and teach its employees about sustainable telecom practices KPN conducts. To incorporate sustainability at KPN, a new design principle is designed that communicates sustainability. The design principle summarises information about SME customer values for sustainability so it can be tested on customer journeys. With the new knowledge, the employees can prioritise sustainability more in their work, resulting in its implementation in customer journeys.<br","Sustainability; Sustainable telecom; SME; Design Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The integration of these two functions saves design space and allows for creative topologies. The literature study of this thesis investigated smart material actuator solutions that could be used to enable such active metamaterials, covering PVDF, dielectric elastomers, IPMC, conducting polymer, carbon nanotubes and piezoelectric ceramics. It is found that dielectric elastomers achieve high strains, low stress and need high driving voltages. Conducting polymers are able to deliver both high stress and high strain, but consume relatively much power. If power consumption is a priority, Electronic EAPs are preferred. PVDF does not excel on stress or strain, but is an overall good performer. The outlook of realizing active metamaterials via integration of actuation paves the way for non-rigid body deformations and broadens the view on potential applications. At the moment such a system cannot be realized due to the lack of appropriate designs and manufacturing methods. The objectives of this report are (1) the employment of smart materials to make metamaterials active, (2) proposing a method of how to realize this using production materials and (3) employing these methods to build a small metamaterial demonstrator that functions both as the actuator and the structure. In this work this was done by designing and constructing a tube shaped metamaterial demonstrator of a high precision positioning system. The 3D geometry of the metamaterial was built by layering planar pre-fabricated structures which use smart material for actuation. The design of the unit cells can be implemented in metamaterial of any shape and allows for miniaturization, which extends its applicability. The metamaterial was capable of vertical displacements. The constructed metamaterial tube was able to bend itself. Measured maximum amplitudes of a single layer, and the three layered stack were respectively 4.60 μm and 6.91 μm. Roll movement of the top layer of the stack was achieved with a lowest point of -0.13 μm and a highest point of 8.49 μm. The system showed that smart materials are a suitable choice to make metamaterial active, and that active metamaterial could be produced using production material.

Therefore, this research explored the relationships of Generalized Anxiety Disorders, Depression, Natural Language and Personality Traits among Chinese university students. <br/>To reach the objective of the present research, an online survey was conducted among Chinese university students, which consists of GAD-7, PHQ-8, BIS/BAS, and PANAS questionnaires, followed by a writing task to describe their feelings about university life and one anxious moment happened in the university. Finally, demographics were assessed. All the sample data were exported into .csv format and imported into the software JASP (JASP, 2017). And the text of the writing task was uploaded on LIWC 2022 software (LIWC, 2022) package, and on the statistical software SPSS for additional analyses. <br/>Through the experiment, the main Research Question and Sub-Research Questions were answered and all hypotheses were accepted. By reflecting on the whole thesis, some limitations of the current research were pointed out and some suggestions were proposed for future work.","Generalized Anxiety Disorders; Depression; Personality traits; Natural language","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Electrification by means of renewable energy sources in electricity production (RES-E) is a key strategy to meet global climate goals established in the Paris Agreement. The increasing share of RES-E as a result of this has significant implications on the functioning of the electricity system and the adequacy of the electricity market design, as these technologies exhibit different characteristics compared to conventional generators. Their intermittent output combined with near negligible marginal costs has an effect on electricity price formation and will lead to an increased demand for flexibility services to level out these fluctuations. These trends will induce an increased investment risk for flexible generation capacity. This increased investment risk feeds into the risk-averse behaviour of investors that is already present due to market failures that exist in electricity markets. It remains unclear whether the liberalised neoclassical electricity market design provides sufficient incentives to invest in generation capacity in order to maintain system adequacy during the energy transition.<br/>One possible market design option that is proposed to address this increased investment risk are Capacity Mechanisms. Capacity Mechanisms allow for an adequate remuneration of (flexible) generation capacity, by providing a steady income stream to firm capacity on top of revenues obtained from selling electricity. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness of a capacity market - a specification of a capacity mechanism - in maintaining system adequacy in a system with an increasing share of RES-E. Additionally, it aims to fulfil the need for electricity system models that allow for performing robustness analysis as this it is seen as increasingly important to adequately account for uncertainty that is inherently related to the unfolding of the energy transition. This research was carried out by extending an existing quantitative model of the Dutch electricity system, referred to as Myopic Optimisation Detailed Operational (or MODO), with a capacity market. The methodology applied relies on myopic optimisation. <br/>Conceptualisation of the capacity market model is based largely on the design of the NYISO Installed Capacity Market (NYISO-ICAP), as this design is relatively simple whilst being considered a successful capacity market. A thorough literature review on the NYISO-ICAP was performed to establish a profound understanding of real-world capacity market dynamics and how these can be translated to the model. The conceptualisation of the capacity market forms a basis for formalisation and is used to establish the formal rules of the capacity market model complying with the basic structure of linear programming problems. This serves as input for the implementation of the extension of the capacity market in MODO, and thus in Linny-R. <br/>With the resulting model, the effectiveness of a capacity market in maintaining system adequacy was assessed on the performance of several Key Performance Indicators. These encompass the Supply Ratio, the average annual volume of Energy-not-Served [MWh], the average Electricity Price [€/MWh] and the total Consumer Spending [€]. A comparative analysis was performed between the performance of the energy-only market and the capacity market on the identified Key Performance Indicators in four pre-specified scenarios. The four scenarios are varied on key uncertainties underlying the unfolding of the energy transition to explore the robustness of results, such as weather conditions and the level of risk aversion of investors. <br/>From this thesis, it can be concluded that a capacity market can be an effective and robust policy instrument to maintain system adequacy during the energy transition at a lower cost to consumers. This can specifically be seen in the increased number of investments in peaking generators compared to the energy-only market when forecasted revenues of the capacity market are sufficient, which has a positive effect on the electricity system's robustness to different weather conditions. Furthermore, when the level of a risk aversion of investors is high, a capacity market is more robust in ensuring system adequacy compared to an energy-only market. <br/>Nonetheless, a capacity market can be prone to investment cycles which can have a negative influence on the effectiveness of a capacity market to maintain system adequacy at all times. These investment cycles are a result of the bounded rationality and myopia experienced by investors, ultimately leading to imperfect forecasting of the revenues of the capacity market. Results of this thesis have shown that in busts of investment cycles, investments in generation capacity can be insufficient to maintain system adequacy. <br/>To conclude, a capacity market can be a viable option in order to maintain system adequacy in the energy transition. However, whether it is the most suitable option to maintain system adequacy is not clear. Novel flexibility options such as storage could potentially serve a significant role in maintaining system adequacy. If additional flexibility options have a lower perceived investment risk compared to flexible generation units, the electricity market can potentially continue to rely on its initial liberalised neoclassical market design whilst maintaining system adequacy. This requires further exploration in future research.<br/>Furthermore, MODO and its capacity market extension fill the need for electricity system models that allow for performing robustness analysis, as it has a relatively low computation burden. Hence, an interesting avenue for future research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a capacity market in many possible futures.","Capacity Mechanism; System adequacy; Myopic Optimisation; Power System Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Especially in the building sector they can have huge benefits over conventional (grey) solution as this sector uses a lot of resources and energy. The benefits that nature-based solutions can offer range from air purification to carbon sequestration to insulation. Even though nature-based solutions are known to have these benefits, large scale diffusion of nature-based solutions has not yet happened. The EU states that in “order for NbS to be implemented effective new business and partnership models should be created”. To foster the creation of these business models an appropriate business model framework is necessary. However, this framework was not yet existing. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to create a novel sustainable business model framework for nature-based solutions in the Dutch building sector. The novel framework was created through performing first literature research followed by a creation phase. This led to a preliminary framework which was then improved with the use of a focus group consisting of 7 experts from the Dutch building sector, who are currently working with, or involved with, nature-based solutions. With valuable insights and tips from the focus group the framework was then improved. This led to a framework consisting of a business model canvas supported by a few sections providing extra information. These extra sections help the user to fill in the business model canvas. On top of the improvements the focus group meeting also gave insights in how, and by who, the framework should be used. It became clear that the framework should primarily be used for creating an overview of an organisation, rather than for ideation. The framework should be used by organisations working with nature-based solutions and especially organisations who care about their impact and their ‘raison d’être’. The framework is a big improvement compared to the alternatives mainly because it is compact, but also comprehensive. It offers the user a way to perform a thoroughly impact assessment and the canvas includes many aspects/elements which are of high importance for implementing nature-based solutions.","Nature-based Solutions; Business Model Framework; Business Model Canvas; Nature-inclusive; focus group; Building sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

It is widely accepted that irrespective of the emission reductions efforts, adaptation to the already committed climate change is a must in the coming decades. Flooding is one of the most devastating climate-induced hazards, calling for adaptation across scales: from government-led adaptation (e.g. dikes), to personal household-led adaptation. There are numerous private adaptation measures, both structural and non-structural, that households can autonomously take to reduce damages and speed up own recovery, in case of the adverse event does occur. Worldwide household surveys provide the empirical evidence suggesting that the appraisal of fear, perceptions of own coping abilities and social influences affect individual decision to adapt. Especially the latter appear as a strong determinant of household-led adaptation. Yet, the role of social networks has not been studied systematically, let alone the exploration of the interplay between private households' adaptation and public policies in the presence of social influences. To increase the understanding of social networks' impact on private flood adaptation under various public policies, an empirical agent-based model is built. In addition to empirical flood maps, I employ Protection Motivation Theory and households' survey data from Houston (Texas, USA) to capture the household’s adaptation decisions, which are subject to social influence. To represent a range of social networks, I explore the effect of three random networks - Erdös-Renyi random network, Barabasi-Albert scale-free network, Watts-Strogatz small-world network -- on the diffusion of flood preparedness. These three networks could serve as a proxy of diverse types of social relationships that vary across cultures, with some being hierarchical and others egalitarian. Furthermore, I test how the diffusion of private adaptation among households evolves under four generic public policy strategies: protection by publicly-funded infrastructure, market-based policy such as subsidy, information policy and regulatory policy.<br/>The thesis findings reveal that the type of social networks influence success of private adaptation decisions significantly. Notably, the effect of social norms depends on the network configuration, where more homogeneous networks lead to higher private adaptation uptake. Furthermore, the thesis quantifies the interaction effects between social networks and policies designed to support private climate change adaptation, for example communication campaigns affecting individual risk perceptions that in turn drive household-led adaptation. Therefore, information policies can be very effective in steering public opinions and, hence, the uptake of households' adaptation measures. Moreover, I find that in the presence of social networks, public adaptation policies interact with each other: a combination of subsidies with communication exhibit synergistic effects on the flood damage reduction from private adaptation. Policies that do not interact with households' perceptions, like infrastructure projects or laws, can be considered more robust - less sensitive to social networks. To conclude, networks can shape the success of climate change adaptation policies and should be accounted for in their design. Further research should focus on the endogenous evolution of social networks and the model behavior under changing flooding conditions and what this complex adaptive system's dynamics means for future cross-scale adaptation efforts.","Climate Change Adaptation; Protection Motivation Theory; Social Networks; Policy; Social Influence; Private Flood Adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Currently, patients are all treated with the same number of anti-tumour treatments, although the required number to eradicate all tumour cells varies between patients. The goal is thus to have an individualised model based on an MRI before the start of therapy and an MRI after several rounds of therapy that predicts how many treatments are needed to eradicate all tumour cells. In the previous MSc thesis by N. Oudhof, a two-dimensional spatiotemporal mechanically coupled reaction-diffusion model was implemented. This was used to model the number of tumour cells in each position of the breast, where the mechanics are included to simulate the behaviour of the surrounding tissue. <br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to improve that model by improving the calibration in which the patient-specific parameters are optimised, by taking into account the treatment schedule of the patients and by extending the model to three dimensions. For calibration, the first and second MRI scans are used and a third MRI is used for validation. To simulate the chemotherapy, both the Kety-Tofts model and a Normalised Blood Volume Map are applied, of which the latter appeared the best option. In 2D, four models are implemented: the reaction-diffusion models with and without mechanics and with and without chemotherapy term. These were compared by analysing the predicted and measured tumour densities for a cohort of three HER2+ patients. For 3D, only the basic reaction-diffusion and chemotherapy-incorporated reaction-diffusion models are implemented. The models are compared in terms of mean squared error, global relative error and concordance correlation coefficient. For both 2D and 3D, the models without chemotherapy gave slightly better results in terms of these measures, although the differences between the models were rather small. To determine the required number of therapy rounds, it is however better to use the chemotherapy-incorporated models because they offer more possibilities to simulate different treatment strategies. The computation time of the 3D implementation should be reduced before the mechanics can be included, which will allow conclusions to be drawn on which model is most accurate. Other directions for future improvements include using the second MRI to calculate the chemotherapy concentrations after calibration, adding an immunotherapy term and increasing the number of patients.","Mathematical modelling; HER2+; Breast Cancer; Chemotherapy; MRI; Treatment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

(Michielsen, Wijk, Ketelaar 2010) Due to their bodily differences, they can feel stigmatized, which leads to stress, anxiety and lowered self esteem.

I employed positive design research to understand the sources of unmet or unvoiced needs, priorities and preferences children could have.

Quantum computers were theorized and are now being realized to extend computational abilities. Though commercially available and widely researched, quantum computers today are still more proof-of-concept than ”universally” applicable tools. A major part of the problem is these systems are riddled with noise, hence the phrase noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices is commonly used to refer to current day devices. There are many approaches to mitigating the effects of noise in quantum systems from both hardware and software perspectives. This work focuses on optimizing the device hardware by combining aspects of two already well-explored systems – superconducting quantum integrated circuits and topological insulators. <br/>The former are relatively easy to fabricate and have become one of the main focuses of today’s industry. The heart of superconducting quantum circuits is found in two circuit elements: the quantum bit (qubit) and the resonator. The qubit manages quantum information processing. The resonator is a simple inductor and capacitor (LC) in parallel and is a well understood classical circuit element. Resonators play a key role in this research. In contrast, topological quantum systems are incredibly difficult to fabricate. In theory, however, topological insulators promise a strong shield against noise across the device. By leveraging the simplicity and ease of simulating classical LC resonators and combining this with the noise-protection introduced in topological systems, this project lays the groundwork for developing a model supporting how such a hybrid hardware could process and protect quantum information. This thesis presents the characterization of how a two-dimensional array of LC resonators could behave similarly to a qubit when demonstrating edge modes, which are typically found in topological quantum systems.

Due to the high risk of explosions in urban environments it brings along, the blast analysis of buildings within in range of the explosions becomes more relevant.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a quick method to analyse the roof of a building subjected to blast load. This is done by first clarifying the blast load definition on a reinforced concrete (RC) structural element through existing design standards and literature. Next, the material behaviour of the concrete and the reinforcement steel is scrutinised by an extensive literature study. Materials behave differently under dynamic loads. The dynamic material properties are increased by the strength increase factor (SIF) and the dynamic increase factor (DIF).<br/><br/>In blast analysis, most energy is dissipated though plastic deformation. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately describe the nonlinear behaviour of RC elements. The nonlinear behaviour of RC elements is translated in the moment-curvature relationship. This relationship is calculated on cross-sectional level and serves as input for the global beam or slab model. The global structural behaviour of the beam or the slab is calculated using the finite difference method (FDM). The FDM model generates a force-deflection (F-u) relationship which can be used in the single degree of freedom (SDOF) mass-spring system. The SDOF mass-spring system is used in this research to predict the dynamic behaviour of RC elements.<br/><br/>The research method is validated by published experiments and finite element analysis. Three experiments are reported, where the following results are obtained:<br/>• Flexural stiffness may be assumed when the scaled distance is above 1.2 m/kg1/3. This is labelled as the ‘far field design range’.<br/>• When choosing the DIFs carefully, the dynamic behaviour of RC elements can be predicted well.<br/>• The FDM model can provide a good estimation of the nonlinear F-u relationship. The method of incorporating cracks in the FDM model is not previously presented in published literature.<br/>• The unloading stiffness requires additional care. This research briefly covers the unloading stiffness.<br/>• According to the UFC 3-340-02 (Department of Defence, US, 2008), RC elements without shear reinforcement and without the possibility of membrane action, fail at a support rotation of 2 degrees. This is where crushing is supposed to happen. This research shows that this is rather conservative and that the support rotation can go up to 6 degrees before failure.<br/><br/>Finally, the validated research method is applied on a case study. The case study contains a slab supported on two stiff beams on opposing sides. This results in a main span (weak direction) and a secondary span (stiff direction) due to the flexural stiffness of the supporting beams. In most cases, the slab supported by beams can be approached as a SDOF mass-spring system. After occurrence of cracks, the slab reinforcement in the main span direction will absorb most of the energy and is therefore the dominating member in the two degrees of freedom (2DOF) mass-spring system.","Structural Dynamics; blast load; blast wave; Mass-Spring System; concrete; Finite Difference Method (FDM); Finite Element Method; Nonlinear Analyses; Cracking; slab; plate; beam; impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","Annotation dynamics of structures",""

The ecosystem was explored by interviewing representatives of the most common stakeholder groups. This investigation identified stakeholders' opportunities and challenges in supporting entrepreneurship and sustainability.<br/>Then, hubs were interviewed to understand their current practices and needs. Finally, a model was developed to assess the impact of hub program activities based on behavior change theory. This model allowed hubs to understand their potential influence directly instead of estimating it based on startups' performance.<br/>This model was used within the design of a toolkit. The toolkit guides hubs to reflect on their activities and policies through a thee Ps sustainability lens. This process guides hubs to upgrade their current program and generate ideas for new activities to meet their sustainability goals. The toolkit also includes a pilot template to help hubs identify resources to test their impact ideas. For example, in testing, the use of the tool led to an upgraded environmental sustainability workshop for one hub. The new workshop will allow them to reach 3X more entrepreneurs annually.<br/>Hubs often struggle to find sufficient funding and resources for their current programs. The toolkit helps them to optimize their existing resources. Facilitated sessions also lead hubs to identify the new people and financial resources they may need to implement their new ideas. Using a sustainability lens helps ensure hubs make the impact they seek and entrepreneurs get the support they need, now and in the future.","incubator support; Entrepreneurial Ecosystem; Triple Bottom Line; sustainability; Sustainable development; Kenya; Rwanda","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The 1st Heinenoordtunnel is an immersed tube which has been open for service in the Netherlands since 1969. Over the past 50 years, a large and increasing settlement has been measured along the tunnel alignment. The greatest value of settlement (65 mm) occurs in tunnel element 1 from 1978 to 2018. The maximum differential settlement has reached 30 mm between element 1 and 2 which causes a potential threat to the tunnel serviceability. In addition, Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) was used to measure daily joint deformation of immersed tunnel. The result of DOFS has shown a periodic settlement under tide.<br/>The aim of this thesis is to investigate the long-term and daily settlement behavior of Heinenoordtunnel. The study starts with the geological information investigation, followed by settlement analysis using 2D Finite Element Modeling. Both long-term settlement and daily cyclic settlement are simulated and compared with the monitoring data.<br/>In long term settlement analysis, the results show that the consolidation settlement of tunnel element is trivial (&lt;0.5mm) over the 50 years operation. The calculated result does not match with the monitoring data under a constant load assumption over the operational period. Therefore, three additional factors are considered which can be the possible causes of the excessive settlement. Those factors are the growth of traffic volume, fluvial deposition on riverbed and secondary compaction on the foundation. The main results are summarized as follows:<br/>(1) The settlement due to extreme traffic growth is between 10 and 20 mm which increases gradually from 1979 to 2018.<br/>(2) The fluvial deposition causes an average settlement of 1.68 mm over the past 40 years of operation.<br/>(3) The secondary compaction result is in between 5.30 and 10.70 mm, while the exact value depends on the selection of creep parameter.<br/>(4) The combined settlement is in between 18.27 and 30.62 mm that is significantly less than the monitoring data.<br/>Based on the above findings, the combination of those three factors cannot provide a sound explanation on monitoring data. Hence, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted in the final stage of the research.<br/>In the daily settlement response simulation, a coupled flow simulation is applied on both traverse and longitudinal direction under tidal fluctuation. The summary of results is indicated as below:<br/>(1) A phase delay of excess pore water pressure occurs for soil under the low permeable layer. This causes periodic rebound and settlement on the tunnel element<br/>(2) The amplitude of tunnel cyclic settlement is in between 0.143 and 0.215 mm<br/>(3) The deformation of intermediate immersion joint is under 0.059 mm<br/>Since the difference between calculation and monitoring results is over 0.2 mm in joint 6, it is important to conduct sensitivity analysis on the Plaxis model.<br/>3<br/>To verify the importance of soil variability, the sensitivity analysis is conducted by reducing the stiffness parameter with two standard deviation value in long term settlement analysis and one standard deviation value in daily settlement analysis. The long-term settlement become twice as the initial value after the parameter adjustment. The difference between monitoring data and Finite Element result reduces by 30 to 192 percent of the original value. On the other hand, the daily settlement of tunnel reduces by 4 to 17 percent under the one standard deviation increment. The daily response of tunnel is closer to the monitoring data after parameter adjustment.<br/>In conclusion, the three factors considered in this research causes a significant change on the total settlement of immersed tunnel. The periodic response of tunnel settlement is verified from the coupled flow mode. Finally, some recommendations are made for future study.","PLAXIS 2D; Immersed Tunnel; Settlement Analysis; Distributed Optical Fiber Sensor; Geotechnical Engineering; Finite Element Modeling; Observational Method; Sensitivity Analysis; soil structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","1st Heinenoord Tunnel",""

In order to do this, we must make sure we truly understand the nature of how photons behave in accordance to each other and to our detectors.In quantum optics we can see that these photons have a very dubious character. They are both particle and wave and neither. This makes studying how they are distributed over the spectrum of the submillimeter and millimeter wave astronomy a very big challenge. We know that this very particlewave duality is what makes up the noise that is fundamental to photons. This duality also makes them obey the BoseEinstein statistics. Hence due to their particlelike behavior, we have a noise component that resembles that of a Poisson distribution. Very much like raindrops falling down from the sky. On the other hand we have the wave nature of the photons, this causes them to arrive in bunches rather than these random raindrops. It is observed that photons arriving at a detector are corrrelated.<br/>In this thesis we will be investigating how to incorporate the noise of the bunching of the photons into the model of TiEMPO. This model simulates the signal processing of a measurement done by the wideband spectrometer named DESHIMA. Due to the fact that DESHIMA operates in a wideband frequency range, we do theoretical research that explains the fundamental theory behind calculating the photon noise over this wideband range. We show that taking the wideband integral of the photon noise is mathematically equivalent of summing the narrowband approximation for infinitely many subbands and adding them up top each other. This approach is the previous method of calculating the photon noise over the wideband. Due to this method being valid, the question of how these variances over these smaller subbands can be additive?<br/>Since we are dealing with the detection of photons which as previously stated is a correlated signal. By modeling a simplified version of wideband photon detection, we have come to the conclusion that due to the small coherence time these photons are independent in the wideband signal. The photons in these smaller subbands of the wideband signal can also be viewed as statistically independent. If we decrease the frequency bandwidth, we increase the coherence time. Thus measuring the signal over this subband equates to having a larger uncertainty in time. Hence when a photon is detected in this subband, due to the large coherence time we have that the knowledge of when this photon arrived is mostly lost. Making the time correlations irrelevant to a measurement of an integration time this long.","Quantum optics; Terahertz; statistics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","DESHIMA",""

(mentor); van Kampen, E. (graduation committee); Schrama, Ernst (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","RLV development can be considered as the modern step towards mission design due to financial and strategic decisions. In the past, reusability has been addressed however the level of maturity of the technology, both in terms of hardware and software was not yet reached. There are several aspects to developing a RLV, and these can be categorized into optimization of the LV, optimization of the trajectory, and cost analysis. TO be able to determine the feasibility of the mission, it is not just necessary to develop a suitable configuration, but to also determine the physical feasibility of the trajectory. Several methods exist of which convex optimization is selected. This class of algorithms have risen in popularity in the regime of powered descent guidance, and present a desirable trade-off between performance and computational cost. An already existing algorithm, DESCENDO, for a two-staged vehicle CALLISTO purposed for a mission to a geo-synchronous orbit, is taken as reference. The algorithm is rewritten in YALMIP allowing it to perform more efficiently by saving computation time through creation of multiple controllers based on a discretized burn schedule. A potential candidate for reusability in the future is selected, which is a VEGA variant, considered as a two-staged vehicle with set requirements on the mission and configuration. Through closed-loop simulations, the feasibility of RTLS for a particular mission of this VEGA variant can be studied. The disciplines involved in the study include the launch vehicle optimization, engine sizing, preliminary ascent &amp; descent, and 3-DoF simulations. Previous research at TU Delft on RLV has included the work Rozenmeijer, Vandamme, Van Kesteren, Miranda, and Contant, graduate students of the TU Delft Aerospace Engineering faculty. The work relied on the usage of the TUDAT C++ software environment and based its feasibility or reusability of operations through a cost-analysis. A shift in direction is taken away from cost-analysis to examine at a greater detail the physical feasibility of the trajectory for a nominal candidate RLV. This is done by examining the influence of simulator to guidance algorithm dynamics and guidance algorithm parameters. Moreover, a nominal payload class between 100 and 500 kg is selected to determine the configuration of the vehicle ideal for this mission. To be able to determine feasibility of RTLS, three metrics are considered, which are the final landing velocity, final landing position, and maximumdynamic pressure. The study performs higher fidelity analysis only on the return phase, and as such the starting conditions for descent are determined through a preliminary design process by considering a drag-less ascent. This returns a starting altitude of around 26-30 km, with similar values for starting downrange position, and varying conditions of initial mass and velocity. For the preliminary descent, it is found that the metric of dynamic pressure does not reach more than around 60% of the limit imposed by the VEGA-C, which is similar for other VEGA variants. This coincides with research done with the CALLISTO vehicle. All in all, the best cases for these metrics and one included as an overall best case where candidates for the 400 kg payload class. The selection criteria for best cases of the preliminary descent involved the dynamic pressure, final velocity, and required propellant mass for descent. Moreover, the vehicle optimization results showed that this contained the most variation of vehicle characteristics, and as such it was deemed as a desirable class to work with for its flexibility in design. The best case burnt mass result was selected as the best case velocity required extensive propellant mass to burn for only a less than 7 m/s difference in result, which would not be indicative of what the convex algorithm could achieve due to dynamics involved in the preliminary experiment. This nominal candidate is then tested for various variations of controller tuning parameters combinations, burn schedules, and simulator/guidance frequencies. The results showed a clear desirable region for the final time of just between 300 and 310 seconds for return, favouring shorter burns. The solution envelope for the burn schedule showed gaps in zones of feasibility as well as optimality, suggesting some performance issues with the algorithm due to it failing to find solutions. Nevertheless this envelope is well defined and several feasible solutions existed. The influence of parameter tuning and simulator frequency was studied. It was determined that no set of guidance parameters could give an advantage over the other, but that some values did favour feasibility more. This is somewhat in contrast to the selection of frequencies, as despite the fact there was also a large difference for higher frequency ratios between the Q3 to Q4 and Q0 to Q2, there is a noticeably trend that higher ratios are favoured. Moreover, a local optimal ratio of frequency of 10-1 was also found, and being the same ratio used for the other experiments as well as the CALLISTO study, provides more evidence that this effect is intended. The uncertainties studied are for the initial state variations, errors in reading of position and velocities, and process time delays. It was noted that almost all the errors in the initial state variations shared similar distributions for ranges of values of the metrics. The overall majority returned feasible as well as the large minority of this returned optimal. Of little to no significance was the processing time delay, of which the overwhelming majority returned optimal results, and the rest where outliers whose process time factor where beyond the 3σ limit imposed in the creation of normal random variables. The largest errors arose from the real-time uncertainty in the velocities and position, modelled after pseudo-range errors. Although results showed a high density in the feasible and optimal regions for metrics of final time and position, there was also a high density past the feasible regions. It can be considered that the feasibility of RTLS operations for such a VEGA vehicle is restricted by such errors as expected, but nevertheless results are promising in what can be the main steps to lead to an error analysis study by the use of state estimation techniques and testing various modifications made to the SOCP problem to improve performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Based on eight in-depth interviews and a six-month embedding, a new co-designed venturing architecture is introduced (Figure 1). The proposed architecture guides innovation teams and executives at Philips DA to build the capabilities and processes for venturing into new territories of consumer value. Additionally, the new architecture reflects the newly established vision of the New Business Creation &amp; Scaling (NBX) team and integrates a new ‘value shaping’ perspective, based on original research findings. <br/><br/>As Philips Domestic Appliances was disconnected from Royal Philips in 2021, the need for new ‘ventures’ emerged in order to remain a leading innovator in the domestic appliances industry. The key questions are what new business opportunities to pursue and how to increase success in bringing meaningful innovation, fostering a forward-looking culture, and facilitating the development of new skills &amp; capabilities. Eight in-depth interviews shed light on the current new business development practice at Philips DA. Four baseline results that highlight areas for further analysis were identified: ‘daring culture’, ‘consumer value’, ‘future visioning’, and ‘design strategy.’ <br/><br/>Based on these baseline results, an inductive analysis yielded three themes: ‘Using design to unlock new value spaces’ (I), ‘Insight-driven value shaping’ (II), and ‘Visions that embrace risk’ (III). These themes orient venturing as a design-driven endeavor, in which consumer value is not only anticipated but actively shaped. Through co-design, the concept of insight-driven value shaping was developed into a new framework. The framework visualizes how the interface between an insight-driven perspective (e.g. trends, consumer needs), and a value shaping perspective (e.g. visions, value spaces) supports the client to identify new ‘seed’ opportunities. <br/><br/>This thesis adopts a design-driven venturing perspective and positions design-driven venturing as a subdomain of new business development. In discussing how NBX can pursue its vision of becoming an industry-leading venturing arm, the distinction between inbound change (how the environment changes Philips DA) and outbound change (how Philips DA can change its environment) clarifies how change affects NBX. The new architecture allows NBX to continuously adapt its practice and re-align capabilities and processes to cater to changing contexts of new business development, both inbound and outbound.","Design-driven venturing; Strategic design; Venturing architecture; New business development; Value shaping; Consumer value; Meaningful innovation; Philips Domestic Appliances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Furthermore, the development of auxetic metamaterials has led to applications in fields ranging from biomedical to civil engineering. However, cellular lattices suffer from the development of localized concentrations of strains during deformation, which lead to sub-optimal mechanical performance. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of cellular lattices are dependent on their macro-scale geometries, limiting their design space. Thus, we seek to both enhance the mechanical properties of lattices by ameliorating strain concentrations and expand the design space of cellular lattices.<br/><br/>In attempting to do so, we can turn to nature. The bio-inspired design motif of the hierarchical arrangement of composite materials has lead to exceptional mechanical characteristics in natural materials. Moreover, morphogenetic processes such as bone remodelling play a vital role in the structural development of natural materials and their hierarchical material arrangement. Motivated by these concepts, we developed an algorithm that optimised the hierarchical material arrangement of hard and soft voxels in an auxetic and non-auxetic unit cell. Our algorithm does so based on a bone remodelling-like approach of strain energy optimisation, whereby elements are transitioned to a hard or soft material based on local strain energy.<br/><br/>Our finite element (FE) simulation results demonstrate the considerable expansion of the range of mechanical properties we can achieve simply by modifying material placement on a micron scale. We also observe clear mitigation of peak strain energies and more homogeneous distributions of strain energy density, which affirm the amelioration of strain concentrations. Furthermore, we were able to increase the stiffnesses of our unit cells without substantially affecting its Poisson’s ratio, disentangling previously interdependent mechanical properties. We further validated our FE simulations by additively manufacturing our optimised unit cells with state-of-the-art voxel-based printing. Both the mechanical properties predicted by our FE simulations and the strain distributions correlated well with digital image correlation recordings, validating our models. Our mechanical testing also revealed the considerable in- creases in ultimate tensile strength of our optimised designs, demonstrating the benefits of hierarchical material arrangement.<br/><br/>To conclude, we demonstrate the efficacy of strain energy-based material optimisation to improve the mechanical properties of unit cells and mitigate strain concentrations. The design paradigms of hierarchical arrangement of composite materials remarkably improved the material space of a unit cell without changing its macro-scale geometry. Findings from this study could enable the optimisation of existing cellular lattices and the development of novel unit cell designs with distinct intrinsic mechanical properties.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-30","","","","","",""

Therefore, a comprehensive comparison among various com-pensation topologies under rated operating condition is necessary for the selection of compensation topology for WPT. In this thesis, eight compensation topologies are selected for benchmark and com-pared in terms of efficiency, component voltage/current stress, design freedom, misalignment be-haviour, etc. under the rated operating condition set based on SAE J2954 [1] standard. Given the analytical comparison results, the S-S compensation and LCC-S compensation are selected for further analysis and experimental verification.<br/>In the practical design process of the compensation, the voltage/current stress on each compo-nent and the implementation of zero voltage switching (ZVS) on switches are two critical issues to be considered. For the calculation of components’ peak voltage/current, the fundamental-frequency analysis is the most widely used calculation method, which is inaccurate in some inductors’ voltage peak calculation. Therefore, a new resonant inductor voltage peak calculation method is proposed in this thesis, which is proved to be more accurate in both simulation and experiments in S-S and LCC-S compensations. For the implementation of ZVS, few studies have given the calculation method of switching current due to its complexity. In this thesis, a new switching current calculation method for LCC-S compensation is proposed and compared with the existing calculation method. A tuning method for ZVS implementation based on this calculation method is also proposed. Results from simulation and experiments under various operating conditions are provided to verify the accuracy of the newly proposed switching current calculation method. In the experiments, the LCC-S compensation and S-S compensation are compared under different power and input voltages.

However, next to its advantages, there are many challenges that still have to be tackled. One of the main ones is the mismatch between residents’ expectations and systems’ functioning. This report analyses the specific case of a demo-apartment in Reigersbos, Amsterdam and applies an Inclusive design perspective with a focus on visually impaired residents. The main goal is to develop a solution that will decrease the gap between residents and systems. Through literature research, user interviews and field research of the demo apartment, the challenges of the case are defined from a human-centred design perspective. Then, the accessibility limitations are identified on the basis of the conducted accessibility research. Different Inclusive design tools and suitable approaches for designing together with visually impaired users are described. As a result, three design interventions are proposed. The first one is targeting the stakeholders, responsible for choosing the systems and products in a renovation. It is a Booklet that provides specific guidelines and recommendations for the decision-makers to follow. Its aim is to help them improve the outcomes of a renovation. While this tool still has to be evaluated in the projected use scenario, according to interviews with experts, it is a much needed product. The other two proposals are concepts called ‘Tactimap’ and ‘Breathing Walls’ which embody the main user needs identified during the research phase. Their target group are the end users, namely visually impaired and the wider public. The evaluation confirmed that the ‘Breathing Walls’ concept has promising potential for future development. ‘Tactimap’ on the other hand turned out to be less prospective at this moment. The exploration of the three concepts contributes knowledge to the field of zero-energy renovations and Inclusive design. In addition, the recommendations from the booklet can be applied immediately in the renovation of Reigersbos so that it becomes better fitting to users’ needs.","Inclusive Desing; Zero-energy renovation; Accessibility; visually impaired people; Design tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Nederlof, Martin (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The wastewater system in the Netherlands is ageing, which increases the probability of failure of the systems as time progresses. A vital failure mechanism is leakages, which occur in leaky connections, joints, or at cracks and holes along the pipe. Eventually, leakages result in infiltration of groundwater into the sewer pipe or exfiltration of sewage into the groundwater system, depending on the location, condition, and system type of the sewer. When the sewer pipe is located below the groundwater table, infiltration of groundwater will occur, and when the sewer pipe is located above the groundwater table, exfiltration of wastewater will most likely occur. Both can have severe consequences for the sewer system, e.g. collapsing pipes, reduction of the groundwater quality, silting up the sewer, and high hydraulic influent load. To prevent these failures, maintenance of the urban drainage system is essential, also referred to as ‘asset management’. It is crucial to find out whether there is a leak in the sewer pipe, where the infiltration or exfiltration occurs, and what the amount of leakage is. <br/><br/>There are different methods to detect leaks, such as camera inspection, pressure tests, and distributed temperature sensing. However, these different techniques each have their specific limitations. The Focussed Electro Leak Location (FELL) system, which is the main focus of this report, has been developed to detect and locate leakages by using electric voltage between an electrode in a sewer pipe and an electrode in the surrounding ground. The electrode in the sewer pipe, also called the probe, consists of three parts. The outer electrodes serve as a guard and also to send electric voltages, like the middle electrode, but they are mainly there to block the area behind it so the signal does not escape. This probe is pulled through the sewer. As soon as an increase in current is visible, this means that the resistance in the sewer pipe wall decreases, and there is a risk of leakage. There is some noise in the signal, but generally, when there is a leak, a more prominent peak in current is present. This peak can say something about the length of the leak, it could say something about the size of the leak, and perhaps it could say something about the leakage rate. There are doubts about whether the last is possible. <br/><br/>Explorative experiments with a PVC pipe above the surface, under ideal conditions, have shown that a clear signal can be obtained caused by leaking water using the FELL prototype 2.0 equipment at hand. The results show that the settings of the FELL prototype 2.0 have a major impact on signal size and noise. However, based on the performed field experiments with a concrete pipe below the surface, it can be concluded that also passing trains, moisture of the soil surrounding the grounding pin, and the position of the FELL prototype 2.0 in the sewer pipe have a strong influence on the resulting leak detection signal of the FELL prototype 2.0. The signal-to-noise ratio was ~1. Environmental factors influence the results in such a way, to an order of magnitude of even greater than 0.1 mA, that it is impossible to see where and whether there is a leakage in the concrete sewer pipe below the surface. To make the signal visible in practice, the FELL prototype 2.0 has to be redesigned, so that environmental influences have limited and known influences on the overall measurements. Also, the vertical movement of the FELL prototype 2.0 during the pulling of the system through the concrete sewer pipe has to be avoided as much as possible, as any change in the measuring geometry clearly affects the obtained signal. This research showed that the FELL prototype 2.0 should best be positioned precisely in the centre of the pipe. In short, the measurement principle theoretically sounds promising under ideal conditions, but the technical implementation of the FELL prototype 2.0 is very fragile, as shown in this study. Theoretically, it is possible to detect leakages, but in a practical sense, many improvements still need to be made to make the implementation robust. It can be confirmed that the performance of the FELL prototype 2.0 was not sufficient yet to tell if this device is able to detect, locate and quantify leaks under simulated field conditions. Both the design and practical condition first need to be optimised.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

We propose a stochastic parameterization in which clouds are represented by a Markov-Chain (MC) lattice model. The state of each lattice site is characterized by cloud top height (CTH) and cloud optical depth (COD). Based on these two parameters, clouds can be categorized into different cloud types (cumulus, stratus, cirrus, deep convection, etc.). In contrast to previous work, where the transition probabilities between different cloud types were calculated, we determine the transition probability densities in the continuous CTH-COD domain. We moreover explore the influence of neighbouring lattice sites on these transition densities to research whether it is possible to simulate cloud organization structures, without the use of extra external large scale variables or forcings. We estimate the parameters of the distributions using GOES-16 satellite images. Using these estimates, we perform simulations of the continuous state space Markov Chain over the lattice. This results in 2D spatial cloud evolutions, which spatial organization we compare to the original images.<br/>The simulations did not show any spatial structures as were observed in the original images. All the simulations resulted in a granulated image of different cloud types after only a couple of hours. <br/>A simulation from the MC model describing transitions from a finite number of cloud types converges to the observed occurrence frequencies, which is property of a MC. When describing the MC in a continuous state space the simulations still converged to the observed cloud state frequencies. However, introducing spatial dependence this property was not a given anymore.<br/>Since we were unable to reproduce the organizational structure from previous work using the GOES-16 satellite images, we cannot conclude whether it is possible to simulate cloud organization using the MC lattice model. A better understanding of these type of models was achieved. Neighbouring sides could diverge too fast in the performed models. We believe adding a stronger coupling between the cloud state evolution of neighbouring cells can improve the spatial models. Therefore one method to simulate correlated variables was tried to implement on the CTH evolution. This showed promising early results for further research. Also a better correction for horizontal advection on the original images could be performed to observe a specific cloud over time, which could improve the observed data quality.","Markov Chain; Cloud Organization; Time-Space modelling; Continuous state space MC; Spatial dependence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The formation could be created with a hole in the middle which simulated a borehole. Next, by filling and pressurising this hole with a bentonite-water suspension, a stable borehole could be simulated. This borehole was then filled with drillgrout to recreate a tunnel filled with grout. This grout column could then be pulled out of the soil formation so that the friction between the drillgrout and soil could be measured. In this setup, no normal forces were present. Due to the absence of normal forces no friction angle could be deducted which made it impossible to estimate the effect of the friction at the depth where a pipe laid by HDD would generally be found. It was concluded that based on the data found, it is not recommended to use grout as a borehole filling around heat transportation pipes. Although the friction would be mainly determined by the filter cake strength, which is comparable to a weak clay, effects like irregular borehole diameters and large soil stresses at the depth of the pipe, would create a frictional force that is large enough to cause buckling or failure of the insulating PUR layer.","HDD; Friction; Soil; Drillgrout; Drilling; Pipe; Bentonite; DPIA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The demand for lowering the emissions of the maritime industry creates the need for insight in the emissions. Currently a generic method to specify emissions in space and time, as a function of vessel and waterway properties is not available.<br/>Although most of the emissions of vessels take place at sea, the most noticeable part takes place in ports since they are located close to urbanized areas. Therefore, this research focuses specifically on emissions in ports. The study investigates the impact of sea-going vessels. By gaining insight in the emissions of sea-going vessels, the big polluters can be tackled. Due to the scope of the research, not all vessel types and emission types are taken into account. Ten vessel types are selected and only CO2, NOx, SOx and PM10 emissions are estimated. These are the most relevant polluters in the shipping industry since they cause health and environmental related issues, both locally as more widely.<br/>To provide insight in the emissions, the objective of this study is to develop a generalized method to calculate and map the emission of a single vessel in space and time in ports based on reliable data. To reduce these emissions, emission reduction strategies have to be drawn up, targeting the largest emission sources and the most crucial locations. Therefore, the developed method must not only quantify the emission sources, but must also provide insight in emission patterns in ports and indicate emission hotspots.<br/>A bottom-up method is developed to estimate the emission of a single vessel in space and time. To derive the emission rate of a vessel, the fuel and energy consumption of the vessel is multiplied by a vessel-specific emission factor. The CO2 and SOx emissions follow a fuel-based approach, in which the emissions produced are directly proportional to the fuel consumption and therefore depend on the engine load. The energy-based approach is used for estimating NOx and PM10 emissions, which cannot be directly related to the fuel consumption but depend on engine characteristics. The fuel consumption is determined by multiplying the energy consumption of the engine with a fuel consumption factor specific to each vessel, meaning the fuel consumption is related to the energy consumption.<br/>The amount of energy the main engines of a vessel consume, is the energy needed to overcome the resistance a ship experiences from sailing through the water and is therefore related to the vessel's speed. This speed is derived from AIS data. AIS data represents real-life vessel tracking data and is gathered automatically, which makes it a reliable and realistic data source. It also provides the ability to make the emission estimations time dependent. Due to the global coverage, AIS data is a good data source to develop a generic method applicable to ports all around the world.<br/><br/>However, in ports the vessel's speed alone is not a good indicator of the energy consumption, since this neglects the amount of energy the auxiliary engines consume. Their energy consumption is dependent on how much energy the electrical systems of a vessel require at that moment, which can be high when a vessel is for example at berth or manoeuvring. The energy consumption is therefore related to the operations a vessel performs. This leads to an approach which takes into account the vessel's resistance and operational modes.<br/>Four operational modes are important to distinguish in ports: 'sailing', 'manoeuvring', 'anchoring' and 'berthing'. According to the operational mode, the main engine power is either estimated with the resistance calculation from Holtrop and Mennen when the vessel is sailing or manoeuvring, or assumed zero when laying still at anchor or berth. According to the operational mode, the auxiliary engine power can be derived from values of the IMO fourth GHG research. Depending on the emission type and vessel characteristics, the emission factor is determined.<br/>The algorithm to determine the emission of a single vessel in space and time is implemented in a model. The model's input consists of AIS data providing the speed and position of the vessel, a vessel database containing vessel characteristics based on information from the Sea-web Ships database, and a FISgraph of the port network. This graph contains the fairway characteristics needed to calculate the resistance. The calculated emissions will also be displayed on the FIS graph for a detailed insight in the emission distribution in space.<br/>The model provides an insight in the emissions patterns in a port. The fairway sections which are subjected to high emissions can be identified immediately and so the emission hotspots are determined. The source of the emissions can be identified by down-drilling of the emissions. The model can drill down to vessel types, operational modes and all the way down to a single vessel in space and time. <br/>The model is illustrated by means of two case studies concerning the Port of Rotterdam and the Port of Constanța. These case studies indicate that the port basins hosting the largest vessels have the highest estimated emissions. These basins are indicated as an emission hotspot by the model when the emissions are projected on the FIS graph. In ports generally, high emissions are observed at places with a high traffic intensity, such as the port entrance. Junctions of fairway sections or port basin entrances also show locally higher emissions. The rise in emissions, is probably due to the fact that vessels are slowing down when approaching a junction. This increases the emission rate of a vessel due to more inefficient engine use, but also since they spend a larger amount of time at this fairway section. <br/>By indicating the location and source of the emission hotspots, targeted emission reduction measures can be taken. Three of these measures are demonstrated on one of the case studies. The first strategy concerns installing shore power. The model is able to simulate vessels connected to shore power, by setting their emission rate at berth to zero. This simulation is compared to the original situation without using shore power. Out of the evaluated reduction measures, this seems the best strategy to reduce emissions since it shows the largest reduction of the total emissions. Besides that, it is an effective measure especially for ports, since the largest emissions reduction takes place at berth. The second evaluated strategy shows also good results and is about switching from a normal tugboat fleet to a zero-emission tugboat fleet. The model simulates this switch by eliminating all the tugboats from the fleet since their emissions will be zero. This new case is compared to the original situation with normal tugboats. The third option to reduce emissions is applying ECA limits which do not seem to have a lot of effect on reducing emissions except for the SOx emissions. This is derived from comparing the original situation without ECA limits, to a new case study where a situation with ECA limits is simulated. This means that the fuel types of the vessels are changed from the most economical fuel type to the lightest fuel type on board and that the sulphur content in the fuel is altered.<br/>However, the model has some limitations. The method does not take into account the effect of currents or variations in time of the water depth. The accuracy of the resistance calculation can be improved by adding these. Furthermore, the emission pattern of tugboats needs further examination as it could not be demonstrated that the split of emissions into operational modes is correctly. The research has also shown that the method to estimate the energy consumption is not suitable for tankers at berth, since their energy consumption pattern is different. The quantity of emissions in the case study of the Port of Rotterdam is far from the expected amount of emissions. The quantification of emissions is assumed to be unreliable and further research should focus on validating these results.<br/>Concluding, the developed model makes use of AIS data, local waterway properties, empirical emission factors and operational modes. This data is used in a physics-based method to estimate the resistance and the energy consumption. If this information is available, all this combined makes the approach in principle applicable to any port. The developed model provides an insight in the emission distribution patterns and provides the ability for down-drilling to find the source of the emission hotspots. A targeted emission reduction strategy can be proposed as a result of this and the model has the ability to evaluate specific emission reduction strategies. The strategies can be simulated with the developed model and the effect of these measures can be quantified by comparing the emission reduction strategy to a situation without these measures.","AIS data; Emission reduction; Emissions; Shipping; Ports","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

We use a genetic search algorithm that looks for these robustness problems. The main question this thesis tries to answer is to what extent the performance metrics are affected by applying metamorphic transformations to the test set of a trained code2vec model. Besides this, this thesis also proposes an alternative metric called percentage MRR, which might better reflect the robustness of a model. The main idea behind this metric is that it penalizes the prediction certainty of a model instead of penalizing the prediction rank.<br/>To answer this research question, a tool is created that runs a genetic algorithm applying these metamorphic transformations to a dataset that a trained model is then evaluating. With this tool, we conducted 22 genetic search experiments on primary metrics and combinations of metrics to see the trade-offs in the Pareto fronts. The guided search of applying metamorphic transformations on the test set results in an average performance decrease of around 19%. This thesis also compares this drop in performance to the performance decrease a random search algorithm would create. Notably, for every transformer added, the average decrease in performance becomes smaller, and there are transformations, e.g., the if-false-else transformation, that have a bigger effect than others. This thesis concludes that the trained model is not robust against metamorphic transformations and has a significant performance drop.","Genetic algorithm; Machine learning; Metamorphic testing; Metamoprhic transformations; Neural network; Genetic search; Robustness; Evaluation framework; software engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This can be done by substituting the use of fossil, CO2-heavy by the use of renewable, CO2-neutral energy carriers. Hydrogen is such a renewable energy carrier that can be produced in a CO2-neutral way. The potential of hydrogen is recognized by the European Commission as specific renewable hydrogen goals are stated in their Fit for 55 package, which is a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the European Union with 55% by 2030. These goals relate to both the production and use of renewable hydrogen within the European Union.  For hydrogen to be qualified as renewable, the European Commission has proposed a set of requirements that its production has to comply with. One of them is temporal correlation, requiring the amount of energy used by a hydrogen production plant to match the amount of energy generated by one or more connected renewable energy plants. Renewable energy plants generate a variable output of energy as they rely on variable energy sources such as wind. This causes the production of renewable hydrogen to be variable as well. The fact that this production of hydrogen is variable can be problematic as some industrial processes require or perform better with a constant input of hydrogen. Energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries, can be integrated in hydrogen plants to stabilize the hydrogen production from a renewable energy source. This works through locally storing part of the energy generated during peaks to be used at times when there is a deficit of energy. The purpose of this study is to see how different energy storage systems influence the performance of wind-hydrogen plants. A wind-hydrogen plant is a hydrogen plant producing hydrogen with an electrolyzer powered with energy from a wind park. Based on the outcomes of the study, wind-hydrogen plants can be designed incorporating the most adequate energy storage system for its purpose. The outcomes of the study can also be used by policy-makers to see how the temporal correlation requirement of the European Commission influences the feasibility of the hydrogen goals in the Fit for 55 package. The performance of wind-hydrogen plants with different energy storage methods is evaluated using a simulation model. After performing experiments for wind-hydrogen plants with different types of energy storage systems, their influence on the performance of the wind-hydrogen plant can be analyzed.  Results show that the hydrogen production from a variable energy source is lower and less stable than that from a continuous source. These effects can be mitigated with the use of energy storage systems. However, the introduction of these systems makes wind-hydrogen plants less efficient and drive up the costs of hydrogen production. This illustrates a trade-off as energy storage systems do increase and stabilize hydrogen production, but at a lower efficiency and higher cost.  Comparing the performance of individual energy storage systems shows that the use of lithiumion batteries to store energy results in the highest and most stable hydrogen. At the same time, the use of lithium-ion batteries is by far the most expensive option. The use of a hydrogen energy storage system results in the most efficient and cheapest hydrogen production. This shows that another trade-off is at play when selecting an energy storage system to integrate in a wind-hydrogen plant.<br/><br/>Based on the results, the effects of the temporal correlation requirement on the feasibility of the Fit for 55 renewable hydrogen goals can be analyzed. The requirement makes the hydrogen goals in the Fit for 55 package less feasible as it causes a decrease in renewable hydrogen production. It also makes it less fit for use by the industry as the hydrogen supply will become less stable. Energy storage systems can be used to mitigate these negative effects, however, these cause a decrease in hydrogen plant efficiency and therefore an increase in loss of renewable energy. Also, it drives up the production cost, making renewable hydrogen less attractive to use by industry and increasing barriers for new renewable hydrogen production to enter the market. The recommendation is for the European Commission to investigate an alternative requirement than the temporal correlation to ensure the renewable production of hydrogen.","Hydrogen production; Energy storage; Numerical simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

It sits on the western bank of the Spaarne river, along which runs one of the main traffic arteries of the city. To the north the plot is defined by the wide canal of the Nieuwe Gracht. The narrow Zakstraat runs along the southern side. Due to its current function, accessibility to the public is very limited and the courtyard is scarcely utilized. <br/><br/>Haarlems central library is struggling with overdue maintenance, poor energy efficiency, an outdated spatial layout and a lack of space to make major changes. Relocating to the Koudenhorn building provides the space to create the desired future-proof library. The building is large enough to house more than a library. In order to alleviate some pressure from the housing market, additional dwellings will be realized. They are connected to the library though programme and the courtyard, which offers spaces for appropriation by visitors and residents alike.<br/><br/>Concluding from case study research, buildings with a courtyard or central space can be defined using different typologies for the aspects of central space, spatial organization, entrances, routing and daylight. These typologies are the leading principles in understanding and redeveloping the Koudenhorn building.<br/><br/>The new central library is organized around four vertical access points. In between are the areas housing the library’s core programme, as well as additional public facilities such as the cafe and auditorium. The repetition of small compartments remaining from the use as a police station are maintained and used for closed stacks. Structurally, two important interventions are done to be able to carry the load of the library collection. Within the central space of the north wing, the interior load-bearing structure is replaced up to the second floor. This allows for the creation of vertical connections through voids and a landscape of stairs. A new load-bearing structure is added on top of the existing structure of small compartments in order to support the library floors above.<br/><br/>The new entrance to the library is situated in the original dining hall. A new entrance square will lead up to the level of the entrance hall. Bicycle and car parking are situated in the existing basement and ground floor structure of the building extension underneath. The square acts as a transitional space, extending the library’s sphere of influence and allowing for a more gradual approach to the building. <br/><br/>The design aims to create an accessible, inclusive library offering multiple different spatial experiences, focusing on connection over collection. An urban living room facilitating the needs of various users, with the courtyard as a connector between the two programmes.","Courtyard; Central space; Spatial Building Typology; Public Building; Library; Dwelling; Haarlem; Koudenhorn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Vacant Heritage","52.384130559103745, 4.64053593200247"

However, As the number of electric vehicles increases, so does the pressure on the grid due to charging. If a large number of electric vehicles are charged at the same time, the grid will inevitably be overloaded. For this problem, smart charging can be a good solution. The smart charging algorithm determines when it is optimal to charge the electric vehicles(EVs) based on factors like Photovoltaic(PV) generation, local load consumption, and energy price. For customers, this means the total cost of charging is the lowest, for the power system it means charging when the network is not overloaded. Furthermore, Smart charging can reduce the need for grid infrastructure investments and reduce energy costs. From an energy-friendly and economical perspective, this is worth doing.<br/><br/>Up to now, there is a large amount of literature study about smart charging. However, most of the literature is based on pure software analysis rather than hardware experiments. In this thesis, a hardware-in-the-loop-based simulation is presented. The basic idea of hardware-in-the-loop simulation is to include a part of the real hardware in the simulation loop. The advantages of hardware-in-the-loop simulation are obvious. Compared with pure software simulation, hardware-in-the-loop(HIL) simulation has the real response of the hardware components, and it is not very complicated to set everything up. In this thesis, the testing and the evaluation of the system are carried out in real-time because the HIL setup includes an OPAL-RT OP4510 DRTS. The simulation of the distribution grid is running on the OPAL target by the software ePHASORsim. The rest part of the testbed consists of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and two bidirectional Direct Current(DC) power supplies to form an Alternating Current(AC) source and an Alfen charger. The smart charging algorithm is written in Python code. By calling Gurobi, smart charging algorithms can calculate and decide the optimal current setpoints for each EV connected to the distribution grid in real-time.<br/><br","Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation; EV Smart Charging; Distribution Grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

The increasing use of workplace surveillance technology in organisations has resulted in considerable debate over the years. This qualitative study aimed to explore virtual leadership in practice and investigate the potential of using workplace surveillance technology to support effective virtual leadership. The results of the research will provide an answer to the following question: “How can workplace surveillance technology support virtual leadership in the new normal era?”.<br/>Existing research suggests that there is no single theory for virtual leadership and that more research should be conducted. The use of workplace surveillance technology lacks practical evidence and does not keep pace with continual change, vast technological advancements, and expectations by followers for transparency. The methodology used for this research consists of ten in-depth interviews with leaders and followers from the same organisation within three different sectors. Interviews were conducted utilising a semi-structured interview format. They produced data based on the lived experiences of virtual leadership and participants' views on workplace surveillance technology relating to whether virtual leaders could become more effective by implementing that.<br/>The findings of this research supported that there is not a single virtual leadership style, and continual change was recognised as an ongoing theme. Acceptance of change, adaptability, and personal attention were necessary for successful virtual leaders. The participants indicated that they saw some potential in using workplace surveillance technology for virtual leaders under certain conditions. The research has found that threats to using sensitive data information should be considered before deployment. When considering the needs and threats, participants argued that this could result in more effective virtual leadership depending on how virtual leaders act upon the information being gathered. Therefore, it is recommended to consider the threat that there is not a standard design of workplace surveillance technology and the potential of this technology is context-specific. Additional research should be conducted to evaluate virtual leadership, in general, to understand motivations and barriers to widespread adoption regardless of the use of workplace surveillance technology. Further research should be conducted on the operational and practical issues surrounding workplace surveillance technology in virtual work environments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Making the telescope more compact with high magnification imposes stricter tolerances. A solution to alleviate these tolerances is to use a refocusing mechanism (RFM) to align the telescope in space after launch. In this project, a refocusing system is designed. This comprises of making system level choices like where to place the mechanism, how to close the loop and how to use the onboard detectors. All these choices lead to the requirements for the RFM. Further, a mechanism is designed that fulfills the requirements. In addition, mechanical and thermal FEM simulations are carried out to show that the RFM survives launch and can work in the challenging thermal environment.","TNO; Optomechatronics; Laser Communication; Refocusing mechanism; Telescope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | High-Tech Engineering","",""

Computer vision algorithms commonly use input images acquired by a camera, where the only measured quantity is the amount of light the camera's sensor receives without any additional information about the shadows, occlusion, highlights, light directionality and interreflections, to help with scene processing and understanding. This thesis applies polarization state measurements of the camera's incoming light to implicitly extract information on these illumination phenomena through a polarization-based intrinsic image decomposition. By defining and measuring the polarization state parameters of an image in the form of polarization cosines, the diffuse and specular intrinsic images can be estimated through an iterative local optimization algorithm to give additional information on the scene illumination. The decomposition algorithm is qualitatively evaluated on three image sample sets, which show that the algorithm performs well as long as the measurements are aligned. The diffuse and specular intrinsic images can then be used to improve existing scene post-processing operations without requiring additional illumination information. One of the three image sample sets is used to evaluate the effects of the decomposition on texture modification, glossiness remapping and tonemapping. The results indicate that the three operations can be either simplified or can have their quality improved with the additional information supplied by the diffuse and specular intrinsic images.","polarization; intrinsic image; scene editing","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/amirzaidi/Polarization","","","","","","Computer Science | Computer Graphics","",""

At the time of writing, the construction industry in the Netherlands is respon¬sible for a large part of CO2 emissions, and due to the lack of significant changes in the industry in recent decades, a meaningful reduction of emissions in the coming years seems unlikely. The difficulty of lowering emissions is further amplified by the major housing shortage, for which it is estimated that one million homes must be built before 2030 to meet the population’s demand in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the construction sector is far behind in terms of environmentally conscious innovation when compared to sectors such as technology and transportation. Architects, contractors, engineers, and civil servants therefore have to join arms to implement large-scale in-depth reforms and accept much-needed innovation. <br/><br/>The booklet, paper and posters present the results of an innovative building system that can contribute to the sustainability of the construction sector. This concept was developed based on six months of research in which nine timber building systems were tested for their degree of flexibility and demountability. A framework was then created, where a chosen system was further developed, step by step, into a building concept that can be applied on a large scale. An attempt was made to incorporate every aspect that a building must satisfy without compromising simplicity. The development of the system has a generic and an applied phase. In the generic phase, the basis of the system is laid, which in theory is the same for every building. In the applied phase, the system is further ela¬borated based on the design assignment, which in this case concerns a temporary student building that must be transformed into laboratory and office functions after 10 years. Although the two phases are separate, the gaps in the generic part become vi¬sible when the system is tested in an actual design, resulting in a generic and specific phases that have continuous exchange and influence on each other. In practice, such a standardised system that is to be applied on a large scale is further fine-tuned after it has been realised and experimented with many times.<br","Timber Construction; flexibility; demountability; Standardisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Requirements can be set intuitively, without knowing what the side effects of the constraints will be for the urban development. On top of that, approval of all stakeholders is needed to be able to implement the design. An integral process of decision-making, with cooperation, open communication and considering everyone’s opinion, seems to be challenging when it comes to urban development projects.<br/><br/>Current decision-making methods, such as Linear Programming, are lacking in terms of cooperation between parties, only finding a feasible design for a group of stakeholders and satisfying one party. Considering preferences helps overcome this problem. In this thesis, an a priori design optimization approach (PDOA) has been developed as decision support system, applied and tested on a real-life urban planning case, Waelpolder.<br/><br/>The PDOA returns a quantitative design (Program of Requirements) for the to be developed area which is considering preferences and wishes of stakeholders a priori, before a design is generated. By basing the design on preferences of stakeholders, intuitively determined requirements are avoided and designs will be more compliant to stakeholders’ needs. The PDOA generates a design by optimizing on overall preference. So, finding a feasible solution is guaranteed, on top of that the approach is able to find a most desired group solution.<br/><br/>The Preferendus (based on Tetra) method, where stakeholders do not make the same amount of compromises in a design, is preferred to use in the PDOA rather than the goal attainment method, where stakeholders do the same amount of compromises. This is mainly because the Preferendus returns more extreme designs and can better show the impact of adjustments in requirements in comparison to the more moderate designs generated with goal attainment. In addition, the stakeholders of Waelpolder indicate that it is realistic that one party should do more compromises than another party. Therefore, the Preferendus is better able to support decision-making and open up discussions.<br/><br/>The PDOA allows a new direction in decision-making, where negotiations become an open glass box rather than a black box. Openness &amp; transparency, which is one of the fundamentals of the PDOA, takes away strategic play between stakeholders. Stakeholders are forced to express what they want upfront, before any design is created.<br/><br/>The approach supports negotiations in decision-making as it provides insights in a rapid and simple manner. The tool allows requirement modification, thereby showing the impact of certain requirements and presenting alternative possibilities. In addition, long negotiation processes where stakeholders need to get aligned are avoided because of the required openness and adaptability of the tool.One of the stakeholders within Waelpolder is willing to implement the PDOA within its organization as slip school model in urban development projects, to investigate the effects of adjusting requirements. Due to the iterative value of the approach, the stakeholders are positive about using the approach in other area developments, in an early stage.<br","Preference modeling; Optimisation; Design management; Multi-stakeholder decision making; Feasibility and desirability integration; Decision support system; Genetic Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It lacks movements, emotions, human activities, memories, experiences and perceptions. Perceptions that transcend vision, however, are more of an issue for the film industry, which strives to provide sensory experiences for the immobile viewer. This study asks questions about experiential space, explores modes of narration, questions sequence, time, and spaces, and attempts to define it through theories that intersect with film and architecture. Ultimately, the reading of cities, typologies, and design approaches is based on the accepted value system inherent in the entire research, which is defined as ""cinematic architecture"". It demonstrates, through material examples, that certain architectural ensembles due to their spatial and ideological configuration can be more cinematic than others. On the other hand, also London was analysed with these acquired lenses.<br/> Urban stories of metropolises, especially the ones like London, which have gone through various phases of destruction, show a constantly changing, dynamic character. This character allows us to consider the city in terms of narratives and scenarios rather than as a fixed city image. Especially in the period of urban change in post-war London, the utopian idea of connecting the city through elevated walkways is a focus of this study due to its experimental nature, morphology, and ideology associated with ""cinematic architecture"". Had the walkways been fully realized, the structure would have been a means to experience a city from a particular vantage point, located at the high level of the city. But the disconnect between the remaining pedways and their fragmentary quality is also an opportunity to think about complementary stories. The unfinished quality of these structures allows us to pose the ""What if?"" question. What are the events and emotions this kind of typology which is neither a building nor a landscape could trigger? How can elevated walkways narrate London`s story and redefine its identity through a visual and emotional connection to the city? <br/>Based on the theoretical framework, these structures became a testing ground to show the subjectivity of perception using a method derived from Bernard Tschumi's manifesto ""Manhattan Transcripts”. This test was expected to show how the fragmental approach to the architectural entity, similar to framed film images can narrate a story that each reader as each viewer can derive its own meaning. The design resulted in an intervention montaged into the city view of Blackfriars, where one of the leftover pedways is located.

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (graduation committee); Biely, K. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2022","To use solar energy efficiently, reduce emissions and net congestion problems, prosumer households should substitute grid-consumed energy with self-consumption. Loadshifting is a low-cost measure to increase self-consumption, shifting energy-intensive behaviors (such as running the laundry machine) to periods of time when energy is produced. Research on the behavioral foundation of loadshifting is scarce. At a time of growing PV integration, leading to a debate on balancing responsibility and the dismantling of the Dutch net-metering scheme, the Netherlands makes for an interesting case to study this issue. This study aims to assess the barriers limiting Dutch prosumer households from loadshifting the use of their laundry machine to a time when their solar PV system is producing energy. <br/><br/>Literature shows that loadshifting not only depends on the individual, but also on the material and institutional context. Therefore, combining the individual-focused theory of planned behavior and context-focused social practice theory is useful to study barriers to loadshifting. The newly constructed model consists of 10 measurable constructs possibly underlying barriers to loadshifting. The included constructs are sufficiency attitude, motivation, user beliefs, know-how, monitoring skills, habits, hassle, practical knowledge provided, institutional policies and regulations, and feedback provision by system design. To test this model a mixed-methods approach is taken. Qualitative data is obtained through six semi-structured interviews with solar energy experts and is analyzed through thematic content analysis using ATLAS.ti. The quantitative data encompasses 283 survey responses from Dutch prosumers, analyzed mainly through a multiple regression analysis in SPSS. <br/><br/>Qualitative findings largely verify the model. According to experts, a low sufficiency attitude, passive user beliefs, limited practical knowledge, strong habits, hassle, limited know-how, low monitoring skills, financial motivation and low feedback provision are all relevant barriers to loadshifting behavior. Barriers found in addition to the predefined model include high age, panel orientation, a lack of clear policy, safety concerns, outdated machinery, and low interpretability of energy bills. On the other hand, only low monitoring skills, strong habits, limited practical knowledge, and passive user beliefs significantly limit loadshifting behavior in the quantitative analyses. <br/><br/>Findings highlight the need for cooperation amongst the energy sector, home appliance producers, policymakers, consultants, researchers, and prosumers. Furthermore, technology should support human behavior, rather than expecting behavior to adjust to technology. For example, technical measures that do not require dramatic habitual change can easily support loadshifting, such as panel orientation. If the encouragement of habitual change is desired, dismantling the Dutch net-metering scheme in combination with providing a monetary self-consumption bonus is recommended. Moreover, prosumer knowledge on self-consumption and prosumers’ monitoring skills should be increased. <br/><br/>Strengths of this study include its mixed-methods approach, the large quantitative sample size and the novel combination of two theories. However, not all relevant barriers could be considered, and policymakers were not interviewed directly. Lastly, most constructs were quantitatively measured using two questions only. Future research is needed mainly to assess potential interaction effects between habits, hassle, and know-how. Additionally, other barriers can be assessed, such as the effects of motivation or values on loadshifting.","Solar energy; Behavior; Netherlands; psychology; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

However, commonly used fish feed products are known to harm the environment while depleting natural species. Various microbial protein forms are thus being investigated, such as those using hydrogen-oxidising bacteria, referred to as MP. This study investigates MP’s environmental performance over conventional feed products as overall<br/>advantages and disadvantages remained unclear based on previous publications.<br/><br/>A four-phase explorative scenario framework for assessing novel technologies was used, further developed from recent studies. Based on a literature review of MP’s environmental performance, the ammonia and heat source used needed further evaluation. At the same time, previous studies displayed limitations related to CO2 allocation, continuous energy and nutrient supply, energy<br/>grid stability, the readiness of the assessed technologies, the cost of production, and other influencing socio-economic factors. An attributional cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to determine an optimal system performance at a pilot-scale rooted in the literature findings. Subsequently, technical and socio-economic parameters were evaluated to influence MP’s progressive environmental performance. <br/><br/>Consequently, an ex-ante LCA compared MP production scenarios over time, differing in energy sources and production scales, against soybean meal (SBM). Even at high technical development, comparative results closely aligned, yet MP using geothermal energy showed a slight overall advantage over SBM after normalisation, in contrast to hydro and bioenergy displaying no real benefit. When oxygen (O2) was recycled, the former showed an overall<br/>advantage over the incumbent at high production capacity. A total disadvantage would be expected for the latter, considering continuous H2 and NH3 supply. Further research should focus on integrating recycled phosphate, green H2 in the steel industry, differences in databases regarding water use for hydropower plants, and scenario analysis of the incumbent system. Besides these findings, the developed framework contributes toward the comparative assessment<br/>of novel technologies against established ones.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The climate is changing and the ecosystems are being affected by our actions. If we stay in the same path, the consequences could be catastrophic. For this reason, there is a growing focus on how to minimise our negative impacts on the planets and develop in a more sustainable manner. To aid in this objective, computers are a useful tool. Computational techniques can offer solutions to complex problems in sustainability, which often involve uncertainty, optimisation and decision making. However, the potential of classical computers is expected to reach a barrier, since the size of computer chips is reaching its physical limit. This requires new solutions that can provide better computational results in the future. A promising paradigm that is emerging is quantum computing, which works with quantum bits (or qubits) to make calculations and produce new solutions.<br/><br/>Given the potential of quantum computers, it is interesting to consider how they could help industrial ecology. Up to date, there have been no studies that focus on these two scientific disciplines together. For this reason, the first aim of this work is to identify what industrial ecology problems can benefit from quantum computing. The second aim is to provide a practical case study to illustrate how to work with quantum computers. In particular, the case study focuses on how to optimise vehicle routings in order to minimise emissions. Although routing problems have been extensively studied from the sustainability point of view, there are no such studies done on quantum computing yet. Overall, the main research question is ""how can quantum computing benefit industrial ecology and how can it be applied to a relevant problem?'"".<br/><br/>Regarding the methodology, it is separated into different parts. Firstly, a literature review is conducted to identify possible applications for industrial ecology. This is done by considering relevant industrial ecology problems and investigating if any gains can be obtained by using quantum computers. The second part of the methodology focuses on the more practical side of quantum computing. It starts by benchmarking two state-of-the-art variational quantum algorithms (Rosalin and LCB CMA-ES) to test the performance and evaluate the produced results. Following the benchmarking, a green routing problem will be encoded and optimised using the mentioned algorithms. All the coding is done in Python with the help of Cirq and Openfermion, which are two packages for quantum computing developed by Google.<br/><br/>After following the methodology, several results were obtained. The literature review highlighted a series of problems that can benefit from quantum computing. Examples are the optimisation of flows in an industrial park and the management of data centres to reduce energy needs. Moreover, the review illustrated different techniques to tackle these problems, such as quantum machine learning and quantum information. Secondly, as for the benchmarking, both algorithms perform well in the test cases and there is no clear advantage of one over the other. One is slightly better for some test cases and the other slightly better in the other cases. In the logistics problem, the problem is encoded into a hamiltonian that is more complex than the test cases. To minimise the expectation of the hamiltonian, the previously mentioned algorithms are tested with different quantum circuits and the results are compared. LCB CMA-ES with circuit of depth 1 gives the best results, while the other LCB CMA-ES experiments do not do as well. This is unexpected because all the LCB CMA-ES experiments are able to optimise successfully the expectation of the hamiltonian. This indicates that it is possible that the encoding of the routing problem is not optimal. Regarding the Rosalin experiments, they are not able to achieve a desirable result due to the adaptive nature of this algorithm, which does not allow a sufficient number of iterations of the optimisation process. <br/><br/>Concluding, although there is potential for using quantum computing in industrial ecology problems, it is clear that for the moment, classical computers produce the best results. However, quantum computing is evolving rapidly, and there may be a point where the tables are turned and quantum computers become the norm. As for now, the obtained results are far from ideal, but these could improve in the coming years.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The application of WBE to monitor health parameters has become essential due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. WBE is a well-known method to track the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater and is used as an early warning system for the spread of the virus. However, the accuracy of monitoring trends through WBE is affected by various methodological challenges. This thesis aims to identify and quantify factors that affect the representativeness of monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 virus through WBE as part of the National Sewage Surveillance (NRS).<br/><br/>Factors that possibly influence the representativeness of WBE for monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 virus from loo to lab are identified. To what extent these factors potentially affect the representativeness is discussed in a literature review. The results are presented in a dendrogram, showing the relationship between different factors. Based on the results of the literature review, the seven most important factors affecting the accuracy of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 through WBE were determined to investigate their effect in more detail. To create an overview of the effect of the various factors and to ensure comparison, the results of the different factors are synthesized based on four criteria.<br/><br/>The effect on the representativeness is quantified and synthesized for the following factors: location of shedding, temporary in-sewer storage, RNA decay, deviant flow values, loss of information by overflow events, automated samplers and flow rate measurements. The effect of each factor is quantified individually. Different methodologies were used for the quantification of the different factors. The results were based on data analysis and expert consultations.<br/><br/>It was observed that the effect on the load of SARS-CoV-2 monitored by temporary in-sewer storage is negligible, as well as the effect by the decay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by temperature and residence time. For the following factors, the influence on representativeness may be significant: The location of shedding, deviant flow values, loss of information by overflow events, automated samplers and flow rate measurements. Based on the results of the synthesis an advice is given on which factors should be included in the methodology of monitoring the virus through WBE and which samples should be excluded.<br/><br/>In conclusion, WBE is a valuable method to use for pandemic preparedness and monitoring health indicators from wastewater. There are many factors that influence the representativeness of samples for the monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This research adds knowledge to the understanding of factors influencing the accuracy of WBE. The results elaborated by this study hope to contribute to the early detection of, not only, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also for other epidemic viruses, as well as other health indicators.<br","Wastewater-based epidemiology; Monitoring; sars-cov-2; COVID-19","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

To make the IoT sensors self-sustained, Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting (PEH) technology provides an excellent solution to power the devices with a relatively long service time. By harvesting the ambient mechanical vibrations, PEH could generate a stable power source without wind or light.<br/><br/>Currently, the famous bearing manufacturer, SKF, collaborates with TU Delft to design a self-sustained smart IoT roller with PEH technology, which will be implanted in huge bearings, such as the bearing in the wind turbines. This thesis project is a feasibility study investigating the possibility of replacing the chemical battery with the Piezoelectric Energy Harvester in SKF's smart IoT roller, called Sensor Roller. <br/><br/>The objective of this project includes the system design of two generations of the prototype harvester. The first prototype concentrates on the properties of the piezoelectric material, while the second prototype focuses on the structure of the harvester. The design work consists of the raw data analysis of the target roller from SKF and the prototype construction and simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics. Besides, to make the results more reliable, two stages of the test with the practical components are made to study the harvester's performance under the actual working condition of the roller in the bearing. As a result, a tube shape Piezoelectric Energy Harvester with suitable materials and parameters is built. According to the simulation results, under a safe pressure level of the piezoelectric material, the proposed harvester achieves 8.1mW output power, which is enough for the loading sensors. The designed Piezoelectric Energy Harvester is being manufactured at present, and it is planned to be installed in the target roller to get the system-level test in the future.<br/><br/>In addition to the harvester, some rectifiers are designed and taped out to improve the performance of the proposed Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting system. Three rectifiers are made with the Silicon Carbide (SiC) process to obtain a high voltage and temperature tolerance: a Full Bridge Rectifier (FBR), a Passive Rectifier, and a Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) rectifier. Meanwhile, another SSHI rectifier is made with the 0.18um Silicon BCD process that focuses on solving the cold-startup problem. Consequently, simulated with the real transducer of the proposed harvester, both the FBR circuit and the Passive Rectifier circuit with the SiC process achieve over 10mW output power, and the SiC SSHI circuit achieves 37.1mW output power. As for the cold-startup SSHI rectifier circuit, it successfully reduces the required open circuit voltage by 4x to start up the SSHI system from the cold state.<br/><br/>The results of this project show the great potential for applying the Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting technology to power the IoT sensors in the roller of bearing. Although some future works should be finished to build the commercial version of the energy harvesting roller, we are convinced that the fully self-sustained Sensor Roller with Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting technology will possibly show up in the near future.","IoT; Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectric; Rectifier; SSHI; SiC MOSFET","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

These devices are typically difficult to put on and bulky, limiting their use to a lab environment. In-ear EEG recording is proposed as a more practical alternative to scalp EEG recording. <br/><br/>In-ear EEG replaces the scalp electrode array with more discrete earpieces, recording the EEG signals from the ear canal instead of the scalp. Because of their increased convenience with respect to their scalp electrode array counterpart, the earpieces allow for everyday use, enabling the possibility of long-term EEG recording, outside of a lab environment.<br/><br/>This work presents the design of a fully-integrated in-ear EEG device. The device has been designed to record EEG signals, process them locally, and transmit the processed data to a smartphone or personal computer. The device is made to be easily re-programmable, making it possible to change the device firmware depending on the intended application. This functionality has been integrated into a small form factor, to allow for the integration of the electronics into an earpiece. A low-power design has been created, to allow for long-term battery operation. <br/><br/>Two prototypes have been made. The first prototype focuses on exploring different system configurations, with the small form factor less of a priority. The performance of the prototype is tested by comparing it to a commercially available scalp EEG recording device based on scalp EEG recordings. For this comparison, the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), and alpha-band modulation paradigms are used. The prototype has shown similar performance to the scalp EEG device in these experiments, with the scalp EEG device performing slightly better for the ASSR and alpha-band modulation paradigms, while the prototype showed the best performance for the SSVEP paradigm.<br/><br/>The second prototype realises the best-performing system configuration that has been found with the first prototype into a form factor that fits into an earpiece. Ear EEG experiments are performed, with electrodes placed around the ears. The ASSR, SSVEP, and alpha-band modulation paradigms have again been used in these experiments. The measured performance on the ASSR and alpha-band modulation paradigms are slightly worse than that measured using the scalp EEG experiments. The SSVEP experiments showed significantly worse performance compared to the scalp EEG experiments. These results align with the expectations, as ear EEG has been documented to have performance close to scalp EEG for the ASSR and alpha-band modulation paradigms, while the SSVEP performance is typically worse for ear EEG than for scalp EEG.","Electroencephalography (EEG); ear-EEG; ASSR; SSVEP; alpha-band modulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

State abstraction as a form of data-centric method shrinks the state space and reduces learning time, however, it is challenged by the fact that abstraction throws away information and might result in a sub-optimal solution. In this thesis, we propose the hierarchical clustering-based state grouping (HCSG) method to split the ground state space into clusters and train multiple agents for each cluster without changing the dimension of the state space. This approach allows us to distribute computation and improves training efficiency without losing the overall performance, and was also shown to outperform baseline and other state-of-art data-centric methods.","Rinforcement Learning; MEDIATOR; state abstraction; State decomposition; Data centric research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","MEDIATOR Project",""

In the first phase, research into the state of the circular economy of current electric toothbrushes was performed in which the academic, manufacturer and user perspectives were researched. This led to three key insights for the circular design of an electric toothbrush. In the second phase, an analysis was performed of the implementation of circular design strategies in a representative set of current electric toothbrushes.

Multiple alternative fuels and power generating systems can be used to decrease these emissions. In this research, a comparative study is performed on six concept solutions. Four fuel types (hydrogen, HVO, methanol, and renewable energy) and three different power generating system components (proton exchange membrane fuel cells, lithiumion batteries, and internal combustion engines) are considered. The option of charging a battery-powered ship offshore is also considered. The goal of this research is to identify the most cost-effective system to reduce GHG emissions. The comparison is based on the total cost of ownership, the GHG emissions of fuel production and utilisation, and the GHG emissions of the production of the power generating system. In order to achieve this, the component sizes and lifetimes are calculated based on the constraints of the ship and the operational profile with different transit distances to the wind farm. The lifetime of the fuel cell is based on a cell voltage degradation model developed in this research. A battery electric ship with a methanol genset is found to be the best method with the largest GHG emissions reductions in relation to cost. Without charging offshore for a transit distance up to 18 km, and with offshore charging beyond 18 km.

Earlier work in this area has lead to the development of a proof-of-concept for detecting behavioural changes in motor performance, but the linear regression model used was limited in its accuracy and had a high latency. This paper uses a non-linear Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR) model to increase performance in those areas. LS-SVR was chosen for its ability to regress complex non-linear relationships and because it is highly adaptable and scalable, yet easy to understand and work with. Test data were simulated based on earlier measured data which resulted in a complete and varied data set that allows for exploring many different situations. <br/>Results from the machine learning model when applied to the test data are promising. With the right combination of hyperparameter settings an improvement of 80% in accuracy was reached, and latency could be reduced by 30%. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters revealed further room for improvement with more careful tuning. Finally, it was shown that by using LS-SVR to make predictions on data from future trials a further reduction in latency can be achieved. Overall, the new model shows definite improvement over the earlier model and can be developed further in subsequent steps towards a clinical applicable method.","Manual tracking; Parkinson’s disease; cybernetic approach; motor performance; behavioural changes; machine learning; regression; least squares support vector machine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Numansgors is a village seeking to improve sustainability by housing renovation. In this process, the effective participation of homeowners faces multiple challenges. The Pattern Language Theory (PLT), a design methodology first proposed by Alexander Christopher in 1970s, shows its potential in tackling these challenges. However, as PLT has been applied in broadening domains, various approaches to using PLT are different from the original one taken by Alexander. As these differences and their basis generally go unarticulated, practitioners referring to such cases may fail to choose an appropriate approach and hence use PLT less effectively. Therefore, to support the effective ue of PLT, either in Numansgors or in other domains, this graduation project aims to support differentiating between diverse PLT approaches, and deciding on a PLT approach.<br/>In the beginning, to better understand the topic, a literature review of PLT was conducted. The benefits of PLT were identified, which later confirmed its suitability in Numansgors. Besides, eight purposes of using PLT were summarised and were later found essential in deciding on PLT approaches.<br/>Next, to understand the different approaches, an integrative review — which I called deconstruction, identifying and reconstruction — of multiple cases was performed. The external manifestations and internal reasons for different approaches were identified. On the outward, the different approaches are manifested in four components. On the inward, the approaches root in<br/>practitioners’ diverging values and needs. These insights were concretised into three tools, which were later incorporated into the final research output.<br/>Afterwards, to find out how the three tools could be used in practice, workshops were organised for inspiration. In these workshops, some other issues in deciding on PLT approaches were found. These issues were tackled by formulating a procedure to use PLT and refining the classification of activities around PLT. All these insights were synthesised into the final research output, the Activity Kit, to support practitioners in deciding on their PLT approaches. With this Activity Kit, practitioners can first consider their project purposes, then find the activities recommended for the purposes, and finally execute the activities with the support of relevant tools.<br/>To validate the use of Activity Kit, the Numansgors project was taken as an example. A three-stage plan for Numansgors was generated by using the Activity Kit. It is recommended to evaluate the Activity Kit with more cases and keep up with the influence of the pattern language in Numansgors.","Pattern Language; Design methodology; sustainability; Renovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","51.7181001, 4.4442611"

With the rise of stablecoins and major events such as the announcement of Facebook’s own cryptocurency Libra in 2019, the EU regulators felt the urgent need to address the digital currencies that may pose financial and security risks if left unsupervised. In 2020, the European Commission introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework to regulate the crypto-asset issuers and service providers located in the EU or serving EU clients from abroad. One of the regulation’s objectives is to address the risks of the crypto-markets while leveraging its benefits, yet there has been no evaluation of the proposed regulation besides the Commission’s own impact assessment.<br/><br/>Thus, this research offers an evaluation of the MiCA framework by adopting World Economic Forum’s DeFi white paper risk framework and interviews with the industry experts to generate both qualitative and quantitative data that is used to construct policy considerations for future amendments. By conducting interviews with 8 legal experts, the study provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the MiCA framework, while the interviews with 2 respondents from crypto-asset issuer entities, 6 from crypto-asset service providers entities and 3 from institutional investors entities provided further insights into the perceptions of the industry participants on the EU crypto regulation. Moreover, the study presents the risk perceptions of each respondent groups as during the interview rounds the participants were presented 18 risks of DeFi and were asked to select the most 5 critical risks perceived by them. This information is used to reveal what risks are perceived by each group. Lastly, the study presents a content analysis to assess the extent to which the 18 risks ranked by the interviewees are addressed in the MiCA framework. In summary, the results of the study suggest many points of improvement to the MiCA framework with respect to definitions, scoping, classifications and the regulatory approach. Moreover, the results suggest that the policy makers should focus on the unaddressed risks in the future amendments and policies, most importantly on technical and operational risks that have been left out from the framework.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-30","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

A threefold-knowledge gap was identified in literature. First, it was identified that the viability of geothermal energy is case-specific. Therefore, the lack of knowledge about geothermal energy implementation in metropolitan setting results in uncertainty about the possible trade-offs of stakeholders and makes stakeholders wary of entering the market. Second, it is unclear how and to what extend regional norms, rules and regulations influence development of geothermal systems in urban areas after policy has been adopted. Third, significance of social acceptance is being discussed in a growing number of studies, however it is unclear how social acceptance may be operationalized in policy implementation research. Therefore, this thesis addresses the question how and to what extent institutions influence the success of the geothermal energy policy implementation process in urban areas in the Netherlands. The aim of this research is to consistently track institutions in geothermal energy policy implementation in urban areas in the Netherlands. For this purpose, a comparative case study has been designed to contrast the geothermal policy implementation process of two municipalities, The Hague and Nieuwegein, that share similarities in urban development, external context and type of geothermal technology, but differ in policy outcome. To structure the individual case analysis, a theoretical framework is developed that utilizes elements from the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) by Kingdon and the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework by Ostrom. From the findings it can be concluded that taking institutions into consideration influences the political and policy flow directly. The primary issues raised by the comparative analysis relate to social, ethical, and politically significant transactions. The lengthy policy implementation process was tainted by a general (mis)trust of the decisionmakers, and concerns were focussed about the equitable allocation of risks and rewards and the willingness to work together for a sustainable system.","Geothermal Energy; Institutional Analysis; Policy implementation; Netherlands; Comparative case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Urban logistics is important for inhabitants' quality of life both in a negative and positive sense and plays a large economic role with significant advantages for various stakeholders along complex, dynamic supply chains. These trends influence the direction of how the city and the supply chain will develop over the coming decades. <br/>Getting a clearer vision of city logistics by exploring (economic, societal, and environmental) trends and different new forms of transportation with exploratory scenarios benefits a wide range of stakeholders. With this vision, municipalities can adapt their urban logistics policy strategy and logistical companies &amp; developers their investments in supply chains and infrastructure. <br/>Rather than sharing their experiences, cities mimic each other's freight legislation. Because the stakes of the various players in the issue are not directly recognized, obligations for urban freight are passed to other stakeholders, and expectations on projects are unclear. and they do not feel responsible for the solution. Changes in logistic stakeholders' conduct are hindered by their passive and awaiting attitudes toward one another. Technological and economic developments have had an impact on urban freight leading to a growing scale of consumption and production. Four distinct scenarios for exploring the future of urban logistics were developed. The four scenarios give an overview of the future of urban logistics and the organization of the inner city supply chain in 2040. The developed vision 2040 for urban logistics has shown significant changes regarding the use of technologies and infrastructure, the design of services and delivery concepts, market organization and cooperation, planning and regulation and finally to a certain extent also behavior. All in all, eventually in 2040, we will not be worse off in terms of CO2 emissions than in the current scenario as climate change will put pressure on increasing emission reduction regulation, even in scenarios 1 &amp; 3 where market forces dominate. Scenario 2 might be the best future outcome for increasing the city's liveability but less good for logistical businesses due to heavy regulation in the urban logistics system. Scenario 4 might be the worst for businesses due to increased cost and economic headwinds and city inhabitants due to reduced living conditions caused by extreme weather. This scenario could be averted if there would be a drastic reduction in emissions to stop climate change. The development of innovative urban distribution methods and driving forces can have a substantial impact on the future urban logistics system. These scenarios, implications &amp; recommendations should assist businesses, policymakers and investors in imagining future developments, exploring relevant uncertainties, and studying the implications for their merit.","Urban Logistics system; City Logistics; Urban Freight Logistics; Scenario Analysis; mixed method analysis; Urban Logistics Scenarios","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In 2016 the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment and 14 transport authorities signed a “Zero Emission Regional Public Transport by Bus” administrative agreement, stating that from 2025 onward all new buses must use 100% renewable energy and from 2030 all buses must be fully emission free. Since then the Dutch public transport system has added more than 1000 battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell buses to their bus fleet. These shifts towards increased sustainable mobility are influenced by policy changes and innovation in technology and institutions. In order to explain how such complex socio-technical transitions develop, it is therefore important to look at them from both a socio-technical and a policy perspective.<br/>Technological innovation and policy innovation are analyzed in different research fields, namely innovation studies and policy studies. In policy theory technological changes are considered as exogenous events, which can also be said about the multiple streams framework (MSF). It does not consider the differences in innovation patterns of technologies, which is the case in most policy literature. Meanwhile in technology transition theory policy changes are seen as a mere black box, which can be seen in the multilevel perspective (MLP) as well. It does not include the ways that policies develop. This makes it difficult to identify important policy-technology feedback links and dynamics in sustainability transitions. <br/>This research looks at the way in which the MLP and the MSF complement each other in order to provide a more holistic explanation of sustainability transitions and how this can be used in future research for theory synthesis. This will be done through a case study of the ongoing transition to ZEBs in the Dutch public transport sector. The aim of this research is to find ways in which the two frameworks strengthen one another, based on the findings of the case study. The results will then be used to generate a proposition to help synthesize and develop a conceptual framework in future research, which combines the MSF and MLP in order to have a more comprehensive explanation of sustainability transitions.","Zero emission buses; Multilevel Perspective; Multiple Streams Framework; Sustainability transitions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

For installed offshore wind turbines, there has been a lot of research conducted in the field of aero-, hydro- and structural dynamics, wind turbine-control, operation &amp; maintenance, foundations and moorings. The research field of offshore wind turbine installation is on the other hand relatively new, and the studies regarding this topic are limited. The lifting of heavy objects is one of the most commonly performed offshore installation operations and has become more challenging due to the trend of increasingly larger and heavier payloads. Especially for substantial waves, the pendular motions of the payload may cause operations to be halted.<br/><br/>This thesis performs a study on a positioning control strategy for a complex lifting control scenario, i.e., position-keeping of a complex-shaped 6-DOF payload using a floating vessel equipped with multiple tugger winches. As the system is highly complex and contains non-linear and time-varying dynamic phenomena, it is an impracticable task to formulate a model that meticulously describes the actual system. For this reason, a fully integrated simulation model in Orcaflex has been used to capture the non-linear dynamic behaviour of the system.<br/><br/>The preassembly operation of a Jacket Lifting Tool on a monohull vessel is adopted as a case study to verify the proposed control strategy. Two scenarios are considered -installation and decommissioning- for which an outrigger configuration is used to position the tugger winches. Due to the difference in setpoint (i.e. the desired position) in the two scenarios, the proposed controller is solely implemented in the decommissioning scenario. Damping tuggers, the current state-of-the-art when it comes to motion mitigation, is considered suitable in the installation scenario. <br/><br/>The proposed controller does not consider the state–space equations of the system and only relies on real-time motion and tension measurements of the vessel and suspended payload. In addition, the controller considers the system's velocity tension and power limitations. The controller's impact is evaluated based on the positional error and verified by the peak reduction in the power spectral density spectra of the simulations. Despite its simple form, results show a significant reduction in the positional error, and therefore the possibility to extend the working conditions of the installation vessel. To improve the controller's performance it is recommended to involve derivative control, consider payload motion prediction and to optimise the tugger winch configuration. For further studies, experimental testing is needed to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme as it could appear that the controller does not exhibit similar performance in the real system. However, it is deemed unlikely that the latter would occur as a sensitivity study regarding measurement error indicates a stable response of the controller.<br","Control; pendulum; installation; Motion Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Thus, to understand how such sustainability transitions come about, it is crucial to comprehend how socio-technical and policy change co-evolve. This study applied the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) from transition studies and the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) from the policy theory to study this co-evolution. <br/><br/>The knowledge gap that this research aims to bridge is the systematic understanding of how socio-technical transitions (resulting from the pressure of landscape and niches on the regime) and policy change (resulting from the intersection of the problem, policy, and politics streams of the MSF) combined affect each other and consequently influence sustainability transitions. Given the strong technical dimension and the significant contribution of national policies, the Dutch transition to electric cars is chosen as a case study to bridge the knowledge gap.<br/><br/>Bridging the knowledge gap answered the following main research question:<br/><br/>How can a study of socio-technical transitions using MLP and policy changes using MSF applied to the Dutch transition to electric cars help create insights into how to synthesise the two aforementioned theoretical frameworks?<br/><br/>Answering this research question resulted in 13 propositions that relate to the commonalities, differences, and (causal) relations between the two frameworks. The findings proved that certain concepts relating to the socio-technical challenges and niche developments of the MLP and the problem and policy streams of the MSF overlap between the two frameworks. <br/><br/>The findings also showed that certain concepts that form an inherent part of the MLP are missing from the MSF. The missing concepts in the MSF namely relate to technological innovation. It is foreseeable that a policy change framework is not expected to include the technical dimensions of its targeting socio-technical change. However, it is still important for such a framework to incorporate the implications that such technological developments have on the general course of events leading to policy change. This is where the potential of the MLP comes in to compensate for this limitation. <br/><br/>At last, the research proved the existence of certain causal relations between the two frameworks. Examples of such relations exist between regime barriers of the MLP and the policy entrepreneurs of the MSF as well as relations between regime actors of the MLP and the national mood and political ideology of the MSF.<br/><br/>To further unleash the full explanatory power of the MLP and MSF, it is recommended to synthesise the two frameworks together. This research offers the possibility of a future synthesis of the two frameworks by using the propositions that this research has developed. Such a new framework, combining both concepts of transition studies and policy literature, would be of great added value to both transition scholars as well as policy analysts aiming to understand how sustainability transitions come about.","Sustainable Transitions; multi-level perspective; Multiple Streams Framework; Socio-technical transition; policy change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Wind-assisted ships are becoming more common due to high fuel prices and rising environmental concerns. The subject of this thesis is wind-assisted ship maneuverability, which is a relatively new and unexplored topic. There are many factors which this study can involve, and so the goal of this thesis is to study the general behavior of wind-assisted ships during the Turning Circle and Zig-Zag standard maneuvers, and investigate in depth the effect of different control optimization schemes for the wind propulsors. This study requires building a 4 degree-of-freedom (DOF) time domain maneuvering model in which the equations of motions for a wind-assisted ship are solved and the required parameters are input in order to execute the standard maneuvers. The model includes calculation of all the major forces on the ship, including hydrodynamic forces common among maneuvering models, and with the addition of aerodynamic forces due to the wind propulsors. Once the model is built and shows sufficient accuracy, the maneuvers are simulated for a variety of wind conditions, sail configurations, and wind propulsor trim optimization schemes. The behavior of the ship due to these different conditions and the compliance with maneuvering standards are discussed.<br/><br/>The results of the simulations show that the maneuvering behavior of the ship is indeed significantly dependant on the wind, and also how the wind propulsors are controlled. Based on the results, in general, the ship shows the behavior to turn quickly into the wind and slowly while turning against the wind. The effect this has on the maneuvers is that the Turning Circle is generally tighter when the initial turn is turning toward the wind, and larger when the ship is initially turning away from the wind. For the Zig-Zag maneuvers, the ship is alternating in turning toward and away from the wind and so the behavior of turning faster toward the wind is evident in the measured quantities of the Zig-Zag maneuver. The standardized requirements on maneuvering do not yet have considerations for wind-assisted ships and thus it is unknown what will be allowed in the future in terms of wind propulsor control during the standardized tests. Additionally, the abilities of the ships and wind propulsors when it comes to active optimization and wind propulsor trimming are not well known. Thus in this thesis a variety of options for wind propulsor control are studied in order to provide some insight on what is possible, covering some more conservative and more aggressive approaches. The wind propulsor optimization shows to have a big effect on the ship maneuverability, and with thoughtfully constructed optimization schemes there is a general improvement in the measured quantities that result from the maneuvers.","wind-assisted ship propulsion; Wind-assist; Wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP); maneuvering; Time Domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

Therefore, the Dutch government chose to transition the whole Dutch residential sector to gas-free living by 2050, to decrease CO2 levels. Homeowners are responsible themselves for adopting a sustainable heating system, where specifically heat pumps are one of the main proposed solutions. However, renovation rates are not expected to meet their determined goals. Hassle factors are a psychological barrier in homeowners' decision-making process, leading to inaction and delays. Therefore, it is determined what is perceived as a hassle and to what extent it is a barrier in homeowners' decision-making process.<br/><br/>Five main hassles were determined which impact the decision-making: ‘length of disruption’, ‘information gathering’, ‘subsidy and loan applications’, ‘finding a contractor’ and ‘neighbour consultation’. Next, their influence as a barrier has been examined through discrete choice modelling with the help of a stated-preference choice experiment containing in total 155 complete responses. The results of this study, for the first time, empirically validated that all five mentioned hassles negatively influence homeowners' decision-making. However, these five individual influences are best modelled as one combined hassle factor, which is perceived as more important than the financial profit a homeowner receives over the lifetime of a heat pump. Additionally, a latent class analysis was performed, finding significantly different preferences between two homeowners groups within the sample. Looking more closely at what a homeowner perceives as a hassle, the additional factor of ‘profit’ is found to have a de-hassling effect on the overall amount of hassle, indicating that context is important for homeowners. Looking more closely at the perceptions of hassle, differences between conscious and unconscious perceptions can be found. <br/><br/>The findings of this research show that reducing the five main hassles can be used to speed up the adoption process of heat pumps and contribute to reducing the adversities of climate change. Policymakers and businesses can perform interventions to decrease hassle or provide even ‘hassle-free’ alternatives by taking over tasks. The appropriateness of these interventions can be based on the derived value of time indicators created for each individual hassle factor. The use of context differentiations can be used as an additional tool via nudging and sludging to decrease or increase the perceived amount of hassle of choices. This research's overall value provides a better understanding of the psychological barrier hassle, which is rarely considered in homeowners' decision-making.","Hassle; Decision-making; Homeowners; Heat pumps; Choice modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Unfairness does not seem something to be desirable by society. So how does it suddenly arise? Unfairness of the network tariff system is in its core a cost allocation issue related to energy use. This issue is a recurring theme in the energy transition and it revolves around the central question of how we are going to divide the costs of the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. This question is currently a very relevant topic in the political and public debate and unfairness of the network tariffs further undermines the very necessary energy transition. The climate goals associated with this transition contributed to the development of sustainable energy technologies such as the electric vehicles, heat pumps, solar panels and wind turbines. The increasing penetration of these technologies cause extra costs for distribution system operators, the managers of the electricity grid. Electric vehicles, for example, congest the grid and therefore system operators will have to invest in the grid. The system operators will have to recover these costs from consumers through a network tariff system. The current tariff system uniformly distributes the costs for all households without making a distinction between heavy and light consumers. This means that consumers that cause extra costs for the system operators pay the same tariff as consumers that cause less costs. This was not a problem in the past because the differences in loads were small and inconsequential. This leads to an outdated network tariff system and causes unfairness for consumers. The system operators (Netbeheer Nederland) in the Netherlands luckily also recognize the seriousness of unfairness and therefore they initiated a multi-actor decision-making process with the goal of introducing a new network tariff system for small consumers in the upcoming years. This will be done in collaboration with a lot of stakeholders in the energy sector. The government (Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, ACM), the energy suppliers (E-NL, Vattenfall, Eneco, Essent, Engie, Greenchoice), consumer organizations (Vereniging eigen huis, Consumentenbond, Aedes) and other stakeholders are involved.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-16","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Zatarain Salazar, J. (mentor); Storm, S.T.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Humanity faces the unprecedented global challenge of climate change. The sheer complexity and uncertainty of this problem renders mere intuitive reasoning insufficient. To aid global climate negotiations, Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are used to analyze the interplay between climate and the economy. More specifically, IAMs account for how greenhouse gas emissions affect climate change, how climate change affects economic production, and how economic production affects GHG emissions. We can use IAMs to project trends in emissions and gross domestic product, assess the costs and benefits of climate policies, and estimate the social carbon cost required to achieve stated emissions reduction targets. Although IAMs are central to informing decision-making to avoid catastrophic consequences, policy recommendations resulting from IAMs commonly prompt a very heterogeneous distribution of risks and benefits across the globe. During the recent 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), it became clear that equity is a central issue in the climate action debate. Emerging economies consider currently suggested abatement policies unjust in light of the historical CO2 generation of high-income countries and the strongly increasing need for energy in low-income countries. The term double inequality has been coined to describe the inverse relationship between the distributions of risks and responsibilities. In fact, the regions that are the least responsible for historical and mostly current CO2 emissions around the world, exhibit the highest degree of vulnerability to climate damages. In order to enable international cooperation and have a shot at meeting the Paris Agreement target, we require policies that promote more equitable mitigation pathways. Equity is therefore an eminently pressing topic, yet most IAM studies largely neglect it due to the implicit use of a utilitarian social welfare function that aggregates risks and benefits over space and time, thus losing sight of distributional consequences. <br/><br/>In order to account for distributional justice, we transform the RICE model into a simulation model and embed it in a many-objective simulation-optimization setup such that we can find Pareto-optimal climate mitigation pathways for different problem formulations. Next to using four ethical premises (rooted in utilitarianism, sufficientarianism, egalitarianism, and prioritarianism), we also direct particular attention to the disaggregation of utility and disutility within each of these ethical premises. The reason for this disaggregation is based on the incommensurability of these two. Usually, IAMs maximize aggregate variables such as welfare. If we also consider the minimization of welfare loss, which is based on economic damages as one of the objectives, we can enable a potentially fairer distribution of not only consumption but economic damages. We argue that we can find climate justice behind the veil of aggregation. What we mean by this is that more equitable policy recommendations are obscured and lie hidden behind a bulwark of highly aggregated variables. If we look beyond this obstruction by the means of disaggregation, we are better equipped to find climate justice. In order to get to the bottom of this, we ask the following question: <br/><br/>How are Pareto-optimal climate abatement pathways affected by the disaggregation of utility and disutility in alternative ethical problem formulations when using an integrated assessment model under deep uncertainty?<br/><br/>To answer this question, we use a framework that is called multi-scenario multi-objective robust decision-making. For each of the eight problem formulations (4 ethical premises x 2 levels of aggregation), we use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find Pareto-optimal policies. We reevaluate their performances under uncertainty by comparing their climate abatement pathways across the problem formulations. On a high-level, we can summarize our key findings as:<br/><br/> - dominance of aggregation levels over ethical premises<br/> - correlation between low welfare and high welfare loss<br/> - general dominance of egalitarian aggregated Pareto-optimal policies<br/> - shared misery via egalitarian disaggregated Pareto-optimal policies<br/><br/>The effect of disaggregating utility and disutility is stronger than originally expected. Using disaggregated problem formulations yields substantially different pathways even within the same ethical premise. These results are promising as we could transfer these insights to other more complex IAMs such as IMAGE and MESSAGE. Overall, this could be also good news for the equity debate. Using alternative ethical premises and disaggregating incommensurate objectives such as utility and disutility can offer alternative policy recommendations and resulting climate abatement pathways which could in turn enable more equity. What we likely need now, is a stronger dialogue between the modelers and policy analysts on the one side and the stakeholders and decision-makers on the other side. The latter ones should not just blindly trust in the magical outputs of a model but they need to be involved to decide what problem formulations we need to use as there is no correct way to frame a complex real-world problem. As unmitigated climate damages exhibit an independent impact on a region's well-being, we could render IAMs more useful for climate policy if we a) acknowledge that the classical notion of welfare is obsolete, b) use a multi-objective approach, and c) let the decision-makers decide how they want to trade-off the various objectives in post. In this manner, we could use IAMs to advance into the direction of enabling a transition of more climate justice.<br","integrated assessment modelling; deep uncertainty; Distributive Justice; disaggregation; RICE; Climate change","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/max-reddel/PyRICE_2022 Associated GitHub repository","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Silicon carbide (SiC) production is such an EII, though it has not yet received much attention in systemic research. This thesis attempts to fill this gap by studying how SiC flows through the global economy. The objectives are to describe the SiC supply chain, quantify its flows and analyse the supply chain’s resilience. Findings: The global SiC production capacity constitutes 1 000 000 t per year. With 55.34% the Asia Pacific region is the biggest producer, followed by Europe with 32.7%, rest of world with 7.96% and North America with 4%. In order of quantity, abrasives, metallurgy, refractories, technical ceramics, other industrial uses, semiconductors and jewellery are the main applications of SiC. Around 5% of the material is recycled (USGS, 2021). High energy requirements in SiC production, as well as strict emission regulations are identified as the main supply risks. Substitution, use reduction, recycling and stockpiling can only minimally absorb supply disturbances at their current state. However, recycling is currently a popular topic in the industry and under development. In the mid-term, recycling activities might become a way to increase supply chain resilience. Another strategy that could lower pressure on the supply chain is using SiC production to balance the energy grid. That is, to produce when there is an oversupply of energy and to halt production when there is a shortcoming. Implications: This thesis shows that sustainability efforts in the SiC industry are not only environmentally desirable, but might also add to its supply chain’s resilience. The case of SiC shows that small EIIs that have so far not received much attention can offer high returns in terms of knowledge gained.","Material Flow Analysis; Supply Chain Resilience; silicon carbide; Energy-intensive industries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-31","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Particularly in Amsterdam, participation with regards to regeneration projects is stimulated by the city government. Although the literature shows that not all such participatory processes are of value to citizens, there is a lack of research on how value can be created for those participating through the process of citizen participation. This thesis aims to (1) develop a theoretical understanding of the values that can be created for citizens through citizen participation, and (2) identify whether and how these values of participation are created for citizens in a real-life case of citizen participation in urban regeneration in Amsterdam. Through a review of urban planning literature, four values that can be created for citizens through citizen participation are found, namely: “power and empowerment”, “social cohesion and inclusion”, “social justice and equity”, and “democratic citizenship and skills”. To explore the importance of these values for citizens at the individual level, they are studied through the lens of the basic personal values as defined by social psychologist Schwartz (2012).<br/><br/>Using case study research on the participatory process during the regeneration of the Lodewijk van Deysselbuurt in Amsterdam Nieuw-West, it is explored whether and how the values found in urban planning literature were created for residents. Since 2016 the Municipality of Amsterdam and housing association Rochdale have involved residents of the Lodewijk van Deysselbuurt in the making of regeneration plans for their neighborhood. Up until now (2022), this participatory process consisted of activities with different participants, and levels of participation ranging from informing, to consulting residents, to letting residents give advice on the plans. Furthermore, residents were involved through a neighborhood platform that looked at the regeneration plans at the neighborhood level and through residents’ committees that discussed the plans for each housing block. The findings of the case study suggest that through this participatory process the values of “social inclusion and cohesion” and “democratic citizenship and skills” were created for residents that participated. However, based on the results it is also suggested there was limited creation of the value of “power and empowerment” and that further research is necessary to explore whether the value of “social justice and inclusion” was created for residents of the Lodewijk van Deysselbuurt.","citizen participation; urban regeneration; value; urban planning; basic personal values","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

However, the limited deployment of them leads to the research gap that is addressed by the present research, which aims to answer ""how can a digital twin for space use support decision makers and users of hospital real estate"" and identify specifications for its development by healthcare organizations.<br/>The research approach is conducted by deploying a design science research framework. In this framework, a literature review is carried out first by analyzing academic publications in the topics of hospital real estate management, space use in hospital real estate, digital twins for space use and digital twins for hospital real estate. Then a case study is conducted in a healthcare organization, by analyzing the organizational characteristics, the real estate portfolio, the deployed information systems for space use and the building documentation databases. This is being done through a set of interviews with employees of the organization, together with a documentation analysis. Two lists of design and utilization principles are then extracted from the literature review and the case study analysis.<br/>The two sets of principles are utilized for the development of a conceptual design of a display of a digital twin for space use in hospitals. This display is based on a time frame window, a building orientation window, a user profile window, a building visualization window and a performance palettes window. The display is then assessed through evaluation interviews and the comprehensiveness of its design is validated. The interviewees further suggest utilization scenarios that they can perform with a similar tool.<br/>It is eventually concluded that a digital twin can be used by different stakeholder perspectives, by providing historical, real time or simulation information at a room, floor, building or campus scale resolution to support operational, tactical and strategic utilization processes.

On its own, the condition—increasingly prevalent among the elderly—is not life threatening, but it leads to an increased risk of stroke and heart failure. As of yet, there is no consensus on the physiological mechanisms responsible for initiating and sustaining atrial fibrillation. A more detailed view of cardiac activity would improve understanding of the disease, making earlier diagnosis possible and improving options for treatment. <br/><br/>The contraction of the cardiac muscles is governed by electrical signals propagating through the tissue. Cardiac activity can be monitored with a high spatial resolution by measuring the electrical potential directly on the epicardium of the heart during open-heart surgery, using an array of closely spaced electrodes. From these electrograms, estimating the time of local activation of the cardiac tissue underneath each electrode provides a quantitative way of mapping the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation. Various methods exist to estimate the activation times, but the complex signals that are typical of atrial fibrillation make it difficult to obtain accurate results. This thesis proposes combining two existing methods for estimating the local activation times. Based on a model of the electrogram as a spatial convolution of local transmembrane currents, an inverse problem is formulated and solved, resulting in a less opaque view of the cardiac activity at the electrode locations by attenuating distant disturbances and emphasizing local activity. The deconvolution output is fed to the second step, where cross-correlating certain pairs of signals gives an estimate for the mutual time delay in local activation. A graph representation of the electrode array is used to define neighbor order and decide which signal pairs are correlated. The set of pairwise time delays this produces is then converted to an estimate for the local activation times, using a least-squares estimator. <br/><br/>The proposed method is evaluated using different simulated cardiac settings. In a setting with one stimulation source, earlier results of the deconvolution and cross-correlation methods are confirmed, and the proposed method is seen to produce a slightly lower mean error than reference methods. In the higher-complexity triple-source setting, the latter effect is again visible. Reinforced by the performance of the different methods in increasingly noisy settings, the main merits of the proposed method for the estimation of local activation times can be said to be found in the form of increased consistency, not significantly improving on the accuracy of existing methods.","atrial fibrillation; activation times; inverse problem; deconvolution; cross-correlation; electrograms; epicardial mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

(mentor); Oliehoek, F.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Various pathologies can occur when independent learners are used in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. One such pathology is Relative Overgeneralisation, which manifests when a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium in the joint action space of a problem is preferred over an optimal Equilibrium. Approaches exist to combat relative overgeneralisation in Q-Learning problems, yet many approaches do not scale well with the state space or joint action space, are hard to adapt or configure, or are not applicable in partially observable environments.<br/><br/>In this work, we introduce Deep Maximum Q-Learning (DMQL), a methodology combining Deep Recurrent Q-Networks [Hausknecht &amp; Stone, 2015] and the optimistic assumption which can be found in Distributed Q-Learning [Lauer &amp; Riedmiller, 2000]. DMQL is a maximum-based learning technique which can be scheduled to transition to an average-based learner (or any other arbitrary type of learner), which can utilise independent learners without communication. DMQL is designed to be relatively intuitive and easy to adapt and configure and is able to utilise notions of similarity to provide solutions in large and continuous state spaces. <br/><br/>DMQL clusters similar histories by mapping them to the same hash based on a subset of the information contained within them, such as the current observation, or other related available information sources, such as state information. Using these hashes, DMQL constructs a hash-action pseudo-maximum Q-value estimation dictionary which is updated at every gradient update step. A dictionary value degradation technique ensures stability by preventing overestimations from being retained in the dictionary by decaying them after they have been encountered. This way, optimism is introduced, and relative overgeneralisation is prevented without using true maximums of past Q-value estimates, as these are not guaranteed to be indicative of the real optimal Q-values. Contrasting similar deep learning methodologies [Palmer et al., 2017], DMQL augments Deep Q-Network targets through value replacement instead of value discardment, potentially leading to improved efficiency. In addition, DMQL can be adapted to be utilised as a maximisation-based step in the greater learning process of other deep learning algorithms.<br/><br/>Our experimental results indicate that DMQL is a successful extension of Distributed Q-learning, which can be used in small environments even without the usage of similarity. Using similarity, however, grants us the ability to learn in increasingly large and complex environments. Interestingly, various problems exist within the process of developing a suitable manner of incorporating similarity into hashes. We speculate on how these problems can be prevented or circumvented, and our experiments validate our circumvention methods. Lastly, our experiments show that DMQL can successfully be applied to combat relative overgeneralisation in partially observable environments as well.","Optimism; Relative overgeneralisation; Similarity; Deep Learning; Deep Q-Learning; Deep Q-Network; Partial Observability; Recurrent Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Artificial Intelligence Technology","",""

By introducing perforations near the vicinity of the splash zone the wave loads on the monopile can be mitigated and the fatigue damage reduced, which is the main advantage jackets have over monopiles. Furthermore, perforated monopiles would be easier to install and manufacture compared to jacket structures, which has the potential to reduce the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) considerably. Perforated monopiles also have the benefit of reduced (local) scour, reduced corrosion damage and providing a habitat for marine life.<br/><br/>To optimize the design of perforated monopiles fast novel surrogate models are needed to determine the (wave) load reduction by the introduction of perforations on the monopile. As traditional (full) order Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are slow and expensive to evaluate. Using a surrogate model a wider range of geometries can be used in the early design optimization steps. Promising designs can then be further evaluated using full models.<br/><br/>This thesis develops a surrogate model for the characterization of the (hydrodynamic) loads on perforated monopiles using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). A dataset is created of 15,561 samples, which considers geometries of varying number of perforations, porosity and ‘angle of attacks’. A Finite Element Method (FEM) CFD model is made in Gridap for a ‘creeping flow’ to determine the flow fields. And determines a load Reduction Factor (RF) by the introduction of perforations. Furthermore, using a Signed Distance Function (SDF) a representation of the geometry is made for use in the CNN model.<br/><br/>Using PyTorch a CNN model is used to predict the RF for a certain input. The model combines multiple convolutional layers with an optional regression head (with linear layers). Five different models are created. Three for representing the geometry by using the SDF, decomposing the SDF in its x and y distance components and the binary representation. Furthermore, two models combine the SDF or distance components with the flow fields from the CFD model.<br/><br/>The results show that a speedup of 386 times is achieved by using the surrogate model, showing the main benefit of using a surrogate model. This is likely to improve considerably in further research when turbulence is taken into account. Furthermore, each of the five models show a good accuracy in predicting the RF. A general trend is observed that the more information is provided in the input to the CNN model the better the accuracy tends to be. The combination of implicit representation of the geometry by using distance components with the CFD flow fields shows the best accuracy with an expected maximum relative error rate of 0.94% within the parametric space of the dataset.<br","Monopiles; Perforation; Machine learning; Surrogate modeling; Renewable energy; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To greatly reduce material wastage, the use of smaller specimens has been explored to characterize the mechanical properties of the material. <br/><br/>This study aims to analyze the influence of test specimen size on the near threshold fatigue properties of Ti-6Al-4V manufactured by conventional processes and Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) . Two different specimen sizes were utilized, the standard size and the sub-sized specimens. The effect of two heat treatments, stress relief (SR) and annealing (AN) on the LPBF material on the fatigue properties was also studied. In addition, the effect of anisotropy on the fatigue threshold value was also touched upon in this study. A fatigue test setup for the sub-sized samples was designed and a constant Kmax test was employed to characterize the threshold properties. The direct current potential drop (DCPD) method was employed to measure the crack length during the test. <br/><br/>The fatigue threshold of the SR microstructure did not show any effect due to sample size. This was attributed to the partly intergranular crack propagation observed playing a prominent role in the fatigue threshold. The conventional and annealed samples witnessed a drop in threshold values of about 0.5 MPa√m when sub-sized samples were used. It was observed that the sub-sized samples had a greater crack depth at threshold leading to increased constraint at the crack tip and hence smaller degree of crack closure explaining the drop in threshold values. <br/><br/>The current study has thus established successfully the feasibility of using sub-sized specimens to characterize the near threshold fatigue properties of conventionally and additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V.<br","Ti-6Al-4V; Fatigue; Additive manufacturing; sub-sized samples","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-29","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Literature shows that elbow muscles and the osseous articulation can lower the load imposed to the UCL by countering the external valgus moment. As the contribution of the individual elbow muscles and the osseous articulation to the UCL load during pitching remains unclear, this study aims to identify the muscles capable of (un)loading the UCL during baseball pitching. Muscle-driven simulations for ten baseball pitches were generated using a musculoskeletal (MSK) model of the upper extremity. The simulations were run twice: ones without any constrictions to the model and ones with the wrist motion locked. The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) was identified as biggest contributors to the internal muscle moment during the wrist-included simulations. The external valgus torque was 10% countered by the elbow muscles, 59% by the osseous articulation and 31% by the UCL. The UCL had to resist a moment of 25.6 Nm. During the wrist-excluded simulations, the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and was identified as biggest contributors to the internal muscle moment. The external valgus torque was 10% countered by the elbow muscles, 42% by the osseous articulation and 48% by the UCL, resulting in a UCL moment of 39.4 Nm. Further research should focus on the influence of wrist and finger motion on UCL load and concentrate more on the osseous articulation as main elbow stabilizer during pitching.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Five categories were made to test on what scale the classification is possible. The categories consisted of all 17 throw types, shots versus passes, wind up type, a 7-class category and an intensity-based category. Even though multiple algorithms were tested, for all categories Support Vector Machines gave the highest F1-score and accuracy and was therefore the best fit.

However, they are continuously exposed to vibrations from the vehicle. Madymo active human models (AHM) can be used for comfort analysis and to learn how vibrations influence the human body in several aspects. However, existing AHM are very time-consuming due to their complexity, and the correspondence with human comfort data is only reasonable. In order to more effectively analyze motion comfort, a computationally efficient simplified human model (SHM) is developed and validated. The human body model has 36 degrees of freedom (DoF) considering the following segments: pelvis, two thighs, two lower legs, two feet, lower torso, upper torso and head. The model is validated in fore-aft, lateral and vertical vibrations. The model's postural stabilization parameters are tuned manually, by gradient search and grid search in sequence. Manually tuning gives a group of initial values of parameters for further optimization. According to the results, failure of the gradient search illustrates that this optimization problem is non-smooth. At the same time, grid search gives a relatively better result but also shows that the current cost function does not perfectly represent a good fit and needs improvement. A comparison between AHM and the SHM shows that the SHM has a similar or even better fit for most signals while being a largest factor 116 faster. A comparison of parameters between SHM and multibody human models in the literature shows that the structure of models affects the values of the same parameters. A comparison of different time steps illustrates that shorter time step does not necessarily give higher accuracy for this SHM.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the last decades there has been an increasing interest in computing the local strain at the atomic scale of materials. By knowing aspects of the local strain in a lattice, one has information about measurements of distortions of lattice parameters concerning shifts, deformations and defects computed with respect to a smooth, defect-free reference region. Multiple methods have been implemented so far in order to map the strain of two-dimensional lattice patterns, which are obtained through means of a High Resolution Electron Microscope (HRTEM). The functioning of a HRTEM is based on the same principles as an optical microscope, but it uses a beam of electrons instead of visible light. One of the computational methods which then processes the obtained two-dimensional images is called the Geometrical Phase Analysis (GPA) and makes use of a very important mathematical tool, the Fourier transform. The GPA method lies at the center of this project and consists of several steps. First, the Fourier transform of the lattice image is plotted and two Bragg peaks corresponding to two linearly independent frequency vectors in the power spectrum are chosen. Next, a mask is applied around these peaks, separately. In my project I have chosen to apply the Hann smoothing filter. Then, the inverse Fourier transform is applied to the masked image and the phase (also called the raw phase) is plotted. The next step is to compute the reduced phase, which is defined at a local pixel as being the raw phase from which the following product is subtracted: 2&#x1d70b; ⃗&#x1d454; ⋅ ⃗&#x1d45f;, where ⃗&#x1d45f; is the vector corresponding to a pixel in the real space and ⃗&#x1d454; the frequency vector corresponding to the Bragg peak around which one has applied the mask. At this point the reference region is computed by choosing a smooth, homogeneous area in the reduced phase image. In order to obtain the strain, one needs an optimal frequency vector ⃗&#x1d454; defined at every pixel of lattice. In order to do so, a minimization process defined in the context of a computer algorithm in the programming language Python has been implemented. These computations should lead to obtaining the lattice strain, which is calculated by taking the symmetric part of the derivation of the displacement obtained from the two linearly independent Fourier components, which is in turn called the distortion. The antisymmetric part of the distortion is the rotation component and serves as a check for the correctness of the computational method. The goal of my project is not only to provide a solid theoretical background for the GPA method and to discuss the strain at atomic level in several lattice patterns, but to also provide a rigorous computer algorithm that makes these computations reality. This algorithm, opposed to pre-existing software, facilitates the reader’s process immensely by the large amount of detail which is given at every step, detail which easily motivates and supports the reader in potential side-steps they would want to take in order to make the method their own.","strain in lattices; geometrical phase analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

It is targeted toward (potential) value creators with an existing motivation to create solutions for textile waste. The way of communicating information was built upon learnings from card sorting activities and the Three Horizons framework. Evaluation with the potential audience showed that the concept offered a valuable knowledge foundation in developing textile waste solutions.

It is essential for these products to be predictable and reliable. The presence of carbide banding in 51CrV4 steel can be detrimental to this predictable and reliable behavior. Therefore, in this research, the formation of carbide-banded microstructure in 51CrV4 steel will be investigated. The bending stresses undergone by trailing arms make it crucial to understand the relationship between surface depth and carbide band formation. Therefore, the goal of this research is to understand the relation between the surface depth and band formation in 51CrV4 steel and how banding differs among 51CrV4 steel from different manufacturers. This was done using a variety of testing methods which include microscopy, hardness, XRD, SEM, EDS and EPMA. These testing methods were used to understand the formation of carbide bands in 51CrV4 as well as the underlying physical properties that lead to the carbide band formation. Overall, a significant difference could be seen in the formation of carbide bands across the steel from different manufacturers. These differences in carbide banding properties could be clearly linked to the difference in the physical properties of the steels. The depth at which carbide band formation tends to start could be most clearly related to the micro-segregation peak concentration. Furthermore, the manner in which the carbide bands are built up along the surface depth could be most clearly related to the chromium concentration in the carbide banded regions. Finally, it was found that chromium is expected to be the primary carbide former in this steel as the formation of carbide bands is closely and consistently related to an increased presence of chromium.","band-structure; carbides; 51CrV4; micro-segregation; spring steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

The unpredictable PV generation deteriorates the system’s reliability and introduces instability. Thus, we develop appropriate formulations to define a limit on exports from residential PV owners to the grid. For this purpose, we employ Distribunally Robust Chance Constraint Programming (DRCCP), as a method that can handle constraints that depend on the uncertain PV generation and<br/>residential demand. We capture the distributional uncertainties with an ambiguity set and we utilize the Wasserstein metric to parameterize the range of this set. <br/>We divide the thesis into two case studies. In the first case study, we perform the DRCCP optimization with only few recorded data. We evaluate the results of our algorithm in a dataset of 500 days of recorded data and we achieve to reduce significantly the overvoltage instances. We tune the DRCCP in a way that we achieve at least 95% satisfaction of constraints that emerge from the DRCCP, avoiding overconservative solutions and high generation cuts that<br/>could harm the PV owners. <br/>In the second case study, we intend to exploit plenty of historical data, but the computational burden hinders us from using them in the DRCCP. Therefore, we employ Wasserstein Barycenters, and we utilize the Wasserstein distance in order to cluster the data. With Wasserstein Barycenters we reduce significantly the running time and we provide an efficient and robust output, for at least 95% satisfaction of the model’s constraints.","Data-Driven; OPF; DRCCP; Wasserstein metric; Wasserstein Barycenters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Active Vibration Control (AVC) methods have been effectively used to attenuate vibrations and increase the bandwidth of these systems. With the miniaturisation of electronics, an increasing amount of sensor and actuator pairs can be used for AVC applications. Not only does this allow for higher active damping, it also grants more flexibility in terms of control. This trend has led to the study of robotic metamaterials and meta-structures: large-scale engineered materials build out of a repeating pattern of unit cells, where each unit cell contains a sensor, actuator and sometimes even a computing unit. The optimal control architecture to use for these systems is a difficult dilemma, since decentralised and centralised control schemes both have fundamental trade-offs in terms of performance and scalability. In this paper we study distributed control, a promising middle-ground solution that is hardly used in AVC applications. We show with the use of LQR that a distributed control architecture can achieve optimal performance in the low-frequency range for robotic materials with relative measurements. Additionally, the actuators use lower maximum control forces and a distributed control architecture remains scalable for implementation in large-scale systems.

Traditional agriculture is steadily extended with and substituted by crop growing in greenhouses, which has better yield, more resistance against weather extremes, and overall more control over the growing parameters than regular agriculture. Greenhouses are traditionally controlled by expert growers, but currently there are not enough experienced growers in the world, and one grower can only handle a limited number of greenhouses. Autonomous greenhouse control solves this problem by taking over the task of defining setpoints for the low-level climate controllers, so that a full crop cycle can be managed with little effort from the grower’s part. Autonomous climate control in greenhouses can be extended by automatic irrigation, which reduces the workload manual calculation of irrigation decisions puts on the growers. Furthermore, it has the possibility of providing better yield than manual control during a crop cycle while reducing the water usage. This thesis introduces a new predictive irrigation control approach, which uses forecast weather data and climate predictions to create irrigation decisions with the use of a Mixed Logical Dynamical (MLD) Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The behaviour of the controller can be changed through costs and constraints, which can be defined according to the need of greenhouse growers. The water balance model, constituting from a simple Plant Water Uptake (PWU) model from literature as well as a novel drain model, is used to predict the water content of the growing substrate accurately for 24 hours ahead. The MLD MPC exploits the structure of nonlinearities inside the water balance model to create a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimal control problem, which can be solved using efficient algorithms with guarantee on optimality. The validation results on data of multiple greenhouses show, that the created algorithm can be generalized with little effort. The effectiveness of the control algorithm in open-loop was inspected through simulations.","greenhouse; irrigation control; Mixed Logical Dynamical Model; MLD; predictive controller; MPC; drain model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In order to maximize the dynamic performance, multiple implementations are analyzed and their drawbacks are presented. Adaptive biasing has been implemented in order to improve the slew rate at the gate of the pass transistor and to increase the voltage loop gain bandwidth. The current loop is stabilized by means of bandwidth enhancement resistors, reaching a unity gain frequency of over 500MHz at maximum load current condition.<br/><br/>The linear voltage regulator occupies an area of 0.0078 mm2, consumes a quiescent current of 8.5µA and has a current capability of 10 mA. The circuit operates at supply levels varying between 7 to 18V, provides an output regulated voltage of 1.8V and is scalable in terms of the load capacitance and the load current. This design achieves a FOM of 0.613ps and is comparable to state-of-the-art designs.","Analog integrated circuit design; Linear Voltage Regulator; Capacitorless; Compact; Scalable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The olive industries, especially in the Mediterranean countries are known to produce a significant amount of residues such as crude olive pomace (COP) and olive tree pruning waste (OTPW) which can lead to various environmental and societal issues if not treated or further utilized (Garcìa Martìn et al., 2020). Considering the fact that not all olive oil industries make use of these olive residues (COP and OTPW) for further processing, they seem to be a promising candidate to produce renewable energy due to their bioenergy potential and physicochemical properties. These residues could be valorized to produce liquid biofuels which would help creating a circular economy. This work aims to expand the current state-of-art of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of olive residues such as COP and OTPW, which will contribute towards the profitability and sustainability of olive oil industries. This work will also serve as a basis to future studies such as development of a continuous process to support the high commercial demand of the liquid biofuel and carrying out a techno-economic assessment of the HTL process of COP and OTPW at this scale.<br/><br/>Due to the characteristics of the olive residues, especially their high moisture content and organic compounds (Ribeiro et al., 2020), the use of HTL has been proposed for the development of the thermochemical conversion process for bio-oil production. So far, only non-catalytic HTL processes have been investigated in batch scale laboratory setups. Thus, the main novelty of this work is that the effects of catalyst dosage (0 - 10 wt.%) along with reaction temperature (250 - 340 °C) and residence time (5 - 60 min) using a central composite design of experiments has been evaluated. The bio-oil and biochar fractions resulting from HTL were characterized by elemental analysis, bomb calorimetry, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy coupled with Energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From the experiments, it was proven that the production of liquid biofuels from olive residue biomass from Spain is possible under both, catalytic and non-catalytic routes. By implementing the central composite design experimental campaign, a set of mathematical models were developed for predicting the mass yields of the bio-oil, biochar, aqueous, and gas phase produced under combinations of the evaluated process variables. <br/><br/>The main finding of this work is that by using a catalyst, significantly higher mass yields of bio-oil were achieved with lower operational conditions when compared with the existing literature. The maximum bio-oil yield was found out to be 56.0% wt. on treating COP at 330°C for 60 minutes and 10 wt. % catalyst whereas for OTPW, the maximum bio-oil yield was found out to be 56.3% wt. at 330 °C for 30 minutes and 7.5 wt. % catalyst. The bio-oil produced under these conditions showed an average energy content of 23.21 MJ/kg. The highest high heating value (HHV) of 32.09 MJ/kg was obtained under non-catalytic HTL route at 340 °C and 15 minutes. The determination of the energy content (HHV) of the bio-oil fractions showed that there is a potential trade-off between the respective mass yield and HHV when using the catalyst.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Kindt, Peter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The widespread concerns about climate change, as well as the major enabling factors for the transition that are required to guarantee its control, necessitate research and a tool that can provide insight into the future of copper mining.The world's copper supply is primarily concentrated in a few producing locations: Chile, Peru, Democratic Republic of the Congo, China, and Zambia. More than 50% of the supply of this metal is produced in locations with high water stress. This is a concerning issue as the process to produce copper is particularly water-intensive. Existing physical risks such as landslides, floods, fires, and dangerous amounts of heat stress are also common and so are researched in this thesis.Policy makers, governments, society, banks, and investors are monitoring the impact of climate risks on this industry. Therefore a tool to evaluate the risks on copper mining to allow the stakeholders to assess exposure to climate change has been developed in this thesis. To accurately analyse the future supply of copper, this tool specifically stress tests different standardized NGFS climate scenarios for years 2030 and 2050 for copper mines throughout the globe.The simulation revealed that climate risks are a systematic risk for copper mining companies, with roughly a 50\% of the supply being at high risk. Moreover, the findings suggest that this commodity is rather more vulnerable to transition risks than to physical risks, mainly due to the price of carbon. Furthermore, major producers in Chile and Peru must turn to seawater desalination and this will significantly raise operational costs. In addition, there are concerns over a possible labour migration to regions with food security issues which could jeopardize the skilled mining workforce, more research into this is required. The findings also indicate that countries previously regarded as unattractive locations for investment, such as Zambia and the DRC, may soon rank among the major producing nations with the lowest climatic risk exposure and the lowest industry costs. However, these ratings may be offset by these countries' higher political risks. Climate change will also affect demand. Copper is a key component of the carbon-neutral transition as numerous significant renewable technologies depend on this raw material. Furthermore, conventional copper-intensive applications such as electrical networks will also expand over the next few decades. Although investments have been pledged, it is anticipated that these will fall short of what is required to satisfy the increasing demand. The developed model is static and reflects the issue that mines would face if they kept business as usual. This provides insights on the size of effort required by miners to overcome climate risks as well as to expose how vulnerable this commodity currently is. The model has the potential to be scaled and adapted to other commodities and to other industries. Due to its modular structure assumptions and parameters can be easily updated providing versatility and robustness.","Copper; Climate risk; Stress-test; Climate scenarios; Climate change; Mining; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

For this, interviews were held and an expert panel was organized. <br/><br/>It was found that uncertainty is an unavoidable element of project management. It is a lack of knowledge about something and its probability of occurrence and potential outcome are usually unquantifiable and immeasurable. Uncertainty is a dynamic concept of which the magnitude decreases over time as more information becomes available. Its presence complicates the management of projects as this means choices need to be made without all relevant information. Literature further showed that uncertainty management consists of different core elements: identification, classification and the act of dealing with uncertainties.<br/><br/>The interviews showed that currently uncertainties are not purposely handled. Based on examples and context, it could however be concluded that elements of uncertainty management are subconsciously applied. Unknowingly in the sense that they are often not used to tackle uncertainties specifically, but risks instead. The empirical study also aimed to identify the differences between the conventional energy industry and the energy transition industry. This was done to determine whether these differences would lead to necessary adaptations in the project management approach.<br/><br/>The final conclusion of the research is that first and foremost, the management approach should be complemented with an uncertainty management plan that extends current risk management practices. The management of uncertainties should include an identification and classification procedure before deciding on the way of dealing with uncertainties, accompanied by an appropriate response. As uncertainty develops over time, monitoring of uncertainties should be done on a regular basis throughout the duration of a project. The overall management approach thus requires a flexible attitude so that changes in the management process of a project can be made if deemed suitable or necessary.<br","Uncertainty; Uncertainty management; Risk and uncertainty; Complexity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Understanding the geomechanical behavior of these reservoirs under different storage conditions, i.e., storage frequency and fluid pressure, is key in defining their capacity and effective lifetime. This thesis work presents a rigorous analysis performed on sandstones to unravel their geomechanical response under cyclic loading. This study includes, importantly, both experimental and numerical investigations under several conditions which are relevant to UES. The rock response was studied considering cyclic stress states above and below the onset of dilatant cracking, under different frequencies and amplitudes. Within the number of cycles studied, measurements of axial strains and acoustic emissions indicated that inelastic strains accumulated cycle after cycle following an exponentially decreasing rate. Five types of deformations were interpreted: elastic, plastic, viscoelastic, cyclic-plastic and brittle creep. Based on these novel experimental results and observations, Nishihara's constitutive model was used for simulating viscoelastic and brittle creep deformations, while dilatant plastic strains were modeled using a Hardening-Softening model. Finally, an extension of the Modified Cam-Clay model was proposed to account for cyclic-plastic compaction. This approach can be extended and improved to study cyclic sandstone deformation's implications on subsidence, fault reactivation and cap rock flexure, among other physical phenomena impacting a reservoir's storage capacity.","Cyclic loading; Underground energy storage; Sandstone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

These refer to ‘smart-,’ ‘intelligent-,’ or ‘assistive-’ built environments including homes, schools, offices, museums, hospitals, libraries, stores, labs, prisons, warehouses, transport hubs, airports, parks, cities, etc. AmIE are often confused with (or described interchangeably as) ‘ubiquitous-,’ ‘pervasive computing,’ ‘mobile computing,’ or ‘spatial computing;’ as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and building automation including HVAC automation. While AmIE comprise the aforementioned technologies, they specifically describe the paradigm in which these and other technologies (namely sensors, actuators, and processors) are outfitted in the built environment so that those places become sensitive and responsive to the presence, needs, wants, and preferences of their inhabitants. Given that AmIEs require an array of computing technologies to function, they are necessarily complex design-engineering systems that rely on some level of algorithmic taxonification and, as such, are vulnerable to perpetuating harm in so far as biases have been codified therein. This research engages this complexity and risk of harm perpetuation by utilizing Minor Theory (also ‘minor theory’) as a theoretical lens through which to begin to move towards values aligned taxonification of the vast AmIE design space. Through a series of sequential literature reviews, this work offers a jumping off point for the continued taxonification of the AmIE design space by 1) introducing and applying minor theory as a method for data analysis and by 2) proposing three thematic vectors to consider in codifying an AmIE a design space: attunement, embodiment, and anti-fragility.","Ambient Intelligent Environments; Design Engineering; Minor Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (degree granting institution)","2022","To expand the economic operating range of offshore wind farms, less common but innovative solutions regarding support structures should be considered. To increase the popularity of gravity-based foundations (GBF) within the offshore wind industry, a better understanding of the hydrodynamics on GBFs, as well as an improved insight in the optimal design process for these structures is essential. Therefore, this thesis proposes a universal design methodology for the preliminary design of concrete GBFs for offshore wind turbines. The hydrodynamic GBF load model is based on a linear potential flow solution and was validated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data. It provides a sufficiently accurate and highly cost-efficient approximation of the wave loads during the conceptual design phase. For the detailed design phase, CFD is still required since it represents the state-of-the-art in wave load modelling. A simplified structural model was created to perform a natural frequency analysis to ensure structural integrity. Due to the high stiffness of GBFs, it is reasonably easy to design the first natural frequency of the structure to be within the desired soft-stiff region, and thus resonance is only a minor challenge. The main concerns for GBFs rather depend on the weight and cost-efficiency of manufacturing, transportation, and installation. The initial design is based on the environmental conditions, wind turbine data, and design guidelines. The complete model is verified using design checks based on industry standards, which ensures foundation stability for the design limit states. The requirements for foundation stability are often driven by the size and weight of the structure. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were performed with various design parameters to identify the main factors influencing the design. As designs often have multiple objectives, the optimal design depends on the objective considered and thereby numerous optimal designs may exist. For a GBF, these objectives are often related to weight, costs, or even both. Generally, a combination of design objectives with varying priorities should be considered. In addition, implementing optimization algorithms is recommended as manual preliminary design optimization is labor-intensive and has difficulties considering all the various design objectives. For future research, it is recommended to test the universality of this methodology. This can be done by modelling GBFs of varying shapes over a broad range of water depths, wave conditions, and design load conditions.","Preliminary Design; Conceptual Design; Methodology; Framework; Gravity-Based; Offshore Wind; Linear potential flow; OrcaFlex","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

These frameworks, however, fail to couple the kinetic solutions to the real-time equilibrium state of the system. Because of this, fundamental processes such as pH changes, NH4+ adsorption to the waste surface and changes to the fluid composition are often not (or inadequate) taken into account. In this study, we propose a degradation model that couples a kinetic solver to the chemical equilibrium software, ORCHESTRA. For this, a tool is developed that allows seamless operability between ORCHESTRA and the Python environment. The modelling framework is used to simulate the degradation of solid organic matter in a batch reactor following a simplified, but comprehensive, reaction network. Reaction rates are based on Monod kinetics that includes a wide variety of inhibition functions. The Freundlich equation is used to capture NH4+ adsorption to the waste surface. Results from various case studies show that the modelling framework is suitable for coupling real-time landfill chemistry to degradation kinetics. We found that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations play a dominant role in the presented model. While low NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+ </sup>concentrations limit biomass growth by substrate inhibition, high concentrations (&gt;0.002 4<br/>mol/L) affect the hydrolysis rate by toxicity inhibition. This translates to a model that is sensitive to a variety of input parameters such as the initial C/N ratio, the Kd (degree of adsorption) value and the initial organic fraction. A comparison with literature studies, however, implies that the model lacks fundamental processes such as gas and fluid transport or changes in volume and temperature. In addition to this, we discuss that the Freundlich isotherms may be inappropriate to capture adsorption in a coupled framework as no ion exchange is taken into account. Models that do so, such as the NICA-Donnan model, could improve the model results significantly.","Municipal Solid Waste treatment; Biogeochemical model; ORCHESTRA; ammonium adsorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/guidozeeuw/orchestra_python","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","CURE",""

Different from carbon capture and storage (CCS), in CCU the carbon captured from point sources or direct from air is processed to valuable carbon containing products. Several studies have been conducted on the technological and economic viability of CCU. However, no detailed process analyses with a system-level approach have been reported. Performance and challenges on pre-treatment and downstream processing of product streams have been ignored or generalized. This work aims to perform a detailed front-end techno-economic and environmental analysis on CCU pathways, focused on thermocatalysis (TC) and low- and high temperature electrolysis (LTE and HTE) of CO2. Identifying the most business critical pathways for valorization and utilization of CO2.<br/><br/>The scope of this study focuses on the identified single-step chemicals, that can directly be produced from CO2 without intermediates. KPI's selected for both conversion technologies are used to determine performance. A parametric analysis is carried out to evaluate the marginal costs of production per unit of weight for the selected chemicals. Based on costs, TRL and phase of product stream a selection of chemicals is made. Products identified as potential viable for industrial scale production and selected for further study are carbon monoxide (LTE, HTE and TC), formic acid (LTE and TC) and oxalic acid (LTE).<br/><br/>Conceptual process designs are made using reported system performance with all required units identified. A model is developed to simulate input- and product streams, scale size of units, calculate required utilities and costs of investment and operation. All processes are modulated according to generic battery limits, use cases and analysis methodology to provide an equal comparative study. It is found that state-of-the-art electrochemical processes are dominated by capital investment costs and are too immature for commercial application. For TC processes, production costs are primarily driven by H2 and CO2 costs. CO shows the most potential in this respect and is competitive with the market price. A sensitivity analysis is performed to gain understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters. Conversion pathways that could gain significant technical improvements are most sensitive to CAPEX varying and are less affected by variance in operating expenses. Main focus for investments on EC technologies should be current density. More mature technologies are most sensitive to varying the costs of feedstock and market parameters.<br/><br/>Opportunities for process improvements are evaluated by a performance analysis for current base-case versus the expected near-term and optimistic future scenarios. The parameters used for modulation vary according to the expected improvements in technical performance, economic performance and electricity price. Opportunities for EC processes lie within extensive R\&amp;D on conversion technology. For TC process, and on the long term for EC, opportunities lie within further development of green H2 production and CO2 capture. EC CCU pathways demonstrate great potential for future performance with potential reduction up to 71\% for near-term future. To quantify the environmental impact of the pathways and their improvements compared to conventional processes, a gate-to-gate life cycle assessment is performed. Switching to a more renewable energy mix offers serious improvements to minimize global warming impact. The most emission reducing pathways are CO TC and OA LTE which utilize more CO2 than is emitted during the process, -0.16 and -0.26 kg CO2-eq per kg of product.<br","carbon capture and utilization; CO2; CO2 Conversion; Techno-economic analysis; Environmental impact; Electrochemical; Thermocatalytical; CCU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Essential to tracking in camera networks is camera calibration and, in particular extrinsic camera calibration. Extrinsic camera calibration incorporates the 3D position and orientation of the cameras in the camera network. Current methods for extrinsic calibration require special operators to place calibration objects in sight of all cameras in the network, which is impractical and limits the ease of tracking in camera networks. <br/>In this thesis, an automatic extrinsic calibration model is proposed to calibrate the extrinsic camera parameters from the image data of all cameras in a network. The proposed method utilizes deep learning algorithms for feature extraction and matching. The feature extraction step is a human-pose estimator, extracting the key points of humans such as joints, eyes, and feet. The matching algorithm is a re-ID algorithm using an affinity-based feature extractor. <br/>Two camera network datasets have been used to evaluate the proposed model. A four-camera fully overlapping dataset SALSA, and a more challenging seven-camera partially overlapping dataset WildTrack. The calibration accuracy of the model on both datasets is calculated by comparing the ground truth value with the calibrated extrinsic camera parameters. On dataset WildTrack, the model could calibrate three of the seven cameras, whereas the model had a near-perfect calibration on dataset SALSA. Dataset SALSA achieved a root mean squared error in translation of 0.02 meters and 0.0 radians in orientation, compared to the ground truth values. <br/>The final product of this research is an automated extrinsic camera calibration model that eases the camera calibration in camera networks. The proposed model could not calibrate all datasets, but the model provides a baseline upon which future research can be done.","Camera calibration; Human-pose estimation; Re-identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The focus of this research is on developing and optimizing a simple and industry-appealing fabrication process for high-eﬀiciency IBC-SHJ solar cells.<br/><br/>The first part of the project investigates the simple processing of IBC-SHJ solar cells featuring tunneling recombination junction (TRJ). The first tunneling IBC devices are fabricated successfully. However, shunting is observed from the J-V curves of fabricated devices, which can be related to the internal shunting of tunneling IBC architecture and high lateral conductivity of p-type nc-Si:H-based blanket layer. Hence, alternative contact stacks are designed for application in the previously developed flowchart with the aim to minimize the lateral conductivity of the blanket layer and keep the fabrication process simple. <br/><br/>The proposed hole collection contact stack is firstly implemented in the front junction (FJ) FBC solar cells. The FJ FBC devices reach Voc of 704 mV and FF of 79.29% . Rear junction (RJ) FBC solar cells are fabricated featuring a novel electron collection contact stack that is developed within this thesis. Voc of 715 mV and FF of 82.24% are obtained in RJ devices. The results of RJ FBC solar cells with a newly developed contact stack show excellent results in terms of FF, making it a promising candidate for further application in IBC devices. The introduction of the optimized device design enabled the successful fabrication of IBC solar cells with the simple process developed for tunneling IBC devices while ensuring no shunting occurs. Fabricated devices represent a proof-of-concept of the novel configuration, providing a promising starting point for future development.<br","Solar cells; IBC solar cells; silicon heterojunction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Joint Solar Program III",""

The rapid urbanization and population growth created an immense waste generation in the process, making it more difficult to completely manage the waste due to the amount and complexity of the waste composition. Indonesia is not excluded from the issue, where there is an absence of an effective waste management system in the country. Bali Province is a region where the primary economic source is tourism, and the development of tourism in the region is reflected in the increase in waste generation in the Province. The current waste management system in Bali could not follow the rate at which the waste is generated, therefore causing the waste to be mismanaged and losing its potential to be recovered. Bali still implements the conventional paradigm of the linear economy using take-make-dispose, where the materials are simply collected, transformed into products that are used, and discarded as waste. This system relies mainly on the usage of landfills. However, Bali is currently facing the issue of waste overflowing in landfills, and the landfills are on the verge of closing. As a solution to the old paradigm, Circular Economy (CE) is introduced where it can minimize resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage by slowing, closing, and narrowing the material and energy loops. To create a transition from linear to circular economy in Bali’s MSWM context, a systemic analysis based on a multi-dimensional approach is needed. Value Chain Analysis (VCA) is one way to explore strategic and misalignment within the chain to increase value and economic sustainability, and by integrating social and environmental aspects, a more sustainable competitive advantage can be reached...","Circular Economy; Municipal Solid Waste Management; Value Chain Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

At the same time, the application of reliability analysis in dealing with uncertainties (e.g. soil properties) is increasing rapidly. This could pose a time-wise problem for an FEM model since reliability analysis normally takes much more than only one realization (function call) of the model. It becomes a bigger problem when a design optimization process is taking place. More often than not, design optimization is performed by a ”trial-and-error” method in practice, which the process itself would even take longer just to give engineers the ”sense” of achieving an optimal design (in terms of safety and economy). Therefore, the actual optimality of the design is not systematically proven and quantified. This research proposes a novel reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) method by combining existing theories regarding active-learning Kriging-based Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) and (1+1)-Covariance Matrix Adaptation evolution scheme ((1+1)-CMA-ES). To achieve accuracy and efficiency, the method consists of four enrichment stages. These enrichment stages ensure the method accurately and efficiently predicts the optimal design combination by considering the reliability constraint. The chosen case study is the reinforcement design of the Starnmeer polder dyke in the Netherlands, which is simulated as an FEM model. Within a limited number of function calls, the proposed RBDO method could accurately predict the optimal dimensions of the dyke that delivers the targeted reliability index. The reliable performance of the proposed method is further demonstrated by solving three analytical optimization problems.","RBDO; Kriging; AK-MCS; MCS; (1+1)-CMA-ES; geotechnical reliability; FEM; dyke reinforcement; Geotechnical Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The equipment used by these mining operations has a nominally rated performance to achieve needed annual production. However, this nominally rated performance is not achieved during operations. This study assesses the underlying causes of reduced shovel production in a mining operation.<br/><br/>The following research questions will be answered in this study: What factors contribute to deviations from the predicted performance? What factors are the most significant? What is the effect of automated trucks on shovel productivity? Can a data-driven model be developed to predict the actual productivity of the shovel in the real world?<br/><br/>The underlying causes of reduced shovel production are assessed through a literature review and five case studies. The case studies consisted of three data analytical desk studies, interviews with industry professionals, and a mine visit to north Africa.<br/><br/>The literature review shows that the mining industry uses formulas to determine the theoretical production rates. The factors in the shovel production formula should be predicted with frequency distributions. Also, truck automation will increase trucking hours, impacting shovel productivity through truck exchange time. The first case study shows a sensitivity analysis of the shovel formula. This sensitivity analysis shows that the swell factor, density, bucket fill, efficiency, and cycle time have a more significant impact than truck exchange time, dumping of the first bucket, and the number of cycles. The second case study shows the underperformance of different electric rope shovel models in different mining operations. The third case study compares the theoretical shovel capacity with the total material moved for 16 years. This shovel capacity and total material ratio should be between 1-2.5 for a mining operation to be classified as above-average-in-class. The fourth case study shows the different factors influencing shovel productivity based on the interviewees' responses. The last case study shows the effects of operational decisions on a mining operation. The literature review and case studies are used to develop a flowchart regarding the factors influencing shovel productivity.<br/><br/>This flowchart was used to synthesise the results. The difference between theoretical and real-world production rates can be decreased when the frequency distributions are known for all the shovel production formula factors. This shovel production formula for annual production rate can be divided into three main pillars. These three pillars are the hourly production rate, use of availability, and mechanical availability. The pillars allow OEMs or mining companies to implement the correct improvement measures to improve shovel productivity. However, one solution for every mining operation will be impossible due to the uncertainty in the data and variability of each mining operation.<br/><br/>To conclude, the factors that contribute to deviations from the predicted performance are categorised as uncontrollable (weather and geographical location), direct (density and cycle time), and indirect (fragmentation and face dimensions), which all impact shovel productivity. The most significant factors are not found during the study, but solving underperformance in the direct factors will solve most of the problems. The effect of automated trucks on shovel productivity will result in additional trucking capacity, which will need to be absorbed by the shovel. Lastly, a data-driven model can be developed with access to all the data from a mining operation. However, this data is often not available to an OEM. Therefore, it is not advisable to develop such a model.","Mining shovels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

In this thesis we look into the quantum version of the familiar random walk, distinguishing between the discrete- and continuous-time quantum randomwalk. Some general properties of random walks are studied throughout this thesis. First we look at the behaviour of both the classical and the random walk on a simple 1-dimensional lattice. Then, to investigate the speed and efficiency of algorithms that use quantumwalks, we analyse quantumrandom walks in graphs, as graphs do a good job of representing the decision trees of algorithms. The graph we look at specifically is the ndimensional hypercube. The criterion we use to see how fast a quantumwalk can traverse certain types of graph is the hitting time. The hitting time is the expected amount of time a random walk takes to reach a certain vertex in a graph for the first time. Literature has shown that classical random walks have a hitting time that scales exponentially with the dimension n of the hypercube. We find that quantum random walks offer a significant speed-up to its classical counterpart. Generally they have a polynomial hitting time, that depends on the Hamming distance between the start and sink vertex. Furthermore we find that quantum walks can have interesting properties such as a non-unitary hitting probability, meaning the quantum walker will never visit the sink vertex. Finally we see that, in some simple, symmetric cases, the hitting time of the quantum walk even is sub-linear, scaling almost like a square root, rather than a polynomial.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

At the same time, building demolition generates large amounts of construction and demolition waste (CDW), primarily consisting of end-of-life (EOL) concrete, a significant waste flow occurring in Europe's construction sector. The potential to deal with waste management and the uprising demand for new concrete in construction lies within circular economy-based solutions applied throughout the building's lifecycle. Steering in this direction, the European Union is endorsing a circular economy strategy that aims to utilize EOL concrete derived from CDW to produce new concrete and thus minimize virgin material inputs. These efforts have not been translated to a uniform framework for Europe, where practices, regulations for waste management, and market acceptance for secondary raw materials differ among member countries. In this project, different types of pre-demolition audits, demolition, and waste processing methods for EOL concrete are compared, showcasing the status quo across the EU and the Dutch case study, which portrays innovations that can shape the future of concrete recycling. An integrated LCA and LCC framework is applied from the demolition stage to waste processing and the production of materials for new construction to capture potential environmental and economic benefits and drawbacks at the end-of-life stage (EOL) of the building. The results showcase the pivotal role of BIM-supported pre-demolition audits in combination with selective demolition with benefits that include lower quantity of generated waste allocated to treatment and more components available for reuse. Finally, LIBS, a quality assurance tool for recycled aggregates, shows great potential in supporting a market for secondary raw materials in Europe.","CDW; EOL concrete; circular economy; secondary raw materials; LIBS; selective demolition; pre-demolition audit; LCC; LCA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","ICEBERG",""

Therefore, monitoring it gives a good overview on the evolution of the disease. There are several imaging modalities to assess the ventilation and perfusion, but they either use ionizing radiation, are expensive, uncomfortable or pose the risk of allergic reactions. Fourier decomposition MRI is a radiation and contrast free technique to image the lungs that is also used while the patient can breathe freely. It is based on the separation of the ventilation and perfusion signals, according to their frequency.

The present study analysed different methods to extract the phase, to obtain the ventilation and perfusion maps and to threshold and detect the defects. It was found that the methods based on sine fitting and Morlet wavelet are the most promising, with the latter having the advantages of a variable window size and frequency. The most promising threshold for perfusion is the 75th percentile * 0.6 and for ventilation the 90th percentile * 0.4.

For long distances to shore, it is preferable to connect the wind farms to land by means of High-Voltage DC (HVDC) cables to reduce losses and costs. This currently poses challenges, as wind turbine generators produce variable-frequency low-voltage AC power, which needs to be converted to HVDC with heavy transformers in the wind turbine nacelle and large offshore substations. One proposed solution is to develop integrated drives which produce HVDC directly inside the nacelle, by segmenting the stator of a direct-drive generator. Each segment has its own dedicated Power Electronic (PE) converter, of which the DC output is connected in series.<br/><br/>This thesis studies one of the challenges of this Modular HVDC generator concept: the segmented stator generates additional vibrations in the structure, and will respond differently to the occurring forces than a stator without segmentation. The goal is to design a concept for the structure that holds the segments in place, while still allow individual modules to be replaced after failure.<br/><br/>As a first step, the machine design is updated taking into account saturation and design limits which were neglected in previous studies. For a 10 MW Direct-Drive generator with an output DC-link voltage of 100 kV, a 10 m diameter inner-rotor Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) with Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings (FSCW) is designed. It has 384 slots and 320 poles, and the stator is split in 16 segments. The design is verified with Finite-Element simulations in COMSOL.<br/><br/>Secondly, the electromagnetic effects of the flux barriers created by the insulated gaps between the segments are analyzed analytically and numerically. The analytical model of the magnetic fields and forces agrees well with the numerical simulations in COMSOL. The FSCW result in a broad spectrum of vibrations, including a strong slot harmonic caused by the open slots. Segmentation of the stator has two important consequences: the addition of radial harmonics with a low spatial order at multiples of the number of segments, called the segment harmonics, and an increase in the cogging<br/>torque. These effects are more pronounced in the numerical simulations than in the analytical model, due to the change of the magnetic flux distribution in the segmented stator, which is neglected in the analytical calculations. Furthermore, time harmonics in the current due to the PE converters are found to significantly increase the breathing mode and torque ripple.<br/>Thirdly, the mechanical response of two different design concepts has been analyzed by performing a modal analysis. The first design uses an interference fit, where the segments are pressed into the frame and held in position by friction. This design behaves similarly to a ring-shaped frame, and has the same eigenmodes at similar eigenfrequencies. The second design uses beams between the frame and stator to support the segments. In this case, the stiffness and structural integrity of the design is significantly reduced, leading to larger deflections and lower eigenfrequencies.<br/><br/>Combining the obtained forces and eigenmodes, it is concluded that the breathing mode, the segment harmonics and the slot harmonics cause the strongest vibrations. The amplitude of the forces causing the first two is low, but the mechanical stiffness of these modes is low and the excitation frequency is close to the eigenfrequency. The slot harmonic is mainly important due to the low spatial order and large amplitude of the force, caused by the combination of concentrated windings and open slots. The PE converter harmonics will not lead to a stronger breathing mode vibration due to the high switching frequency of the converters, but could create resonance of the slot harmonic.<br/><br/>Based on these results, both designs were found to be feasible from an electromechanical perspective, as long as care is taken to mitigate the vibrations caused by the segment harmonics, and resonance of the PE converter harmonics is prevented. Due to the uncertainty of the mechanical model, experimental validation of the eigenfrequencies and the vibration levels is recommended, which can be done by using modal analysis.","PMSG; Force harmonics; Wind Energy; Modularity; COMSOL; Power Electronics; HVDC; Fractional Slot Concentrated Windings; Eigenfrequencies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","ModHVDC",""

A better understanding of the efficiency, and thus the feasibility of this decentralised logistics method, contributes to a better understanding of the potential of these systems as alternatives to the current centrally organised system. The main research question is: To what extent can the efficiency of a decentralised dynamic parcel distribution method be improved by applying different heuristics and adapting the simulation environment with congestion and a mixed fleet? To answer this question, a review is made of existing literature on last-mile logistics, self-organisation in logistics and auction methods in logistics. The current model is evaluated, benchmarked and validated. Model improvements are defined and applied in an experimental setting using a small dataset, after which the extended model is applied to a real-scale case dataset based on 729 delivery addresses in Delft. The applied modification strategies are random insertion, parcel swapping and k-means clustering. To account for the behaviour of the model under different conditions, the method was tested for a heterogeneous fleet of vans and cargo bikes and different levels of congestion. In general, the heuristics were able to improve the performance of the model, but the improvements in travel distance were minimal. When the combination of the best performing heuristics is applied to the case data, a 4.6% improvement in vehicle travel distance can be achieved compared to the original method, but still with high computation times. Comparison with an external centrally organised OR solver shows that although the decentralised method can be improved, it does not perform well, as the OR solver can find a better solution in a fraction of the time needed for the improved decentralised auction method. This study provides a proof of concept of the method and a more efficient model has been constructed.

(graduation committee); Dijkstra, Ferdinand (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","class=""MsoNormal"">The expected growth of civil air traffic and the inclusion of advanced systems in the Royal Netherlands Air Force result in more demanding airspace requirements across all users, making this a scarce resource. To optimise its usage, military airspaces in Amsterdam Flight Information Region are used as Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA), which no longer considers airspace as entirely ‘civil’ or ‘military’, but as a continuum to be allocated temporarily according to user requirements. Given its importance for civil-military cooperation, FUA is at the core of the Dutch Airspace Redesign Programme, considering both a reorganisation of FUA structures and the plannability policies they are reserved with. In order to inform these decisions, this study analyses the effect of FUA availability and plannability on the fuel efficiency of civil commercial traffic. Historical traffic data from the Eurocontrol R&amp;D data archive is sampled for the month of March 2019 and used in three experiments. On the one hand, Experiment 1 investigates FUA availability by considering flights losing route efficiency due to FUA sectors and comparing them with Great Circle Route alternatives and similar flights historically transiting them. On the other hand, Experiment 2 considers flights making use of FUA sectors during times when these have been delegated to civil use to assess the effects of carrying a surplus fuel due to an insufficient airspace plannability. By proposing new plannability policies, the hypothetical reduction in fuel consumption as a result of not taking the surplus fuel is assessed. Lastly, Experiment 3 combines the benefits found in Experiment 1 with the plannability policies of Experiment 2 to determine the fuel benefits resulting from a tactical rerouting enabled by the new plannability concepts. A total of 1,548 simulations have been performed in the open source air traffic simulator BlueSky to compute the fuel efficiency metrics. The results suggest that making both the Alpha and Delta sectors completely available would result in a yearly reduction in fuel consumption of 70,198 and 100,022 tonnes, respectively; 8,908 and 13,301 of which would be saved solely by adopting a new plannability policy (corresponding to 28,060 and 41,898 tonnes of CO2). Finally, not carrying a surplus fuel due to this concept would contribute to an extra 270 and 394 tonnes of fuel consumption being reduced in 2019 (851 and 1,241 tonnes of CO2).  ","Flexible Use of Airspace; Direct Routing; Great Circle Route; Plannability; Fuel Efficiency; Airspace","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Although there is a common understanding that the use of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) is needed in our collective attempt to decarbonise society, the type of technology that we should deploy, and where is not so clear. Stakeholders from real-world projects use the outcomes from optimisation models to aid their decision-making process. One of such outcomes that decision-makers use is the price information of energy carriers in the required temporal and spatial resolution. In the current state, price information is embedded in the form of shadow prices within linear optimisation problems. As a result, price information is relatively easy to extract for conventional, power-sector focussed energy system models. However, when these energy system models are multi-carrier and sector-coupled in which energy carriers undergo several conversion stages, the extraction of price information becomes less trivial. Furthermore, even when price information is extracted in the form of shadow prices, they might not represent real-world price information. This master thesis research aims to develop a generally applicable price information generation method to extend the use of shadow-price based methods in conventional models to more complex multi-carrier fully sector-coupled models. The price information generation method is developed in Python which is tested within the Calliope modelling framework for a multi-carrier fully sector-coupled energy system. It does this by extracting the shadow prices from a linear optimisation problem of the North Sea Euro Calliope model which is adapted from the Euro-Calliope model. The shadow prices are then compared against current real-world prices for the energy carrier electricity. Results show that the shadow prices do not represent real-world prices accurately, however the use of shadow prices can be extended to understand trade-offs between different configurations of fully sector-coupled energy system models. A use case for the shadow prices has been conducted to analyse the price stability of Dutch electricity prices for different hydrogen shares within the energy system for different weather scenarios. Initial results show that the price stability of electricity in the Netherlands could be improved by increasing the share of hydrogen in the energy system. The increase of the hydrogen share within an energy system does not significantly affect the payback time of the energy system and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for electricity technologies. This research project shows that shadow prices could be used to understand trade-offs in different configurations of fully sector-coupled energy systems and aid the decision-making for the type and location of technologies to fulfil energy demands in the future. Recommended future research include an improvement of the North Sea Calliope model using a bottom-up approach and the analysis of other sectors within the fully sector-coupled energy system such as hydrogen and heat.","CoSEM; Optimization Modeling; Calliope; Shadow Prices; Linear programming; North Sea; Hydrogen; Sector Coupling","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/GOophfS1FWu9dtr?path=%2F North Sea Calliope model https://github.com/asow22/simple_model Simply Calliope Model","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","","51.507194, -0.127611"

Part of this charging infrastructure should be placed within the public space which causes problems and requires the multiple involved stakeholders to collaborate in order to solve these challenges. How this physical public charging infrastructure for EVs will look like in the future remains unclear. However, having a clearer image of the future public charging infrastructure could be beneficial for the efficiency with which the stakeholders could work towards the future and also help policy makers. Therefore, the objective of this study is to create future scenarios on how the physical charging infrastructure could look like in the future streetscape of big urban cities in The Netherlands by taking a holistic approach. These different scenarios are compared with each other. The methods used in this study are a literature review, semi-structured interviews, and a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The stakeholders which are interviewed for this study are the DSO, municipalities, CPO, hardware manufacturer and knowledge institutes which together provide different perspectives on the public charging infrastructure and could help with creating a holistic view on the future. The key uncertainties that were studied following from the literature review were the charging speed, the technical developments, clustering, smart solutions, parking policy, charging location, placement strategy, grid options, and the roll out solutions. This study showed that the future seems to be clear on some key elements of the charging infrastructure, while remaining unclear on other elements. Overall, however, there are some key elements of the system that seem to have support from most of the stakeholders interviewed and are therefore expected to be a part of the future public charging system. For the charging speed, the general expectation is that slow charging will remain the standard and that fast-charging squares could be used as additional charging option. The main charging technique to be used will remain the standard charging pole since innovative charging techniques like streetlight charging seem interesting but are still very expensive. Considering smart charging, the general notion is that this should be implemented in order to fulfill the existing charging demand while minimizing the impact on the grid. To do this however, a tariff structure should be designed where the CPO will be compensated in order to keep their business case attractive. Then, for the placement strategy data-driven seems to be the preferred option with strategic placement on special locations. Lastly, the grid expansion is expected to be required no matter what, although the extent to which this network expansion is needed depends on the extend of smart charging implementation. On the other key elements however, less consensus exists, and it is expected that these will vary more dependent on the decision maker. The different scenarios show all the different possibilities of combinations that are extracted from the interview data.","EV charging; Scenario Development; Charging infrastructure; Public Space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Ghorbani, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Misinformation on social media is an urgent grand challenge. Misinformation has caused excess deaths because people abstain from getting vaccinated and other evidence-based prevention behaviors. Misinformation also influences various other important topics such as climate change. And it has the potential to influence countless other areas. In order to exemplify the broader point, this project focuses on simple example of beliefs around the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations. To find ways to successfully tackle this grand challenge, it is crucial to have thorough understanding of the system. Modeling and simulation can be a powerful tool to support our reasoning about big and complex systems such as misinformation on social media. Therefore, I choose to look at how modeling and simulation can be useful for the study of misinformation on social media and of potential counter-measures.<br/><br/>Agent-based models (ABMs) are one of the useful modeling paradigms for this grand challenge. And while there is a body of literature on ABMs in the field of misinformation research, there is structural uncertainty about how to represent the way that people change their minds on social media. Different types of representations of this updating process are used. It is unclear which of them is the most suitable representation of the real-world process and also to what extent it makes a difference for the choice of counter-measures. Moreover, the choice between these different belief update functions is usually not discussed. And to the best of my knowledge, nobody has explored the issue of whether the choice between belief update functions makes a substantial difference in the conclusions from the studies.<br/><br/>Because of the significance of this grand challenge and the lack of exploring a key structural uncertainty, I choose to apply a method for exploring uncertainty in the context of ABMs. More specifically, because the structural uncertainty about the belief update function is a central component of models in this field, I explore a method for handling this structural uncertainty. This project is a show case of the value that methods from the field of Decision-Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) have for the field of misinformation focused ABMs.<br/><br/>Yet, applying a DMDU approach is not only useful for enabling exploration of uncertainties. With many DMDU methods, it is possible to evaluate policies based on not only a single, but on multiple objectives. As far as I know, also the evaluation of multiple objectives has not previously been done in the field of opinion dynamic models such as ABMs which focus on misinformation on social media. However, policies that aim at tackling the misinformation challenge do not only impact one single stakeholder, but a multitude of diverse stakeholders who care about various aspects of the system. If we pick policies by only optimizing for one objective, we run the risk of merely shifting the problem. To find solutions that are sustainable and work for the whole system, it is helpful to consider multiple metrics that stakeholders care about. The ranking and filtering by multiple objectives is not trivial. But there is a method called non-dominated ranking which can be applied to do exactly that. This results in so-called Pareto-optimal policies. It is in this specific niche that I pursue the following methodological question within the field of agent-based misinformation modeling:<br/><br/>Main Research Question<br/><br/>How does the consideration of structural uncertainty with respect to the choice between different belief update functions influence the resulting Pareto-optimal policies and their performance?<br/><br/>I look at three alternative belief update functions, where each belief update function is represented by one model. I show that the choice of the belief update function makes a significant difference for what kind of policies are Pareto-optimal and for the outcomes that stem from these policies. To investigate how the choice of the belief update function influences which policies are Pareto-optimal and what kind of outcomes result, I apply the DMDU-method of Many-Objective Robust Decision-Making (MORDM) approach. With DMDU methods, modellers can acknowledge the uncomfortable situation in which we know that we have uncertainties, ruining the possibility of using models as reliable prediction machines. These uncertainties can be about the real world's states (i.e., parametric uncertainties) or its processes (i.e., structural uncertainty). When applying DMDU methods, modellers can aim to find policies that perform robustly over a large number of possible instantiations of parametric or structural uncertainties. In this project, I first evaluate more than 26'000 candidate policies with each of the three belief update functions. Then, I select a set of Pareto-optimal policies for each belief update function. Additionally, I select a set of policies that seem optimal when only considering a single metric. Subsequently, I re-evaluate Pareto-optimal policies of each belief update function under deep uncertainty to gain a better impression of their performance. Finally, I compare the commonalities and differences between the selected policies and their performances. This, I do for either method of selection and for all three belief update functions.<br/><br/>To explore the structural uncertainty, I use a model which can be instantiated with either of the alternative belief update functions. I refer to these three possible instantiations as the three different models. The first model uses the commonly used function based on the research by Deffuant (hereafter 'DEFFUANT model'). In it, beliefs are always updated by a fix percentage towards the newly incoming information. In this project, this newly incoming information is the belief that is represented in a seen post. The second model samples whether a belief update happens or not. If an update happens, the new belief is the average between the previous belief and the newly incoming information. We call this the 'SAMPLE model'. Unfortunately, neither of these two models includes well-established phenomena from social psychology. Examples of such phenomena include for instance that we are more willing to update towards beliefs that are more similar to ours, that we have limited attention capacity, and that it takes more to change someone's mind when they are very convinced of their current belief than when they are uncertain. The third model was chosen to fill this void by basing its belief update function on Social Impact Theory (SIT) and adjusting this theory to the context of social media. This model is referred to as the 'SIT model'.<br/><br/>Main Findings<br/><br/>- There is a clear distinction between the models' optimal policies as well as their outcomes.<br/>- Differences in parameters do make a difference.<br/>- The models' optimal policies exhibit an order in how optimistic their outcomes are. This order (in descending direction) is DEFFUANT, SAMPLE, and SIT.<br/>- The outcomes of the DEFFUANT and the SAMPLE model are more similar to each other than to the SIT model.<br/><br/>The main methodological take-away is that the DMDU approach can bring substantial value to the field of ABM-based studies on the grand challenge of misinformation on social media platforms. While this is shown by a simple exploration of the structural uncertainty with respect to the belief update, many more insights could be gathered by utilizing the DMDU approach. For instance, the DMDU approach offers state-of-the-art methods to identify vulnerable scenarios, i.e., scenarios which would be particularly bleak. Another example could be to explore different problem formulations with different sets of objectives or other structural uncertainties such as the posting behavior.<br/><br/>Furthermore, by utilizing the tools of DMDU, also society as a whole can benefit. By including multiple objectives and a wide range of considered uncertainties, the many different world-views and values of the diverse stakeholders can be taken into account in order to avoid potential policy gridlock situations. This could contribute to tackling the misinformation grand challenge more successfully and thus for instance lead to more people embracing evidence-based medical interventions.","Agent-Based Modeling & Simulation; Misinformation; Deep Uncertainty; Structural uncertainty; Belief Update","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/felicity-reddel/MisinfoPy","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

During this time, employees have become accustomed to remote working habits, and a shift has been made in many lives toward a more flexible work-life balance. Nowadays, with the pandemic almost behind, it gives rise to the question, how will the ideal workplace environment look like post-pandemic? By conducting a broad and extensive literature research two frameworks were constructed and proposed, being, respectively, a productivity framework, and a well-being framework. On top of that, three categories involving the responsibility of these factors were proposed, being, respectively, the neutral, positive, and happy category, linked to the responsibility of respectively, the manager, colleagues, and the employee self. These frameworks and their corresponding factors were connected by the five needs of Maslow and linked to these categories. Resulting in a combined framework that showed promising connections between the productivity and well-being factors that are in need to be verified and validated. This was followed by a survey conducted over 56 participants, including a selection of the factors mentioned in the frameworks. Resulting in many qualitative information on how to establish the ideal workplace environment. However, due to the time constraints, the results of the survey are still open to be analyzed in a quantitative manner. The research was concluded with a part that draws the ideal workplace environment, and on top of that, some advice for managers on how to create their own ideal workplace environment, and how to better support their employees with the focus on remote work. All in all, managers should have an open communication style, be respectful, listen actively to the needs, preferences, and wishes of their employees, and keep up to date with the resources they can provide to support their employees. Resulting in an increase in the mentioned factors from the frameworks, which, in turn, could fulfill the five basic needs of Maslow, and helps employees to live up to their potential. When an employee is able to achieve this, their productivity and well-being will be improved, and they will make more and cost less, for the organization. Therefore, aiming for the ideal workplace environment will benefit all.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This class of materials is known for its superior creep resistance. However, creep of refractory linings is a known phenomenon in refractory science. Therefore, knowledge on creep behaviour is critical for furnace lining life predictions and selection of materials. This work, in collaboration with Tata Steel IJmuiden, focuses on creep development in magnesia carbon (MgO-C), a refractory often found in Basic Oxygen Furnaces (BOF). In this research, the influence of binder and aluminium content on creep development in MgO-C was investigated. This was addressed, based on the microstructural changes, phase transformations and thermo-mechanical properties. Microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction, cold crushing strength, hot modulus of rupture, dilatometry, refractoriness under load and hot compressive strength tests were conducted in order to explain creep behaviour. For creep testing, a nonstandardised set-up was designed to be able to retrieve creep data more efficiently. The experimental configuration increased the load every 5 hours (multi-stage). Resulting creep rates were validated against a single-load stage creep measurement. A small difference of 5% in creep rates was observed. This indicated that the multi- and single-stage results are within range of each other. Therefore, the proposed multi-stage creep test can be considered a viable creep testing method. A trend of decreasing creep rates with increasing binder content was found. Increasing the content from 2% to 3% showed a maximum decrease in creep rates of 80%. A further increase of binder content from 3% to 4% showed a maximum decrease in creep rates of 30%. This behaviour was mainly attributed due to volatilisation of the binder and magnesium, and densification due to carbonisation of the binder. Increasing the aluminium content from 0 to 1% resulted in a maximum decrease in creep rates of 70%. This was mainly attributed due to spinel formation. The irreversible volume expansion due to spinel formation, increased the density and the stress state within the material. As a result, micro cracks formed which strengthened the material and improved creep resistance. The outcomes of this work are an important contribution to refractory science.

Recent studies indicate that human mesenchymal stem cells are affected by the surface curvature of the underlying substrate. However, how meso-scale substrate curvature affects cell behaviour is still not clear. This study utilised the finite element method to simulate a prestressed human mesenchymal stem cell conforming and attaching to a flat control substrate, concave hemispherical and concave cylindrical substrates with curvature radii from 300 µm to 75 µm. The cell model comprises the actin cortex, cytoskeleton, and nucleus modelled with a hyperelastic material definition and 30 linear elastic stress fibres prestressed with a force of 10 nN. The effects of surface curvature on cellular traction forces, cell height, nuclear aspect ratio and actin cortex was studied. The vertical traction forces were observed to be 70% and 40% lower for the hemispherical and cylindrical substrates of the highest curvatures compared to the flat control substrate, respectively. Cellular traction forces towards the cell periphery were roughly 10-20% higher than the more central cellular traction forces independent of substrate curvature. Stresses in the actin cortex were observed to increase by 290% and 220% from the flat control substrate to the hemispherical and cylindrical substrates of the highest curvatures, respectively. These results indicate that the cell is more sensitive to hemispherical substrates than cylindrical substrates. The results also support in vitro observations where hMSCs are seen to span hemispherical substrates and avoid continuous contact.","Finite Element Analysis; Mesenchymal stem cells; Substrate Curvature; Traction Forces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The responsibility problem in the AI field has been taken seriously. The point of the problem is how to prevent AI systems from making moral decisions for whom they cannot be held accountable. One of the directions to address the responsibility problem is Meaningful Human Control (MHC). Most of the work focused on theoretical definition and measurement ex- plorations and few researchers investigate it by combining application scenarios. Research Question. One of the previous works identified that explanations could be used to improve the subjective feeling of MHC when the effect of con- trol is delayed. Therefore, we wanted to study what type of explanations could facilitate the improvement and how explanations achieved that. Method. We conducted an expert study to obtain advice on selecting explanation types by a ranking question questionnaire and structured questions. Due to the findings that information sharing could improve Situation Awareness (SA), we conducted a pilot study and a user study to study the effect of explanations on different levels of SA and the human feeling of MHC. We used the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) and a Five-point Likert scale question- naire to measure the effect of explanations on SA and MHC. Moreover, we compared the effect of sub-explanations we used in the user study (consequen- tial and counterfactual explanations) with a questionnaire. Results. It was shown that the explanations help to get more overall SA and SA in the pro- jection level. It was also shown that higher SA scores are associated with a better feeling of MHC. However, our result showed that the explanations have no significant effect on the subjective experience of MHC. The findings also in- dicated that a high frequency of playing computer games can result in a good subjective experience of control. Comparisons of the sub-explanations on quali- tative and quantitative analysis demonstrated that counterfactual explanations made a better impression on participants in most respects. Discussion and Conclusion. From the results, we concluded that explanations do increase the degree of SA of the task to a certain extent, but they do not affect the experi- enced control. We also found that the computer gaming experience may provide higher cooperation engagement and cohesion, resulting in increased experienced control. As for the sub-explanations, the counterfactual ones were overall bet- ter than the consequential ones by providing more information and making the participants feel the robot’s intelligence.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Therefore, it is important to get accurate observations of aerosols in the atmosphere as well as accurate emission fluxes of aerosol species. Satellite instruments such as SPEXone are able to measure aerosol properties with a high accuracy. Unfortunately, the instrument has a low daily global coverage. To obtain full daily global coverage, methods such as data assimilation are used. However, these methods have a high computational cost. This report investigates the use of neural networks to obtain global daily coverage of aerosol properties and emission fluxes with a lower computational cost. Two networks are trained. One to get global coverages of the aerosol properties Aerosol Optical Depth at 550nm (AOD), Single Scattering Albedo at 550nm (SSA) and ̊Angstr ̈om Exponent between 550nm and 865nm(AE). The other network is trained for global emission fields of the species dimethylsulfide (DMS), sulfur dioxide (SO2), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), sea salt (SS) and dust (DU). The results from these trained networks are compared to the results of a control experiment, which represents our prior knowledge on the aerosol fields and emissions, although not the truth. It is found that the network for aerosol properties has a significant decrease in errors compared to the control experiment. For both AOD and AE, the network has a large improvement, and for SSA the improvement is slightly smaller, likely due to a lower performance of the control experiment compared to AOD and AE. The network for the emissions also has a noticeable improvement over the control experiment for all species except DMS, where there is only a small improvement due to the already accurate DMS value for the control experiment. It is also found that the network for emissions overfits due to too little variation in training and testing data.<br","Artifical Intelligence; Aerosol; Convolutional Neural Network; Data Assimilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The leading cause of this is high muscle stress during explosive actions. To be able to prevent injuries, the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) and Dutch Hockey Association (KNHB) are working on smart sensor shorts in collaboration with the Delft University of Technology. The human movement scientists from the VU and RUG use these sensor shorts to develop a model which can predict potential incidents. The product’s goal is for the physical trainer to use it to monitor the team in real-time during a game or training.<br/>The physical trainer will use a computer to analyze all the data. The sensor shorts consist of 3 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Each IMU measures the angular velocity (dps), linear acceleration (g), and magnetic field (µT) with a ampling rate of 250 Hz. The high volume of data due to the high sampling rate induces challenges for wireless communication and design.<br/>The sensor shorts can, at the moment, read out the IMUs and compress the sensor data. Besides, possible antennas for the sensor shorts have already been looked at. This thesis will continue with the communication link between the sensor shorts and the computer used by the physical trainer. The thesis will be focused on designing a reliable system for wireless communication. Multiple challenges must be faced to develop a reliable wireless communication system with minimal size. The challenges are the minimum amount of resources available, high data rate, large area to cover for communication, and obstruction due to the human body.<br/>According to literature about monitoring devices currently described in the literature used for football, eight base stations are needed around the football field. The goal is to minimize the number of base stations so that the system can be easily set up. For the development of the system, first, the different Data Collection Protocols(DCP) are examined. Based on the network topology corresponding to the DCP, we want to choose a DCP that is the most efficient and reliable. The Direct Delivery protocol was chosen as most suited in combination with WiFi operating at 2.4 GHz. WiFi can deal with the high data rates and communicate over large distances.<br/>The number of base stations needed is determined based on tests performed on the football field. The choice was made to place the antenna of the sensor shorts on the back of the athlete because there it has the most negligible chance of obstruction due to the athlete’s limbs. The athlete’s own body could cause attenuation of 10 dBm. Additionally, it was chosen to have the base station at 2.2 m height, to have fewer chances of obstruction due to the athletes on the football field. Multiple tests have been performed to determine how many base stations are needed. First, the possible signal strength values of the sensor shorts around the football field have been measured for a single base station. After that, a relation between the measured signal strength and possible loss and delay has been established. These results made it clear that more than one base station is needed. In tests with two base stations, it became clear that data might get lost when there is no base station in the radiation plane of the patch antenna of the sensor shorts. Therefore the choice was made to have four base stations, one on each corner of the football field, so that there is always a base station in the radiation plane of the patch antenna. Based on the test results, the choice was made to have four base stations, one on each corner of the football field. Assuming that the sensor shorts’ RSSI values are always higher than −80 dBm, the system with four base stations would have a loss of less than 5%. The upper boundary for the delay would be 5 s.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Such classical controllers need digital memory for various applications, ranging from high-speed queues to high-speed and low-speed lookup tables and working memory. The power consumption of the memories should be within the available cooling power at these temperatures. To obtain the best memory design with the lowest power consumption, cryogenic-CMOS characteristics need to be taken into account during design. This thesis aims to develop a model that can be used to find the optimal memory cell design for each application, while taking area, latency, error rate, and power constraints into account. A model is developed to estimate the error rate and power consumption of a memory core for four cell designs, namely three embedded dynamic cell designs and one static cell design, over a range of applications in terms of memory operation frequency and read/write operation ratio. The model is constructed using room temperature and 233 K simulation data of individual cells and peripherals from a TSMC 40 nm technology. To estimate the error rate and power consumption at 4.2 K, the model is extended with empirical cryogenic-CMOS characteristics, such as an increase in threshold voltage and a steeper subthreshold slope, since good device models at this temperature are not available. To verify and improve the memory model, a test chip in TSMC 40 nm technology is designed, which includes eight fully-custom memories with two threshold-variations of each of the four cell designs to mitigate the cryogenic-CMOS threshold voltage increase. These memories are connected to an on-chip programmable microcontroller through a bus which enables flexible and high-speed testing without the need for high-speed I/O. This chip design is taped out and will be measured to verify and refine the model. At room temperature, the static cell design outperforms the dynamic cells in all memory applications with less than 10<sup>7</sup> operations per second. However, at cryogenic temperatures, the embedded dynamic cell designs become feasible for applications with more than 300 operations per second, due to the significantly reduced refresh rate. The best embedded dynamic cell design depends on the read/write memory operation ratio required by the application. After verification and improvement of the memory model based on the measurement results from the test chip, this model can be used to find the best cell design for a given application based on its operation frequency and read/write operation ratio. Apart from comparing the performance of a single memory design at room temperature and 4.2 K, this work also allows for direct comparison between the different memory cells designs, designed with the same technology, architecture, peripherals, and by the same design rules. Since only a single architecture is used with a single design for each of the peripherals, further optimisation is required for a cryogenic-optimised full memory design.","Cryo-CMOS; memory; dram; sram; quantum computing; Cryogenic electronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-29","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

This means that there can be a high interference rate between the gas and light, which is desirable for gas sensing.<br/>First, less complicated optical fibers were studied. The analytical solution of the electric and magnetic field for the TE and TM modes of the simple fiber were derived and for the TE modes of the step-index fiber.

Photonic crystal fiber with circular core was then simulated with COMSOL Multiphysics, but the results did not match with the literature. Therefore another photonic crystal fiber was simulated with a star-shaped core. The simulation results found modes concentrated in the core, with low attenuation.<br/>It was attempted to get similar results with a three layer step-index fiber, by varying the imaginary refractive index of the middle layer. The attenuation of the three layer fiber was much higher than that of the photonic crystal fiber for all simulations. This indicates that the three layer step-index fiber does not support propagation modes that are confined to the core. Further research could be done by studying the effect of the radius of the middle layer and the real part of the refractive index.","photonic crystal fiber; gas sensing; COMSOL Multiphysics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Each guideline corresponds with an underlying need of children: support children with different interests, give children the feeling that they are in control, allow children to take a break to reflect on their experience, enable discovery, emphasise the feeling of fellowship, challenge the abilities of the children, provide a clear and simple introduction, allow children to take risks, trigger their senses, reflect everyday life within the installation, utilise humour and create an aesthetically pleasing experience. <br/><br/>The guidelines formed the basis for developing the design Geotricity. Geotricity consists of a table with an interactive landscape projected on it. The challenge for the children is to provide energy to the houses on the table.

To realise successful implementation of delivery robots in the public space, it is important to study the interaction between robot and environment. The traffic environment includes the physical infrastructure, traffic conditions and the people using the environment. This research proposes an assessment method that can be applied to determine the ‘roboreadiness’ of a traffic environment. This expresses whether the environment is ready for delivery robots to drive there. The performance of new transport concepts and the acceptance of innovations in the transport system are studied in a literature review, leading to the important factors. This is translated into a conceptual model which is the basis for the development of the method. To be able to assess the factors, suitable sub-methods are chosen and elaborated. To study the performance of the robot in its traffic environment a test-case can be performed and to examine the social acceptance a survey can be conducted. Analysing the resulting data leads to the level of roboreadiness. As a final step in the development of the method, a validation is carried out. While demonstrating the assessment method, it follows that the method is suitable for determining the level of performance, social acceptance and consequently the roboreadiness. In addition, first insights regarding the performance and social acceptance of the delivery robot at the campus of the Erasmus University Rotterdam are presented. The proposed assessment method can be used to collect data that can be useful for future projects. Although the method is valid, suggestions for improvements are made for further research.","delivery robots; robot performance; social acceptance; assessment method; roboreadiness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The experimental results show that AENN outperforms PySTEPS in terms of instantaneous radar echo prediction in the extreme-rain period and high accumulation detection in four Dutch catchments. GPD normalization can enhance the model’s detection ability in heavy rain.

Eating disorders are most prevalent among young adults between 18 and 30 years old and, on average, go undiagnosed for four years. There is no single cause for eating disorders, and are often accompanied by other mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Because of the complexity, there is no ready-made solution. Eating disorders occur because they offer instant gratification to cope with emotional distress. Individuals often do not seek help because of denial, guilt, shame and stigmatisation caused by a lack of general knowledge.<br/>The main aim of this research has been to explore the needs of young adults living with an eating disorder who seek support in addressing their disorder.<br/>Throughout this graduation project, Redesigning Psychiatry (a project which details an ideal future vision of mental healthcare in the Netherlands) was consulted to provide guidance in making decisions for design directions.<br/>The research consisted of a theoretical background study, contextmapping (a qualitative user research approach using generative tools and interviews) and research through design method (including activities such as rapid prototyping and testing).<br/>The theoretical background and context mapping insights resulted in a theoretical model that provided detailed insights into factors that influence the help-seeking behaviour in young adults with eating disorders. The model created an overview of the research insights and Redesigning Psychiatry was consulted to highlight the importance of including the social network of young adults with eating disorders in the design.<br/>Based on this design decision, the goal for the design was to design a tool that enables the initiation of a conversation about eating disorders between young adults with eating disorders and their social network so that both parties can set boundaries for their involved support while maintaining their original relationship.<br/>The design should aim to:<br/>Increase others understanding eating disorders<br/>Increase openness in communication about eating disorders<br/>Increase knowing how to communicate about eating disorders<br/>Enable the development of personalised care<br/>Creates a safe and controlled feeling over the interaction<br/>The goal resulted in Food for Talk, which is a conversation game for young adults with eating disorders and their social network to communicate experiences, emotions and needs surrounding the topic of eating disorders. The conversation game facilitates the conversation through several game elements such as a board, conversation cards and tokens. Food for talk is intended to be distributed through therapists of young adults with eating disorders.<br/>Finally, the game Food for talk has been evaluated with young adults with eating disorders and their social networks. The design was successful in supporting in-depth conversations between young adults and their social network, increased openness and knowledge and removed hesitance in the conversation. However, further research is needed to validate the effects of the final design. The final design should be evaluated between young adults with eating disorders and their social networks in a long-term study as well as with different types of social networks.","Eating disorders; Personalised care; Mental health vulnerability; social support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Though it is a non-linear process, every religious transition starts with a critical questioning of religious norms that one has been exposed to. <br/><br/>Reasons for questioning vary from traumatic experiences with religious others to cognitive and moral dissonance and contradictions in the sacred scriptures. Questioning brings the urge to discuss the contested aspects of one’s religion with others in the religious spheres. However, people questioning some aspects of their religion are usually discouraged in their inquiry because being critical of one’s religion is seen as heresy and a transgressive action to be avoided. <br/><br/>The lack of space to discuss critical questions with religious others can result in a feeling of loneliness and loss of relatedness.

Inspired by this potential, we employ the recently introduced Recurrent Independent Mechanisms (RIMs) in the downstream video prediction task. RIMs consist of several modular recurrent units and modular hidden states which are called RIM cells. Those modules are connected by two attention mechanisms. Through experiments, we show that RIMs perform better or comparably with related baselines. <br/><br/>From modular recurrent units to modular image representations, we push the modularity further to explore how much the performance can benefit from it. We extend RIMs architecture on both the encoder and decoder sides to allow for object-centric (OC) feature representation learning in video prediction, resulting in an end-to-end architecture we refer to as OC-RIMs. Our qualitative evaluations demonstrate that every RIM cell in OC-RIMs now attends to a certain object within the input scene at any specific moment. As a result, OC-RIMs offer considerable quantitative performance improvement in video prediction over comparable baselines across two datasets.<br/><br/>We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the design choices of every module of RIMs. We empirically show that most modules work as expected. However, the sparse activation greatly detriments the prediction performance, which is against the claims in the paper where RIMs were proposed. On the other hand, RIM cells are expected to work near-independently. But experiments show that the use of communication mechanism leads to heavy co-adaptation between cells, i.e., RIM cells fail to make any reasonable predictions independently. Those issues have raised our concerns about the design of RIMs. Finally, we point out some future work directions to address these deficiencies.","object-centric; video prediction; modular neural network; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","Project Github Repository - https://github.com/sentient-codebot/RIM-MovingMNIST","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Furthermore, the rotor is operating in its own wake, leading to complex aerodynamics. A Command Filtered Incremental Backstepping controller has been applied to a simulation model of an MBB Bo-105 hingeless rotorcraft. The model incorporates the Pitt-Peters inflow model to calculate the inflow variations of the main rotor. Incremental controllers rely on sensor measurements of state derivatives instead of model knowledge, making them robust to modelling errors. However, some states of the helicopter model, such as blade flap angles and rotor inflow, cannot be measured in real life. Therefore a process called residualization and synchronization is used to remove these states from the controller model and compensate for their dynamics in a synchronization filter. This process has already been performed for the flap angles. In this thesis the inflow states are also residualized and added to the synchronization filter. Furthermore, the Pitt-Peters inflow model of the simulation model is updated with the Keller correction to better simulate off-axis response to control input. Modelling the off-axis response of helicopters is notoriously difficult and is often of the wrong sign compared to experimental data. Having a more precise helicopter model is key to perform piloted simulation or research to non-linear controllers. Although the updated inflow model did alter the inflow states, changes in the helicopter dynamics remained very limited. Furthermore, the application of residualization was successful but synchronizing the rotor inflow did not improve controller performance.","Helicopter Control; Incremental Backstepping; Dynamic inflow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Laboratory accelerated thermal ageing experiments on material compatibility were performed to assure long-term physical and chemical stability at the interface between C4F7N/CO2 gas mixture and epoxy resin with different fillers. As there are no standards for accelerated ageing for this novel gas, the ageing test is performed based on the recommendations of CIGRE. The compatibility of gas and solid insulating materials in contact was assessed based on the changes in insulation performance after ageing. Before and after ageing experiments, such as AC and LI flashover tests, visual inspection, FTIR of epoxy samples and breakdown strength of the gas were analysed and compared.<br/><br/>The optical detection of partial discharge (PD) is a critical method for determining the insulating quality of equipment. Moreover, the PD of different gases correspond to distinct multispectral characteristic distributions, but the current investigation is limited to SF6. As a result, this research offers a solution to identify the optical PD spectrum of the novel alternative gas C4F7N/CO2. Based on the finding, the research is extended to use it in fluorescent fibres for PD detection in Gas Insulated Systems. The selection of fluorescent fibres and sensors is analysed, and tests are performed to produce PRPD patterns from the optical sensor output.

The resulting aliased data is a major obstacle for accurate subsurface images. Therefore, methods are needed to reconstruct these sparse data to an adequate sampling. We develop a novel kinematic wavefront-based seismic data reconstruction method that uses the existing nonlinear beamforming (NLBF) framework, which allows for building a more detailed sampling from a sparse input. We present the theory and methodology of our NLBF reconstruction algorithm and test it on a synthetic Society of Exploration Geophysicists Advanced Modeling (SEAM) Arid dataset and a field dataset. We attempt to answer the following question: can the NLBF framework be used for seismic data reconstruction, and how do these results compare to some conventional reconstruction methods? Control parameter tests are performed to find the optimal NLBF reconstruction, and results are compared to those from several control methods including the convergent alternating projection onto convex sets (POCS) and bootstrap POCS methods, which were also developed for this study. Our NLBF reconstruction method successfully reconstructs high-quality data on both datasets. We find that the optimal NLBF control parameters are ultimately dataset-dependent as the concrete data acquisition geometry plays a central role. Specifically for our datasets, optimal parameters include a time window of 12∆ts, an operator aperture of 600 m x 600 m, and a parameter trace interval of ∆x = ∆y = 60 m. The synthetic SEAM Arid NLBF reconstruction results show high trace fidelity to the ground truth. The field data NLBF results show better-reconstructed gaps, and wavefield variations closer to those of physical propagating waves in comparison to our control methods. These results show the potential of the NLBF reconstruction method to become a common data reconstruction tool used in the seismic industry.","Nonlinear beamforming; seismic data reconstruction; traveltime operator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

A reduced order model of the high-fidelity model can still accurately determine the quantities of interest with only a fraction of the computational cost, and thus can potentially solve the aforementioned problem. However, reducing a high-fidelity model of a small modular reactor is complicated due to the large number of parameters involved in nuclear reactor models, as that leads to an exponentially increasing parameter space needed to be surveyed.<br/><br/>Disregarding the parameters with the smallest impact on the output and thereby reducing the total number of variables can limit the parameter space, and thus speed up the model reduction at the cost of some accuracy. Perturbation theory utilizes the benefits of adjoint theory to efficiently determine sensitivities of responses to all the variables in the model, which allows one to find the influence on the output of the different variables without the need for evaluating them all repeatedly. It is then possible to apply a reduced order modeling technique such as proper orthogonal decomposition to determine and select only the most important eigenmodes of the high-fidelity model and build a reduced model.<br/><br/>This approach is applied to three different neutronics model of the U-Battery, varying in complexity. The presented method has shown to alleviate computational cost significantly for all examined reduced models. However, the upfront cost of building the reduced models by sampling the high-fidelity models has been considerable, especially when evaluating the resulting accuracy of the reduced models. A proper selection of the proper orthogonal decomposition tolerances must be made to ensure sufficient accuracy and to prevent oversampling. Nonetheless, combining proper orthogonal decomposition with perturbation theory showed to be a promising way of selecting only a few parameters for participation in the building of reduced order models while minimizing the loss of accuracy compared to the high-fidelity model.","Reduced order modelling; Sensitivity analysis; Locally adaptive sparse grids; Nonintrusive; U-Battery; Uncertainty quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor); Faragau, A.B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In transition zones, railway tracks experience significant inhomogeneity in their mechanical properties—more specifically in vertical stiffness. In such areas, conventional tracks (soft tracks) are typically encountered with other engineering structures with noticeably larger stiffness, such as bridges and culverts (stiff tracks). This inhomogeneity together with the passage of high-speed trains leads to amplification in dynamic response, which in turn results in faster degradation and higher cost of maintenance at transition zones. In practice, various mitigation measures have been adopted which have led to improvement in track performance to a certain degree.<br/><br/>This thesis is mainly focused on the feasibility of using the tuned mass damper (TMD), as a novel mitigation measure, for improving the aforementioned undesired behavior. Additionally, the efficiency of two already existing corrective measures, namely auxiliary rail and under sleeper pad (USP), is investigated at transition zone.<br/><br/>The track is modeled as an infinite one-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli beam resting on a piecewise-homogeneous and continuously distributed Kelvin foundation. For each mitigation measure, semi-analytical solutions are derived through the Fourier transform method. Regarding TMD analysis, mechanical parameters are optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II), in which the discrepancy between the soft and the stiff tracks’ wavenumbers is minimized. In regard to auxiliary rail, two configurations with multiple number of extra rails (ERs) are evaluated; ERs over soft track only, and ERs over all domains. Additionally, USPs with different stiffness are considered for their arrangement along the track. The efficiency corresponding to each mitigation measure is mainly evaluated through dynamic amplification factor (DAF) and power input.<br/><br/>The system with TMD demonstrates a significant reduction in DAF amplitude corresponding to the load velocity for which the optimization is performed. This improvement is also evident for velocities close to the aforementioned load speed. In fact, the addition of TMD results in presence of a free propagating wave behind the load and decreasing the critical velocity in the corresponding system. The outcomes corresponding to power input suggest a significant reduction in potential damage to the foundation due to the employment of TMD.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the application of ER leads to improvement in dynamic performance of the track by increasing the critical velocity to a larger value, at which the corresponding DAF indicates no reduction. In addition, considering more than one ER along the track does not lead to a noticeably better result compared to when only one ER is added. Moreover, applying ER over soft track leads to inhomogeneity in bending stiffness and mass corresponding to the beam element at transition point. Therefore, the system with ER over all domains indicates a better dynamic behavior. Potentially, less damage to the foundation can be signified in the system with ER according to the power input response.<br/><br/>Finally, USP can significantly affect the equivalent stiffness of the track. It is concluded that the efficiency of USPs in mitigating the amplified response is strongly dependent on their stiffness and arrangement along the track, as well as the stiffness variation in the supporting structure; improper design of USPs alignment can adversely result in even more amplified responses.<br","Transition Zone; Transition radiation; Tuned mass damper (TMD); Under sleeper pad (USP); Auxiliary rail","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Research indicates that coffee, as one of the largest industries, generates a huge amount of waste, namely Spent Coffee Grounds (SCGs). This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of converting SCG into biochar using a solar-assisted biomass torrefying technique, while keeping frugal or ""jugaad"" innovation in mind. To torrefy the feedstock, it was intended to use the available SK14 solar cooker in conjunction with a prototype reactor unit. Based on previous research on torrefying coffee waste, this study asks: Can the biomass torrefied using the SK 14 cooker be utilized as fuel? In this context: Solar biomass torrefaction is an endothermic process of converting the feedstock in an inert environment at low temperatures of 200-300 °C provided by concentrated solar energy in order to produce a high yield of solid biochar.<br/> <br/>Based on the literature research, it was important to characterize the SK14 cooker, the feedstock, and to understand the operating principles of the chosen reactor, namely Evacuated Tube Vacuum Collectors (EVCs). Since the design of the reactor and cooker were interdependent, COMSOL was used to simulate the heat distribution profile and temperature profile of the reactor model. Literature and simulation results were used to construct a prototype reactor, and torrefaction tests were conducted in Hyderabad (India). SCG was effectively torrefied to generate biochar at 240 °C and 260 °C, as evidenced by high heating values of 26 MJ/kg (21% increase) and 26.3 MJ/kg (22.50% increase), respectively compared to the raw material. The results show that the current system can be utilized as a small-scale solar biomass torrefier, creating biochar that can be used as a fuel. However, the reactor's non-homogeneous heating rate and poor heat retention severely hampered its applicability. Further study is required to find other features and aspects that might not only improve the design and efficacy of the torrefier, but also facilitate its implementation for coffee producers in Kerala.<br","jugaad; torrefier; EVCs; high heating value; small-scale; biochar","en","master thesis","","","","","","Links used are added as numbers in square brackets.","","2024-08-26","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","17.45603, 78.44856"

It showcases the contextual design approach and opportunities for the unlisted 50’s-60’s international style office buildings - “glass boxes”- whose potential is not yet widely seen today, especially in the context of densification. The project puts a focus on a building’s adaptability for different future uses as a resilient solution to urban densification.<br/><br/>The vacant former police office building at Witte de Withstraat in Rotterdam has become a testing ground to find guidelines for dealing with an existing building and reviving it for as long as possible. <br/><br/>This project is a part of the Adapting 20th century heritage studio that deals with vacant police buildings in the Netherlands. The police want to adapt their real estate to the new organization and the changed structure of the services, with larger teams, in fewer places, and more digital presence. This reorientation to denser locations is also taking place outside of police institutions on a larger scale, both nationally and globally. It is estimated that by 2050 nearly 7 out of 10 people in the world will live in cities. Denser construction reduces transit emissions by adding more stories and provides more livable and usable area in the same amount of space. <br/><br/>With my research, I was looking for ways this site could contribute to the future challenges of densification in central Rotterdam. There are 4 scales of impact this building could have: urban, architectural/heritage, social, and technical. The strategy of each scale developed for this building is an outcome of the research.<br/><br/>On the urban scale, the building is to become a landmark for the street and have an active and inviting plinth. Regarding the architectural/heritage scale, the majority of the original building is reused, recreating the original lobby, and a new extension on top is introduced. New functions - restaurant, cooking school, shop, urban farm, co-living and roof terrace with rentable bar for celebrations - will have a positive socio-cultural impact, providing locals with fresh food, education, job opportunities and making the neighbourhood more inclusive. Adaptability for different uses over time will be introduced on the technical scale by implementing Open Building principles and introducing new, more spacious, vertical circulation cores in the places of the existing ones. The project’s flexibility limits were tested. For this reason, four subjects were looked at in more depth: program, storey height &amp; installations, raised floor and the facade, yielding interesting findings.<br/><br/>To conlcude, this adaptive reuse project introduces the abovementioned solutions as a strategy that addresses impact on the urban, architectural/heritage, social, and technical scales. The design’s goal is to activate the building, guaranteeing its long lifespan by re-connecting it with the street, introducing environmentally and socially impactful program, establishing an architectural landmark, all while implementing adaptability for different future uses.","Densification; Authenticity; open plan; post-war; adaptability; plinth; Urban Agriculture; Open Building; Flexibility; young monument; Adaptive Reuse; Adaptive re-use; Rotterdam; Modern Heritage; Extension; timber construction; Heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","51.915983, 4.478186"

(graduation committee); Mastrangeli, Massimo (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Silicon solar cells account for about 95% of the total photovoltaic market share. Poly-Si passivating contacts are promising techniques enabling high performance c-Si solar cells with conversion efficiency over 26.0%. The highly absorptive nature of poly-Si materials makes the transparent passivating contacts attractive, such as poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>). However, the research of p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts on a textured surface with an in-situ doping nature is still missing. Therefore, in this thesis, the optimization of p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) carrier selective passivating contacts on double side textured wafers are given and the application in solar cells is demonstrated.<br/>Firstly, the influences of different interfacial tunnelling oxides fabrication methods, nitric acid oxidation of silicon (NAOS-SiO<sub>x</sub>), plasma assisted N<sub>2</sub>O oxidation (PANO-SiO<sub>x</sub>), and thermal oxidation (t-SiO<sub>x</sub>) on the passivation of p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts are explored. It is found that Si<sup>4+</sup> stoichiometry in the tunnelling oxide layer is an indicator for its quality. There is a positive correlation between Si<sup>4+</sup> and SiO<sub>x</sub> density. The t-SiO<sub>x </sub>can be denser with higher Si<sup>4+</sup> compared to its counterparts NAOS-SiO<sub>x</sub> and PANO-SiO<sub>x</sub>. And fewer boron dopants in-diffuse phenomenon can be observed in the t-SiO<sub>x</sub> samples. Then, different intrinsic layer deposition approaches are explored. The intrinsic layer deposited by LPCVD results in higher i<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> compared to PECVD counterpart. The enhanced i<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> is given by suppressing the blistering which is caused by hydrogen accumulation at the interface between intrinsic layer and SiO<sub>x</sub>. It is assumed that less hydrogen accumulation exists in intrinsic layer deposited by LPCVD. Next, p<sup>+</sup> doping layer thickness is changed from 0 nm to 200 nm to observe its effect on the passivation quality. The optimum p<sup>+</sup> doping layer thickness is found to be 100 nm with the highest i<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub>. After that, the hydrogenation process is introduced to enhance chemical passivation by coating SiN<sub>x</sub>:H and performing forming gas annealing. The highest i<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> with the standard hydrogenation process is 674 mV. In order to improve the hydrogen level of p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts, AlO<sub>x</sub>:H inserted layer is used for the hydrogen reservoir together with SiN<sub>x</sub>:H. It results in an improved i<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> of 685 mV. It is assumed that the hydrogen in AlO<sub>x</sub>:H diffuses into c-Si/p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) interface and enhances the chemical passivation.<br/><br/>Besides, metallization methods of p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivity contacts are also studied. There are two approaches to complete the metallization process. Firstly, with thin p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts, TCO is required to provide with the lateral and vertical carrier transport as respect to the carrier collection. However, it commonly brings with the TCO introduced sputtering damage. The i<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> losses are 70-90 mV when TCO is sputtered on p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts. When the thickness of p<sup>+</sup> doping layer is over 50 nm, sufficient lateral conductivity can be provided with thick p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts. Therefore, it can directly contact with metal which is the second method of metallization. However, when utilizing this metallization method, the metal induced recombinations need to be taken into consideration when contacting with p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts. Thus, the plot of <i>J</i><sub>o,total</sub> along with different metal fractions is fitted to extract<i> J</i><sub>o,metal </sub>of p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts with 100 nm p<sup>+</sup> doping layer. When contacting with evaporated aluminum, the measured<i> J</i><sub>o,metal</sub> is around 91 fA/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, after calculating, there is 24 mV i<i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> loss when p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts contacting with metal. It is smaller than the loss induced by TCO sputtering. Therefore, the thick p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts with 100 nm p<sup>+</sup> doping layer directly contacting with metal is used as metallization method for the application in c-Si solar cell. In addition, after linear fitting and calculating, <i>ρ</i><sub>c</sub> between p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts with 100 nm boron doped layer and c-Si is about 23 mΩ· cm<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Finally, p<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contact is applied in c-Si solar cells together with n<sup>+</sup> poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contact as front surface field. The poly-poly solar cell of the highest quality has the following electrical performance: <i>V</i><sub>oc</sub> is 648 mV, <i>J</i><sub>sc</sub> is 35.9 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, <i>FF</i> is 73.1% and <i>η</i> is 17.0%. A roadmap to realize 22% is given by addressing the bottlenecks of poly-Si(O<sub>x</sub>) passivating contacts based c-Si solar cells.<br","Sustainable Energy; solar cell; passivating contact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The very factors that make this a viable solution ---such as the availability of diverse crowd workers on-demand--- also lead to great challenges. The ever-changing pool of online workers powering conversations with individual users makes it particularly difficult to generate contextually consistent responses from a single user's standpoint. To tackle this, prior work has employed conversational facts extracted by workers to maintain a global memory, albeit with limited success. Leveraging systematic context in affective crowdsourcing tasks has remained unexplored. Through a controlled experiment, we explored if a conversational agent, dubbed ContextBot, can provide workers with the required context on the fly for successful completion of affective support tasks in CPCS, and explore the impact of ContextBot on the response quality of workers and their interaction experience. To this end, we recruited workers (N=351) from the Prolific crowdsourcing platform and carried out a 3*3 factorial between-subjects study. Experimental conditions varied based on (i) whether or not context was elicited and informed by motivational interviewing techniques (MI, non-MI, and chat history), and (ii) different conversational entry points for workers to produce responses (early, middle, and late). Our findings showed that workers who entered the conversation earliest were more likely to produce highly consistent responses after interacting with ContextBot. Better user experience from workers was expected after they interacted with ContextBot at a late entry. We found that interacting with ContextBot through task completion did not negatively impact workers' cognitive load.","crowd-powered conversational systems; conversational interfaces; motivational interviewing; dialogue context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Large-scale UAV applications make reliable UAV navigation a pressing need. Traditionally, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is extensively used as the primary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service. However, GNSS is vulnerable to intentional radio interference such as spoofing, jamming, and repeating. Hence, alternative PNT (APNT) attracted many researchers' attention. <br/><br/>In this thesis, instead of GNSS signals, ADS-B signals from piloted aircraft are leveraged for UAV navigation. We propose a cooperative navigation strategy for multiple UAVs in GNSS-denied environments. It consists of: 1) a system-level, leader-follower cooperative strategy; 2) a sensor fusion algorithm for individual UAV navigation based on the extended Kalman filter. Furthermore, the effects of asynchronous clocks are studied and a joint relative positioning and synchronization algorithm is applied to tackle this problem. <br/><br/>Finally, Monte Carlo experiments in a multi-UAV scene are performed to verify the proposed algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a performance comparable to civilian GNSS on the selected data set and under the system assumptions we made. Moreover, the proposed cooperative navigation framework only needs one ground station of limited service capacity as external aid. Compared with large-scale, specialized terrestrial APNT service networks, our proposed framework is more flexible and the system can be deployed in areas without infrastructure.","Navigation; Sensor fusion; ADS-B; Extended Kalman Filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

For instance, by providing cooking inspiration to customers through a recently launched recipe page in the app. This feature presents new recipes weekly and allows customers to easily add the ingredients to their shopping basket. It has raised interest in finding out what dishes customers are cooking as it could be helpful in choosing recipes for the page, predicting which articles are forgotten before checkout, and building a recipe recommender system. Hence, this work proposes two models to detect dish types in Picnic deliveries. The problem is scoped to detect main meals from a specified list of dish types in deliveries which were ordered in the Netherlands. The first model, named the Frequent Itemset Model, applies unsupervised learning techniques. First the articles in the deliveries are pre-processed by removing certain articles, choosing the representation of articles, and cleaning the text. The itemsets which represent core ingredients are obtained by applying techniques such as frequent itemset mining, association rule mining, and hierarchical clustering. In the final step itemsets are matched to dish types with the use of programmatic labelling and fuzzy string matching. Newly available labelled data enables the creation of a second model, referred to as the Supervised Learning Model, which applies supervised learning techniques. Features are selected and extracted. Multiple machine learning models, some in combination with binary relevance, are compared. The models are evaluated on two datasets: a large, weakly labelled dataset obtained through the recipe page, and a very small, manually labelled dataset with deliveries from a single customer. It is challenging to evaluate the performance of the models, since no large, truly labelled dataset is available. The results do indicate that the Frequent Itemset Model is able to detect common dish types, and that the Supervised Learning Model is able to detect dish types which are similar to the Picnic recipes it has trained on. Multiple suggestions are made for future work, such as obtaining a larger variety of labelled data and redefining the class labels. The contribution of this work is the formulation of the problem, two proposed solutions, insights into the challenges, and suggestions for future work.","Dishes; Recipes; Online grocery; Multi-label classification; Unsupervised learning; Supervised learning; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-26","","","","Computer Science","",""

However, at the same time, opportunity management is not practised very well. Under risk management, threats and opportunities are identified and managed. In practise, opportunities are overlooked while threats receive more attention. Numerous barriers to the practical use of opportunity management have been identified by researchers. Eight of the twelve barriers were found to be connected to organisational procedures and competencies. This study looked at competencies and took advice from entrepreneurs in an effort to overcome such barriers. This study aims to shed light on project managers' and entrepreneurs' perspectives on the competencies that could facilitate practising opportunity management and identify solutions to enhance opportunity management. <br/><br/>Project managers' and entrepreneurs' perspectives were compared using the Q-methodology. Q-analysis resulted in low cumulative explained variance (42%). The similarities and differences between the perspectives of project managers and entrepreneurs were examined in light of the Q-analysis findings. Entrepreneurial or shared competencies, such opportunity (s10), creativity (s4), and leadership (s8), received the highest overall ratings. The lowest rated competencies, in comparison, are self-management (s26), governance, structure, and processes (s7), and compliance, standards, and regulations (s2). Business developers entering a project in the conceptualisation phase found resourcefulness (s22), vision (s34) and personal communication (s12) more important. Whereas project managers are involved in the execution phase of a project, they found negotiation (s9), time (s33) and procurement (s16) more critical for opportunity management. Project managers' and business developers' differing perspectives are the result of (1) their involvement in different stages of the project and (2) their different project roles. <br/><br/>The difference in opinion can be overcome by increasing coherence between project managers and business developers. Project managers need to move their focal point to business oriented by fostering opportunities in alignment with the project portfolio, and opportunities in the direction of the project portfolio will help deliver portfolio benefits. According to this research, it is advised to involve the project manager in the project's conceptualization stage, and the business developer must continue to be involved during the project's initial execution stage. It will give both parties the chance to look at one another's work, gather ideas from one another, and develop a market opportunity that is viable enough to take advantage of. To identify opportunities, project managers must consider organisational strategy and portfolio benefits. Project managers should foster an environment where team members who are working in isolation can communicate and exchange ideas with people from different disciplines.

In order to accelerate this transition, it is necessary to explore and adopt more innovative and sustainable solutions within the construction and waste sector. A small amount of waste including materials and elements from the construction projects is being reused after End-of-Life phase, and this issue must be optimized considerably. On the other hand, the aforementioned sector suffers from the lack of a centralized and harmonized data platform which can contribute either to advancing of CE transition by optimizing reusability or the collaboration among the stakeholders involved in the deconstruction process. There are still various sustainable and circular issues that need to be taken into consideration when realizing, developing and enriching a newly designed data sources. Therefore, this research is aimed to conceptualize and develop a ‘Circular Construction Element (CCE) Information System’ as a tool which consists of an import sheet, an analysis and processing sheet and a dashboard. The ‘CCE Information System’ takes into account the functional performance characteristics of the existing elements and also the cost-related issues of the stakeholders involved in the deconstruction for reuse process. The developed tool is therefore intended to support various stakeholders in the decision-making process regarding reusing the existing elements.<br/>In this study, different functional performance properties of the existing concrete elements have been analyzed and it can be concluded that those characteristics depends largely on functional properties of the substances used in them. On the other hand, there are a large number of stakeholders involved in deconstruction process with different ambitions and benefits. The research showed that deconstruction for reuse is an uneconomic process for the actors, as this process requires more time, manpower, equipment and costly interventions. By measuring the Reuse Potential (RP) factor from a functional (qualitative) and economic (quantitative) perspective, it is possible to indicate the extent to which the functional residual value and also the profitability of reuse of the element is. The developed tool has been applied in real cases and the results showed that the existing elements have sufficient functional reuse potential value, but this depends largely on the function of the newly designed projects. Furthermore, the reuse cost including deconstruction and other associated costs can be optimized by the proposed tool. Thus, based on the results obtained by applying the CCE information system in real cases, it can be concluded that the existing elements can be kept in a closed loop by finding the elements and linking them to the most suitable project from a functional and economic point of view. Moreover, the client and the contractor (demolition company) can deal with many costs uncertainties, including benefits and loss. These parties may also face different uncertainties that can arise due to many other reasons such as the exceedance of process time, additional labor costs, and uncertainties regarding salvage value. Therefore, it can highly be recommended to analyze the impact of those uncertainties on the deconstruction cost and consequently on the reuse and other associated costs as these uncertainties will take into consideration in the deconstruction process.","Circularity; Reusability; Functional Performance Characteristics; Construction Elements; Cost of Reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Despite the extensiveliterature that can be found on desalination, limited information is availableabout the practical comparison of the technologies with regards to the brineconcentration performance and associated energy consumption. This thesis studyaims to contribute to bridging this knowledge gap by comparing reverse osmosis(RO), electrodialysis (ED) and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD). RO wasstudied by simulations using WAVE software, while ED and VMD were studied byperforming lab-scale experiments. Feed NaCl concentrationsbetween 20 and 80 g/L were considered in this study. The achievedconcentration factor (CF) for RO was greatly influenced by the feedconcentration. It was found that applying higher netdriving pressures resulted in higher recoveries, but recoveries are limited by feed concentration. In the VMDstudy, the correlation between operating temperatures and permeate flux wasfound to be positive. A decrease in permeate flux wasobserved with increasing solute content, which is related to the vapourpressure lowering phenomena. It was found that the effect of operatingtemperature on permeate flux is greater than the effect of the feedconcentration. Condensation contributed to the highest energy consumption(81%), followed by the vacuum pump (18.9%). Efficient heating andcooling pumps result in a significant energy consumption decrease. In the ED study it was found that applying different current density (CD) did not influence the CF, so it ismore advantageous to apply lower CD to achieve the same desalination from anenergy saving point of view. Furthermore, the CF decreased with increasing feedconcentration and thistrend intensifies with larger volume ratios. The effectof absolute water transport became more significant at higher feedconcentrations and resulted in overall dilution of the concentrate stream. Thedistribution of mass transport was similar for different volume ratios, meaningthat higher CF can be achieved by larger volume ratios. Higher energy consumptionwas related to higher feed concentration and higher volume ratios resulted in higherenergy consumption due to smaller concentrate volume.RO, VMD and ED proved to be suitabletechnologies for concentrating different NaCl solutions. RO and ED showed verysimilar concentration performance and energy consumption. The concentration limit for RO was 118g/L, while for ED it was 140 g/L. RO was able to achieve higher CF with lowerenergy consumption at concentrations &lt; 60 g/L, compared to ED. EDoutperforms RO at concentrations &gt; 60 g/L. Theenergy consumption of ED and RO can be reduced by applying a multi-stageconfiguration. The VMD results showed that the energy consumptionto achieve a similar CF as RO and ED, increased by a factor of 61. VMD is moreadvantageous at higher feed concentrations and even more so with waste heat. VMD and RO are suitable for cases that require high qualitypermeate whereas ED is not. The technologies could also be applied togetherto minimize waste production, whilst prioritizing concentration.","brine treatment; water treatment; electrodialysis; vacuum membrane distillation; reverse osmosis; membrane technology; concentration performance; energy consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-26","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Since the late 16th century, it has given researchers a better understanding of cell processes and greatly advanced healthcare. In this century, Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized optical microscopy by breaking the optical diffraction limit. Sparsely activating emitters in a sample labeled with fluorophores, the object can be reconstructed by estimating their positions using the system point spread function (PSF). These localization algorithms are the state of the art<br/>in optical imaging, using unbiased estimators to reach the theoretical minimum uncertainty, or Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB).<br/>While SMLM works well when emitters are sparsely activated, overlap of the emitter images is inevitable for thick or densely labeled samples. When SMLM is used on such images, the estimates become biased and the algorithm cannot find the correct number of emitters. Most techniques also make a deterministic estimate and are incapable of representing the uncertainty of estimates for dense samples. <br/>A three-dimensional, Bayesian multiple emitter fitting algorithm is constructed using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). While following the structure of Bayesian multiple-emitter fitting (BAMF), novel RJMCMC moves are designed to sample the parameters. The algorithm also jumps through models, estimating the number of emitters. It asymptotically samples from the posterior, revealing uncertainties in three-dimensional imaging that other techniques are incapable of imaging. <br/>The algorithm was tested with astigmatic and biplane imaging. It has proven capable of consistently finding the correct model when a prior on emitter intensity is used. When separating two emitters, posterior density reconstruction revealed non-Gaussian emitter position uncertainties. Upon further investigation, the posterior density was found to be multimodal, with<br/>both modes representative of the data and indistinguishable in terms of likelihood. This shows the algorithm can quantify three-dimensional PSF degeneracy and can become a vital tool for researchers to analyze their imaging setup. We also expect it to be especially effective when combined with modulation-enhanced localization microscopy (meLM) techniques.","Imaging Physics; Single Molecule Localization Microscopy; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo; Multimodality; SMLM; PSF; PSF degeneracy; MCMC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This waiting time is partly caused by the unavailability of resources, the pilots, tugboats and linesmen in the port. Therefore, the question arises if the waiting time could be reduced by making use of more resources. The goal of this research is to find a relationship between the waiting time for incoming and outgoing vessels due to the use of a different amount of pilots and tugboats and the costs of these resources. A model has been built to simulate the port call processes. By altering the resources in the system, the effect on the waiting times is evaluated. The results show that by adding more resources the waiting time decreases. The most effective way to decrease the waiting times is by investing in multiple resources at once. Due to their strong correlation, waiting times of vessels can increase when investing in a single resource, but by choosing a suitable composition of resources, the waiting time will be decreased. It would be interesting to examine variables which cause vessels to wait other than the unavailability of resources. The ”first come first serve” principle is proven to be inefficient, but is still used by the port of Antwerp. Thereby, the influence uncertainties in the system caused by incorrect expected time of arrivals and mechanical failure is an intriguing subject for further research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Maritime Operations and Management","",""

The researchers at TU Delft have developed a state-of-art tool called Mitigation Controller© (MitC) for automating the search for finding the most cost-effective set of mitigation measures to ensure the probability of the project's completion at a required level. However, there is a modelling error in the project network diagram of this tool. The risks and uncertainties are modelled using a Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distribution. The current Mitigation Controller has managed<br/>to recreate the human-oriented selection of mitigation measures, but it has not considered all possible scenarios within a complex construction project.<br/><br/>PERT is the most straightforward distribution used for explanatory purposes. This does not reflect reallife conditions. There are instances where certain activities are repeated when the result does not meet the required quality. To overcome the limitations of PERT, it is suggested to implement the Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) for scheduling construction projects. A new code<br/>is integrated into the existing Mitigation Controller to generate new network paths based on the probabilistic nature of the project activity. The novel network structure is used to compute the optimal set of mitigation measures using Monte Carlo analysis and linear optimisation. It is also observed that the optimisation solver takes a substantial amount of time to compute depending on the number of activities on the project. An efficient Monte Carlo analysis is implemented to reduce optimisation time within the tool.","Mitigation Controller; Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS); GERT; Multiple Branching; Probabilistic Branching; Mixed Integer Linear Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-26","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, even though the Renovation Wave was aimed to tackle energy poverty, recent studies have shown that renovation policies have failed to address energy poverty as renovation and social policies lack intersectoral integration resulting in the exclusion of vulnerable groups and an increased risk of social inequity. Moreover, various scholars have tried to identify vulnerability indicators that give rise to energy poverty; however, these have only focused on identifying socio-<br/>economic and energy indicators. Consequently, scholars have called to include justice in renovation policies and explore how vulnerable groups can be identified. To address this knowledge gap, the following main research question was formulated: <br/><br/><b>Using a Case-Study Mixed Methods (CS-MM) approach, how can justice be included in renovation policies considering the socio-spatial vulnerability to energy poverty?<br/></b><br/>The results showed that by identifying vulnerable groups based on a locally developed index of the socio-spatial vulnerability to energy poverty and acknowledging their vulnerability, recognitional justice can be included in renovation policies. Besides, identifying tailored policy strategies in a multi-stakeholder environment that, on the one hand, focus on the distribution of renovation resources based on the needs and characteristics of the identified vulnerable groups and, on the other hand, on how the vulnerable groups can be included in the decision-making, distributional and procedural justice can be included in renovation policies. Thus, it can be concluded that by deploying the current CS-MM approach, justice can be included. <br/>The outcomes of the present study are twofold. Firstly, from a scientific perspective, the present study contributes to the current body of scientific knowledge on: (1) how vulnerable groups in need of renovation can be identified, (2) how justice can be included in renovation policies to address energy poverty and (3) how a CS-MM approach can be deployed to research how justice can be included in renovation policies considering the socio-spatial vulnerability to energy poverty. Secondly, from a societal perspective, this study provides insights to improve policy strategies that enable local decision-makers to identify vulnerable groups and include justice in renovation, considering the socio-spatial vulnerability to energy poverty.","Renovation Wave; Energy Poverty; Case-Study Mixed Methods; Renovation; Socio-Spatial Vulnerability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-26","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","52.3080, 4.9715"

(graduation committee); Salomons, A.M. (mentor); Yuan, Y. (mentor); Atasoy, B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Bicycles have an important role to play in the transition towards a more sustainable mobility. In order to achieve the modal shift towards bicycles, more must be done to accommodate cyclists. Although controlled intersections do increase the (perceived) safety of crossings with motorized vehicles, they are seen as major obstacles, and cyclists tend to avoid them when possible. The negative effects of controlled intersections for cyclists may be reduced by new methods of intersection control. This thesis combines the concepts of the connected environment and structure free control, to design an intersection controller that uses a genetic algorithmto determine the optimal signal plan, hereafter referred to as the SFGA controller. The controller is designed for an isolated intersection and considers car drivers and cyclists. Desires of cyclist with regard to controlled intersections, are identified by means of a literature review on the determinants of bicycle use, which are then projected on the controlled intersection. A traffic system model, based on validated models found in literature, is set up and a design for the structure free controller is proposed. A set of control objectives is proposed, including different metrics related to the desires of cyclists and car drivers. Objective function weights can be varied to achieve different levels of cyclist prioritization. A maximumwaiting time of 100 seconds is enforced in order to prevent prioritization of cyclists to result in unreasonable delays for car drivers, because red light running probabilities increase at larger waiting times. The performance of the structure free controller is evaluated for 15, 35 and 45% traffic saturation (percentage of intersection capacity), by means of a simulation based case study. The designed controller is benchmarked to vehicle actuated control (VA). VA has a cyclic, fixed control structure in which green times of movements are flexible and depend on the queue size. SFGA is benchmarkedwith an equalweight for the delay of car drivers and cyclists, and no weight included for the number of stops. The effect of incorporating weights that prioritize the desires of cyclists over those of car drivers is investigated. The SFGA controller results in average delays 1.8, 2.7 and 3.0 times lower than VAC for each of the evaluated traffic saturation levels. The number of stops is 1.9, 2.3 and 3.1 times lower. Including weights in the objective function to explicitly prioritize cyclists, results in even lower average delays and number of stops for cyclists. As is to be expected, this comes at the cost of additional delays for car drivers, especially for higher traffic saturation. The better performance of SFGA is attributed to two main differences between the controllers. First of all, the structure free aspect allows for a larger degree of freedom to choose more effective combinations of traffic lights to show green at the same time, instead of following the fixed sequence of VA. Additionally, the controller allows traffic that otherwise would experience the largest total delay to cross first, even if this means delaying some travellers in close proximity of the traffic light. This contrary to VA, that extends green time based on detected traffic in the active block. Without inclusion of weights that prioritize the desires of cyclist over cars, the controller already tends towards prioritization of the cyclists. This is caused by the controller considering the number of travellers that are influenced by its’ control decisions, combined with the higher traffic densities, that can be expected on bicycle paths in urban areas. Weights to prioritize cyclists can be included to include more priority, for example when bicycle traffic volumes are low. This work implicates that, in order to better serve the cyclists, it is not explicitly required to prioritize cyclists over cars. In areas with large volumes of cyclists, considering the number of travellers and their proximity to the traffic light can already result in cyclists being served better. This work could be used as a starting point or inspiration to design and eventually implement more cyclist oriented intersection controllers. Improvements for the controller and extensions for the research scope are proposed that are required for the controller to be suitable for practical implementation in the real world. If a future version of the controller is to be implemented, it will reduce the negative effects of controlled intersections on cyclists, thereby making the bicycle a more suitable replacement for the car.","Bicycle; Connected Vehicles; Genetic Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Two WWT systems are studied: one is the current WWT facility operating in La Llagosta, Barcelona, Spain (reference system), and the other is one of the case studies of the Water Mining (WM) project (original system). The WM project aims to apply innovative approaches to recover clean water and other resources from municipal and industrial wastewater and seawater.<br/>Social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) was applied to evaluate the social performances of organizations in a site-specific assessment and to assess the social risks along the systems’ value chains in a generic assessment through PSILCA.

The results of the former indicate that the organizations performed relatively well in both systems. However, improvements are needed in some subcategories. Moreover, after accounting for each organization’s share and allocating the results, the original system’s performance is better than the reference system in most subcategories. For each organization that did not achieve the acceptable level (Basic Requirement), suggestions for improvement are offered. Finally, although social performances could be linked to a product and multifunctionality could be solved, the results must be interpreted with caution in light of the limitations of S-LCA.

By spreading the emitted energy out over time, vibrator sources are perceived to be less intrusive to marine mammals. It is also believed that vibrators have greater control of the emitted source wavelet than can be achieved with traditional airguns. With the added control, it is possible to only emit portions of the frequency spectrum, which in turn allows for many applications such as deblending and the ability to avoid masking mammal communications. To effectively implement these, two methodologies are proposed to interpolate the frequency data that are not emitted. The first is a deep learning approach utilizing a U-Net architecture, with a custom frequency loss function. The second is a sparse optimization method that approximates the reflectivity series of the subsurface using known frequency content. By assuming that the signal can be represented sparsely and that all frequencies interact with the subsurface interfaces similarly at all frequencies, the frequency spectrum can be reconstructed. Both of the presented methods are tasked to interpolate the missing frequency band(s) in North Sea shot data. It is found that both methods are able to interpolate narrow 2.5 Hz bands, but are unable to accurately reconstruct wider (ex. 10 Hz), frequency bands. Overall, the U-Net shows better results than the sparse optimization method when the frequency gaps are positioned closely.<br","Machine learning; marine seismic; interpolation; frequency domain; Sparse Solvers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

Evidence suggests a correlation between microcirculation during reperfusion and post-implantation organ functionality. Optical methods can measure the organ microcirculation in real-time in-vivo. Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI), Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Sidestream Dark Field Imaging (SDFI) were evaluated on this purpose during NMP of porcine slaughterhouse kidneys.<br/><b>METHODS </b>An experiment consisting of steady-state NMP and intervention phases was designed. In the intervention phases, the pressure control was decreased and increased in steps and a main branch of the arteria renalis was clamped for three periods with each a consecutive reperfusion phase. Moreover, conventional functionality assessments, such as perfusate analysis, were performed. The microcirculations of the kidneys were imaged or measured with one of the optical methods throughout the experiment. <br/><b>RESULTS </b>Consistent responses to the interventions were observed in the LSCI signals. Moreover, some significant correlation was found between these signals and conventional functionality assessments. The signals measured with NIRS showed some trend in response to the interventions. However, these were not as consistent as in the LSCI signals.

However, sign language remains one of the input types that has not been looked upon. Although numerous amount of people around the world use sign language as their primary language, there have not been many efforts to include them in these technological landscapes. In this thesis, we hope to draw attention to and take a step towards the inclusion of deaf and mute people in microtask crowdsourcing. <br/>We identify some of the existing technical and research gaps in the current architectures for Sign Language Recognition/Translation in a real-time setting. Next, we determine various microtasks which can be adapted to use sign language as input, keeping in mind the challenges it introduces. We, then, investigate the effectiveness of a system that uses sign language as input by building a web application - SignUpCrowd - for microtask crowdsourcing, namely Visual Question Answering and Tweet Sentiment Analysis tasks, and comparing it with already prevalent input types such as text and click. This comparison with different popular input types will help understand how much of a difference there is for sign language as input. In addition, it will also show the preference of input types for the particular microtasks. For this, we developed three web applications with different input types and conducted a between-subject experimental study on Prolific wherein a number of workers (N=240) were asked to perform the above-mentioned tasks using sign language, text, and click input. Our results indicate that, in terms of task completion time and task accuracy, sign language as an input modality in microtask crowdsourcing is not significantly different from other, commonly used, input types. We also noticed that people's input type preference for the given microtasks for sign language was more than text input. Although people with no knowledge of sign language found it difficult, this input modality aims at a different target audience. This shows us that there is scope for sign language as an input type for microtask crowdsourcing among people, and paves the way for more efforts for the introduction of sign language in real-world applications.","Crowdsourcing; Sign Language; Input Modality","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://osf.io/n8pca/?view_only=fc7bf6ab55d6482f83ff2729c25b937f","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The chosen method of aeration is over-extraction, where suction pressure is created causing ambient air to intrude into the landfill. Aeration induces enhanced settlement due to the acceleration of aerobic degradation of the waste. The aeration infrastructure comprises 110 wells, separated by around 10 to 15 m, covering an area of approximately 5 ha. This study analysed the spatial and temporal variability of settlement of the landfill, and aimed to correlate this with the carbon extracted by the wells. In order to quantify the settlement of the landfill various remote sensing methods have been utilised and compared. The methods include an Aerial Laser Scanner (ALS), Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements from a rover. In total 11 GNSS surveys, 4 TLS point clouds, and 2 ALS point clouds were available to this study.<br/><br/>Ground settlement plates have been measured using the GNSS rover since the start of aeration, showing a maximum settlement of ∼1.17 m on the western slope from August 2017 to June 2022. The slopes of the landfill experience more settlement than the top of the landfill, as a plate installed on the top only<br/>experienced ∼ 0.09 m over this same time period. This is due to the increased surface area of the landfill exposed to the outside air at the slopes. The UAV-based ALS and TLS point clouds were able to measure spatial and temporal variations in settlement. Whereas the trends in settlement are consistent between the methods, the absolute values show notable variance. The ALS and TLS data contain significant uncertainty due to the effect of vegetation on the landfill, to which this variance can almost entirely be attributed. At its peak the vegetation contributed to a difference of 0.95 m in settlement, compared to the GNSS measured settlement. Several processing steps were taken to help negate the effect, but these were not able to fully filter vegetation out. ALS data was impacted to a lesser extent due to the high angle of incidence of its laser<br/>signals as it flies overhead, because of this the signals generally penetrated the vegetation to a deeper depth than the TLS.<br/><br/>The aeration wells extracted 2583 tonnes of carbon from August 2017 to March 2022. Both visually and through the Pearson Correlation Coefficient clear correlations were observed between the variability of settlement and carbon extraction by the wells. The highest correlation coefficient reached was 0.503 using GNSS and gas data from August 2021 to March 2022, signifying a strong correlation.<br","LiDAR; GNSS; Landfill; Aeration; TLS; ALS; Point Cloud; Settlement; Netherlands; CURE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

However, new technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, speech-to-speech translation, and so on are available now. These developments provide new opportunities to support all processes in the consultation room, of which communication between doctor and patient will be revolutionized. During the pandemic, the benefits and broad prospects of teleconsultation gradually entered the public consciousness and gained acceptance. However, for patients, going to the doctor is about more than just convenience and efficiency. Patients who are ill frequently experience significant anxiety, feeling lost and uncertain about their condition and future plans. According to Tyrer (2013), 10% to 20% of general hospital patients have abnormal health anxiety. As a result, the future of teleconsultation should consider patients' vulnerability and emotional needs.<br/><br/>This project aims to explore how to alleviate patient anxiety in teleconsultation contexts in 2030. The following sub-questions are proposed to structure the final RQ:<br/>SQ-1: What are the key influencing factors of patients’ anxiety?<br/>SQ-2: How can technologies be used to alleviate anxiety? / Where do the design opportunities lie?<br/>SQ-3: How to align the technologies/ideas with the desired future vision?<br/><br/>The project is divided into five stages to answer these questions:<br/><br/>Understand: A literature review and expert interviews will be conducted to fully comprehend the research context.

Although is a service that dates all the way back to 1882, it has managed to regain interest in the recent years due to the constant electrification of various aspects of the world. This comes as a response towards environmental challenges as, even today, the majority of the energy necessary to cover our need comes from fossil fuels, making the transition to renewable energy sources more vital. One promising form of renewable energy source is solar energy and its use with photovoltaic (PV) systems. An interesting implementation of such systems is in catenary grids like trolleybus grids. Nevertheless, their integration has a low potential as the gaps in the trolleybus schedule and the intermittent behavior of the PV electric power leave a lot of excess PV electric energy unused. Possible solutions to this problem could be either the storage of this excess energy in on-board energy storage systems (OESS) or stationary energy storage systems (SESS). Besides that, in preparation for the future, more attention is given every day to the multifunctionality of trolleybus grids. This is related to parameters such as voltage drops, that have important role in rendering the trolleybus grid capable of being expanded with components other than trolleybuses, such as electric vehicle chargers.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis work is to find out which energy storage systems (on-board or stationary) are most favorable for a PV-powered multifunctional trolleybus grid for increasing the PV system utilization and improving its multifunctionality. Parameters related to the multifunctionality of trolleybus grids can be the yearly electric energy consumption and the voltage drops.<br/><br/>For the conduction of this work is used an existing, verified trolleybus grid model of Arnhem in MATLAB that has realistic trolleybus electric power profiles as an input. By using the backward-forward sweep method are determined precise values such as the total electric power needed, voltage drops, ohmic losses and more. Also, is used as an existing, verified PV system model that provides the PV electric power as an output based on measured data. Then is developed a model for the on-board energy storage system which with the help of a constraint checking algorithm, that simulates the energy storage technologies, it provides new, adjusted trolleybus electric power profiles that are used as input to the trolleybus grid model. Finally, for the stationary energy storage system, the main trolleybus grid model is expanded with storage capabilities based on voltage control and a similar constraint checking algorithm for the storage technologies.<br/><br/>The results show that the impact of stationary energy storage systems on the PV system utilization and on parameters of the trolleybus grid in general is heavily correlated to the control strategy used. The technology, the PV system size, the trolleybus grid section, and the targeted outcome (improve the PV system utilization or reduce the voltage drops) have key role to the selection of the control strategy. The comparison of stationary energy storage systems to other energy storage systems cannot be straightforward. Besides that, on-board energy storage systems can perform better on parameters regarding the multifunctionality of the trolleybus grid such as the total yearly electric energy consumption and the mitigation of the severity of the voltage drops. On the other hand, stationary energy storage systems can perform well on a wide range of parameters according to their control strategy. For the one used in this work, they perform better on parameters regarding the PV system utilization, managing to have a positive impact.","trolleybus; PV; multifunctional; on-board; stationary; OESS; SESS; energy storage system; photovoltaic; PV system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-26","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","51.9851034, 5.8987296"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The need for more efficient aircraft has spawned the conception of a variety of novel engine and aircraft architectures, such as the combined-cycle engine proposed by researchers at Delft University of Technology. To evaluate the potential benefits of these concepts comprehensively, in-depth performance simulations are required. Furthermore, penalties with regard to weight and drag are critical considerations, thus new engine technologies must be evaluated within their full airframe-level integration and mission profile. Accurate weight estimations of a variety of design alternatives are therefore necessary in order to properly assess the validity of such technologies and to reach an optimal design with respect to the tradeoffs between weight, drag, and efficiency. No weight estimation tools with sufficient accuracy are publically available at present, thus a new, component-based preliminary engine design tool, named ‘Weight Estimation of Aeronautical Gas Turbine Engines’ (or WEST), was developed. WEST can be used to predict the weight of novel engine architectures to a reasonable degree of accuracy, all the while accounting for sensitivity to design parameters such as turbine inlet temperature, overall pressure ratio, mass flow rate, power, and choice of turbomachinery configuration. Similar methodologies are able to design components worth between 60 and 110% of the actual weight of an existing engine, whereas WEST was able to account for about 70-90%, thus exceeding initial expectations and improving the reliability of the estimations. This tool can therefore be used to estimate the weight of a variety of existing engines, and is sufficiently flexible to model novel architectures as well, since the results are based on the application-specific design of real engine components. Among the potential uses of WEST, a promising one would be to evaluate the weight of a large set of designs for a particular application. Upon these estimates, single-equation surrogate models could be developed using statistical regression, allowing for these equations to be used as a more computationally-efficient weight estimation methodology in a wide range of aircraft-level design and optimization studies. These equations would build upon the work described in this paper and could be used to accelerate the development and introduction of new aircraft-related technologies.","Gas Turbine; Weight Estimation; Aircraft; Engine; Design; Sustainability; Turbofan; Turboshaft; Combined Cycle; Organic Rankine Cycle; Waste Heat; Recovery; Thermal; Efficiency; Power Unit; CFM56; PW2037","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Airborne Energy Harvesting for Aircraft (ARENA)",""

The energy infrastructure in the Netherlands will be a critical factor in achieving these goals. As an extension to the stated importance, understanding the current energy infrastructure is equally significant. Models often form the base of understanding such complex systems. Unfortunately, the modelling environment of the Dutch energy infrastructure is fragmented. There exists no one model that is able to give comprehensive oversight in order to provide policy makers with the information needed to facilitate key energy policy decisions. However, there is a variety of models present that each clarify their own piece of the puzzle. Therefore it is the ambition of the TU Delft and partners to create a multi-model infrastructure that is able to couple existing energy models in order to facilitate comprehensive energy policy creation. This thesis is part of the research needed in order to achieve this higher goal. <br/><br/>The main conclusion of the conducted research is that the problem described in the main research question can be answered by using a coupling process based on audits, comprised of questions aimed at detecting issues and checking the effectivity of the means to solve the issues. These audits have proven successful in completing two different multi-resolution multi-modelling coupling case studies. The process entails (for a two-model coupling) a separate model audit for each model, leading to a coupling audit using both models and finally to the realisation of the coupling itself. Adherance to the process standardises the way couplings are created to a degree. Because of this, model audits done for one coupling could for example be re-used at a later date for another one. This provides value over old coupling methods, which were often done individually in an ad-hoc manner.","Multi-Resolution Modelling; Multi-Modelling; Aggregation Disaggregation; Energy Modelling; Consistency maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","Multi-model.nl, Towards a multi-model infrastructure for integrated decision-making in the energy transition","52.00253889542042, 4.369310484566606"

Firstly, an attitude controller is designed that solves the over actuated system of tiltrotor’s longitudinal cyclic and elevator pitch control by using a weighted least squares control allocation method. Secondly, an incremental based velocity controller is designed which integrates the use of the tiltrotor nacelles. The controllers have been tested against attitude and speed tracking tasks to evaluate their performance. The attitude controller showed to be able to follow the reference signal while adjusting to the changing aircraft dynamics. In combination with the velocity controller, the aircraft was able to follow a complete speed profile starting from the tiltrotor’s helicopter mode to the final fixed-wing mode and back.

When coupling this to an ongoing trend of urbanization in many places across the world, the energy systems of our cities become of particular interest. However, the transition away from a fossil fuel based system towards a renewable energy based system is a complex sociotechnical process that in part relies on the extent to which households are able to adopt energy efficient technologies. Not all households are equally capable of investing in these technologies, causing some households to have better access to participate in the renewable energy transition. This unequal access to the renewable energy transition causes an unequitable distribution of energy efficient technologies and could potentially lock-in or perpetuate current injustices. To prevent this from happening there is a need for energy policy that supports socioeconomic groups across society, that have inadequate access to the renewable energy transition. In order to design such policy it is essential to first of all identify who these groups are, and secondly where they are located. As the renewable energy transition is still in its early stages, these insights are currently lacking in literature.<br/><br/>Considering the fact that solar PV is a major driver of the renewable energy transition, this thesis in part addresses this knowledge gap by spatially analyzing which socioeconomic groups in the urban environment lack access to solar PV and where these groups are located. Access to solar PV in this context is defined as: the freedom of individuals or households to decide whether or not to adopt residential solar PV energy resources, dependent on the existence of one or more barriers. Secondly, does the research assess how access to solar PV resources spatially intersects with the ability to generate solar energy through these resources. The location that is selected as the area of study for this research is the city of The Hague, Netherlands. A framework is constructed to assess access to solar PV using the Theory of Planned Behavior originating from social sciences, which is frequently used to model adoption behavior of novel energy technologies. To evaluate the technical PV potential of the case-area the ArcGIS Solar Analyst Tool is applied. A K-means clustering analysis is performed to find any meaningful patterns in the distribution of access to solar PV across the area of study.<br/><br/>The key findings of this study are:<br/>•Access to solar PV resources is unequally distributed across the Hague. Large parts of The Hague have unfavorable characteristics for solar PV adoption.<br/>•The highest levels of technical PV potential are found in areas that are considered to have poor access to solar PV. As a consequence, currently the majority of technical PV potential within the case area is likely to remain unexploited due to poor access to solar PV within these areas.<br/>•There is a need for energy policy that focuses on the groups that have poor access to solar PV and are unserved by current energy policy focused on stimulating adoption of solar PV. These groups are non-home owners in the private rental sector, home-owners that share ownership of the roof of a shared building and households that are provided housing by social housing corporations.<br/><br/>Further research could focus on exploring and evaluating policy design that is aimed at supporting socioeconomic groups that currently lack access to the renewable energy transition. This is important in order to ensure that the renewable energy transition makes its way throughout all layers of society.<br","Solar PV adoption; Solar PV energy; Urban Environment; Renewable Energy Technologies; Energy Justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Many products are shipped to consumers from warehouses directly rather than being displayed in a physical retail store. Smooth and effective warehousing operations are more crucial with the increased dependency on warehouses nowadays. More than 130 key performance indicators (KPIs) exist for warehouses. Often a summarized and meaningful metric is desired to give an accurate evaluation of the overall warehouse performance (OWP). The most common method of measuring OWP used in the literature is done using data envelopment analysis (DEA). However, it is difficult to find empirical evidence that DEA has significantly improved performance evaluation and benchmarking in actual non-production conditions. A new method for measuring OWP is explored using a widely accepted overall metric in the manufacturing industry, namely overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). The use of OEE as a performance measure for warehouses or in logistics generally has not been researched extensively yet. The research problem lies in evaluating the overall performance of warehouses using a modified OEE framework. Therefore, a challenge to identify the components of a modified OEE for warehousing was present. Additionally, a modified OEE formula for the automated warehouse was made based on the major losses that occur in such warehouse. The nature of the items processed at a warehouse and the warehouse utilization stage impacts the KPIs to be considered by a modified OEE model. A framework for a modified OEE for warehouses was developed using these inputs. It was agreed that one of the main uses of an OWP measure lies in reporting performance to different stakeholders, mainly the warehouse contractor. Additionally, using OEE can give insight to areas of improvement which gives a science-based ground for continuous improvement. The research was done using a single case study in the inbound part of an automated warehouse for online clothing retail with an industry leader. Expanding this research into other warehouse areas is suggested, and a final OWP using a modified OEE model may be achieved after numerous iterations and case studies. Further quantitative analysis of the performance of OEE as an OWP can validate the results more. It is argued that a universal indicator of some sort using OEE can be achieved in the future, this can then be used for benchmarking alike warehouses.","Overall warehouse performance (OWP); Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE); KPI; Warehouse; OEE; Logistics; Supply Chain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The lack of space on land and up-scaling of turbine sizes led to the need of exploiting further away and harsher environments, where more space is available and there is arguably less of an impact on society. This together with a higher supply of wind resources has led to the development of large numbers of offshore wind farms, of which many are still to be built. Taking Europe as an example, currently the goal is to achieve at least 450[GW] of installed offshore wind power by the year 2050, of which only 25[GW] has been installed up until 2020. This sketches out the enormous challenge that is being tackled by governments and the public market as we speak. <br/>The market is a highly competitive one, where small increases in efficiency of one of the many complex steps within the development of offshore wind farms can make or brake companies and projects. The eventual goal of increasing the efficiency of the overall process, is to decrease the levelized cost of energy of a wind farm. One of the main approaches of increasing this efficiency, has been to up-scale wind turbines, in the last decades the size and power output of wind turbines has already more than doubled from an average of 3MW of installed power per wind turbine 15 years ago to an average of 8.2MW in 2020. This trend does not seem to stop any time soon, as wind turbines of 12-15MW are in active development. The industry has already expressed interest into turbines of 20-25MW and even beyond this. The turbines beyond these sizes will be referred to as Ultra Large Wind Turbines(ULWTs). Due to the size and weight of components of ULWTs traditional top-down installation techniques cannot be used anymore due to relative motion related difficulties during the mating of components. Thus, the following research question will be answered during the defence:<br/><br/>""What would be feasible novel on-site installation methods for a bottom founded Ultra Large Wind Turbines(ULWT) using floating vessels?""<br/><br/>During the research, the base case of, floating installation on a pre-installed jacket type foundation is used as a starting point for the generation of concepts. A total of 15 concepts has been generated and pooled with concepts proposed in the industry and academia. All these concepts were screened to find the most promising ones. These concepts were sequentially tested on their technical feasibility for use with ULWTs, to identify which concepts can possibly be used. The final step was to perform a comparative analysis of the economic feasibility of the technically feasible concepts, to identify the differences in performance and usability of the concepts. From the technically feasible concepts, two main approaches could be identified which are promising for the installation of ULWTs. Further work must be performed to identify the best option from these two and describe their overall economic feasibility. <br/>Self-climbers: Devices which climb the tower without assistance of an installation vessel. Especially interesting due to the fact that they can be used with existing mono-hull lifting vessels. Main downsides are the relatively low flexibility w.r.t. wind turbine size, usability and have a long installation time. They are promising, as they decouple the size of the installation vessel and size of the turbine entirely. <br/>Large semi-submersible vessels: Either using lifting equipment, so that existing vessels can be used. Or specifically designed vessels which provide large flexibility w.r.t. size of turbine and usability. Main downside are the size and costs of these vessels. They are promising, as they provide a platform on which the needed height can be reached effectively.<br","Instalaltion methods; Offshore wind turbines; Ultra Large Offshore wind turbines; Novel; Concepts; Concept generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","double degree of Master of Science in Offshore and Dredging Engineering at Delft University of Technology and M.Sc.

(mentor); Hoppe, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To achieve 23% renewable energy by 2025, 29% emission reduction by 2030, and net zero emission in 2060, Indonesia needs to accelerate the transition to renewable energy such as solar energy. Despite the abundant solar energy potential, the contribution of solar PV has only reached 0.05% of the energy mix in 2021 (MEMR, 2021). The development of solar PV face challenges such as land availability, land acquisition, geographical problem, and timely permits (Patil et al., 2017). A niche rooftop PV serves as an alternative to solve these problems. This study focuses on rooftop PV niche development in the sustainability transition of Indonesia. <br/>The sustainability transition is a complex process due to the involvement of various stakeholders (Geels et al., 2017). Moreover, Indonesia's high dependency on fossil fuels adds complexity to the transition. Therefore, it is necessary to study the development of rooftop PV in Indonesia to investigate factors influencing the niche development, address the sociotechnical aspect, and identify barriers and opportunities for broader diffusion. This research uses qualitative analysis by adopting Strategic niche management (SNM) with complementary insights from the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) and business model. A case study was selected to gain a clearer understanding of different rooftop PV business models in three provinces (Jakarta, Banten and West Java). The data collection was conducted using interviews with 15 respondents from various groups and desk research. The study aims to answer the question, “<i>How has the rooftop PV niche developed in Indonesia, and to what extent do business models influence niche development?</i>”<br/>The results show that rooftop PV was initially developed in the 1990s through a solar home system innovation in Sukatani village. Landscape factors influencing niche development are low electrification in rural areas, the Asian financial crisis, energy security, climate change, covid-19, and international market pressure. At the regime level, factors include development plan (e.g., Repelita), regulation (e.g., net-metering), and dominant stakeholder PLN (e.g., permit approval) founded influencing the niche development. Another factor, such as the learning process (e.g., demonstration project, survey, and knowledge transfer), provided learning to the technical, policy development, and public awareness. The result shows niche development of rooftop PV faces financial, institutional, policy, technical and awareness barriers. Niche actors have implemented business models to overcome the barriers. The host-owned business model is developed to provide access for the consumer to be prosumers who can benefit from the feed-in tariffs. The third-party business model enables users to overcome the high-upfront cost barriers. Meanwhile, the cooperative business model operated by KUD emerged using grants in the early 1990s to facilitate the coordination of the increased participation of international donors, banks, suppliers and villagers. However, the role of the cooperative business models has decreased due to the economic crisis and the decline in the use of rooftop PV in rural areas.<br/>Lastly, this study shows the importance of shielding strategies in supporting Indonesia’s rooftop PV niche development. Therefore, this thesis recommends that the government should consider and systematically use the shielding concept in formulating regulations on energy transition.<br","Rooftop PV; Indonesia; Strategic Niche Management; Multi-Level Perspective; Business Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This has resulted in an increase in global average temperature by ≈ 1.1 C in this period; and has sparked the concern of climate disaster events across the globe. In order to tackle the issue of climate change, research into Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) has gained prominence.<br/><br/>Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) B.V is a technology startup based in Delft, working on the CCU pathway for CDR. ZEF is developing micro plants to capture CO2 and H2O from the atmosphere using Direct Air Capture (DAC) system. The captured CO2 is then compressed to 50bar using compressors while<br/>H2O is split electro-chemically to H2 at 50bar. This high-pressure CO2 and H2 are then used to produce methanol. The energy for the whole process is derived from the sun, making the entire process sustainable and emission-free.<br/><br/>ZEF’s micro-plant will derive its raw materials i.e. CO2 and H2O, from the environment. Thus, variation in the environmental conditions, i.e., humidity, temperature, and solar radiation (external disturbances<br/>for the system), will affect the overall system output. Current work focused on the design of control scheme for the integrated DAC and CO2 compression system, which will be able to meet ZEF’s performance target. The effect of variation in solar radiation was not considered for this work.<br/><br/>At first, the performance parameters for the various sub-systems of the integrated DAC+FM system were identified. With this information, the operating scenarios and the process constraints for the system<br/>were identified. Then, models for the sub-systems of the DAC and compressor system, i.e., Absorber, sump, desorber, flash tank, and compressor system were developed. Parts of the model, the desorber and flash tank, were validated using experimental setup developed by integrating the existing DAC prototype at ZEF with a representative compression system.<br/><br/>The main target of the experimental setup was to develop control scheme to maintain the pressure of the flash tank to the required target levels. Through multiple iterations, the final layout and control system<br/>for the integrated setup was identified which was able to control the pressure of the flash tank at the<br/>target level.<br/><br/>Finally, a control scheme for DAC production control was developed based on the steady-state output from the desorber model. Through this, the feed and power (heat) input to the desorber is varied to control the production of CO2 and H2O. <br/><br/>The system model developed as part of this work can be further used as a tool by ZEF to integrate different sub-systems, test the performance of different sorbents and assess the viability of different control schemes for the integrated system","Direct Air Capture; Process Control; System modelling; Dynamic analysis; System integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-26","","","","","",""

The project aims to design a resonance-based test system to measure the lifetime curves of dielectric materials such as oil-impregnated paper and epoxy under high frequencies.<br/> <br/> The major components of this project are the H-Bridge Circuitry found on the low voltage side and the resonant transformer which is tuned with the test sample to be in resonance. The design techniques and critical factors for the design of gate driver circuits have been provided. Moreover, through simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB along with practical measurements using vector network analyzers the behaviour of the transformer equivalent circuit parameters with changes in geometry is discussed. Through this understanding, the critical parameters to design a test system to obtain the highest gain while in resonance have been highlighted. <br/> <br/> The final test setup is designed and is used to perform lifetime tests on oil-paper and epoxy samples, both materials exhibited different behaviour during the tests. Due to the high gain of the system, it is very sensitive to changes in the capacitance of the test object and hence a constant voltage is not applied to the oil-paper sample. Therefore the breakdown times cannot be considered for the lifetime curve. Recommendations are provided to improve the test setup. Epoxy showcased a different behaviour, it is observed that the linear voltage gain of the resonance system is lost once partial discharges are initiated, and the voltage across the test sample becomes constant even upon a further increase in the input voltage. Based on these observations recommendations are provided to improve the test setup along with further topics that need to be studied.","Resonance; Transformer; Transformer winding; Leakage Inductance; Dielectric; Testing; lifetime test; Gate Driver; Epoxy; Oil-paper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

With the adoption of deep learning techniques, side-channel attacks have become more powerful and require less manual analysis; hence, approaches involving deep learning have become the de facto standard for side-channel analysis. Especially the convolutional neural network has been highly effective in bypassing side-channel-specific countermeasures. The research surrounding the application of deep learning in the side-channel domain has so far primarily focused on either introducing architectures that perform well on specific datasets, data-preprocessing techniques, or the assessment of model output. Only a few attempts have been made toward the methodology aspect involving the generation of convolutional neural network architectures. The negligence of this part lends itself to the challenge of interpreting the model’s decision-making process and the high number of tunable parameters and design choices.

Nevertheless, due to the vast number of substations in the distribution level and the high cost of differential busbar protection, DSOs try to implement more cost-effective protection schemes for the busbars. This includes using various communication-based protection schemes, such as the reverse-blocking scheme that Stedin implements. However, due to impedance grounding, the single-phase-to-ground short circuit current can reach small values in magnitude in medium voltage distribution grids, making detecting it more challenging for these protection schemes. That is the problem that Stedin experiences in its network. <br/>In this thesis, a novel communication-based protection scheme is proposed as a solution to this problem. The protection scheme utilizes the IEC 61850 standard and the currently available infrastructure Stedin owns. The scheme can be considered a distributed protection scheme. The grid is modeled in RTDS, and a HiL simulation is carried out to test the protection scheme. The extensive simulations show that this scheme can detect single-phase-to-ground busbar faults in impedance earthed networks. Some limitations of the proposed scheme are also seen in the simulation results. Furthermore, a centralized approach for busbar protection is discussed. Two algorithms are developed based on GOOSE and SV messages, respectively. HiL simulations are carried out for these centralized algorithms too. The advantages and the considerations for implementing centralized protection are discussed. These findings can serve as a basis for further research for Stedin in the domain of centralized protection.","busbar protection; IEC 61850; distributed protection scheme; centralized protection; RTDS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Network Architectures and Services","",""

The ability to identify moral values is important for social and ethical artificial intelligence. We address the difficulties of using contemporary natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify moral values in texts. As the classification criterion of moral values is subjective, it is often difficult to argue for the existence of a `ground truth' label. In such circumstances, we can learn from the (dis-)agreement among multiple annotators. However, it is expensive to consult everyone, especially when working with crowdsourcing. A way to reduce the annotation cost is to apply active learning, which uses query strategies to choose the data and annotator that are most valuable to consult. Further, to account for subjectivity, we want to ensure the dataset is labelled by a diverse set of annotators. Therefore, we propose an annotator selection method for active learning. When given an unlabelled text, this method selects an annotator that has labelled the least amount of texts that are similar to the given text. The evaluation results show that the method performs better on datasets with balanced annotator distribution.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-01","","","","Computer Science | Artificial Intelligence Technology","",""

State Estimation, a task traditionally reserved for Transmission System Operators (TSOs), is, therefore, a needed tool for DSOs to properly monitor the distribution grid in the future. However, the implementation of Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) faces several challenges. The distribution system lacks observability to get satisfying estimation accuracy, the denser network increases the complexity of the estimation process, and the lack of labeled data makes training Machine Learning alternatives difficult. To tackle these issues, we propose the Deep Statistical Solver for Distribution System State Estimation (DSS2), a Deep Learning model based on the Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and the Physic-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) framework.<br/><br/>The DSS2 model is based on the Deep Statistical Solver (DSS) framework, which seamlessly models power systems into GNN using Hyper-Heterogeneous Multi Graphs (H2MG), and emphasizes semi-supervised learning by learning to optimize, using optimization problem as a loss function.

In this work, we conduct an impact and root-cause analysis of sensitivity to column permutations through extensive empirical analysis. Specifically, we show that changing the input column order increases the statistical difference between real and synthetic data by up to 39\%, due to the encoding of tabular data. To address this challenge, we first attempts to find an optimal column order to improve tabular data synthesis. Next, we propose AE-GAN, an effective tabular data synthesizer that leverages the latent representation of tabular data to regulate its sensitivity to column permutations while incurring low training overhead. AE-GAN is composed of an Autoencoder (AE) to efficiently represent tabular data as latent vectors, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic synthetic data, and a classifier to improve the semantic integrity of the generated records. It combines the flexibility of unsupervised training with the control offered by supervised training, thereby ensuring the statistical similarity between real and synthetic data. The evaluation of AE-GAN on five datasets shows that it is not only more permutation-invariant than the prior state-of-the-art, but also results in better downstream analysis based on the generated data.","Generative Adversarial Network; Autoencoder; Tabular Data Synthesis; Column Permutation Invariance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering | Distributed Systems","",""

While all food producers and chefs have different interpretations of sustainability, they have one thing in common: the need to share stories about local sustainable food products.<br/><br/>To discover whether consumers are open to storytelling in restaurants, in-depth research is conducted among eight participants. Exploration of a restaurant experience from the customers point of view, provides insights in how to enrich this experience.<br/><br/>All of the knowledge and insights are brought together in the Food for Thought toolbox.

Thereby, this research finds that colonial and racist structures that were set out by the Dutch as nickel mining exploration activities have been taken over by Indonesia, where nickel mining has been developed further which the Papuans often experience negative consequences. Now, with the growing demand for nickel for energy transitions, colonialism can be legitimised for the ‘green’ energy transitions.

Different iron compounds are employed for supplementation, including ferrous sulphate and ferrous fumarate. However, since only 15% of the supplemented iron is absorbed by the human body, the remaining 85% can cause various health-related issues.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management is committed to enhancing the accessibility and sustainability of the Dutch mobility system. Working from home (WFH) has been discussed as a policy lever to decrease commute travel and, thereby, congestion for decades. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this discussion regained momentum. WFH was a key factor for the decrease in commute travel by public transport and car in the Netherlands, which decreased congestion. Against this background, the Ministry wants to stimulate WFH post-pandemic to retain some of the sustainability and accessibility benefits identified during the pandemic. WFH can enhance the accessibility of the mobility system thanks to reduced commute trips during peak hours.<br/>Although the stimulation of WFH may be a policy lever to increase the accessibility of the mobility system, the full effect of WFH on overall personal mobility is unknown. Studying pre-, during and post-COVID-19 measures data, this study assesses the impact of a change in WFH on activity-travel patterns. Commute travel, non-work travel, and mode use together define activity-travel patterns in this research. The main research question is as follows: How did changes in WFH influence activity-travel patterns during the pandemic in the Netherlands? To answer this question, data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN), collected between 2019-2022 is used. Latent class analysis is used to identify seven distinct activity-travel patterns. Next, two latent transition models are estimated. The first model, for 2019-2021, studies the effect of an increase in WFH on transitions in activity-travel patterns. The second model, for 2021-2022, studies the effect of a decrease in WFH on transitions in activity-travel patterns.<br/><br/>The application of LTA, a longitudinal clustering method, sheds light on complex transition behaviour in the population during- and post-COVID-19 measures. The results show that activity-travel patterns before a change in WFH and the level of an increase in WFH matter for the impact of WFH on transitions. Depending on the initial class membership, differences in transitions emerged. To a certain extent, all effects of WFH on travel, substitution, complementarity, modification, and neutrality exist in the population, but these depend on initial class membership. The results for an increase in WFH are significant, while results for a decrease are not. For the time being, these findings do not exclude the existence of structural changes in working and travel behaviour. Significant effects on transitions appear for a small and a large increase in WFH. After an increase in WFH, most classes are more prone to take up another activity-travel pattern. In both cases, most classes have an increased probability of transitioning towards the low mobility class, which underpins more sustainable patterns. Nonetheless, more diverse results appear for a small increase in WFH, and significant transitions towards other car profiles appear. Analysing the impact of a small increase on class sizes confirms this. Overall, the car class sizes remain relatively high after a small increase in WFH. Thus, an increase by 1-3 days working from home may not lead to more sustainable activity-travel patterns in terms of trip rates per purpose and mode. Nevertheless, it needs to be kept in mind that this study only analysed trip rates per purpose and mode, a small increase in WFH may still lead to a peak-travel reduction, which benefits accessibility. Further analyses should investigate peak-travel to conclude on the accessibility benefits of small increases in WFH. At the same time, governments and employers should take measures to counter-act low mobility associated with WFH which is detrimental for physical health.<br","COVID-19; Activity-travel patterns; Netherlands; Transitions; Pandemic; Working from home","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Yet breast pumps are still mass-produced products, and finding the right product for themselves can be challenging for mothers. As a result, a new design strategy, product personalisation, is offered to address the problem of users’ particular demands not being satisfied.<br/><br/>This collaboration between Philips Experience Design and the NEXT UPPS project team explores the UPPS framework’s application possibilities in its MCC (Mother and Child Care) context. NEXT UPPS team, on the other hand, intends to complete different aspects of its design approach through the application of concepts to real-world case studies.<br/><br/>This graduation project aims to help mothers better engage in the co-creation process to obtain a more personalised breast pumping product that truly fits their needs. To design a co-creation experience that can motivate participation, research activities were carried out to understand mothers’ needs and concerns regarding breast pumping from multiple perspectives and to explore appropriate design opportunities across the whole breast pumping journey.<br/><br/>The research revealed that it could be challenging for inexperienced moms to articulate their needs to get personalised products. In addition, the mother’s high reliance on medical professionals in the early stages of childbirth shows that the co-creation of unfamiliar products is even more difficult. To overcome this problem, the goal of the design phase was to design a supportive and informative process that guides mothers to finish the task easily within co-creation. The design should provide an experience that mothers can feel secure, as easily facing unknown challenges with the support of medical professionals.<br/><br/>This project presented a product customisation webpage and a self-scanning mobile App to conquer the challenge. The product customisation webpage guides participants step-by-step through a question-and-answer interaction to customise breast pump products while allowing them to explore and understand their needs. The self-scanning mobile app guides women to easily and independently complete body measurement through clear and simple instructions, so as to obtain more personalised offers in product personalisation.It has been proven in user testing that the Q&amp;A interaction can motivate users’ participation while stimulating them to reflect on their product needs. However, although the guidance of the body scan can help users complete body measurement quickly and effectively, users still have concerns about data sharing.","Personalisation; breast pump; co-creation; Ultra-Personalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The required tolerance budget for the measurement and adjustment of these coordinates are $\pm 1~mrad$ in Rx and Ry and $0.1~mm$ in Z. The design is done by first finding different solutions for the sensor, the calibration approach and the adjustment. These different solutions are then combined to create different concepts for the setup. Subsequently, these concepts are traded off against each other using different selection criteria. The selected concept uses a lasertriangulator on an X and a Y directed stage that measures the height of a selection of preselected locations on a coplanar reference, which has the desired Rx, Ry, and Z coordinates. This set of data points is then used to make a plane fit from which the Rx, Ry, and Z coordinates of the reference can be retrieved. Subsequently, the same process is used to determine the Rx, Ry and Z coordinates of the element. The required adjustment of the element can then be calculated from the difference between the two sets of coordinates. After a 3D design is made for the setup, the different subsystems of the setup are elaborated and their tolerances are budgeted. To verify the setup, the setup is build in the cleanroom and the different subsystems are tested for their functionality and their performance. These results are then compared with the calculated tolerances. Since most of the tolerances are approximately the same as budgeted and the setup works as expected, it can be concluded that the selected design is suitable. This is however with the exception the tolerance due the stage wobble, which could not be measured as accurately as desired, and with the exception of the tolerance due to the heat generated by the stages, which was unexpected. In the end, recommendations are given on how to improve the setup. From these recommendations, changing the lasertriangulator for a sensor which preforms better on a reflective surface and implementing a solution for the tolerance due to the heat generated by the stages are the most important to alter the setup and make it a production ready design. If a sensor would be implemented that can measure reflective surfaces, the stage wobble, which is the last unknown tolerance contributor, could also be measured after which it can be fully concluded whether the setup works.","calibration; tilt; tilt calibration; lasertriangulator; coplanar reference; Rx Ry Z calibration; tolerance chain; tolerance contributors; linear stage; height map; Rx Ry Z; plane fit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Besides being an environmental burden, passenger cars also require a lot of space. Mitigating the impact of passenger cars on climate change and public space requires a shift to a more sustainable view of transport, in which neighborhood mobility hubs might play a role. As a relatively new concept, mobility hubs are starting to gain attention in academia and practice. The first findings, however, showed that the adoption rate of mobility hubs might be low and no good image of the user can be formed yet. This research therefore aims to identify which user groups are likely to adopt mobility offered by neighborhood mobility hubs in the Netherlands. To do this, a conceptual model is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) and subsequently, a survey was distributed in the Netherlands (N=298). After analyzing the data using an Exploratory Factor Analysis, a Latent Class Cluster Analysis was executed in order to find groups in the sample population with similar preferences and socio-economic profiles. By means of the latter, four distinctive groups of travelers are uncovered. Two clusters have intentions to use neighborhood mobility hubs: hub huggers (45%) and hub-ready impacting travelers (25%). The other two clusters, anti-new mobility individuals (22%) and traditional car owners (8%) are not yet ready to use neighborhood mobility hubs. There are some determinants that are likely to play a role in future mobility hub usage: people with prior experience with shared transport and households who do not own a car are more likely to use neighborhood mobility hubs in the future. People who currently use a sustainable travel mode (train or (e-)bike) to reach their work and/or study are more likely to be the adapters of neighborhood mobility hubs. This also holds for people who have a social and environmental responsibility, innovative mindset and clearly see the benefits of using a mobility hub and who are (most often) higher educated and younger of age.","neighborhood mobility hub; behavioral intention; exploratory factor analysis; latent class cluster analysis; UTAUT2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The DE-RISC project aims to generate a 3D model of the entire city of Rotterdam in The Netherlands, enabling many of these applications. Generating a 3D model of a building can be done in a variety of ways, of which only few are robust, scalable and generalizable. Recognition and reconstruction of architectural floor plans is such a scalable method long researched in literature.<br/>Although these methods generalized poorly initially, recent breakthroughs in computer vision have allowed for the application of deep learning based approaches. Recent floor plan processing methods have shown promising results on single-unit floor plans. Single-unit floor plans are floor plans of single apartments of relatively low complexity. In contrast, multi-unit floor plans describe entire buildings, and are thus significantly larger and of higher complexity. Applying single-unit floor plan processing methods to multi-unit floor plans is not trivial, and results in insufficient accuracy. These methods can therefore not be applied to an entire city, limiting the scalability and generalizability.<br/>This thesis proposes a novel multi-scale floor plan recognition and reconstruction method designed to transform floor plans of arbitrary size into their 3D representations. As no multi-unit floor plan datasets exists, a novel floor plan dataset MURF is presented based on multi-unit floor plans from buildings in Rotterdam. MURF considers seven boundary and opening semantic classes, each with distinct physical properties. The recognition part of the method relies on an FCN employing multi-scale skip-connections, an attention mechanism, and a multi-task training objective to reinforce the learning of multi-scale features. The reconstruction part refines predictions from the recognition step by applying post-processing, vectorization, and visualization in Blender.<br/>The proposed method is compared to floor plan processing models from literature and general stateof-the-art segmentation models by a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly outperforms existing floor plan processing methods, and performs best out of general segmentation models. A case study on the EMC in Rotterdam demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed method.","Floor plan analysis; FCN; Multi-task learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This spread requires land to be occupied, competing with other activities such as agriculture and residency. This project can help the spread of photovoltaic (PV) technologies in an environment still little explored: the water. Offshore floating photovoltaic (OFPV) gains increasing attention in research due to a substantial reduction in land occupancy and a lower operating temperature. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the power output of a OFPV system located in the North Sea considering the effect of the waves on tilt and azimuth of PV modules.<br/><br/>First, the JONSWAP spectrum theory was employed to simulate the sea surface. Then, the interaction between the waves and the floater was modelled to obtain the orientation of the PV modules. The system energy yield was simulated through the PVMD Toolbox, a physics-based tool developed by the PhotoVoltaic Materials Devices Group (PVMD Group) at Delft University of Technology. Finally, experimental analysis was conducted on a commercial string inverter emulating the DC power output from the OFPV modelled plant.<br/><br/>The waves generally cause lower irradiance hitting PV modules. However, fluctuations do not always have a negative influence. For example, the research found that with a calm sea, a system under the effect of waves produces 1% more than an offshore stationary 0° tilt plant. Nevertheless, the variable PV orientation scenario shows substantial losses for higher sea agitation states compared to the 0° tilt situation. Over a year, an OFPV under waves effect loses 0.84% and 17.97% of the production compared to stationary 0° and optimal installation tilt, respectively. From the laboratory activity, it appeared that with the same irradiance, the oscillations have a negative impact on the efficiency, especially that of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) block, which reaches -3.2% with rough sea.<br/><br/>In the end, we can conclude that the power output losses are not as dramatic as expected and that the development of OFPV technology will probably depend on future costs for offshore installations and the competition for inland areas.","Floating Photovoltaics; Offshore energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-25","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","TrustPV",""

In this context, rivers are the most important suppliers of plastics entering the marine environment. However, rivers that contain high loads of plastic waste also directly harm the livelihoods of people living near these rivers. An example is the flooding of urban areas in Indonesia due to clogging of the hydraulic and drainage systems, which is caused by the blockage of local hydraulic structures by plastic debris.<br/>At this moment, there is a lack of knowledge on this accumulation process and its underlying dynamics, since observational and experimental research is lacking. Numerical modeling has proven to be a great tool for expanding experimental research. However, no suitable numerical method has been identified yet to model the plastic accumulation process, since traditional mesh-based CFD numerical methods are expected to be not a viable option, due to their inability to model the individual interaction between plastic particles, critical during this process. A possible solution could be the SPH-DEM method, which is a two-way coupled numerical approach that simulates fluid and debris as discrete particles and elements.<br/>The objective of this report was to find out if SPH-DEM could be a suitable numerical method to model the dynamic processes of the plastic debris accumulation against hydraulic structures. To accomplish this, the first goal was to realistically model a turbulent open-channel flow and the buoyancy of individual plastic debris, which would be validated by experimental research. The second goal was to investigate which are the most important (numerical) parameters affecting the mentioned plastic debris accumulation.<br/>In this report, experimental research was carried out in the form of buoyancy tests and flume tests, and numerical research was carried out in the form of the design of numerical simulations. In the buoyancy tests, the rising velocities of four plastic fragments that differed in size and density were measured, which were released multiple times in a graduated cylinder filled with water. In the flume tests, first the water elevation was measured along the the flume, after which the passing ratio’s and carpet lengths were measured for the four different released fragments for three different gate configurations. Two types of numerical models were designed that represented both types of experimental tests, for which several design choices had to be made to compensate for several physical phenomena, which can’t be directly represented in the model design.<br/>The numerical buoyancy test was validated with the rising velocities obtained from the experimental equivalent. It was discovered, that for relatively low resolution modeled fragments, the rising velocity is heavily influenced by numerical diffusion. The smoothing length was identified as an important numerical parameter, which can compensate this effect. Furthermore, it was discovered that the degree of numerical diffusion is dependent on the depth of the fragment in the water. The numerical flume test was validated with the water elevation obtained from the experimental equivalent. For uniform flows, by adjusting the boundary viscosity coefficient, smooth turbulent velocity profiles could be simulated throughout the flume corresponding to theoretical values. However, no single value of was found in which the velocity profiles of the uniform flow and the validated water elevation of the gradually varied flows were both in agreement with their theoretical values. After validation, fragments were added to numerical flume model. Per fragment type and gate configuration,<br/>four different numerical scenarios were executed, where each scenario was defined by a combination of a certain density ½s and restitution coefficient e. Finally, the best corresponding scenarios were used to simulate mixed fragments released in the flow. It was found that the gate opening height , density and restitution of the plastic fragments have the largest influence on the passing ratio’s , carpet length , carpet shape and carpet stability. Furthermore, it was confirmed that individual fragment interactions play a crucial role in the accumulation process. However, the model is mainly limited by its low resolution and the absence of suitable turbulence models. This means that many forms of fragment behavior seen in the experimental research such of buoyancy, trajectory and individual interactions, which are heavily influenced by turbulence, cannot be sufficiently represented in the numerical model. However, it is shown that by adjusting the density the buoyancy behavior can be partly replicated and by adjusting the restitution coefficient the turbulent individual interactions can be partly replicated. In conclusion it can be stated that SPH-DEM is an interesting option to model the dynamic processes of the accumulation of plastic debris against a sluice gate; however, further improvements in computational power and turbulence models are needed to be more widely applied.","SPH; DEM simulation; carpet length; passing ratio; sluice gate; plastic; Accumulation; smoothing length; Flume experiments; Numerical simulation; Flooding; Buoyancy; Turbulence; velocity profiles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Constructing high-rise buildings is one way to try to solve the issue. However, high-rise buildings are sensitive to wind-induced vibrations. The accurate prediction of the dynamic response is important in high-rise building design. In building design practice, calculating the dynamic response of high-rise buildings under wind loading typically involves simplifying the structure as a single degree of freedom system, characterised by the first eigenmode properties and subjected to a white noise spectrum. The damping and natural frequency of the building substantially impact its dynamic response. These parameters are challenging to predict with accuracy. Additionally, in the presence of soft soils, soil-structure interaction can play an important role in energy dissipation and influence the structure's natural frequency. In practice, soil-structure interaction is either disregarded or simplified. <br/>In order to assess the effect of soil-structure interaction on the dynamic response of the building, this study models in a robust manner: the foundation, the tower structure, and the wind load. This newly developed model is addressed as the HF model. The investigation consists of a case study and a parametric study. Additionally, this study compares the predictions by the newly developed model with those obtained with a model as specified in the Eurocode. The case study provides a comparison between the models and the measured dynamic response of the New Orleans Tower. The parametric study looks into the influence of soil stiffness and material damping on the dynamic response of high-rise buildings. Furthermore, it investigates how these parameters affect the dynamic response of structures with various slenderness ratios.<br/>The case study was used to demonstrate that the developed model accurately predicts the measured dynamic response of the New Orleans Tower in the along-wind direction. For all the examined dynamic properties, the error compared with the measurements was lower than 7%. In the case of the Eurocode model, the results demonstrate that, when using the natural frequency estimation recommended by the Eurocode, it provides a 30%–35% underestimation of the peak acceleration compared to measurements. This Eurocode model overestimates the natural frequency and overall damping, which causes it to underestimate peak acceleration. However, the natural frequency determined in the design phase of the New Orleans Tower was significantly lower than the value obtained with the recommended estimation method in the Eurocode. With this lower natural frequency, the peak acceleration is overestimated by around 50%. This underestimation of the natural frequency and overestimation of the damping provided acceptable conservative results. Although this showcases the importance of accurate predictions of both natural frequency and damping, having poor predictions that cancel out each other’s effects is not desirable.<br/>The results from the parametric study support the findings from the case study. This shows that the case study’s findings apply to the more extensive range of building configurations investigated in the parametric study. In general, the Eurocode model, for slender structures on soft soil, overestimates the natural frequency and overall damping, which causes it to underestimate peak acceleration. <br/>The parametric study revealed that the building's first natural frequency and global damping ratio are significantly influenced by the soil stiffness and soil material damping, which can result in various effects on the peak acceleration. In the case of soil material damping, not considering it at all or considering a higher value could lead to 20% overestimation and 40% underestimation of peak acceleration, respectively. Soil stiffness had more intricate effects since it affected the natural frequency and the amount of energy dissipated by the soil radiation damping, the soil material damping and the structure material damping. For particular combinations of parameters, soil stiffness had up to a 40% increase in the peak accelerations compared to the fixed foundation.<br/>The results of this research show that the soil stiffness and soil material damping, for the ranges of properties relevant to the Netherlands, significantly influence the accurate predictions of the wind-induced dynamic response of high-rise buildings. Especially, there was found a higher influence on the dynamic response for the extreme cases of high slenderness ratio structures on very soft soils.","High-rise Buildings; Wind-induced Dynamic Behaviour; Dynamic behaviour; Soil-Structure Interaction Effects; Stochastic Frequency Domain Dynamic Analysis; Modelling of Building in Soft Soils; SSI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","HiViBe",""

This is especially true for the Netherlands as it is used officially as a safety measure against flooding from extreme weather since 1984 (Rijkswaterstaat, 1989). As of current 1D modelling of the waves is an acceptable method for the Dutch coast to assess the safety of the dunes (Den Heijer, 2013). For assessing the dune coastal safety the 98t h percentile of the runup R2% (Stockdon et al., 2006) is used for defining the wave response during a storm on the dunes. The current dune coastal safety studies consider bound waves (infragravity and sea- swell waves) propagating from offshore to nearshore. However, due to the Dutch coast being located at a very large semi-enclosed basin additional free infragravity waves can be present during a storm next to the bound waves that are reflected from other coasts (Daouk, 2020) as leaky waves (Herbers et al., 1995), and potentially increasing the R2% magnitude. Here we show that the R2% with the additional free infragravity waves in the wave domain can have a significant response on the dune coastal safety. The additional free infragravity waves can have tens of centimetres of R2% magnitude increase that is dependent on the slope of the domain. For the additional free infragravity waves a higher R2% is observed for steeper slopes, while a larger R2% growth is observed at the milder slopes when the free infragravity waves are initially introduced to the slope. The dune coastal safety assessments conducted thus far do not consider the effects from leaky waves from other coasts, therefore underestimating the safety provided from the dunes against flooding. With the research conducted by considering additional free infragravity waves with the traditionally bound waves originating in a storm, a better insight can be provided for dune coastal safety. As a result, companies and governmental bodies such as Rijkswaterstaat in the Netherlands that assess the coastal safety of the dunes can benefit by having a more complete representation of the coastal hydrodynamics that can as a result prevent flooding or provide dune nourishment after the episodic event (Sallenger, 2000).","Free Infragravity Waves; infragravity waves; dune safety; runup; Coastal Engineering; XBeach; 1D Model; Storm safety; Resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-25","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Agricultural land in the Netherlands has been decreasing in recent decades, especially within the Metropolitan Region of Amsterdam. This trend is likely to continue in the coming decades (Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving, 2015; Lesschen et al., 2020). Alongside this, there is an ambition from both regional government bodies and non-government actors to source twenty-five percent of the food consumed from their own region. This research looks at opportunities for achieving this ambition and how the objectives can be accomplished despite the scarce space in the metropolitan region. Four future scenarios have been drawn up for 2030, based on two axes, with each scenario describing the measures that can be taken to achieve this future scenario. The first axis is focused on governance of the food chain: either by a strong directing government or by polycentric networks. The second axis addresses the use of space: either conventional agricultural land use remains dominant, or alternative forms of food production break through and change the demand for space. By describing the four future scenarios, this master's thesis attempts to highlight multiple paths to the different future scenario’s and to map the possibilities for short food supply chains for the future. As such, this thesis falls within the discussions surrounding the alternative food geographies paradigm. <br/><br/>Key words: urban food systems, short food supply chains, alternative food geographies, Metropolitan Region of Amsterdam, futuring, backcasting, polycentric governance, 2030","Urban Food Systems; Short Food Supply Chains; Alternative Food Geographies; Metropolitan Region of Amsterdam; Futuring; Backcasting; Polycentric Governance; 2030","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

We introduce two models: the first model introduces the AC Stark shift and the novel second model expands on this by adding a resonance frequency shift on top. We assume the latter resonance frequency shift to be due to heating effects. We optimize the gate-fidelity for a qubit coupled to up to six drives as a function of the overall driving time and -frequency of a single drive for both models using the Nelder-Mead algorithm.<br/><br/>Using the AC Stark shift model, we still obtain 0.99999 fidelity if we do not account for the crosstalk. However, when using the second model, the fidelity drops to 0.69 in the presence of two drives when we do not correct for the heating-induced resonance frequency shift and the AC Stark shift. Furthermore, the fidelity decreases linearly with the number of drives coupled to the qubit, implicating that the resonance frequency shift will become a significant problem for the scalability of silicon quantum computers. We find that we can correct for the resonance frequency shift entirely by using optimized driving time and -frequency, where most gain comes from optimizing the driving frequency. Moreover, we discover that there is a linearly increasing dependence of the resonance frequency shift at the theoretical driving time as a function of the total drives. Up to a translation factor of 0.5 MHz, we discover the same linear relationship for the correction needed on the theoretical driving frequency to hit maximum fidelity as a function of the total drives.","silicon quantum computing; crosstalk; electron dipole spin resonance; EDSR; resonance frequency shift; Quantum Computing; fidelity; optimization; nelder-mead","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Such projects are becoming more complex: Many different interrelated aspects that are subject to change play a role in the delivery of construction work. This makes it interesting to know what exactly is uncertain in these projects, and what can be done to manage uncertainty. The aim of this research is to explore what aspects of complex construction projects are uncertain and what project management teams of public clients do to manage uncertainty before it impacts projects. Four complex construction projects were studied at two large public clients in the Netherlands: Rijksvastgoedbedrijf and Rijkswaterstaat. A total of 17 interviews were carried out across the project teams of these cases. A literature study was conducted to provide a theoretical basis of uncertainty in complex projects and approaches for the management of uncertainty. Uncertainty can be present in eight aspects: Objectives, methods, market, resources, stakeholders, contract, technology and environment. And managing uncertainty can be done in three ways: Learning, representing complexity and selectionism.<br/>The results show a variety of uncertainties present in those projects: all eight aspects were found to involve uncertainty in the cases. What especially appears as a challenge is the state of objects in renovation projects. This was a significant uncertainty that played a role in three renovation cases. Interestingly, project teams know before the start of the project that this is an uncertainty, but still face surprises during the execution phase. In addition, objectives, stakeholders and environment were uncertain in most of the cases. Given this broad spectrum of uncertainties, what do project teams do to prepare for this? Public clients mainly use approaches that represent the complexity of the project. They do this mainly by using organizational structures that focus on collaboration and integration. Organizational structures are utilized to facilitate joint risk management between the contractor and the public client. In addition, other approaches are used to represent complexity. Uncertainties are identified and discussed in a <br/>project development process to develop new project-specific knowledge. Decision-makers are often involved to increase the decision power of the project team or to escalate matters that are beyond influence of the project team. And lastly, project teams often focus on financial reserves and creating cohesion between project parties to prepare for unforeseen situations. learning is the second most used approach to prepare for uncertainty. It is mainly used in the renovation projects that were studied, where experiments at the site, use of mockups off site and pilots are introduced to learn about the interaction between the construction method, the object and the environment. <br/>The findings show that public clients manage a variety of uncertainties through the representation of complexity in the project organization and by learning. Selectionism was not used in the cases, and it is not clear to which extent selectionism is viable in complex construction projects. Based on the literature, it is recommendable for public clients to use integrated project teams to manage complex construction projects.","Uncertainty; complexity; construction projects; Project Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Another important aspect is the involvement of different physical phenomena such as torque production, electromagnetic fields and thermal heat flow. Thus designs need to satisfy multiple constraints and fulfill competing objectives making the design process tedious. Multi-Objective Optimisation algorithms provide a set of designs that are Pareto optimal i.e. any improvement in one objective comes at the cost of performance in another objective. This gives the designer a set of designs with different trade-offs between objectives and they can choose the design that satisfies the objectives and constraints the best.<br/><br/>There are numerous commercial software available that provide these functionalities. However the methods used to model machines within these packages are not available or cannot be changed. They are also usually expensive.

The involved flow field is small in space and highly unsteady in time, so it challenging the spatial and temporal resolution that current PIV techniques is able to achieve. In present study, single cavitation bubbles of hundreds of micrometers are seeded at near a solid wall by laser techniques. At the mean time a high-speed photography experiment up to 200,000 Hz, a planar PIV experiment combined with shadow method, and the first tomographic PIV experiment in the field, are meticulously designed and implemented. The images taken are firstly calibrated by a high-order anti-distortion algorithm before signal-to-noise ratio enhancement processing. According to the bubble morphology data, two simple formulas are fitted to describe the bubble collapse time and the bubble radius as functions of the wall-stand-off distance. A planar PIV shows the flow fields during the bubble oscillation, which helps to explain the mechanism of the formation of the two types of vortex left by a cavitation bubble. The consistence between the results of planar PIV and the 2D slices of tomographic data as well as the axial symmetry proved by the 3D velocity field data validates the sufficiency of a planar PIV measurement for flow fields induced by a single cavitation bubble. A principle named Proof-of-concept indeed guides the tomographic PIV experiment where the technical difficulties encountered and the resulting data may serve as a valuable starting point for future tomographic PIV experiments in the field of bubble dynamics. A SPCC PIV evaluation algorithm and an AI PIV approach, which are able to achieve a single-pixel-resolution velocity field, are implemented to resolve the wall shear rates exerted by a cavitation bubble. In the case when a bubble does not touch the wall the SPCC algorithm succeeds, while it is effort-consuming and badly influenced by unsteadiness among experiments. In particular, the flow fields are dominated by the many sources of instabilities for the moment long after the bubble generation, in which case the SPCC algorithm cannot deal with the images ensemble from different flow conditions. Although the AI deep learning method in present work is failed in obtaining the correct velocity gradient at the near-wall region, the there is a very bright way out. The governing law NS equations, the physical constrains non-slip conditon, and high accuracy PIV cross-correlation velocity data can be together considered within the loss function of a convolutional neural network. In such way the AI method is supposed to be capable to get the correct cavitation flow field up to single-pixel-resolution.","PIV (particle image velocimetry); cavitation; bubble dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This makes them attractive targets for malicious cyber-attacks, which have become more advanced and abundant in recent history. To properly defend ICSs from these cyber-attacks, appropriate cyber-defensive mechanisms should be continuously designed and updated, cyber-attack detection mechanisms included. These mechanisms should undergo sufficient testing before being implemented in actual ICSs to minimise unforeseen consequences. Existing literature indicates that Dynamic Multiplicative Watermarking (DMWM) is a promising form of cyber-attack detection, which could improve overall detection performance. Thus far, this technique has not yet been applied to Automatic Generation Control (AGC) (a prominent form of Load Frequency Control (LFC) in power grids) to detect data integrity attacks (specifically scaling and replay attacks).<br/><br/>Ergo, this research aims at testing the performance of DMWM against data integrity attacks on AGC. To perform attack detection, a Luenberger observer it utilised. This observer generates a residual, which is compared to a robustly designed threshold. For the purpose of adequate testing, the HILDA (Hardware-In-the-Loop Detection of Attacks) testbed is designed and constructed. By using this testbed, more realistic scenarios can be simulated than with regular desktop simulations. After verifying the correct construction of the testbed, the DMWM performance is examined both on a desktop simulation environment using MATLAB &amp; Simulink, and on the HILDA testbed. It is shown that the addition of DMWM increases the detection performance in the context of both scaling and replay attacks. For replay attacks, this performance increases notably, while for scaling attacks the improvement is more modest. It is shown that, overall, the attacks are detected more quickly when simulated on the HILDA testbed compared to simulations performed on the MATLAB &amp; Simulink environment. On the other hand, the overall detection ratio was better when simulated on the MATLAB &amp; Simulink environment. This discrepancy in detection performance demonstrates the added value of the HILDA testbed.","Industrial Control System; Dynamic Multiplicative Watermarking; Automatic Generation Control; Load Frequency Control; Data integrity attack; Scaling attack; Replay attack; Hardware-In-the-Loop Testbed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","","52.00182744704395, 4.3713199611650335"

As cooled cooling air reduces required turbine cooling massflow, a major source of loss in modern aeroengines, it is believed that the concept can improve engine efficiency. No extensive or explicit study on the merits of this concept has been performed, however.<br/>Using the 0-D engine analysis software GSP, engine performance parameters at Take-Off and Cruise, such as, specific fuel consumption and (specific) thrust were evaluated against altering feed cooling air temperature by 0 to -300K and heat exchanger induced pressure losses of 0 to 8% in the bypass. This was done for two test cases; the Leap-1A engine (TOC OPR 50, CRZ BPR 11.1, TO FN 121kN) representing current conventional technology and GTF2050, a geared turbofan engine (TOC OPR 75, CRZ BPR 17.1, TO FN 174kN) with entry into service of 2050. For the Leap-1A engine the specific fuel consumption increased up to 1.9% at cruise and for GTF2050, the increase was up to 4.1%. It is shown that the change in fuel consumption is linear with the decrease in cooling fraction, as for both engines the specific fuel consumption increases by +0.34% per percent cooling air reduction.<br/>With a reduction in cooling fraction, the exhaust pressure of the core increases, resulting in a higher thrust (up to 2.3%). It is shown that the optimal take-off bypass ratio for minimum fuel consumption shifts up, for the GTF2050 engine from 16.4 to 17.5.<br/>Furthermore, scenario tests and an exergy analysis were performed to find that the impact of different mechanisms; the pressure loss in heat exchanger has minor impact on performance; change in turbine efficiency has small impact; the effect of changed turbine massflow and heat rejection into the bypass are the dominant phenomena.<br/>It is concluded that as a method for reducing fuel consumption, cooled cooling air with the bypass as a heat sink is not feasible for conventional architectures even with extreme design parameters such as high OPR and BPR. Heat rejection to the bypass cannot be effectively utilised and no improvement in core efficiency from reduced cooling air can compensate. In the edge case where there is no heat transfer in cruise, there is an observed specific fuel consumption benefit of up to 4%. The achievable benefit will be lower, however, when accounting for installation penalties.<br/>It is recommended to focus turbine cooling studies on the impact and feasibility of active cooling massflow control without heat rejection, investigate alternative heat sinks for cooled cooling air (e.g. cryogenic fuel), and only consider bypass cooled cooling air as last resort when up-flowing cooling<br/>schemes is not permissible or ineffective.","Cooled Cooling; Turbine; Engine efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Phasing-out CFPP and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) is, therefore, a crucial part of energy transitions for mitigating climate change. The Indonesian government has announced ambitious plans to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and reach net-zero by 2060. However, despite these ambitious plans, Indonesia plans to expand their use of CFPP in the coming years and deployment of RES is limited. Research suggests that the main problem with regard to a coal transition in Indonesia arises from vested interests of powerful and influential actors in the political economy of coal in Indonesia. <br/>The purpose of this thesis is to conduct research on possible ways to enable a coal transition in the Indonesian province of South Kalimantan. A literature review on coal transitions has revealed that policies are regarded as the main drivers for coal transitions. This thesis adopts a broader view of policies as being a part of institutions. In view of the theory of New Institutional Economics, institutions can be defined as rules that structure social interactions. The main research question of this research is: How can a coal transition in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, be enabled by influencing actors in the Indonesian political economy of coal through institutional interventions? <br/>The research approach of this thesis is a case study on the political economy of coal in Indonesia, and more specifically in South Kalimantan. The case study is an exploratory, single case study. The research methodology for the case study combines literature reviews, a desk study, and expert interviews. <br/>The first part of this research provides a system analysis of the political economy of coal. The second part of this research aims to explore how a coal transition in South Kalimantan can be enabled by institutional interventions. This is conducted by complementing insights from literature on coal transitions, political economy of coal- or energy transitions, and literature directly related to coal or energy transitions in South Kalimantan and Indonesia, with insights from expert interviews. The expert interviews aim to establish insights into which of the proposed institutional interventions from literature would be politically feasible, given the existing political economy of coal. <br/>Based on the results of this case study and the expert interviews, several institutional interventions are proposed. These are complemented with insights from systems thinking and insights to overcome the prevalent systems archetypes of the Tragedy of the Commons, Rule Beating, and Policy Resistance.<br/>Further research needs to be conducted on: (1) adaptive management, (2) how to convince key actors to accelerate a coal transition, (3) examining the required investments, how these can be distributed, and how to ensure that investments and international financial support are used for the intended purposes and not redirected or misused, (4) exploring adequate alternative pathways for economic development in South Kalimantan, and (5) modelling the proposed institutional interventions. <br","energy transition; coal transition; political economy; new institutional economics; systems thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In the ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders, software security patching is a well-recognised and effective strategy to mitigate vulnerabilities in software products. However, organisations struggle with the best practice to “patch early and often”, resulting in vulnerabilities in software being exposed for much longer than desired. Prior research indicates the socio-technical nature of this practice forms the core of delays in software patch management. Developing a deeper understanding of the decision-making of IT practitioners and what socio-technical factors play a role in this process allows organisations to address the ineffectiveness of their security patch process. The main research question in this explorative research is: <i>What socio-technical factors influence the effectiveness and timeliness of the security patching process in organisations?</i> This Mixed Methods research combines qualitative data from interviews with IT practitioners, with a quantitative data exploration of the meaningfulness of organisational measurements. Findings show that IT practitioners go through a funnel of decision-making that influences the decision of what to patch, and when to patch. The presence and interplay of different socio-technical factors related to four main aspects of this decision (i.e., security, applicability, operability, and availability) result in tensions and trade-offs influencing the decision space of IT. Furthermore, this study indicates the interrelations between the significance of socio-technical factors, which is reduced by certain coping strategies applied by IT practitioners. This research reveals that having some measurement in place helps to understand the existence of challenges and the working of coping strategies, therefore contributing to an understanding of socio-technical challenges. However, it also reveals several limitations to the quality of existing data and difficulties in coming to measurements that provide meaningful information, due to socio-technical factors. The main contribution of this research is a better understanding of how socio-technical factors influence the decision-making process of IT practitioners. This research is limited in the way it uses quantitative data to understand patching activity. Future research is recommended to compare the potential discrepancy between what IT practitioners state influences the effectiveness of their security patch process and what the actual patching activity of IT practitioners reveals about the effectiveness of patching. This research furthermore hypothesises that not all socio-technical factors have the same level of significance. It is recommended to investigate the possibilities of quantification of the importance of each of the socio-technical challenges identified in this explorative study.","Software Security Patching; Information Security; Risk Management; Mixed Methods Approach; Socio-technical challenges","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Wouters, B. (mentor); Izeboud, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Antarctic ocean temperatures are rising due to climate change, causing land ice to melt at increasingly higher rates. Ice shelf bottom melt is a key factor responsible for Antarctic ice mass loss and as such understanding melt processes in the Antarctic is therefore key to more accurately predict how the global sea level will respond to climate change in the foreseeable future. Basal melt results in the formation of both basal melt channels underneath an ice shelf and persistent sea ice wakes (named plume-driven polynyas) at the ice shelf shoreline. The goal of this research is to develop a method that can help to automatically infer basal melt locations along the Antarctic shoreline with significantly increased spatio-temporal resolution compared to previously researched basal melt detection methods.<br/>We infer basal melt locations by detecting plume-driven polynyas. We used dual-pol (HH/HV) Sentinel-1 EW SAR data (40x40m resolution) in combination with GLCM textural features as input for a random forest classification that differentiates images as water or ice in four sub-classes: undisturbed ’open’ water, disturbed ’rough’ water, sea ice and (floating) land ice. We assessed what the advantages and limitations of this approach were for plume-driven polynya detection by performing water-ice (sub-class) classifications and examining which GLCM features proved most useful, what GLCM window size is preferred, and how classification can be aided by post-processing classified images.<br/>We computed GLCM textures for window sizes w = [5,11,21] and created a classifier for each choice (GLCM5, GLCM11 and GLC21) and compared results to a classifier based on original dual-pol SAR data (BASE). Via cross validated recursive feature elimination we determined that ’sum average’ (HH and HV polarization) and ’difference variance’ (HV polarization) were most useful for separation of water and ice classes (HH_savg, HV_savg and HV_dvar). Our results have shown that using GLCM texture based dual-pol classifiers improves water-ice classification significantly compared to dual-pol only classifiers, although using HH_savg and HV_savg instead of orignal dual-pol data comes at a cost of reduced spatial resolution. Water-ice classification accuracy of BASE was 92.2% (kappa = 84.4%) was increased to 95.9% (kappa = 91.5%) for GLCM5, 96.3% (kappa = 92.7%) for GLCM11 and to 96.5% (kappa = 93.0%) for GLCM21. From a spatial context, GLCM21 showed an insufficient ability to detect small-scaled bodies of water at a sub-kilometer scale. GLCM5 showed unsatisfactory results in terms of sea ice classification. GLCM11 showed highest robustness in both these performance aspects and proved to be most successful classifier for the application of polynya detection. Using an area filter as a post-processing step proved successful when a classifier is based on GLCM data with a window size no larger than w=11. Noise output (small regions of falsely classified open water pixels) was heavily reduced via this form of post-processing and significantly increased polynya detection performance.<br/>The final classified product however still contained too many incorrectly classified water regions of similar spatial scales as plume-driven polynyas to be able to apply this algorithm as a reliable automated polynya detection method. We urge to build upon this SAR-based detection method, by using additional non-GLCM input features or using extra post-processing steps, such as temporally filtering water body presence, until results are satisfactory for a fully automated plume-driven polynya detection algorithm. The method presented here has the potential to make detection significantly faster, easier and more accessible than the current methods available. Lastly, in its current state, this method can already be used to validate predicted locations of basal melt by ocean-ice sheet models and DEM-based methods.","Classification; Polynya; SAR; Basal Melt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Warnier, Martijn (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Ransomware has evolved over the years, shifting from widespread attacks targeting individuals to focused attacks on businesses and agencies. These attacks are performed by ransomware gangs while establishing interaction within the ransomware ecosystem. In this thesis, the ransomware ecosystem is posited as being constructed of three separate sub-ecosystems: the attacker sub-system, the defender sub-system, and the governance sub-system. Since ransomware gangs put in an effort to hide their internal communication and operation from the outer world, difficulties arise in correctly understanding the ransomware ecosystem and a ransomware gang’s establishment of interactions within this ecosystem. As a result, current interventions are ineffective. <br/><br/>While earlier research has been conducted on ransomware, we observe two knowledge gaps: 1) there is a lack of understanding of how ransomware gangs establish interactions with actors in the ransomware ecosystem, and 2) There has been a lack of research that uses ground truth data due to ransomware gangs keeping their internal communication and operations hidden. This thesis uses the leaked internal communication data of the Conti ransomware gang to fill these knowledge gaps and answer the research question: To which extent can the ransomware ecosystem be reconstructed using ground truth communication data of the Conti ransomware gang?”.<br/><br/>To answer this question, a novel methodology is proposed that uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to empirically determine overarching topics in Conti's internal communication. It is then researched how these overarching topics map to Conti’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) which is a commonly used methodology to better understand how ransomware gangs operate. Subsequently, these TTP are leveraged to reconstruct the ransomware ecosystem while taking the perspective of how the Conti ransomware gang establishes interactions within the ransomware ecosystem.<br/><br/>The findings of this thesis indicate that Conti is a large and professional organization that incorporates and adjusts services of service-providing cybercriminals in the attacker ecosystem rather than developing their ransomware themselves using scarce IT talent. In addition, reconnaissance is one of the most critical activities that ransomware gangs perform to get to a successful ransomware attack. While researching Conti's TTP, this thesis identifies novel TTP of ransomware gangs, such as Conti's attack chain, reconnaissance procedure, and money laundering procedure.<br/><br/>We conclude that the ransomware ecosystem can be reconstructed from the attacker ecosystem, the defender ecosystem, and the governance ecosystem, in which ransomware gangs establish interactions within each sub-ecosystem while operating from the attacker ecosystem. In the attacker ecosystem, ransomware gangs establish interactions with service-providing cybercriminals to outsource sub-commodities of their ransomware value chain. This allows them to strengthen their attack vectors by relying on the expertise of others and have a more varied set of attacks. The defender ecosystem is comprised of defenders that defend themselves against ransomware. Ransomware gangs establish interactions by performing extensive reconnaissance on defender territories and valuable information and open-source tools that strengthen their attack vectors. The governance ecosystem comprises governance actors that create and maintain the governance framework that influences the attacker ecosystem and defender ecosystem. Ransomware gangs establish interactions with actors in the governance ecosystem to observe the regulatory frameworks in place and adjust their TTP based on the involved risks of getting caught.","Ransomware; Conti; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; TTP; ransomware ecosystem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Various methods have been investigated to mitigate the TCO (IWO) deposition induced passivation degradation and to optimize the screen printing process.<br/><br/>First, approaches to reduce the passivation degradation due to IWO deposition were explored.

It is important that people are made aware of the dramatic consequences if these ecosystems would be lost forever. Yet, children in Kenya are not fully aware of the richness of the ecosystems within their own country, hence there is a clear need for inspiring education. The Green Kids’ Museum will be built with the objective to raise children’s awareness of the different aspects of sustainability, with one room dedicated to biodiversity and ecosystems in Kenya. <br/><br/>This research project has explored different ways to transfer knowledge in a playful way about biodiversity and ecosystems fitting children in the 9 to 11 year old age range. The outcome of this exploration resulted in a game that serves as an interactive exhibit piece helping children recognize the different ecosystems in Kenya. <br/><br/>In the initial phase of this project research was done in three different Dutch museums to understand what type of museum installation attracts children. This showed that children are mostly attracted to large striking installations that are interactive and require little to no instructions and installations where they can build something or win a prize. These aspects were taken into account during the ideation phase; each design needed to have at least one of the previously mentioned aspects to make it attract to children. The chosen design had the first three aspects incorporated and resulted in a first iteration that was tested with the target group. The evaluation with the target group was split into a physical test and an online test. The results of this test showed that the children enjoyed the game, but expressed the wish to play the game for a longer amount of time and at an increased level of complexity. A number of unfamiliar animals were added to the game increasing the complexity and duration of the game. The design was evaluated with manufacturers in Kenya to validate that the product could be fully manufactured in Kenya. Based on their feedback some alterations were applied to the design making it ready for manufacturing. Manufacturers were selected based on their efforts to produce sustainably. This selection was done based on the manufacturing techniques catalogue, created by the researcher for this project, providing a comparison of different manufacturers in Kenya that execute that same technique. Based on these results a final design has been created. <br/><br/>The final concept, “The Great Kenya Eco Challenge”, is an interactive exhibit piece teaching Kenyan children how to recognize the different ecosystems in Kenya. This is done by matching different animals to the ecosystem they live in using a button system. The exhibit piece enables children to learn about ecosystems in a playful and fun way. <br","Museum; Children; Ecosystems; Kenya","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","","-1.3152325781125507, 36.74091909508896"

Government adaptations such as dikes or beach nourishments are important, yet insufficient in the face of worsening hazards. They reduce the hazard probability, but the local actions at the household level determine the extent of damages and inequalities in its distributional impacts on various societal groups. To design effective policies and risk reduction strategies it is critical to quantify the speed and scope of the household adaptation uptake and the resulting damage prevention. This is especially the case for distributional impacts (i.e., how different societal household groups adapt), which are often neglected. Quantifying both aggregate and distributional impacts of household climate change adaptation (CCA) on flood risk fosters the design of tailored flood risk management policies which allocate resources to the societal groups that need them most. This thesis presents a state-of-the-art agent-based flood model in downtown Shanghai, China to understand the role of household CCA in reducing coastal flood risk both in its aggregate and distributional impacts. To model the households’ exposure to climate-induced floods we overlayed the geolocations of 18.039 residential buildings with 21 inundation maps that depict dike failures and dike overtopping under different climate-change scenarios. We further parameterized households using context-specific micro-level survey data from Shanghai and depicted households’ adaptation decisions using an extended version of the Protection Motivation Theory. Our results show that autonomous household adaptation (adaptation without government policy) to climate change plays an essential role in reducing flood damage in downtown Shanghai. However, despite the considerable adaptation uptake, the residual damages increase over time due to the effects of sea level rise and land subsidence. This shows that autonomous household adaptation alone is insufficient to keep pace with the increasing severity of climate-related flooding, as it is constrained by barriers in the form of adaptation measure costs and regulations. Thus, additional policies are needed to overcome these barriers. These policies should take into account differences in adaptation behaviour and damage prevention among societal household groups. Specifically, our results indicate that households with lower worry, self-efficacy, and income adapt measurably slower to climate-induced floods, which makes these household groups significantly more vulnerable to flooding.","Flood; Household adaptation; Agent-based model; Behaviour; Protection Motivation Theory; Shanghai","en","master thesis","","","","","","Link to the flood-ABM code: https://github.com/jlechn01/Shanghai-Flood-ABM The updated thesis PDF document includes a minor change in the acknowledgements (European Research Council project SCALAR).","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","","31.23040, 121.47370"

Finally, the results show that involving the practitioners in the design of the system can improve the decision-making time, since it reduces the discussion between the actors, but is less relevant than the time needed to gather and process the information (which is a very critical aspect in contexts of time pressure), especially for those who work in contact with the system.","DSS; Decision-making process; time pressure; uncertainty; dynamism; Decision Support Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Local energy storage could contribute significantly to the solution. This study focused on one solution in particular: the neighborhood battery. Neighborhood batteries are emerging as a technical and social innovation for smart neighborhoods, which enable to share and store energy collectively. Since each neighborhood has its own characteristics, different technical needs, and economic conditions, the fitability of a battery per neighborhood will also differ. If stakeholder values are considered during a project, the technology can have more support from the citizens. Therefore, technology support can be considered as an important aspect of the success of new projects to succeed. In this thesis, it is considered neighborhood batteries have embedded values and can satisfy the demands of different actors. The theory of Responsible innovation tries to align technological innovations with the technical, socio-economic, and institutional aspects of the innovation. The objective of this study is to better understand the alignment of technical functionalities of the batteries and citizens' values. Accordingly, neighborhood batteries are not only assessed on a technological and economic performance indicator, but ethical aspects provide a wider understanding of the development of neighborhood batteries. Agent-Based Modeling is used to model the batteries in the neighborhood and study the influence of values and interactions on the technology support. In addition, this research uses Schwartz values to model values.<br/><br/>The results show the multi-functional usability of neighborhood batteries. Additionally, the results demonstrate how a neighborhood battery can be designed to match the values of the neighborhood and how value similarity and communities can influence the support for the battery. The diverse functionalities of the neighborhood battery show advantageous technical and economic capabilities. The current rules and regulations enable battery projects, but still business models that achieve large-scale implementations are missing. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the amount of neighborhood battery projects in The Netherlands that focus on equal benefits for all energy users. Within these projects, value-based decisions can help the process of implementing the neighborhood battery. It is important to consider the social dimensions of neighborhood batteries and responsible innovations can help to do so. If more attention is given to local developments and the role of all energy users, the neighborhood battery will provide a platform to store and share your power.<br","Neighborhood battery; Community Energy; agent based model; Responsible Innovation; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Consequently, the concept of urban resilience has grown in popularity not only to tackle sudden shocks but also to face long-lasting socio-economic tensions. To implement the arrangements for resilience policy, literature suggests that social factors govern the resilience of urban areas. Communities in which the residents work together and have common goals have a stronger willingness to cooperate. To this end, social cohesion has been proven to be significant for subsistence in the event of a catastrophe. Cohesive communities protect residents against threats, care of others during hardships, and ultimately promote community resilience.<br/><br/><br/>Balanced neighbourhood policies aim to strengthen the cohesion between citizens, communities, and social institutions departing from the assumption that social mix fosters social cohesion. Their goal is to increase the social mix of specific areas to avoid the clustering and segregation of disadvantaged households to, as a result, promote resilient actions. There is, however, literature that suggests that the anticipated effects are rather inconclusive and usually not achieved. Instead, balanced neighbourhood policies would promote segregation by forcing the displacement of groups of residents.<br/><br/><br/>The issue arises whether balanced neighbourhoods trigger resilient actions that are pivotal in resilient communities. In other words, does neighbourhood balance increase resilient action of neighbourhood residents? We took a cross-sectional confirmatory approach to understand the social mechanism that triggers resilient action in balanced neighbourhoods based on Partial Least Squares—Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and spatial econometrics. To this end, the research tests the assumptions on which the municipality of Rotterdam grounds their Resilience Strategy's balanced neighbourhood policy, the Woonvisie, using a 2019 public survey on social development. Rotterdam's definition of a balanced neighbourhood is defined from a set of conditions for the amount of houses in different house price segments. Therefore, the tested model is based on the grounds that geographically connected people become affected by their neighbourhood's balance to promote resilient action. As such, we use the willingness to help friends and neighbours to characterise informal support as resilient action. Here we show that balanced neighbourhoods are associated with less informal support: the higher the balance, the fewer residents are willing to help their friends and neighbours.<br/><br/><br/>The results indicate that social cohesion is the social mechanism that triggers help between friends and relatives and fully acts as the mechanism for resilient actions triggered by the balance in a neighbourhood. From the multiple combinations of houses in different house price segments that the definition of balanced neighbourhoods allows, we distinguish two associations. On one hand, house price distributions which foment a reduction in polarisation (more middle-priced houses) are negatively associated with social cohesion. On the other hand, balanced neighbourhoods which foment polarisation (more low- and high-priced houses) are positively associated with social cohesion. This indicates that our results are in line with Putnam’s homophily principle, i.e. ‘birds of a feather flock together’. This outcome is opposite to the policy discourse of governments in favour of balanced neighbourhoods, including the municipality of Rotterdam, that mixed neighbourhoods foster social cohesion and therefore resilient action.<br/><br/><br/>The testing of the theory is complemented in two ways. First, we show that social cohesion and informal support are not constrained by administrative boundaries, so the social perceptions and actions in nearby neighbourhoods affects the level of the other neighbourhoods. Second, we found no moderating effect of factors related to the demographics and the built environment that can promote or deter social interactions, and thus are aspects of what can be considered a resilient neighbourhood.<br/><br/><br/>The analysis also shows that Rotterdam's definition of balance allows multiple and dispersed combinations of the amount of houses in each price segment, which can result in counterintuitive conceptions of balance. In addition, the results show apparently contradicting results of the relationship between balance and social cohesion depending on whether the distribution foments house price polarisation. As a result, we argue that the definition is under-specified and can be misleading. <br/><br/><br/>Finally, only 2.1% of the possible balance distributions yielded an acceptable goodness-of-fit of our model. This could be indicative that the model needs to be reevaluated. We found that neighbourhood ethnic heterogeneity and house type heterogeneity are directly associated to social cohesion and informal support, respectively. Future research should elaborate on the theory on which the model is grounded and create coherence to the empirical relationships identified. In contrast, the few fitting distributions could otherwise indicate that that social cohesion and informal support cannot be explained by the balance in a neighbourhood and that the policy should be reevaluated. Under this second interpretation, the study has uncovered which are the balance distributions for the city that can actually show the alleged effects of balance.<br/><br/><br/>Based on these findings, a policy advice is formulated. If the objective is to increase social cohesion and resilient actions, we discourage the municipality of Rotterdam to approach this by building balanced neighbourhoods. Nevertheless, we have seen that building social cohesion is a way to build social resilience, so recently developed city programs focused on the development of neighbourhood organisations, which not only provide a space for social cohesion but also to collect and share resources directly, are a step forward from the Woonvisie.","Urban resilience; Social resilience; Social cohesion; Balanced neighbourhoods; Social mixing; Rotterdam; PLS-SEM; Spatial econometrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","51.9244, 4.4777"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) relieves human drivers’ tasks by taking over the control of the throttle and braking of the vehicles automatically. However, it has been demonstrated in many empirical studies that current production ACC systems fail to guarantee string stability. It is believed that if vehicles can take the longitudinal dynamics further downstream into account and react to the propagating disturbance earlier, the string stability in the platoon may be improved. Instead of relying on inter-vehicle communication technologies, the ego-vehicle should be able to detect the second leading vehicle by leveraging the power of on-board sensors. Still, the second leader measurements can be highly erroneous. Therefore, it is important to consider the entailed measurement uncertainties when designing and evaluating such ACC systems. This study proposes several ACC systems which possess the property of multi-anticipation and uncertainty handling.<br/><br/>The possible sensor technology which can collect the second leader measurements is first investigated. Based on the considered setup, the measurement uncertainties are modelled to reflect the real-world conditions. The ACC system architecture and control system design method are then proposed. Deep reinforcement learning is applied for the controller design in light of its great potential in describing the complex non-linear control task and handling the uncertainties. Kalman filters and recurrent policies with a Long-Short-Term-Memory network are applied to cope with uncertain measurements. The first method estimates the state information before feeding it back to the controller agent, while the latter incorporates the state estimator into the controller to actively consider the uncertainties while making decisions.<br/><br/>A numerical simulation approach is adopted to theoretically assess the performance of the proposed ACC systems. A traffic disturbance event and multiple levels of measurement noise are considered in the experiment. To analyze the performance in terms of string stability and ride comfort and understand the car-following behavior mechanism resulted from the proposed systems, a quantitative analysis framework is developed.<br/><br/>The evaluation results demonstrate the applied learning-based approach succeeds to train ACC control policies which can ensure string stability. It is also found that the multi-anticipation ability significantly improves the string stability and ride comfort performance. In the scenarios with measurement noise, systems using the tuned Kalman filters exhibit the ideal level of string stability performance. However, ride comfort cannot be guaranteed in scenarios with large measurement noise. On the other hand, systems using recurrent policies can better ensure ride comfort performance while maintaining string stability at certain levels. Based on the results, the performance limits of the proposed ACC systems in the handling of measurement uncertainties are explored. In addition, with the different policy training setups, the trade-off between these two performance aspects is shown.<br/><br/>The findings of this study are anticipated to trigger the development of advanced multi-leader ACC system by automakers, sensor manufacturers, and traffic engineers. Future work can be directed to an enhanced controller design. Robustness of the systems with respect to other sources of measurement uncertainties, more types of traffic disturbance, and platoon heterogeneity is worth further design consideration and analysis.","adaptive cruise control; multi-anticipation; deep reinforcement learning; measurement uncertainties; Kalman filter; string stability; ride comfort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Chan, P.W.C. (graduation committee); Muraki, Y (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This study aims to explore what design of ‘ba’, the Japanese concept which translates into ‘place’ or ‘space’ in English, facilitates effective knowledge creation in construction organisations. Although many scholars have investigated the field of knowledge management in construction organisations, few have focused on ‘ba’, where the knowledge creation process takes place (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1998). ‘Ba’ is defined as ‘a shared context in which knowledge is shared, created and utilised (Nonaka et al., 2000)’, and ‘ba’ can be physical (e.g. meeting rooms), virtual (e.g. e-mails), and even mental space (e.g. shared values). Although ‘ba’ has been recognised as the essential part of knowledge creation, it is not fully clear what design of ‘ba’ can facilitate organisational knowledge creation better due to its ambiguity and intractability. Moreover, new ICT tools have emerged and used for ‘ba’ since the concept was first introduced in the 1990s, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of virtual environments in business. Also, few examined the impact of individuals’ traits such as generational differences in values and Belbin team roles on ‘ba’. Therefore, exploring ‘ba’ in accordance with the above aspects can contribute to enhancing knowledge creation in organisations. <br/>This research is divided into three parts: literature study, qualitative data collection and analysis, and recommendations. In the literature study, the conceptual model of ‘ba’ is reconstructed based on the extant literature in order to clarify the nature of ‘ba’. The model suggests the nature of ‘ba’ is “a shared space given meaning by inter-subjective relationships and inter-corporeal relationships”. Moreover, the four categories of enabling conditions that stimulate ‘ba’ are identified, namely social/behavioural, cognitive/epistemic, information systems, and strategy/structure. <br/>Subsequently, the empirical data obtained by semi-structured interviews with East Japan Railway Company show both physical and virtual ‘ba’ are used in the organisation. Comparing physical ‘ba’ with virtual ‘ba’, most informants described that physical ‘ba’ that allows face-to-face communication is appropriate for knowledge creation activities. Sharing the physical space allows participants to convey their ideas adequately with inter-corporeal interaction. As the construction industry heavily depends on tacit knowledge due to its intrinsic nature, the environment where tacit knowledge conversion is easily taken place is considered effective for knowledge creation. Also, focusing on individuals’ characteristics specifically generation differences and Belbin orientation, these variables do not affect the perception of ‘ba’ that facilitates knowledge creation. On the other hand, organisational tenure may indirectly influence the perception of ‘ba’ since most of the interviewees have worked for a long time within the same organisation and the organisation’s values and philosophy can be steeped in their minds as their tenures increased. <br/>Finally, recommendations were developed to facilitate the knowledge-creating process by combining the results of the literature study and empirical study. The following three key recommendations were proposed: design 'ba' with corporeality; complement the lack of corporeality; Clarify the meaning of ‘ba’. <br","Knowledge creation; the concept of 'Ba'; SECI model; construction industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Photovoltaic technology has become one of the leading renewable alternatives for energy production. One main factor in the diminished performance of a photovoltaic module is partial shading, due to the resulting mismatch conditions in the module. However, it is difficult to understand how a specific PV module reacts to shading in comparison with others, as currently the ability of a module to withstand shading is usually expressed in vague qualitative terms on its datasheet. In this work, the development of a shading tolerability calculator in MATLAB was completed. This tool can relatively easily and quickly calculate the shading tolerability of a module as a numeric parameter (ST), which can then be used for characterization and comparison purposes. <br/><br/>First a MATLAB based model to simulate the IV characteristics of a PV module under different conditions (including partial shading) was developed. The model was developed at a cell level, and was translated to a module level by taking the series connection of cells into account, and modeling the impacts of reverse bias and bypass diodes operation. Validation with experimental data showed errors at Pmpp remained below 4.5%. <br/><br/>Next, the shading scenarios to be considered were defined and developed. The objective was to determine Pmpp of a given PV module under all possible shading scenarios, using the IV simulation model developed. The possible shading scenarios were based on a PV module split into 12 equal sections, and considering two irradiance levels: 100 W/m2 for shaded sections, and 1000 W/m2 for unshaded. To improve the speed of the model, which was an important aim within this project, the existence of equivalent scenarios based on the symmetry of the module was utilised. The Pmpp value was only simulated once for every unique scenario, greatly reducing the required number of simulations and simulation time.<br/><br/>Based on the above, the development of a calculator for the shading tolerability parameter of a PV module was accomplished. The ST values for more than 40 PV modules were calculated, giving ST% values ranging between 22% and 29%. Correlations between different module parameters were explored to see their impact on ST. One main result seen was the impact of bypass diodes on ST, specifically the considerable positive effect of a higher number of bypass diodes. Another was the positive correlation between temperature coefficient of open circuit voltage and ST. <br/><br/>Finally, a case study for the calculation of ST for a half-cell butterfly module was implemented. This involved modeling parallel connections in PV modules, as well as updating the IV simulation model to include this new type of PV module configuration. The ST values for two half-cell butterfly modules were calculated, giving ST% values of around 42%. This was significantly higher than those calculated for the conventional modules, highlighting the improved shading tolerance of half-cell butterfly modules. The adaptability of this model to be able to calculate the shading tolerability of any type of configuration of PV module was also demonstrated through this case study, paving the way for future research.","Photovoltaic; Shading; Solar Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-25","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","TrustPV",""

Distributed solar photovoltaics (DSPV) systems characterised by reducing transmission line losses, increasing grid resilience and relaxing requirements for investment have experienced exponential growth over the last decade. China’s DSPV power market has witnessed momentous changes since 2012, when a series of policies were introduced. DSPV is becoming the main approach to utilizing solar energy in China.<br/>However, there are barriers impeding distributed energy development regarding financial, technological, regulatory, resources and awareness aspects. To overcome obstacles to DSPV development, several scholars emphasized the importance of promoting business model innovation (BMI) in DSPV projects. Before any further design and implementation, a comprehensive understanding of BMI is essential. The fundamental step is to identify the origins of BMI and investigate how DSPV projects enterprises can capture and subsequently respond to changes within and external to their businesses. <br/>This work aims to investigate business model innovation for distributed solar photovoltaic project companies through dynamic sustainable business model frameworks. The main research question is “How can we develop a dynamic sustainable business model framework to understand business model innovation in distributed solar PV (DSPV) projects in China?” The objective is to develop dynamic sustainable business model framework and then apply it to DSPV project companies in China in order to understand business model innovation.<br/>Through the study, business model innovation at the firm level (DSPV project enterprise) is a dynamic process. Due to environmental and business variables, a company’s business model constantly changes in response to external and internal opportunities and threats. These variables are essential for understanding business model innovation. Changes in external factors (e.g., policy and regulation, industrial technology innovation, customer demand, market competition, etc.) and internal factors (e.g., company technology improvement, project O&amp;M management, personnel capability, etc.) could trigger business model innovation. Starting with recognizing opportunities or threats, DSPV enterprises respond to these variables differently depending on company capability and external business environment. Meanwhile, changes within business model elements tend to be coherent and interlinked over time. For an efficient business model innovation, associated business model elements are supposed to be in line with a changed business model element. On the way, these changes can either create or capture value for stakeholders, including customers, society and the environment. The constantly changing process as to BMI is based on a company’s flexible operation and management for adapting to the complex and varying environment.","Dynamic Sustainable Business Model Framework; Business Model Innovation; Distributed Solar Photovoltaics; Business Model Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Maintaining certain geometry in space is advantageous in many applications such as space interferometry and underwater sensing. At present, there is a variety of distributed solutions for agents to converge to desired formations and track a series of prescribed maneuvers. They typically rely on the relative kinematics e.g., relative positions of the neighboring agents as state observations for the local controller. In harsh working environments, the acquisition of the relative kinematics is challenged and observation losses might occur, which can be detrimental to the optimality of formation. <br/><br/>In this work, observation losses in noisy environments are addressed under a distributed formation control framework. Three types of solutions are proposed to enhance the robustness which is evaluated through the improvements of tracking error, convergence speed, and smoothness of trajectories in both random and permanent loss settings. Firstly, a relative localization technique is proposed using formation itself as a spatial constraint. Secondly, a dynamic model is established for the agents entailed by a Kalman filter-based solution. Finally, a fusion of the previous two types is inspired and it exhibits superior performance than both aforementioned types individually. <br/><br/>This work not only provides means of relative localization without additional sensor data but also shares insights into coping with random or permanent graph changes for stress-based formation control systems.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The goal of this Thesis is to reduce the patient's discomfort during hemodialysis by achieving improved vascular access using a novel insertion device with a dilating diameter. High measures of discomfort are associated during achieving vascular access during hemodialysis therapy. The vascular access devices require large gauge sizes (14/15G) compared to the entry veins to achieve the high blood flow rates (BFRs) needed for an efficient dialysis. These large gauge sizes result in a moderate to severe pain experience for most dialysis patients during insertion. Moreover, the entered vein needs to be surgically prepared before it is able to withstand the used BFRs. A now commonly used technique to prepare the vein, is the creation of an Arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Although less than the techniques used in the past, an AVF can come with complications. An AVF can cause more narrow access veins due to maturation problems, which results in a higher chance of a miss hit and unnecessary trauma. <br/><br/>To reduce patients' discomfort associated with achieving vascular access, a design process was set up in order to reduce both the experienced pain as the possibility of miss hits. The size of the access device was said to be a major cause for both problems. Accordingly, there seems to be a need for a smaller insertion gauge without lowering the BFR. Based on this, a novel insertion device with a dilating diameter was designed. <br/><br/>A patent study was conducted of existing solutions for the design obstacles. The solutions found were combined with novel ideas not found during the patent study and consolidated in a morphological overview. This was used as a tool to choose and elaborate four concepts based on two dilation solutions: a dilating spiral and a slide-on dilator. <br/><br/>To validate the concepts two proof-of-principle experiments were executed for every dilation solution, resulting in four experiments in total. A difference in insertion force for adding a slide-on dilator compared to the conventional straight needles was measured. The slide-on dilator was found to produce a higher insertion force than the currently used needle and was therefore rated as more painful than the currently used insertion methods. As the dilating spiral is a new design, its working principle itself had to be proven during the experiment. The results showed how a dilating spiral, as designed in the concepts, is able to create sufficient dilation force.<br/><br/>The experimental results were used to rate the set-up criteria and choose one final concept. The concept was constructed and assembled, after which the design was validated by means of 3D printed parts and a larger scaled dilating spiral. The evaluation was incorporated into the final design, which in turn has been evaluated after it was assembled. All parts but the Spiral-Dilator were 3D-printed on a scale 1:1 and work well together. The device fits well in one's hand, feels naturally and is easy to handle. The Spiral-Dilator was created on a larger scale. Testing made clear that a twisting motion was necessary to let the spiral stay in shape during the slide back of its holder. To do so, the Slide Container has to be altered to enable the Dilation Slide slide back in a twisting motion. A final version of the Spiral-Dilator was not created and will be necessary for a definite confirmation of the working principle. Nonetheless, the Dilating Insertion Device (DID) has shown to be promising, it adds accuracy and in potential reduce experienced pain to the insertion for vascular access.<br","Medical device; Hemodialysis; Dilation; Vascular Access","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-08-17","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Anaerobic biodegradability and toxicity test were done to measure the extent of anaerobic digestion in this wastewater. Different parameters such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, volatile fatty acids (VFA), alkalinity, pH, and nutrient uptake were measured to access the biological performance of the EGSB reactor starting from unacclimated anaerobic granular biomass. Data analyzing tools including Excel and PHREEQC modeling were used in this research study. Excel tool was used to plot the graph and curve fitting whereas the PHREEQC model was done to understand the corrosivity of the biogas and calcite precipitation in the effluent discharge pipe.<br/>The results showed that about 60% of the organic compounds in the wastewater were biodegradable, and no significant toxicity was found. Also, the performance of the EGSB was good with COD removal of roughly 50% at the stable phase. The presence of wood cellulose fiber in the wastewater had a negative impact on the performance of the reactor more specifically blockage in the recirculation and reduce methane production. However, based on the experimental results, EGSB alone would not be enough to remove most of the organic pollutants, which require additional post treatment such as aerobic system and membrane filtration to meet the discharge limit. <br","Chemithermomechanical pulping; Anaerobic treatment; Expanded Granular Sludge Bed bioreactor (EGSB)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-25","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The two main problems are (1). how to optimize GP hyperparameters in fully-distributed manner, and (2). how to aggregate predictions from agents.<br/><br/>The state-of-the-art solution for distributed GP hyperparameter optimization problem is proximal alternated direction method of multipliers (pxADMM) algorithm, which requires a center station in MAS. Based on pxADMM, two fully-distributed pxADMM algorithms are proposed such that the center station is no longer needed. Asynchronous behavior is also introduced into the proposed algorithms, so that they can deal with heterogeneous processing time of agents. Simulations are carried out on both artificial and real datasets. Results show that the proposed methods all achieve stable convergence.<br/><br/>The aggregation methods can be classified based on whether the local datasets are assumed to be independent or not. Under independent assumption, PoE and BCM families of methods can be distributed by applying discrete time consensus filter (DTCF). In this project, primal-dual method of multiplier (PDMM) is proposed to replace DTCF so that the aggregation converges faster. Without independent assumption, the Nested Pointwise Aggregation of Experts (NPAE) considers the cross-correlation among local datasets to achieve consistent aggregation. The current NPAE-JOR algorithm distributes NPAE in complete graph, where flooding variables across network is required before aggregation. In this project, CON-NPAE is proposed to extend NPAE to fully-distributed version in connected graph, where flooding is not required. Simulations on artificial and real datasets are performed. Results show that the proposed PDMM based algorithm reduces the iterations needed for fully-distributed PoE and BCM families of methods. The CON-NPAE is fully-distributed and makes better aggregations than independence assumption based methods in networks with high connectivity.

This project aims to find out where improvements can be made to the Revolt HUB. The starting points that have been used to define the scope are the improvement of the interaction and the embodiment of the brand values, particularly the combination of the product and sustainability.

In order to find possible areas of improvement, multidisciplinary research was performed. Through this research, an analysis was made of the company, the current product, the current and desired interaction and the context. The findings showed that making small adjustments led to a chain reaction of other adjustments. This resulted in a consensus with all stakeholders to rebuild the HUB from scratch. All this was accomplished through a vision formulated according to trends and developments in both the technological and social fields. Based on this, recommendations were presented as a complete redesign of the HUB. The interaction is leading and serves as a starting point for further elaboration of the complete product portfolio. In addition, the concept also lends itself to the implementation of future technological developments, as a separate single charging station is incorporated into the design; the new ONE.

To help mitigate climate change, photovoltaics (PV) is seen as a technology with the tremendous capability to satisfy the world’s electricity demands by tapping into renewable energy from the sun. There are various PV technologies available, each with its challenges; the newest upcoming material is perovskites. They have showcased an immense potential of further lowering the production costs of solar modules, lower material consumption, and promising high conversion efficiencies. The single cell efficiency has seen incredible improvement in the last decade to 25.7%. The next stage is the scaling up to module level and outdoor deployment. However, some significant challenges remain towards achieving this; one is its response to shading, which has been studied little thus far and will be investigated in this study. The increasing integration of PV into the close surroundings also means that integrated PV will be exposed to much more shading than a typical panel in a solar farm. It is imperative to understand the behavior of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to shade, primarily due to the poor reverse bias behavior reported in recent years. Since the cells are typically connected in series, shaded cells dissipate energy by going into negative voltages. The response to shading of any material also depends on the interconnection method adopted for the solar cells. So, several interconnections were identified in the project, a few including bypass diodes to improve shade tolerance. Due to the poor reverse bias characteristics of the PSCs, the interconnections and shading were modeled using Matlab and Simulink to better understand the interconnection configuration with the least power mismatch losses. Total Cross Tied (TCT) with bypass diodes was identified as the optimal configuration. Furthermore, the TCT interconnection with bypass diodes was tested experimentally on a shading setup to validate the model. The experiments confirmed the modeled results. None of the modules degraded under shading for the interconnection as the cells did not experience large enough reverse bias voltages. Additionally, tests were conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanism of perovskites. Shading was tested on a single module, parallel and perpendicular to laser scribes, to confirm that the degradation was due to reverse bias voltage. When the module was exposed to an Electroluminescence (EL) test after shading, it revealed the degradation through the formation of dark spots. The degradation is speculated to form due to the formation of shunt paths caused by the migration of copper into the absorber layer. A similar test was conducted on semi-transparent modules that did not lead to degradation. Also, the modules were tested to find their reverse breakdown voltage. It was observed to breakdown at -6.5V, translating to a cell breakdown at -1.6V. Interestingly, the module’s performance was slightly regained under light soaking for one hour in forward bias due to the reversal of the ion movement, which occurred in the reverse bias condition. The research into the shading of PSCs is still in the early days; many further topics for the future are proposed that could be interesting for later research.","Photovoltaic; Perovskite solar cells; Shading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Climate code SPEEDY is used to investigate relations between cloud patterns on rocky exoplanets with oceans for various planet parameters, such as obliquity and incident stellar flux, and the observable signals of such exoplanets are computed. SPEEDY was chosen for the modelling of rocky exoplanets, because of its speed, since our aim is to run simulations for various planet parameters, and its flexibility, since it allows the adaptation of planet properties such as the presence and distribution of continents. The planet’s rotational period is found to have the most obvious influence on the cloud pattern: with increasing rotational speed, bands of clouds form, parallel to the equator, with the number of bands increasing with the rotational speed. The total flux and polarisation of starlight that is reflected by the planets with cloud bands as functions of the wavelength and the planetary phase angle are computed. Also the influence of the integration time of the observations on the reflected light signals is studied. Our main recommendation for further research is to broaden the applicability of SPEEDY for exoplanet research by first gaining more insight into the parametrisations and then by adapting them where necessary to allow wider parameter settings.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In particular, hydrogen combustion in gas turbine combustors is expected to play an essential role in the energy transition. Hence, a fuel-flexible gas turbine combustor operating with a wide range of natural gas and hydrogen fuels is necessary. Low Swirl Burner(LSB), developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), is one of the promising solutions for fuel-flexible gas turbine combustors. However, hydrogen combustion in LSB at lean conditions is accompanied by several challenges, especially flame flashback. Flashback results in damage and shutdown of gas turbines. Recent experimental studies performed on LSB revealed the occurrence of flame flashback at a high volume percentage of hydrogen, but the exact cause of the flashback in LSB is yet to be discovered.<br/><br/>In this study, numerical modelling of low swirl premixed burner with turbulent flow and high hydrogen content is performed. RANS simulations are performed initially for the non-reacting flow and are validated with the experimental measurements. Flamelet combustion model with Zimont Turbulent Flame speed correlation is employed to model the reacting flow. The flame front position obtained from the Zimont correlation closely agrees with the experiments.<br/>Further, Algebraic Flame Surface Wrinkling (AFSW) correlation is compared with the Zimont correlation for hydrogen-enriched flames. Based on the comparison, it is concluded that the AFSW correlation did not lead to a significant difference. However, both the correlations failed to model the flashback process. Therefore, the potential mechanism responsible for the flame flashback in LSB is examined. It has been found that none of the standard flashback mechanisms is accountable for the flame flashback in LSB. Furthermore, the effect of different flame shapes reported in the experiments is evaluated. It has been observed that ’M’ shape flame has more propensity to flashback than ’V’ shape flame. Then, a shear layer and turbulent wakes in the premix nozzle of the LSB were noticed. Hence, an increase in flame speed due to the local enrichment of thermo-diffusive unstable hydrogen flame and all the aforementioned effects might lead to a sudden flashback in LSB.<br/><br","Low Swirl; combustion; flashback; hydrogen; hydrocarbon; turbulence; boundary layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The adaption of hydrogen instead of natural gas as a fuel in gas turbine combustors introduces additional challenges regarding flame stability. One instabilities is boundary layer flashback. This phenomenon occurs if the flame speed exceeds the local flow velocity. Then the flame can propagate upstream, which can result in equipment failure. Lean premixed hydrogen mixtures are more prone to boundary layer flashback because hydrogen flames have both a smaller quenching distance and higher flame speed compared to natural gas. Therefore, operating at 100% hydrogen fuel content is an enormous challenge. Active control strategies are a promising strategy to prevent and withstand possible occurrences of boundary layer flashback in gas turbine combustors. In this work, the detection, prevention, and counteraction of flashback are investigated in unconfined Bunsen burners. After an experimental analysis of suitable sensors, a tracking controller is therefore designed and different control design approaches evaluated.<br/><br/>Both the increase in flame fluctuations and in flame angle are reasonable as indicators for a flame moving towards flashback as the flow velocity is reduced. However, the complex nature of a flame makes it challenging to measure these effects in a flame. Four types of sensors, i.e. an ion sensor, a thermocouple, a photo-detector and a microphone, were investigated for their ability to detect flashback and to find precursors that indicate the onset of flashback. A Bunsen burner equipped with the different types of sensors was used in an experiment to determine the most suitable sensor type. Of the investigated sensors, the thermocouple is the most promising sensor for both flashback detection and use the temperature signal as a control variable. The temperature is a precursor for the onset of flashback since the temperature increases with increasing flame angle. Also, by placing multiple thermocouples in $360^oC$ configuration on the burner rim, it is possible to estimate the position, where the flame entered the burner.<br/><br/>A complete fault-tolerant framework to control a flashback event is proposed. This framework increases the flashback resistance of the system and it counteracts possible flashback events, which is considered as a fault in the system. A supervisor block has two functions. Firstly, the supervisor uses a fault detection method, known as trend checking, to detect flashback. Secondly, it decides which strategy should be applied, based on the temperature measurements. The fault-tolerant control strategy is threefold. First, the prevention controller closes the loop, so it can steer away from flashback conditions by rejecting disturbances and tracking a desired reference path using the temperature data. Different tuning methodologies based on the traditional proportional and integral (PI), linear-quadratic-integral (LQI) and pole placement regulator (PPR) are explored for this purpose. The robustness of the proposed controller was verified through loop shaping interpretation. However, flashback could be consider as an stochastic process that still could be triggered. Therefore, the second task is to detect present flashback events and apply counteraction to oppose the fault. A design is proposed by the injection of pressurized air upstream of the burner rim to push back the flame by diluting the boundary layer and increasing the flow speed. A proof-of-concept is validated in the experimental set-up as a possible and feasible counteraction. The third task is a final safety measure. A safety switch would be applied to shut off the fuel supply to fail safe after a potential unsuccessful counteraction attempt. The fault-tolerant control framework was simulated in Simulink for a demonstration purpose, where the models were identified from experimental data.<br/><br/>The proposed fault tolerant control framework is intended to increases the flashback resistance of the system by being more robust towards disturbances and flashback events that would normally require a restart of the system. Its potential to do so has been confirmed by simulations. However, further research on the prediction of flashback and controller implementation are still required to run burners on 100% hydrogen without flashback.","Premixed Bunsen flame; Boundary layer flashback; Hydrogen combustion; System Identification; Fault Detection; Fault Tolerant Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The methods considered here are non-end-to-end which means that first features need to be generated which will be consecutively fed to a classification algorithm. Features are created by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a suitable point neighborhood. A neighbourhood of 20 nearest neighbours turned out to work most effectively. A Neural Network and Random Forest will be tested as classification al- gorithms. The training dataset consisted of a combination of a tree database from the municipality of Delft and AHN4. This training data is imperfect since it contained both false positives and false negatives due to how it was created. For both algorithms a training dataset of 400 000 points was used, to prevent overfitting, with a 50/50 split between tree and non-tree points. Both algorithms were validated against two datasets, Validation Dataset one is a small generic dataset and Validation Dataset two is a dataset consisting of problem scenarios such as cars and construction sites. The Neural Network scored an accuracy of 92.8% and the Random Forest 94.4% against Validation Dataset one. Against Validation Dataset two the Neural Network scored an accuracy of 66.9% and Random Forest 72.4%. Both algorithms had trouble with correctly classifying cars and construction sites as non trees. In the end, the Random Forest algorithm had a higher accuracy than the Neural Network, however this might be the result of the imperfect training data.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","Geoscience and Remote Sensing",""

(mentor); van Nunen, Karolien (mentor); van Eeten, M.J.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This study investigates organizations’ approaches to managing cybersecurity challenges that are associated with high levels of teleworking. Over the last two and a half years the pandemic forced organizations to implement teleworking models that resulted in a large share of the workforce working from home. The increasing use of teleworking resulted in organizations being worried about their ability to handle cyberthreats, while at the same time they sidestepped on their cybersecurity to implement a proper teleworking model. There is a large body of literature showing what the security risks and practices are related to these high levels of teleworking, while it is not clear what the related security challenges are and how organizations are approaching these. So, there is a gap in the literature regarding the understanding of the current cybersecurity challenges and approaches that are associated with these high levels of teleworking. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with both cybersecurity consultants and individuals that fulfill a role in an organization that makes them responsible for the cybersecurity management of the organization. Thematic analysis was used that led to the identification of four main security challenges and four approaches used to manage these challenges. The following four challenges were identified: ‘Security vs. privacy’ which shows how it is challenging for organizations to secure the private environments of their organizations without invading their privacy. Secondly, the ‘Control &amp; awareness which addresses the balance between control and awareness. More restrictions can lead to less security if there is a lack of awareness and knowledge among employees. Thirdly, the ’Lack of resources’ challenge, not all organizations have the monetary resources to achieve the desired level of security. Finally, the ’Priorities’ challenge shows how according to the consultants, cybersecurity is still seen as a burden and is being neglected by organizations, regardless of the increase in cybersecurity attention and the increased risks related to high levels of teleworking.<br/>The identified approaches start with ‘Technology &amp; Processes’ as this is most often the first choice for organizations. Using device management systems with corporate devices or BYOD devices with an enclave to ensure security without invading privacy. Education of the workforce is deemed one of the most successful approaches, since the security of the organizations is now more dependent on the workforce, raising awareness through education is of great importance. An approach that at first glance seems more counter-intuitive is the establishment of a security culture that takes years to achieve. Cybersecurity is involved into the daily tasks of the complete workforce. Without forcing and too many controls, but nudging employees by discussion and giving them responsibilities. The last approach shows that despite the priority challenge that is only mentioned by consultants, organizations want to become more mature, and organizations are currently giving cybersecurity a higher priority.<br/><br","Cybersecurity; Teleworking; Thematic Analysis; Organizations; Challenges","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

(mentor); Roohi, K. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","IIn the past decades, the rapid development of industry and economy leads to heavy dependence on fossil fuels which causes increasing concentration of CO2 in atmosphere. Now, excessive CO2 emission has accelerated global warming and caused a series of irreversible environmental problems. To address this problem, electrochemical conversion of CO2 is considered one of the most promising strategies to due to its mild operating conditions, utilization of renewable sources of energy and controllability of the process. However, CO2 reduction faces many difficulties which requires active catalysts to achieve effective conversion. Among all the catalysts, Copper (Cu)-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) become veryattracting candidates due to their high porosity, tunable structure and special properties to convert CO2 into various hydrocarbons. In particular, two-dimension (2D) Cu-MOFs can further improve the electrical conductivity and catalytic activity. In this study, three types of Cu-based MOFs are studied as catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Among them, Cu-BTC is a conventional 3D MOF, Cu-HAB and Cu-HHTP belong to 2D MOFs. In particular, Cu-HAB has not been used as catalyst for CO2 reduction before. To investigate their catalytic performance for CO2 reduction, the surface morphologies and bond structures were first characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Then Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Chronoamperometry (CA) were used to examine the electrochemical performance and stability of them. In the last, the product selectivity of Cu-HAB and Cu-HHTP wastested using Gas Chromography (GC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). From the results, 2D MOFs show higher catalytic activity, capacitance and conductivity which suggest 2D structure is beneficial for catalytic process. Especially Cu-HAB shows the best conductivity and catalytic activity due to presence of Cu-N4 coordination in the MOF structure as well as smaller particles. But from the point of view of product selectivity, Cu-HHTP performs better than Cu-HAB which may indicate Cu-O4 sites can better engage with CO2 molecule and transfer it to other products.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2022","The European Union has set itself the target of becoming climate neutral by 2050 through a series of policies affecting industries such as the energy sector. This sector will be subject to considerable change with renewable energies set to replace fossil fuels. However, the EU will not be able to solely rely on its domestic production of renewable energies. An option would be to import from Africa as it is close to Europe, while it has considerable potential in terms of renewable energies. Therefore, this research addresses the following question: How can Africa-EU hydrogen and biomass supply chains contribute to the greening of the EU’s energy mix by 2050 while contributing to Africa’s renewable energy development? This question is answered by assessing two renewable energy supply chains: biomass and hydrogen. This study uses the Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis framework to investigate these intercontinental supply chains. The research identifies the top-three African countries based on parameters relevant to both supply chains, such as their existing energy infrastructure, transport infrastructure and natural resources. The three best performing countries for each supply chain are assessed based on their potential biomass and hydrogen production and exports to the EU by 2050 considering distinct scenarios (realistic and ambitious) for each energy product. The scenarios account for the size of the EU’s demand for biomass and hydrogen respectively in 2050, with hydrogen also containing an average scenario taking into account the average of the forecasted EU energy demanded in existing research. The results show that the best suited African countries for the export of biomass to the EU are Morocco, Egypt and South Africa, while for hydrogen these include Morocco, Egypt and Algeria. It is also found that in a realistic scenario, 5,7% of the EU’s import demand for biomass and 100% of its import demand for green hydrogen could be fulfilled by the top three supplier countries in each case. In the average hydrogen scenario, 33,7% of the EU’s import demand would be fulfilled. For the ambitious scenario, 4% of the biomass import demand and 4,2% of the EU’s hydrogen import demand would be met. The lower percentages of coverage in the ambitious scenario are due to the significantly larger demand of biomass and hydrogen with respect to the realistic scenario. The research finds that across all scenarios, African countries will be able to meet their own demand for biomass and hydrogen through domestic production, except for South Africa which will not be able to fulfil its demand entirely by itself. Additionally, the research highlights important policy areas which need to be considered, which include setting clearer goals for biomass and hydrogen, and encouraging the development of renewable energy demand in Africa and the EU.","Renewable energy; Supply Chain; Africa; Europe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","Pro2Tech - Inclusive carbon neutral pathways",""

An interleaved boost-converter topology with two inductors is used to divide the high currents over the two branches, in order to reduce the conduction losses in the MOSFET power switches at high input power.<br/><br/>A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) strategy is employed to find the optimal matching between the harvesting sensor, which in this case is a solar cell, and the input of the converter. The Maximum Power Point (MPP) is found by measuring the output current of the converter, decreasing the duty cycle of the switching power MOSFETs, and again measuring the output current to check if it increases. This process is repeated until the output current no longer increases, which is where the MPP will be. The duty-cycle pulses that control the power switches are generated by comparing a reference voltage representing the duty cycle with two sawtooth waves with a phase difference of 180 degrees generated on-chip.<br/><br/>Usually, for converters that handle large currents, large power switches are required to keep the on-resistance of the switches minimal such that the conduction losses do not dominate. Since the converter also needs to be able to efficiently convert smaller powers, the size of the power switches is made configurable. This is necessary since otherwise the gate-charge losses will become dominant. The total size of the segmented power switches are controlled digitally by a logic unit that calculates the expected input current using 2-bit representations of the measured output current and the two most significant bits of the 5-bit representation for the duty cycle set by the MPPT.<br/><br/>Schematic simulation results show a conversion efficiency of up to 92%. The proposed system is designed and simulated using 180 nm TSMC CMOS technology. The chip covers a total silicon area of 2.20 mm2, with an active area of 1.12 mm2.","Energy Harvesting; Interleaved Boost Converter; DC-DC converter; Photovoltaic; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Integrated Circuits; CMOS; Relaxation Oscillator; Sawtooth generator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-24","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

These trolleybuses are equipped with an on-board battery large enough to provide energy for certain parts of the route. Thanks to that, the parts of the line do not have to be covered with overhead lines. As the vehicles charge their batteries en route, the IMC trolleybuses do not have to stop for depot charging which gives them advantage over regular e-buses. <br/><br/>Main task of this thesis is to develop and study a new charging scheme for IMC trolleybuses called the Valley-Charging. While conventional methods can only use two predefined charging powers, Valley-Charging allows changing the charging power over time based on the conditions on the trolley-grid. To evaluate the suitability to charge, methods of evaluating the state of the trolley-grid, such as traffic or power capacity of substations were developed into an estimator suggesting the appropriate charging power. The estimator is a set of conditions and constraints which use data that are available on-board of the trolleybus en route without any way of communication with other vehicles or infrastructure, such as bus voltage, bus current or bus position.<br/><br/>Multiple version of the estimator were developed and analysed for problematic circumstances. New conditions were added after that to make the estimator more complex. The Valley-Charging method supported by the estimator was implemented to 9 new IMC trolleybuses added to the Arnhem trolleygrid. Simulations with the latest version of the estimator showed that the new vehicles manage to service the line as it can collect enough energy under the overhead lines to successfully make the round trips. The results of the Valley-Charging scheme were compared with conventional charging schemes currently used. The Valley-Charging was found superior to the conventional methods in terms of energy collected or severity of technical limit violations.","In-Motion Charging (IMC); Trolleybus; Trolley-grid; Valley-Charging; Public transport; Estimator; Arnhem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-24","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Two predictive parameters, the pressure deficit [hPa] (Δ&#x1d443;) and maximum sustained wind speed [m/s] (vmax) are tested for the BaCla model. Frank copula is used by the BaCla model to predict the peak amount of rainfall. It employs the adapted Holland wind profile to create a 1D rain profile.

The calibration study challenges the assumption that the radius of maximum wind speed (Rvmax) is equal to the radius of maximum precipitation (Rpmax) in the BaCla model. Additionally, it is observed that the radial fit overestimates rainfall in scenarios where the peak amount of rainfall is less than 2.8mm/hr. These observations lead to modifications in the relationship between Rvmax and Rpmax, the radial fit threshold, and the fitting coefficients of the adapted Holland wind profile for rainfall distribution in the improved BaClHa model.

An important aspect in an autonomous agent is the navigation system it uses to traverse the environment. Not much emphasis has been paid in the past on autonomous agent navigation in cluttered environments. Cluttered and unknown environments such as forests and subaquatic environments need to have autonomous navigation systems developed just for them due to their uncertain and changing nature. Path planning algorithms are used for the navigation of an autonomous agent in an environment. The agent needs to reach a target location while avoiding the obstacles it detects along the path. Such a system is called a Detect and Avoid (DAA) system and there are different implementations for it of which some are explored in this thesis. The Artificial Potential Fields method or APF for short is a method for mobile agent navigation which is based on generating an attractive force on the agent from the target and a repulsive force from the obstacles. This leads to the agent reaching the target while avoiding the obstacles along the way. The Classical APF (CAPF) method works for structured environments well but not for cluttered environments. The CAPF method can be replaced with a modified version where the agent is surrounded by a set of points (called bacteria points) around its current location and the agent moves by selecting a bacteria point as a future location. This method is named the Bacteria APF (BAPF) method. This selection happens through combinatorial optimization based on the potential value of each bacteria point. In this thesis, we propose two distinct contributions to the BAPF method. The first one being the use of an adaptive parameter in the repulsive cost function which is determined through a brute-force search. The second addition is a branching cost function that changes the value of the repulsive potential based on predefined perimeters around each obstacle. We show through simulations on densely and lightly cluttered environments that this Improved BAPF (IBAPF) method significantly improves the performance of the system in terms of the convergence to the target by almost 200% and reduced the time it takes to converge by around 25% as well as maintain the safety of the navigation route by keeping the average distance from obstacles around the same value.","Detect and Avoid; Autonomous Navigation; Cluttered Environments; Artificial Potential Fields","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","Airborne Data Collection on Resilient System Architectures",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Generating synthetic images has wide applications in several fields such as creating datasets for machine learning or using these images to investigate the behaviour of machine learning models. An essential requirement when generating images is to control aspects such as the entities or objects in the image. Controlling this helps in creating custom datasets tailored for the above applications and creates a platform to conduct diverse experiments with the generated images, enabling research in the application's field.Existing methods individually enable controllability over various elements in the image such as selecting the objects, their properties, colour or the relations between objects, etc. but we identify a research gap in this field where no single method allows the user to control all these aspects of the image. An additional research gap identified is that existing methods cannot generate images based on a query with a logic based combination of entities.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we aim to fill this research gap by developing SceneUI - a system that allows the user to specify and control aspects of the scene through a user interface such as the objects, object properties, spatial relations between objects, object colour, extent of contextual objects and the background of the image. Additionally, we include a component where the scene is generated based on an OR query specifying the objects as predicates, which serves as a foundation to generating images based on entity combinations. Owing to the limited range of attributes for objects and the lack of objects with attributes in the dataset, we augment the dataset by expanding the attributes of objects in the scene graphs of the dataset and introducing additional objects that have attributes. This was done by identifying recurring objects in the dataset that could be expanded and manually annotating the changes in the dataset. This increases the level of controllability and gives a wider range of an object's properties to choose from.<br/><br/>The goal of the thesis is to design and develop a method that allows the user to declare, specify and manipulate elements of the image and eventually use the images generated for two use cases - Generating Images for Interpretable Machine Learning and Generating Images from Queries as Ground Truth. We evaluate SceneUI to show its usability and effectiveness for the two use cases through two experiments. In the first experiment, we use SceneUI to create biased datasets where each bias is based on an object's colour or object type and the goal is to train a deep learning model that learns the biases. The results show that the model learns the biases well and thus, SceneUI can be used to control datasets which can be used to benchmark machine learning explainability methods. The second experiment generates a dataset of images using the OR query and training machine learning models on the dataset to ensure the suitability of the images for machine learning tasks. As the generated images will be used as ground truth given a query for a specialised machine learning model, the model is expected to identify the predicate objects in the image. The results show SceneUI can generate images based on objects in the query and can also accommodate the objects to have properties. The models identify important features in the SceneUI-generated images and are thus suitable to be used as ground truth. We also discuss the limitations and tradeoffs of SceneUI and present potential future directions for research to improve its scalability.","Image Generation; Indoor Scene Synthesis; Machine learning; Explainable Machine Learning; Query Generated Image","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Web Information Systems","",""

Growing awareness of the negative contribution of the healthcare sector to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions demands environmental sustainability to be taken into account as well. Reusable and disposable flexible intubation scopes are of current interest to anesthesiologists because disposables are often utilized due to their presumed superior sterility, cheaper purchasing price and convenience. Knowledge about the life cycle environmental impact of flexible intubation scopes is limited, so research is required to aid in sustainable device selection. Therefore, the goal of this study is to compare the environmental impact of disposable and reusable flexible intubation scopes and design a sustainable concept to enable data-driven selection of sustainable flexible intubation scopes. A cradle-to-grave comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was made to quantify the environmental impact of reusable fiberoptic bronchoscopes (FOB) and disposable flexible video endoscopes (FVS) at 450 patient intubations. The largest contributors to the life cycle impact of the flexible intubation scopes were identified and used to generate a sustainable concept. The LCA results suggest that the reusable FOB has a lower life cycle impact in comparison to the disposable FVS, so selecting a reusable FOB is preferable from environmental perspective. Most life cycle emissions of the disposable FVS are caused by the material production of the device and manufacturing of the printed circuit board, while the disinfection process contributes most to the life cycle of the reusable FOB. The final concept of the sustainable flexible intubation scope contains plastic optical fibers and a thicker sleeve around the bending section of the insertion tube to make the device more durable and thus extend its lifetime. In order to minimize the environmental impact of flexible intubation scopes, it is recommended to develop flexible intubation scopes with plastic optical fibers, select low-impact materials for the device and revise the products’ life cycle at the product system level (e.g. disinfection process). Every small contribution towards a more sustainable healthcare system counts.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This research explores the effects different cooperation levels between countries have on water resources from a shared river. The water resources that are taken into account are: hydro electricity generated per dam, water that flows to the environment per dam, and irrigation water per station. The Zambezi river basin is selected as study area due to its trans-boundary multi-stakeholder complex character. The cooperation levels that are explored are no cooperation, full cooperation, and section cooperation. No cooperation entails that every hydroelectric dam in the river only tries to maximize its own electricity. With full cooperation the dams releases are adjusted to benefit all the water resources in the whole basin. With section cooperation the dam releases are adjusted to maximize the water resources within the section of the specific dam. A section is a geographical area that is based on country borders. A simulation model is built in order to explore the effects of the different cooperation levels. The release policies that maximize the water resources for full and section cooperation are found with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). From this research three findings are extracted. First, for the full cooperation level and the section cooperation level policies exist that dominate the no cooperation level policy for every examined water resource. Moreover, for these water resources found policies for either full or section cooperation produce similar results. Therefore, any of the explored cooperation forms could be more beneficial than no cooperation at all. Second, outcomes of this study indicate that owners of water resources located in the upstream of the river have less possible benefits from entering a cooperation agreement in which their dams have to adjust their release policy. These water resources can only improve by a small amount compared to water resources located in the downstream of the river. Third, policies do exist that are able to perform best for certain water resources, but also cause other water resources to decline to lower than their no cooperation value. Therefore, selecting fitting release policies is important since not every found policy leads to a better solution. Last, in this study best performing policies for electricity production and irrigation for both full and section cooperation are compared. It is discovered that adapting the best electricity policy for either one of the cooperation forms would be most beneficial for the involved stakeholders. This is due to the electricity policies having the highest relative resource gains. To conclude, cooperation in a river basin could result in an overall increase in water resources. However, reaching cooperation might prove to be difficult, because of the lower incentives for the stakeholders in the upstream of the river. Furthermore, extra care has to go towards selecting better performing policies, because policies exist that can cause a decline in water resources compared to when there is no cooperation in the river basin. Moreover, stakeholders are expected to select the policy that maximizes the electricity production, since these policies also perform well for other examined water resources.","Water; trans-boundary; management; cooperation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Many proposed means to achieve this decarbonization like the electrification of various sectors or the introduction of ‘new’ forms of energy such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage require existing energy infrastructures to be expended or entirely new energy infrastructures to be created. Since energy networks are capital intensive, minimizing their construction costs is essential for their realization. Previous works studying the cost minimization of energy networks often neglect that their construction costs can be influenced by geographical areas such as mountain ranges, existing infrastructures or zoning rules. Using methods borrowed from graph theory and geometrical computing, a method has been developed that is able to find costoptimal energy infrastructures in a spatial context of geographic regions with different costs for constructing power cables or pipelines through them. The method models these geographical areas as triangles on which borders a user-defined number of points are uniformly placed representing potential entry and exit points for pipelines or power cables. Experimenting with 144 randomly generated routing problems has shown that, on average, increasing the number of these placed border points results in a reduction of the total network costs. Although, this effect flattens when more than 7 of these points are placed. The method is applied to two offshore electricity networks in the Dutch North sea. These cases demonstrate the method’s strength in identifying trade-offs between energy networks’ investment costs and their (negative) influence on their spatial surroundings. Additionally, the method’s outcomes are well-suited to be used as a springboard for dialogue in energy infrastructure decision-making processes. Further research could focus on the extension of the model, by including existing connections, or the improvement of the model, by implementing a different method for modelling geographical areas that has a higher accuracy and is computationally faster.","Energy infrastructure; Graph theory; Offshore Wind; Policy; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The steel production capacity of a nation has a significant impact on its GDP. Even though steel rolling has been in the industry since the early 1700s, there have not been significant advancements in its technology space. The safety hazards to personnel and failure of process components have persistently posed daunting challenges for the steel industry. The advent of automation in the late 1900s helped the industry manage some of these challenges to a certain extent. Despite these technological improvements, the realm of steel rolling is still not explored thoroughly because steel rolling is a highly integrated and complex system with numerous process parameters impacting the quality of the finished product. As a result, the study of the dynamics of steel rolling is still under active research targeted toward improving the complex processes involved in the industry.<br/><br/>External factors play a significant role in the complexity of the steel rolling process. The scope of the work herein attempts to identify and model some of these significant external factors, also known as ""disturbances"" in control terminology. A Finite-Element Method (FEM) based simulator for the rolling process simulation incorporating the external disturbances is explored. The outcomes from this simulation will enable establishing regression models that facilitate quantifying external disturbances’ effects on the technological/process parameters in steel rolling.<br/><br/>The thesis is focused on studying the external disturbance of speed mismatch and proposing a quantitative model for evaluating the effect of speed mismatch on the process parameters of rolling. Subsequent to the development of the proposed disturbance quantitative model, three controller systems - Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller, and Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller will be implemented to evaluate comparisons between the controllers for disturbance rejection and reference tracking.<br/><br/>The scope of the work presented in this thesis is significant as it focuses on developing a quantitative model for the process disturbances that prevail in the steel rolling industry.","Speed Control; Steel mills; Steel rolling; Quantitative modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

With the devices that are being attacked becoming more sophisticated, so is SCA. In the past few years, the focus of the research in the field of SCA shifted towards the application of the powerful method of Deep Learning (DL). DL SCA methods can operate in a similar way as before seen methods in the profiled setting, such as Template Attack. In the profiled setting, SCA first creates a profile on a copy of the target device, to then subsequently use that same profile to perform a more powerful attack on the target device. DL SCA has proven to be quite the effective method, even showcasing its success against implementations utilising countermeasures. However, as DL SCA is fairly novel there still exist gaps in the knowledge we have of how to make DL SCA effective in all possible situations. Most research bases itself on software-based implementations, whilst rarely hardware-based implementations are discussed as they are often seen as more difficult to attack. Our contribution in this work is to showcase the difference in difficulty between hardware-based implementations and software-based implementations that both use countermeasures. We explore the attack performance of several state-of-the-art methods on hardware-based implementations with countermeasures and give insight into why their performance is the way it is. We also attempt to make a base methodology for attacking hardware-based implementations, both with and without countermeasures, as the current field of research is lacking this. Showcasing our suggested methodology, we achieve better than state-of-the-art results on a hardware-based implementation with countermeasures and competitive with the state-of-the-art results on a hardware-based implementation without countermeasures.","Side-channel analysis; Deep Learning; ResNets; Hardware-based encryption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wind turbines become increasingly larger, and available locations for offshore wind farms are shifting towards deeper waters, where jack-up vessels can no longer be used for installation. Heerema Marine Contractors is planning to install pre-assembled wind turbine generators (WTGs) with the semi-submersible crane vessel ‘Thialf’. During installation, the set-down stage is a critical phase in which the WTG is placed on top of the substructure. Due to uncontrollable motions in the WTG (caused by ship motions and wind loads), a significant impact can occur, which can cause considerable loads at the interface between WTG and substructure. The objective of this research is to determine the allowable impact ensuring sufficient structural integrity. The allowable impact is most conveniently expressed in the kinematic parameters impact speed Vi and oblique impact angle α.<br/><br/>Based on structural integrity analysis, two requirements are formulated; occurring stresses in the system shall not exceed the yield stress, and the RNA accelerations are limited to 1.5 g. In order to relate the impact kinematics (Vi and α) to the occurring stresses and accelerations, an impact model is constructed. A special case describes the collinear impact, in which α = 0°. The WTG tower and substructure are modelled as rods describing the axial motions. The applicability of the collinear case is limited, as a zero oblique angle is improbable. Yet, this collinear case provides insights in stress wave reflections and system parameter influence. The oblique case appends the classical rod with a classical beam describing transverse motions. The model simulates the oblique impact by imposing a bending moment and shear force at the interface. A contact model is created to approximate the contact stresses at the interface and the force eccentricity which determines the imposed moment.<br/><br/>The results obtained for the collinear case, which are successfully cross-checked with a FEM model, demonstrate that a superposition of incident waves and reflections can result in maximum stresses about three times higher than the induced stress at the interface. The induced stress at the interface is approximately linear proportional to the impact speed Vi. The oblique case shows increasing maximum stresses for increasing oblique angle, as the imposed moment results in bending stresses adding up to the axial stresses. The contact model shows significantly higher stresses than the global model. By including an elementary material damping model, considerably lower stresses are obtained, emphasizing the importance of material damping. Regarding the stress requirement, the contact model approximates an allowable impact speed Vi of 0.47 m/s for the largest possible oblique angle. It is demonstrated that the maximum RNA acceleration requirement imposes even more stringent allowable impact velocity: for the maximum oblique angle, the allowable impact speed Vi is 0.09 m/s.<br/><br/>The constructed models provide approximations of stresses and accelerations in the WTG and substructure. Due to several underlying assumptions, particularly the one-way coupling simplification, it is unfortunately not concluded that the oblique impact model yields conservative stress approximations. Hence, it is recommended for successive research to improve the contact model. Considering the approximated allowable impact speed Vi of 0.43 m/s limited by the yield requirement, the acceleration-limited allowable impact speed Vi of 0.09 m/s shows that RNA accelerations currently limit the impact. Hence, acceleration mitigation in the RNA could allow for significantly higher impact speeds, enlarging the operational window.<br","Wind Turbine Installation; Impact loads; Floating installation; WTG installation; Contact load","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-24","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Those essential trapping physics are translated into parameterized spaces during an offline stage before simulation starts. Among them, the hysteresis behavior of constitutive relations is captured by the surfaces created from bounding and scanning curves, on which relative permeability and capillarity pressure are determined directly with a pair of saturation and turning point values.On the other hand, the new development allows for simulation of realistic reservoir models with complex geological features by implementing in corner point gird. The extension to corner point grid is validated by comparing simulation results obtained from the cartesian box and the converted corner-point grid of the same geometry, and it is applied to a field scale reservoir eventually.<br/>A set of sensitivity analysis reveals the roles of various physical effects and their interactions in CO2 trapping in a realistic reservoir model, apart from the investigation on the impact of migration path, linear trapping coefficient and depth.

Emergency measures against failure of flood defenses may play an important role in flood risk management and is therefore currently being investigated. One of these measures is the BresDefender, which is a submersible floating pontoon that can be placed on the outer slope of a weakened dike section to prevent or delay failure. The application of the BresDefender can be divided into two scenarios: (1) to stop breach formation and (2) to limit water infiltration into the dike. The latter application scenario is expected to influence the development of the phreatic surface inside the dike, which affects dike safety. This study focuses on this scenario by assessing the effect of this seal on the development of the phreatic surface.<br/><br/>A numerical modelling approach is developed to describe this effect using the finite element method program PLAXIS, with add-on module PlaxFlow, to describe transient groundwater flow problems. This numerical modelling process starts off with the development of a model for a laboratory scale dike. In a previous study at the WaterLab, the phreatic surface level of the dike was measured over time for different degrees of sealing using a steel plate. These measurements are used to calibrate the numerical model, where the connection between seal and dike slope is described with a transmissive interface layer. It is concluded that this interface layer approximates the effect of the seal on the phreatic surface adequately.<br/>The next step is to extent the numerical model to a larger scale dike consisting of heterogeneous soils. This model represents the dike located in the Flood Proof Holland test facility, which consists of a permeable core covered by a low-permeability layer. By modelling this transition from simple to complex, influences of permeability, heterogeneity, and damage of the cover on the phreatic surface are identified.<br/><br/>The effect of a seal on the phreatic surface is also studied using physical model tests of the dike at Flood Proof Holland. The position of the phreatic surface is measured by pressure sensors in standpipes, which are spread over the crest and inner slope of the dike. Different scenarios for the seal are examined: stiff plate, flexible textile, and no emergency measure (reference case). For every scenario, experiments are carried out with and without a damaged location in the outer slope of the dike, which lead to a total of six test cases.<br/>The results of the physical model tests show multiple effects of the seal on the phreatic surface. First, the seal shows a delaying effect on the position of the phreatic surface, which implies that the seal delays the rise of the phreatic surface over time. The time until the phreatic surface reached a steady-state over the entire dike was increased with around 15% for plate cases and around 25% for textile cases when compared to the corresponding reference cases. Second, no decreasing effect on the phreatic surface can be observed, which means that the phreatic surface level in its steady-state condition is not affected by the placement of a seal on the outer slope. Third, the delaying effect is larger for a seal that consists of a flexible textile rather than a stiff plate. The connection between seal and dike cover is proved to be important since leakages underneath the seal influence its performance, especially when the dike is locally damaged.<br/>Last, the textile seal has a three-dimensional effect on the development of the phreatic surface. A certain area of influence can be identified where the phreatic surface is affected. The effect of the phreatic surface is seen to be stronger for locations near the textile and this effect diminishes over time. For the textile case on a damaged dike, an initial decrease of the phreatic level is observed directly behind the textile ranging up to 30 cm.<br/><br/>Overall, the effect of a seal on the development of the phreatic surface is concluded to be relatively small. The effect is only of a time-varying nature and, in three dimensions, the effect diminishes for larger distances.

(mentor); Wiertlewski, M. (graduation committee); Luijtten, Johannes (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Hand-worn haptic systems must be able to produce high-quality haptics while also being lightweight and energy-efficient. In order to meet market expectations, research is being done into novel drivetrains that may be implemented in hand worn devices. This is being pushed forward by the growing demand in the virtual reality sector, which is placing pressure on the development of new wearable force feedback technology. In order to validate a proof of concept, this thesis proposes a novel force feedback drivetrain with a dual actuator setup-a motor and a brake—that is integrated into a tabletop prototype. Using both a motor and a brake will reduce weight and improve the haptic rendering quality relative to each component when considered separately.<br/><br/>To evaluate the presumptive advantages, a theoretical analysis into the suggested hybrid actuation solution is conducted. The analysis comprises of numerous simulations using a model of the hybrid drivetrain's working principle. Additionally, the analysis is employed to investigate and spot any early-stage defects or undesirable behavior. Consequently, a 3D model was created in order to 3D print a functioning prototype in order to apply the theory in a physical version. The prototype is initially used to validate the simulation model and enforce the findings of the theoretical analysis. Force data is measured when using the prototype and in turn is fed into the simulation model to assess whether the output behaviour is consistent with the prototype. Both the model's competence and the prototype's predictability are assessed using the outcomes.<br/><br/>Finally, an experiment is conducted to both asses the mechanical performance and predictability as well as the participant's perception; 2 virtual environments and 3 actuation modes (motor, brake, and hybrid) were cross-examined and each repeated 6 times, for a total of 36 trials. This experiment ultimately assesses the prototypes validity and determines whether the theoretically assumed benefits are present in the prototype as well. Finally, the participant completes a questionnaire in the form of a 5-point Likert scale to determine if the experiment data complies with the users experience.<br/><br/>The theoretical analysis revealed both reliable behavior and potential problems, such as oscillations in feedback force due to rapid switching between actuator activity. However, the cause of this behaviour was identified and anticipated to be less pronounced during use of the prototype. The prototype was successfully designed and produced, and a comparison to the model revealed consistent findings and, thus, predictable behavior. However, the model occasionally miscalculated the velocity. The experiment also shows that the hybrid drivetrain approach is promising and outperforms the state of the art both in mechanical prowess as well as physical fidelity when providing haptic feedback; the motor fails to render rigid objects and the brake cannot render spring-like objects, while the hybrid approach can render both successfully.<br/><br/>The thesis demonstrates that additional investigation into the suggested drivetrain is supported, despite some obvious limitations. When compared to equally powerful DC motors, the hybrid technique, as employed in the prototype, is capable of portraying the largest variety of haptics, including hard walls, impacts, and stiffness while potentially conserving weight.","Haptic feedback; haptics; force feedback; Wearable; Glove; hybrid actuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The introduction of European Green Deal (EGD) has further raised the targets regarding greenhouse gas emissions, Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) and strengthened legislation concerning the circular economy and biodiversity. Forest biomass energy has been at the forefront of the EU policy-making. <br/> <br/>In Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), where the forest biomass is mainly used for domestic heating in the form of round-wood, the issue of AQ has a significant role in the energy transition agenda. The burning of round-wood in old low-efficiency stoves cannot produce sufficient energy while exposing people to indoor and outdoor pollution. Moreover, the Particulate Matter (PM) from wood burning is associated with multiple health conditions. <br/> <br/>The research aims to understand the impact of the forest bio-energy policy mix on EP; hence the following research question is formulated: How is the forest biomass energy policy mix affecting energy poverty alleviation in Sofia, Bulgaria? The case study approach is suited to answer the main research question. Furthermore, the case study approach allows for in-depth exploration of complex issues and uses multiple research methods.<br/> <br/>The theoretical framework of the research is based on the policy mix conceptualisation proposed by Rogge and Reichardt (2016). Rogge and Reichardt define three building blocks of the policy mixes: elements, process and characteristics. <br/> <br/>The conflicts existing between the national level policy instruments and the rest of the policy mix result in vertical and horizontal inconsistency. Nevertheless, synergies between the EU instruments and the appliance change programs result in synergies. The lack of capability of the local and national institutions and the perceptions conflict indicate a lack of policy mix coherence. At the same time, the policy mix does not have any instruments to cover market failures exposing households to higher energy cost and include policy instruments outside the national energy plans indicating a lack of comprehensiveness.<br/> <br/>While the lack of consistency, coherence and comprehensiveness have some positive impact on energy cost, thus reducing energy poverty, the conflicts in the policy mix are sustaining the use of<br/>traditional fuels. Overall, in the situation of surging energy prices, the forest bio-energy policy mix is sustaining the EP; however, in the case of lower energy costs, the existing conflicts constitute a significant obstacle in alleviating EP in Sofia.<br/> <br/>The evaluation of the impact of the policy mix on energy poverty in Sofia shows that the lack of constancy, coherence and comprehensiveness and credibility does not always lead to adverse effects on the energy poverty indicators. Nevertheless, the results support the findings of other articles focusing on the impact of the energy transition on energy poverty and that the way to achieve energy poverty alleviation is to strive for consistent, coherent and comprehensive energy transition policies. In terms of the policy mix concept, the study shows the need for further empirical research on the multi-dimensional policy mixes and more emphasis on the instrument’s design features. <br","Policy Mix; Energy poverty; Sofia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

A direct consequence is a decrease in ecosystem services - the benefits for humans that are provided by ecology - which are needed to keep especially cities liveable places. It is therefore crucial that cities are going to be developed more sustainably. Several theories acknowledge that for sustainable urban development, a shift is needed from a fragmented approach to a systematic approach to development. Therefore, this thesis has studied the potential of systems thinking to make ecology more important in the process of urban development. This has been done through document analysis and semi-structured interviews, which clarified how ecology is approached in the current process. It emphasized the current socio-technical landscape we are in, where ecology is still something that is controlled by humans and where urban ecology is not acknowledged as a distinct urban system. The interviews have been used to indicate the challenges and opportunities for systems thinking to change this landscape. This has formed the foundation of preliminary recommendations that have been validated through a workshop. Challenges like other interests, soft concept and no value can be overcome by various niche developments, tools that help in quantifying or monetising ecology so a value can be created that is interesting for developers, or help can be given to municipalities to set requirements on ecology. Using these tools, the context and its systems should always be considered for ecology not to be reduced to technical features, and no optimal ecological change can be created. Tools should also be used in a pre-initiative phase, where core challenges in an area, main drivers of developers and common goals of stakeholders can be established. Involving a wide range of stakeholders influences people to think more broadly and deeply about themes. Especially involving ecologists and maintenance departments in the design phase can create flexible designs that are future-proof and implemented successfully. Besides, ecologists, who know how to use language and create more chances in ecology instead of burdens and relate ecology to other themes, should be involved throughout the different phases of urban development as they often can make it more interesting for other disciplines. This eventually benefits the desired transition towards a landscape where the paradigm around urban ecology is entirely accepted, which results in the perception of ecology as something that is equal to humans and is therefore always on an equal level or even more important as the social and economic system ultimately benefitting the loss of biodiversity.","systems thinking; Urban ecology; Sustainable urban development; cities; Ecological system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

(mentor); Wellens, P.R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this report a new enriched finite volume method is introduced. This method will be particularly useful for fluid-structure interaction problems. In engineering many problems are in the domain of fluidstructure interaction. Examples of these are water in sea locks, blood flowing in vessels and sailing ships. Fluid problems are usually solved with the finite volume method (FVM), and structures in this fluid flow are handled by discretizing the fluid flow around this structure. The mesh therefore needs to be conforming around the structure, and remeshing is needed when the the structure is moving over time. Remeshing is a computationally expensive process, therefore in FEM a method called enriched FEM is developed, which removes the need for remeshing. Enriched FEM uses so-called enrichment functions; these enrichment functions decouple the structure from the mesh. This concept is implemented in the finite volume method to get an enriched FVM. In order to come up with this method; FVM and enriched FEM are compared to see if the concepts of enriched FEM can be implemented in FVM. The FE method that is used is the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which is a method that uses components of FEM and FVM. It discretizes equations as in FEM, but the elements are connected using flux functions as in FVM. DG is used to develop a high-order FVM and to introduce enrichments in FVM. The result of this thesis is a method which can implement enrichment functions in FVM, such that remeshing is no longer needed. The method is compared with conforming FVM and enriched DG, and it uses less computational power than both methods. The method also recovers the optimal convergence rate for a non-conforming FVM discretization. The enrichment functions are decoupled from the FVM discretization, therefore the method can be added to existing FVM solvers without changing the non-enriched part. The method is tested on a problem where waves are generated in a box.<br","FVM; FEM; enriched FEM; DE-FEM; wave-generation; discontinous Galerkin; DG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The scenarios correspond respectively to 3.9, 2.0, and 1.5°C of global warming in 2100 (vs. pre-industrial levels). Regionally, China produces the largest volume of ammonia as well as the ammonia with the largest climate change impact, due to the dominance of coal gasification technology. To meet 1.5°C of warming (the most sustainable scenario) a global decrease of fossil-based ammonia is needed. For many regions, electrolysis (yellow) ammonia becomes the technology with the lowest global warming potential by around 2045 in the RCP26 storyline and 2035 in RCP19. Until the regional electricity mixes are cleaner, steam reforming, steam reforming with carbon capture and storage, or methane pyrolysis offer lower emission options. However, electrolysis using on-site or designated renewable energy can create emission-free green ammonia, without waiting years for a cleaner regional grid. This means that electrolysis is the best choice for new plants if a producer is not making urea on-site (or has an alternative source of carbon dioxide if they are). Reduction in urea demand will be important for reducing reliance on steam reforming and coal gasification, and a swift uptake of electrolysis with designated renewables must be the focus. However, burden shifting associated with the dominance of renewable electricity systems and bioenergy carbon capture and storage in the RCP19 scenario must be taken into account.","Ammonia; Life Cycle Assessment; Future scenarios; Decarbonisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Such method assumes and successfully reconstructs the returned pulses in a photon starved condition, but fails under strong background noise. The increase in average photon counts per detection range limits the detection range, thereby rendering the system impractical for an automotive application where strong sunlight is present. The techniques proposed in this work, namely the asynchronous gating technique and the adaptive TDC gating technique, have been simulated for the SPAD-based LiDAR system and achieves a reliable detection range of 74m and reduces the required memory size by at least a factor of 14 in comparison to the system without a data compression technique, respectively. <br/><br/>In-pixel time-to-digital (TDC) converters are further studied in this work.

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The topic of standardization is an underexamined research field. Let alone the specific case of quality standard adoption in the semiconductor industry this study focuses on. Quality standards are developed to distinguish low from high-quality products and set up production and development processes. Once standards have been developed, it is not guaranteed that companies will adopt them. Factors often influence adoption. In this thesis, the fictional name GCpuSol is given to an existing company in the semiconductor industry that adopted two quality standards, the ISO 9001 and ISO 13485. This name stands for Gpu Cpu Solutions. Due to privacy concerns the real name of the company has not been given. Both standards are quality management standards, on which they are periodically audited. With these two quality standards, GCpuSol formed an excellent company to study which factors affect the likelihood of adopting this category of standards. Hence, the main research question is which factors affect the adoption of quality standards in the semiconductor industry, according to experts? Factors have been found by conducting a literature review and by interviewing experts. First, three theories are examined that describe factors on the adoption of innovation and standards; the neo-institutional, network economics, and diffusion of innovation theory. Also, the Technology Organization Environment (TOE) framework has been used to find factors. After that, four structured interviews were followed with experts to find additional relevant factors. Consequently, a list of fifteen relevant factors was derived. The factors are: pressures from government organizations, pressure from non-government organizations, pressures from customer(s), pressures from big player(s), pressure from supplier(s), mimetic pressures, normative pressures, management support, centralization, formalization, organization size, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability. These factors are separated into three categories: pressure from (external) stakeholders, organizational characteristics, and perceived characteristics of quality standards. Then, the factors had to be ranked by weighting them with a Multi Criteria Decision Making method; the so-called Best Worst Method is used. This research method was conducted with ten experts. Data from eight of them was consistent enough to be used for the remainder of the study. It turned out that the factors: pressure from customer(s), pressure from big player(s), and management support are the three most relevant factors. Based on quotes from the experts and the BWM results, it can be concluded that quality standards are adopted because they are a must-have for doing business. Customers and big players impose pressure on their clients to adopt quality standards. Pressure from customers describes customers that cannot be chosen, and business is done directly with these companies. Pressure from big players describes the companies that can be chosen; their influence can be denied by not doing business with them. However, their pressure will be transmitted via their customers to other companies in the value chain. The factor management support describes that the top management team makes the final decision on whether to adopt. Adoption will only happen when this group of employees agree. Thereby is it also the case that GCpuSol wants to distinguish themselves in this industry and that they are willing to work hard, structured, and orderly to accomplish goals. This led in the first place to the adoption of ISO 13485. They were among the first companies that adopted the ISO 13485. This study is one of the first to investigate the adoption of quality standards by using a list of determinants and weighing them on their importance with the BWM. Some new contributions have been made to the existing literature on standard adoption and the literature from which the factors are derived. Multiple factors from the neo-institutional theory indicates a strong relationship with the adoption of quality standards and two factors from the category, organizational characteristics, that have been derived from the TOE framework. It turns out that the factors can be minimally influenced. According to the experts, pressure from other companies can only be influenced by conversing with them. Once a customer imposes the adoption of a quality standard, one must adopt it. Denial might bring the risk of losing that customer. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The addition of ASTs resulted in increased performance in the best performing models on all languages, while also reducing the need for a pre-training task to achieve the best performance. The largest increase in performance for a Java model compared to its baseline counterpart was 3.0% on average on the test set, the largest increase in performance for a Julia model compared to its baseline counterpart was 1.1% on average on the test set, and the largest increase in performance of a CPP model compared to its baseline counterpart was 5.7% on average on the test set.","Machine learning; Machine Learning for Software Engineering; Transformer; Language modeling; Code Completion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

NOM not only negatively influences the colour, taste and smell of the water, it also decreases the effectiveness of common water treatment steps such as (membrane) filtration and UV desinfectation. A big fraction of natural organic matter is negatively charged and because of that it can be removed from water with ion exchange.<br/><br/>Suspended ion exchange is a relatively new type of ion exchange, invented and developed by drinking water company PWN in the Netherlands. The trademark aspect of this process is that ion exchange resin gets dosed directly into the influent in suspension, followed by a filtration and a regeneration step instead of fixed bed reactors. The big advantage of this way of operating is that it can operate raw surface water, it is not prone to clogging and can operate continuously. Therefore it is much easier to implement towards the beginning of the water treatment chain, allowing it to positively impact later treatment steps. <br/><br/>PHREEQC is a computer program developed to do geochemical calculations. It is designed to take into account different chemical processes happening simultaneously in complex ground or water matrices. <br/><br/>This report is about the research done to see if the removal of natural organic matter through SIX can be simulated with a modeling program such as PHREEQC. Therefore a series of jar tests and titrations have been done to determine the relevant chemical properties of four different NOM samples, the influence of pH on ion exchange and the influence of competition between different target anions.<br/><br/>The counter anion exchange equivalence of NOM has shown to be varying from around 1.8 to 8. This can explain why it is observed that the adsorption of natural organic matter is almost unaffected by the presence of competing anions such as sulfate, as this high counter anion exchange equivalence suggests that NOM sits high in the anion selectivity range. Additionally, the adsorption of NOM has been constantly high over a wide pH range. This is remarkable, especially at low pH values where titrations show that the charge of NOM decrease drastically. The release of chloride by the resin does get affected by pH a lot however, although this is minimally related to the changing charge of NOM and rather by the increasing amount of bicarbonate in the system adsorbing to the resin at neutral or high pH ranges.<br/><br/>Using the equilibrium constants calculated with results from the jar tests in PHREEQC give quite accurate results when a system of two anions is simulated. When a system with more than two anions is introduced however, the program values the equilibrium constants too much, resulting in vastly underestimating the adsorption of whichever anion has the lower selectivity in the system. <br/>NOM is currently too complex to accurately represent in a computer model compared to other, more common anions such as chloride, nitrate and sulfate. On top of that PHREEQC needs more parameters beyond exchange equilibria to properly model the exchange reactions in a model. <br","Ion Exchange; Natural organic matter; PHREEQC; Suspended ion exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The potential of these initiatives, as identified from this clean energy production, to play a key role in the energy transition is assumed to be vital as recognized by the European Commission’s Clean Energy for All package and the provision of a legislative framework for their operation in European countries. In the light of this, European policy makers assume that promoting the engagement of more citizens in such initiatives will lead to a rise in energy justice and a fairer energy transition. However, several researches show that this assumption maybe flawed as the relation between the two is not explicitly verified. Through the acknowledgement of minority groups, this research aims to investigate whether an increased citizen engagement in energy communities could lead to a rise in energy justice. For this, the research is broken down into three key steps involving: 1) investigating what factors could affect the willingness of citizens to engage in energy communities by conducting a literature review and then evaluating potential influence of the identified factors for the city of The Hague as case study area, 2) investigating the distribution of the identified factors around areas with energy communities to find out whether there are any social groups favoured by the distribution of these factors around neighbourhoods with 24 energy communities. This is done by conducting spatial data analysis to investigate whether the engagements of any particular social groups or classes of people might be favoured by the spatial locations of energy communities in specific areas of The Hague 3) finally by conducting one on one interviews with 8 board members of energy communities in The Hague, the research seeks to investigate the relation between the identified factors potentially affecting citizens' desires to engage and the three tenets of energy justice. The results show that in the city of The Hague, although a majority of neighbourhoods in which energy communities are located are characterized by a high number of minority groups, a high majority of the energy communities interviewed (7 out of 8) acknowledge that minority groups are generally less involved. However for the classes of people engaging in such initiatives, a majority seeks to raise their powers and that of other community members in the decision making process. Hence, this allows to conclude that for the case study area, energy communities might only lead to a limited rise in Energy justice due to the partial or non-acknowledgement of minority groups.","Energy Community; Energy Justice; Data analysis; Citizen Engagement; socioeconomic factors; Recognition Justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Hirvasniemi, Jukka (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Background: Advancements in the field of artificial intelligence have lead to the incorporation of automated algorithms in the analysis of medical images and data. Deep learning algorithms have been applied in muscu- loskeletal research to improve the understanding of osteoarthritis and to assist in disease detection and prognosis. The majority of the developed methods examine and process X-ray images and clinical data (age, gender etc.), with a small minority using MRI as inputs. Objective: The current master thesis project aims to investigate the influence of MRI scans on the early detection of knee osteoarthritis through the use of deep learning architectures, and to develop a semi-automatic method for knee region of interest extraction for creating the MRI input of detection algorithms. Methods: The MRI scans used in this project were acquired from the publicly available database of the Os- teoarthritis Initiative. In total 593 dual echo steady state and intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences were included. The extraction of the knee joint included several processing steps. Initially, a U-Net model was trained on 507 annotated dual echo steady state MRIs for the segmentation of bone and cartilage tissue, which was followed by the registration of the output masks to intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences in order to create the joint labels for the desired MRI scans. Final step for the region of interest construction included the search of bone coordinates and the creation of the knee joint region of interest. The detection of early osteoarthri- tis progression from knee MRI scans was tested through three different deep learning architectures, a residual network (ResNet), a densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) and a convolutional variational au- toencoder (CVAE). Furthermore, the probability output of the ResNet and DenseNet as well as the feature vector of the CVAE were coupled with clinical data (age, gender, bone mass index) and used as input to a Logistic Regression Classifier, in order to investigate the influence of osteoarthritis related features to the detection task. The U-Net segmentation method was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient and Intersection of Union while the detection algorithms using the area under the receiver’s characteristic curve (AUC) and the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) metrics, with two different input data configurations, only MRI and a combination of MRI and clinical data. Results: The U-Net algorithm for bone and cartilage segmentation showed adequate results, since Dice simi- larity coefficient and Intersection of Union reached mean values higher than 0.99 and 0.88. Regarding the early detection of knee osteoarthritis incidence, ResNet and DenseNet showed similar results, with both methods hav- ing an AUC value ranging from 0.5033 to 0.6269, when only MRI scans were examined. In the case of MRI and clinical data combination, the more complicated deep learning architecture (DenseNet) achieved the highest AUC at 0.6556. The best performing model was CVAE with the largest number of latent space features (1000) achieving an AUC of 0.6699 when combined with clinical data and an AUC of 0.6689 when used alone as input to the logistic regression classifier. All three deep learning algorithms yielded higher performance metrics when clinical data where combined with models’ outputs. Conclusion: The tested deep learning algorithms showed a potential in the challenging task of early detection of knee osteoarthritis through MRI scans, even though they did not reach the same level of performance metrics. The region-of-interest creation had promising results for the implementation of U-Net method for bone tissue labelling.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

These human interventions affect how water and sediment interact with the bed and banks of the river. The interaction between water and sediment is called morphodynamics and is an important component of the natural ecosystem of the river and its surroundings. This research aims to investigate if human interventions have disturbed the natural morphodynamics in the Karnali fluvial fan and if this can be the cause of grassland degradation in the adjacent floodplains of the Bardiya national park. To do so, the following research question is answered: What is the relation between human interventions and the morphodynamics of the Karnali fluvial fan? <br/><br/>To do so, a method is developed where a time-series analysis of the morphodynamics is performed, based on discharge and optical remote sensing data. The flow regime is investigated by computing the temporal evolution of discharge, the flow duration curve, the base flow index, and the water distribution at the bifurcation in the upstream part of the fan. Morphodynamic parameters that can be described using remote sensing data concern the planform and the land cover of the river channel-belt. The planform dynamics are described by looking at the evolution of the sinuosity and braiding, and the land cover dynamics are represented by the evolution of the river's channel, sediment bar, and grassland areas. The most important human interventions are identified, after which the relation between the morphodynamics and the human interventions is assessed. <br/><br/>No evidence was found that human interventions have significantly influenced the evolution of the morphodynamics of the Karnali fluvial fan. Only on a small scale, changes or peculiarities in morphodynamic parameters can be attributed to human interventions. In this case study, the construction of embankments reduced lateral erosion, and the Kailashpuri dam influenced upstream sedimentation and erosion processes. A shift of the main stream from the eastern to western river branch in 2009 most likely caused a change in river-floodplain interaction in the branch closest to the Bardiya national park. The quantities of sediment and water extraction were found to be negligible in comparison to the natural water and sediment fluxes.<br/><br/>This research is the first step in quantifying the morphodynamic behaviour of the Karnali fluvial fan and indicates which are the most important drivers of morphodynamic changes. Besides this contribution, the study also includes the development of a methodology that could improve remote sensing-based morphodynamics studies.<br","Morphodynamics; Human interventions; river dynamics; Optical remote sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-23","","","","Water Management","","28.638812,81.281979"

This method of vessel sealing is often preferred over traditional suturing or clipping of blood vessels because it comes with the advantages of reducing intraoperative blood loss and operation time. Most bipolar vessel sealers are disposable. The high costs of the devices often lead to unrightful reuse in LMICs, increasing the risk of postoperative infection. Next to that, many existing vessel sealing devices operate using a scissor-like clamp that exerts a larger clamping pressure at the proximal end than at the distal end of the clamp. Studies have shown that an unevenly distributed clamping pressure negatively affects the burst pressure of the seal [1][2][3]. The aim of this thesis is to redesign the conventional bipolar vessel sealer to a reusable version that exerts a uniformly distributed pressure across the clamping surface.<br/>A design goal and a set of design requirements were constructed to clarify the objectives. This was followed by a creative design process which was executed to generate solutions for the problems of disposability and uneven pressure distribution. The concept for reusability was verified by mechanical analysis of forces and by rapid prototyping. For the pressure distribution, three concepts were made and tested for performance during an experiment. A redesign of the conventional bipolar vessel sealer was made in CAD containing the innovations for reusability and the pressure distribution mechanism that performed best.<br/>A mechanism has been designed that allows the closing of the upper jaw to be actuated by forward motion of the blade. This eliminates the need for a separate jaw actuator hence promotes cleanability and reusability. The pressure distribution experiment demonstrated which mechanism performed the best. These innovations together with other design considerations have been incorporated into a CAD model of the redesigned bipolar vessel sealer.<br/>The design goal has been met successfully. All design requirements have been met except for one. The removability of the blade lacks in the redesign because it was hindered by other innovations. A list of recommendations has been made to highlight potential future opportunities and shortcomings.","medical device; vessel sealing; pressure distribution; reusable; uniform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This is mainly due to the ever-growing demand for sustainable energy sources, which involve Hydrogen and to meet the high structural and economic demands from the automobile sector and other industrial demands for which high strength steels like dual-phase steels have been developed. Steels may absorb hydrogen both throughout the production process and during different phases of use. High-strength steels (particularly dual phase steels) and martensitic stainless steels are highly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Moreover, hydrogen embrittlement is already possible at quantities as low as 0.1 ppm[1]. Therefore, understanding Metal-hydrogen interactions is essential.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to study the effect of Hydrogen charging on three different<br/>iron-based materials and the possible effect on the electrochemical/corrosion performance. The Iron-based materials used in the study are Pure Iron, DP1000 and AISI 420. The methodology involves using an electrochemical procedure based on potentiostatic Hydrogen charging and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), applied on these Iron-based materials having different phases to monitor H-uptake in the materials. The materials are charged with Hydrogen both on the active and passive surfaces. The electrochemical method is capable of measuring the diffusible H concentration (including mobile Hydrogen) for the steel alloys under H-charging conditions. Using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) Technique, microstructural analysis is carried out on Pure Iron, DP1000 and AISI 420 stainless steel to identify the different phases interacting with Hydrogen. To gain additional insights relating to the electrochemical/corrosion performance of the investigated materials and into the H-related findings, potentiostatic polarization techniques, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) are carried out.<br/><br/>As a result, it was discovered that Pure Iron had the maximum amount of diffusible Hydrogen under the charging conditions tested, followed by DP1000 and then AISI 420 Steel with the lowest amount. EIS technique was useful in identifying a trend between the barrier properties of the passive layer and the H desorption values for the three materials. The results also revealed that materials charged with Hydrogen on active and passive surfaces behaved differently with respect to the amount of Hydrogen desorption.

Due to the complexity of wind turbine systems, fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic codes are indispensable to represent the nonlinear behaviour of the system. However, nonlinear codes are known to be costly and time-consuming. In consequence, fast methods of assessing the loads on the system are required to speed up the wind turbine design process, especially in its early stages. This research comprehends a linearised version of the BHawC model and provides fast methods of evaluating wind turbine loads under turbulent inflow conditions. For wind turbines in isotropic conditions and low turbulence intensity, the model is studied as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system through the Coleman transformation, which describes the rotor degrees of freedom in the inertial frame. The dynamic response of the system is obtained through a frequency-domain procedure based on computing the system's transfer function and using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. In addition, model-order reduction (MOR) techniques are used to lower the run times of the simulations.<br/><br/>The verification of the fast model is accomplished by comparing the response of the linear model with that of the Siemens in-house aeroelastic simulation tool, BHawC. The comparison is made both in the time domain and the frequency domain through the power spectra of the time series. Results of the tower-top displacements and the tower-bottom loads are presented at three operating points. From the time-domain responses, the maximum root-mean-square error of the tower-base loads related to the fore-aft and the vertical motion of the turbine is around 10%. Besides, the tower-base lateral force and moment present large discrepancies of around 20% with respect to BHawC. The fatigue side-side moment is greatly overpredicted, whereas the differences for the other load channels are less than 20%.<br/><br/>For isotropic conditions and high turbulence intensity, the dependency on the variations in the controller is considered by modelling the system as a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system. In this case, a discrete-time approach is used together with model-order reduction techniques to reduce the computational requirements in terms of memory and run time. The methodology requires knowledge of the state at the steady-state equilibrium. Nevertheless, the linearised BHawC model describes the rotational degrees of freedom differently to the linearised model. Therefore, the implemented methodology is instead used in an analytical wind turbine model. There, the LPV system is able to capture the variability in the system while greatly reducing the computational expense of the simulations.","linear model; BHawC/OrcaFlex; linear time-invariant; Coleman transformation; linear parameter-varying; model order reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The working principle of the IPT technology is based on two coils separated by an air gap and magnetically coupled together; since the medium to transfer the energy is the air between the coils, the magnetic circuit of this system becomes remarkably important, as the magnetic flux need to be constrained as much as possible for the sake of securing the magnetic linkage between the coils. In this thesis, the design process of the casing of the coils is presented, such casing will ensure that the coils are always kept fixed according to their design.<br/><br/>From this point, the first goal of this thesis arises: Design an accurate and modular casing for the coils of a 50 kW IPT system that will fix such elements in the correct position, and which will allow for easy<br/>changes/upgrades in the coil if required. The design process of such casing was to first do the CAD model of the coils, and then do the CAD model of the casing, by considering the following criteria: accurate dimensions, easy and fast to manufacture and assemble, modular-designed, light, adequately cooled, and robust. The result of such design was a casing that was actually manufactured and assembled, and that is currently being used to test a 50 kW IPT prototype system.<br/><br/>Besides procuring an efficient coil design for the IPT systems, it’s important to understand the dynamic behavior of the IPT electric system. One of the elements that could potentially influence the electric behavior of such system is known as parasitic capacitance. From here, the second objective of this thesis arises: Derive the parasitic capacitance of the coils in order to perform a better circuit modeling and to predict a possible over-voltage across such capacitance.<br/><br/>The methodology to derive the parasitic capacitance of the coils was first to perform an electromagnetic fields FEM simulation on the coils in order to obtain a set of parameters such as the coils impedance, resonance frequency and inductance. With these parameters and a set of equations, it was possible then to derive the parasitic capacitance of each coil. Finally, with this information, it was possible to build a (virtual) equivalent circuit of the IPT system and evaluate the voltage across the parasitic capacitance. It was concluded from this thesis that the parasitic capacitance at the standard operating frequency (85 kHz) does not represent a risk of over-voltage, but as the frequency goes close to the resonance frequency (1.46 MHz), the electric field across the capacitor could reach values up to 14 kV/mm.","IPT; Wireless Charging; inductive power transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the dynamic nature of the cable loading, the cables are prone to fatigue failure. Since the evaluation of the fatigue life of complex structures, like power cables, has to deal with a certain degree of uncertainty, fatigue safety factors are introduced. These factors ensure a desired probability of failure based on the degree of uncertainty present in the modeling of the fatigue life. Limited experience in the evaluation of the fatigue life of dynamic power cables is found in the literature, and no sources have been found attempting to calibrate the prescribed fatigue safety factor. Currently, a fatigue safety factor of 10 is advised. This implies that there is much room for reduction in the uncertainties, meaning that there is a potential for making the cables cheaper and more reliable, which will in turn make floating wind energy more competitive with other (renewable) energy sources.<br/>Due to the lack of available literature, comparisons with umbilicals and flexible risers are made. Different methods for the evaluation of fatigue safety factors for flexible risers are evaluated, and judged on how applicable they are to use on dynamic power cables. It is found that a reliability based approach is most suitable for this purpose.<br/>A case study is carried out for a presently relevant scenario to put the proposed method into practice. It is concluded that for a safety class corresponding to a required maximum probability of failure of 10<sup>-3</sup> in the last operational year, a fatigue safety factor of 3.5 is needed. This safety factor is required for the wave-load induced fatigue, as opposed to the seabed induced fatigue, to which the dynamic power cable is less vulnerable nearby the touch-down zone. <br/>The main parameter driving the uncertainty in the fatigue analysis is the sensitivity of the local stress analysis, which is in line with what has been found for similar studies for the oil &amp; gas industry. In order to bring down the cost of dynamic power cables, and make them more reliable, more accurate local stress analysis models need to be developed, being validated against test data, in order to reduce the standard deviation of the local stress computation.","Floating Wind Turbines; Dynamic power cables; Fatigue; safety factor; Reliability; femap; OrcaFlex","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Lead time refers to the time that elapses between placing and receiving an order. The construction company Janssen de Jong recognizes the problem of sub-components’ long lead times in precast concrete house-building. Sub-components are those products being integrated into the precast concrete components and they are supplied to the precasting concrete factory by various suppliers. The company seeks to optimize sub-components’ lead times, so as to increase its competitiveness. Accordingly, the current research focuses on identifying the sources of sub-components’ long lead times in precast house-building industry and optimizing them, in order to improve projects’ performance in terms of time and costs. The research draws on literature review, interviews, mathematical optimization modelling and case study.<br/><br/>Literature review and interviews with Janssen de Jong, a precasting concrete factory, a windows and frames supplier and an installation technology supplier revealed the large batch size of batch-and-queue manufacturing method, as the main quantifiable source of long manufacturing time, affecting significantly the delivery of sub-components and so, extending their lead time. Batch-and-queue utilizes the equipment to its maximum capacity, yet leads to stock creation at each production step. On the contrary, one-piece-flow manufacturing method (batch size of one), was indicated as a value-adding process worth to approach, yet not easily achievable, not so efficient and more expensive. One-piece-flow refers to moving the product step-by-step through each process step without non-value-added time. The conflicting interests of the suppliers and Janssen de Jong call for solutions that could satisfy both time- and cost-related interests.<br/><br/>The mathematical optimization model was built based on the identified conflicting relation between reducing costs and shortening lead times, in relation to the batch size. This was done considering the arguments in favor of and against both manufacturing methods. In this way, the bias is reduced. Weights are assigned to each of the objectives, denoting their relative importance to the client. A set of optimal lead times and costs is obtained, after running the model for each supplier separately, enabling Janssen de Jong to improve the project performance as per the priorities each time. <br/><br/>A project of 23 precast concrete houses was utilized as a case study for the model validation. Out of the involved suppliers, only the windows and frames supplier made some data accessible. This supplier already follows one-piece-flow. Access to financial data was restricted, so, a supplementary Greek company, which is active in the same field and it is highly representative of the case, was utilized. The developed model yields reasonable results compared to the real figures.<br/><br/>Concluding, the model proves to be effective in optimizing sub-components’ lead time in precast concrete house-building industry. However, it is recommended the model to be validated using companies from other fields (e.g. installation technology company) and incorporate further information in a future version –complex to include this in the current thesis– to achieve even higher levels of realism and applicability. <br","Lead time optimization; Precast concrete; Sub-components; House-building industry; Non-value-added time","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PJDKQysb-f-QsLG1NDwogW8awlAvUIXg?usp=sharing Repository link By following this link, the executable file with the developed graphical user interface can be accessed.","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

When payload is retrieved from the splash zone to the deck, besides the crane block, no additional control can be applied on the underactuated system. Existing studies either assume more control over the payload or develop a control system based on a new crane. To reduce payload motion on current crane vessels, a conceptual model needs to be developed. <br/><br/>In this thesis, various state-of-the-art solutions are considered based on four criteria: Time reduction, motion reduction, initial investment required and power required. Eventually, the quantified criteria and an analytic hierarchy process established that the most promising concept is based on an automated side loader of a garbage truck. <br/><br/>The selected concept is developed based on a design process that focuses on optimized material usage. The geometry is determined according to requirements and forms the starting point of the circular design process. A dynamic analysis is conducted to obtain the dynamic response of the payload and eventually the reduced payload motion. The design cycle is complete after a finite element analysis has been conducted to verify the structural integrity of the model. After more than 20 cycles of the design process, the conceptual model is optimized and over 85% of motion is reduced in the X direction. The payload motion in Y- and Z-direction is 20% and 29% respectively. <br/><br/>The simulation results in this study show that the conceptual model is able to reduce the payload motion during offshore lifting operations whilst staying within the limits set by offshore standards. The motion reduction of the payload creates a safer and more efficient environment to execute offshore lifting operations.","Offshore lifting operations; Conceptual development; motion reduction; Dynamic analysis; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-09","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Congested distribution and transmission grids in the Netherlands and Germany highlights the importance of providing system flexibility. Residential, commercial and industrial consumers can install their own renewable energy sources + energy storage to maximize self-consumption of renewable energy, to reduce electricity bills, reduce demand charges, to provide backup power and to provide grid balancing services. However, the deployment of behind-the-meter storage systems comes with major barriers, which are the main focus of this study. The research consists of a literature study, an analysis of behind-the-meter storage systems in the Netherlands and Germany and 10 expert interviews. Moreover, the Y-factor method, a method that allows to easily visualize, in once, which barriers are affecting what technologies, is used to score the identified barriers on stationary battery systems and electric vehicles enabled to bi-directional charge. The main conclusion is that 13 factors hamper the deployment of behind-the-meter storage systems, categorized in cost &amp; financing barriers, technical barriers, market &amp; regulatory barriers, multi-stakeholder complexity and behavioral barriers. Moreover, all combinations of technologies, sectors and countries face significant barriers for the deployment of these storage technologies. There can be concluded that cost &amp; financing barriers play a major role for the deployment of residential stationary battery systems in the Netherlands as well as a lack of signals for self-consumption. Additionally, required investment costs and resource constraints play a significant barrier for commercial and industrial consumers in Germany. Moreover, the barriers: technology uncertainty, lack of communication protocols, dependency on other actors and a lack of a clear regulatory framework hamper the deployment of V2G technology significantly in both sectors in Germany.","Behind-the-meter storage; Barriers; Stationary batteries; V2G","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Ride-Sharing services are believed to be offering a crucial technological and perception shifts to reducing emission.

This model learns to predict proton dose distributions by being trained with Monte Carlo generated data. Monte Carlo is the golden standard of proton dose calculation because it is very accurate, but it has relatively long computation times. In current proton therapy treatment programmes, Monte Carlo algorithms are the most commonly used models to perform dose calculation. The goal of the DoTA model is to predict proton dose distributions with Monte Carlo accuracy in the fraction of the computation time of Monte Carlo algorithms to speed up the dose calculation process in proton therapy treatment. The DoTA model can take patient geometry, random proton beam energy and random proton beam shape (2D Gaussian with different major and minor axes) as input. The addition of the random proton beam shape input is discussed in this report, together with a detailed explanation of the DoTA model. The DoTA model is trained with data from 9 lung cancer patients and 9 head &amp; neck cancer patients. Being used on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU, the DoTA model managed to produce results with a gamma pass rate of 98.45 ± 2.60 % with an average computation time of 0.3 seconds. The gamma pass rate determines how similar the DoTA predicted dose is to the reference (Monte Carlo generated) dose. Compared to the average computation time of the Monte Carlo algorithm that was used to generate the training data, which is 20 seconds on the same CPU, we can conclude that the DoTA model has the potential to greatly improve dose calculation times in proton therapy treatment, especially when used on a system with greater processing power. Because the DoTA model is able to deliver accurate results in a small amount of time, it has the potential to be used for real-time dose calculation. Real-time dose calculation could account for small changes in patient geometry during treatment, which increases the accuracy of the treatment and minimizes side effects. The DoTA model can also be used for other radiotherapy types like phonon therapy and electron therapy (in that case it needs to be trained with<br/>different data).","Proton therapy; Dose Calculation; Machine learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

As part of new mitigation strategies, the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) emerged after the compliance markets materialized. Via the voluntary carbon market companies can offset their carbon emissions. The captured carbon is transformed into ’carbon credits’ representing one tonne of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions captured or reduced. One of the leading quality and integrity concerns is the potential double counting of credits. In a nutshell, the voluntary carbon market is based on voluntary carbon offset projects, compliance schemes require governments to report their national mitigation activities in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)s, and the private sector needs to report on their environment, governance, and sustainability responsibilities. Double counting occurs among these three activities when captured carbon is allocated to more than one actor. This thesis consists of an exploratory, single case study based on the blockchain solution of Acorn Rabobank. Acorn is both a project developer of carbon credits and the enabler of its own digital marketplace. The data for the case study is comprised of in-house research provided by Acorn, interview transcripts, reports, and news articles. This data is used to answer the research question: “What framework can be developed to evaluate the benefits and limitations of blockchain-based platforms to prevent double counting in the voluntary carbon market?<br/><br/>To answer this research question several research activities were performed. The research activities consisted of selecting and defining the case, data collection, data interpretation, and theory building. Three forms of double counting were established. To further enrich the knowledge base the stakeholder dimension was mapped based on secondary sources and empirical knowledge gained through preliminary interviews. Several mapping techniques were employed to map the interrelations between the market mechanisms and double counting. <br/><br/>The MLGBE framework allows carbon market actors to evaluate and, if applicable, reason about the various available blockchain-based infrastructures as tokenizing carbon credits and the digitized trading of these credits. By doing so, they can identify the stakeholder dynamics with all policies, interrelated treaties, and community plans in place, to develop or evaluate sustainable blockchain-based platforms tailored to the market to prevent double counting.<br/><br/>Scientifically, new theory was built through the development of the MLGBE framework. By integrating multi-level governance theory and business &amp; governance information to the particularities of asset tokenization in blockchain applications, a new approach to evaluate blockchain designs is presented. Secondly, the research delineates the issue of double counting in the voluntary carbon market, Lastly, the research corroborates earlier findings in the logistics domain of the importance of reliability of data elements of blockchain-based applications used for audit trails.<br/><br/>Concerning double counting further research is recommended on the potential of blockchain solutions to link schemes together to facilitate a global carbon market, how these link to the eventual implementation of Article 6, and the potential nesting within countries’ NDCs. For<br/>the MLGBE framework, future research should look into the interaction between the standardization/fragmentation dependent on policy layers and the different rights in the governance<br/>requirements.<br","Voluntary Carbon Market; Double Counting; Blockchain; Blockchain Technology; Evaluation Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

With the use of real-world roads extracted from Google Maps combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm, we develop a new way to generate roads for testing self-driving cars. We evaluate this algorithm against a state-of-the-art multi-objective genetic algorithm using randomly generated roads using two different setups. Our results show that REWOSA is able to generate more failures than the baseline on both the setups, as well as create more complex roads. In return, REWOSA does create a large overhead due to the complexity of the real-world roads.

While there is an increasing need for higher resolution and increased target detection and DoA estimation performance, such improvements often require increased hardware cost, complexity and size. With the increase in computational power of modern systems, Compressive Sensing methods have become more attractive as alternative methods for DoA estimation to the established ones, which often rely on uniform linear arrays (ULA) and the acquisition of multiple snapshots to provide good performance. Compressive Sensing methods have been shown to fit very well into the DoA estimation framework and have the ability to use far fewer snapshots, provide super resolution capabilities and by nature, utilise sparse spatial sampling, i.e. sparse antenna arrays. The latter point is the key incentive of this thesis.<br/><br/>Specifically, Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS) which in addition to point estimates also provides measures of uncertainty is used in this thesis, to generate and use sparse<br/>linear array structures for DoA estimation. In particular, the entropy of the recovered coefficient vector is reduced in each step. Two array generation algorithms are proposed<br/>building on the same concept to generate sensor arrays for the consideration of a uniformly spaced, linear grid of possible sensor locations and for a Multiple In Multiple Out<br/>(MIMO) array setup. Utilising sparse arrays with BCS has the potential to reduce the hardware complexity of the circuit board, reduce energy consumption and heat generation, as well as ultimately saving costs in production and operation.<br/><br/>The proposed array generation algorithms are first tested and assessed with simulated Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Waveform (FMCW) radar data, where it is shown that<br/>the generated algorithms achieve good estimation and detection performance with a heavily reduced number of sensors compared to their fully filled template arrays. Moreover, they are shown to outperform randomly generated arrays in most cases that have been studied. To add practical insight, the generated antenna arrays are tested with measured data that has been captured in two measurement campaigns with a Texas Instruments Cascade Evaluation board, featuring an 86 element virtual ULA, which has been used as the grid of possible sensor positions for the array generations. The simulated results are affirmed by the measured data, although more sensors tend to be required depending on the clutter present in the scene. It is shown, that BCS can work very well with the proposed, heavily sparse arrays tested on both simulated and measured data, which translates directly to a possible reduction in required hardware antennas. Although in this thesis the possible sensor positions have been confined to a grid of positions spaced by half the wavelength, it is easily possible to extend the procedure to a more finely divided search space.","Direction of Arrival Estimation; Bayesian Compressive Sensing; MIMO radar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

The design of a new bridge deck using fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bridge decks raises questions on the connection of a FRP bridge deck to a steel superstructure. At the Tu Delft a bolted connector injected with steel reinforced resin (iSRR) is developed for the connections between steel superstructure and FRP bridge deck. Steel reinforce resin (SRR) is a combination of steel shot (SS) and resin. The steel shot is added to achieve higher stiffness and reduce the total production cost. The iSRR connection can be produced using multiple methods. For all production methods, the SRR in the connector is produced by pouring SS around the bolt followed by the injection of the resin. The iSRR connector should accompany the fatigue resistance of the FRP bridge deck. A better understanding of crack propagation can help to increase the life expectancy of iSRR connections. However, no standardized method for the testing of crack propagation in SRR exists. This research attempts to find a crack propagation testing method for SRR by investigating the use of compact tension (CT) and semi-circle bending (SCB) testing for the SRR material. For the production 5 different casting methods were compared. From these methods, the closed mould injection casting and ring mould injection casting showed the most promising production method for the production of complicated forms in SRR. From this testing the need to use modified forms of CT and SCB was found, resulting in the use of a doubly tapered compact tension specimen (2TCT) and the design of the short tapered notched beam specimen (STNB). The modified specimen forms are tested under varying loading types. The 2TCT specimen is tested under load controlled, and displacement controlled loading. From this, the incremental increasing loading type was suggested. This loading type was used in the testing of STNB specimens. Lastly with the use of FEA the stress intensity factors for the modified test forms were validated. The validation was done on the analytical formulas provided by literature for the unmodified forms. From this research, it can be concluded that the closed mould injection casting and ring mould injection both achieve good results for the production of complicated shapes with SRR. The incremental increasing displacement loading method leads to more stable crack growth. The 3 point bending testing type leads to the most promising results for crack propagation. With a linear correlation in the small range of K = 20-60 resulting in a Paris Law with &#x1d436; = 4.3&#x1d452; − 7 and &#x1d45a; = 2.41. It is recommended for further crack propagation testing to produce specimens with the least amount of voids. The voids are expected to have a high contribution to the big spread of data found during the testing. For better insight, the voids in the tested specimens could also be investigated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Several treatments are available to lower risks of sudden cardiac deaths. Atrial fibrillation is one of the leading causes for sudden cardiac deaths. Atrial fibrillation can be treated with drugs or with procedures or surgeries. Catheter ablation is one of these procedures. With the use of radiofrequency, the area in the heart causing the disrupting of the signal pathway and therefore causing the atrial fibrillation can be restored. When performing the ablation, the force on the heart tissue and insert angle of the catheter tip can influence the results of the catheter ablation. In this paper we investigate whether the impedance readout can be used to determine the force and the angle the multielectrode catheter tip is exerted on a phantom tissue. Methods To research the impedance readout with respect to the insert angle and force an experimental setup was designed. The electrodes of a catheter were connected to a HP impedance analyzer (HP 4192A). This catheter was guided through a 3D print with hollow tubes (90, 60, 45 and 30 degrees) to achieve the desired insert angle on a phantom. The 3D print is mounted to a linear stage to control the movement of the catheter with millimeter precision movement. The catheter was pressed onto a phantom. Cardiac phantoms were made with the base material Gellan Gum, Agar and PVA. The phantom was put in a container with a skinpatch counter electrode attached to it to be able to measure the impedance change. Below the container a scale is placed to readout the force that is being exerted on the phantom. Results Samples with base materials as Gellan Gum, Agar and PVA were made and the catheter was being exerted on it with various insert angles. Impedance change with increasing force and varying insert angles were recorded and graphs were taken out of the data that is being recorded with the use of Excel. The data has been taken from fresh made samples, 1 week old samples and 2 weeks old samples. From the graphs the relative impedance increase decreases when the insert angle is reduced from 90 to 30 degrees. Conclusion Impedance can be used to determine how much pressure is being exerted on a heart tissue. However, the catheter that approaches the heart tissue will have different insert angles. The impedance change is dependent on the various insert angles. Therefore it is not sure if this impedance change method can be used to determine the force that is being exerted on the heart tissue in a reliable way when the catheter tip angle is unknown.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

Due to its activated carbon (AC) content, the material could be used to remove pollutants such as organic micropollutants (OMP). Fast AC bed exhaustion makes adsorption a cost-intensive solution. Regeneration of AC is done off-site and requires transport and high energy consumption for heat treatment. Due to the iron and graphite content of the novel adsorbent, catalytic regeneration could allow for in-situ regeneration. This property would present a major advantage over common AC. Regeneration could potentially be realized by applying an electric current across an exhausted bed of this adsorbent. Such a setup is called a “particle electrode”, where electrically conductive particles are placed between an anode and cathode. Upon application of an electric current across an exhausted bed of adsorbent, two mechanisms are hypothesized to result in the restoration of adsorption capacity: (1) desorption and (2) degradation of the pollutant. This study evaluated the adsorption capacity and rate constants for 17 OMP on two different versions of this partly graphitized carbon (with and without iron content) as an alternative to conventional AC for drinking water treatment. By batch adsorption experiments, the adsorption properties of this novel carbon were investigated. Oxidation of zero-valent iron on the iron containing version of carbon resulted in yellowish water. This version was therefore considered not appropriate for general drinking water treatment, and the remaining experiments were conducted only with the version without iron. The material adsorbed a great variety of OMP, including different charges and hydrophobicity. Its graphite content probably promoted the adsorption of neutral compounds. A negatively charged layer formed by NOM accumulation on adsorbent surfaces assisted positively charged compounds adsorption. Investigation of regeneration efficiency was conducted with alternative cycles of adsorption and regeneration with high OMP concentration solutions. This material could be electrochemically regenerated. Reverse adsorption could be achieved on neutral, positively and negatively charged compounds in multiple cycles of regeneration. Electrodesorption is probably the major mechanism responsible for regeneration. Permanent and partial loss of adsorption capacity was recorded, probably due to poor NOM desorption and change in surface chemistry. Regeneration efficiency was not positively correlated with elevating applied current. Increasing cell voltage is not always beneficial to the electrochemical process. Prolonged treatment time improved the regeneration efficiency, but the marginal benefit was considered to be uneconomical. Poor NOM regeneration was responsible and more concerning for the loss of adsorption capacity. Long-chain PFAS regeneration was achieved over cycles of regeneration. Short-chain PFAS regeneration was unfavorable due to blockage of micropores.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-19","","","","Water Management","",""

This is particularly determined by the cognitive side of empathy. In addition, this study shows that sufficient effective communication is necessary for solid project outcomes. Communication seems to serve as a prerequisite for a successful integrated design process. No demonstrable effect was found in the direct relationship of empathy and the outcome of the integrated design process. The line of empathy through communication is not reflected in the direct results. Additionally, this says that influences of empathy on the game results through other processes than communication cannot be demonstrated. However, this study cannot rule out that there was no positive effect of empathy on the outcomes of the integrated design process. Further research with larger datasets needs to conclude what the proportion is of other confounding variables being dominant in game success and how empathy relates to them. All in all, this research has taken first important steps toward recognizing the value of empathy in construction projects and it provides much reason for follow-up research into this topic.","Empathy; Communication; integrated design; Construction Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Emerging digital technologies, such as information and automation, have recently made it feasible for even more types of retail business to exist. One of the key strategic themes for retail businesses in Europe, and indeed the entire world, is the digital transformation of the supply chain. However, many retail representatives have only a vague idea of the exact steps that need to be taken in the digital arena. The retail supply chain does not seem to know how to measure the actual level of its digitalisation, and it is not clear whether the current digital development of the supply chain is on a good track, thus lacking guidelines for further strategy development and investment. Previous studies have shown that Maturity Model (MM) helps enable retail companies assess their level of digitization. On the one hand, MM can help companies assess the gap between themselves and competitive benchmarks. On the other hand, it can help managers to have a more comprehensive and scientific understanding of the current digital performance of their companies. MM is a great tool for both comparison with competitors and internal optimization of companies. All in all, using MM not only helps to position an existing relationship on the maturity scale but also helps to identify areas where improvement is needed to achieve a higher maturity.","Retail supply chian; Maturity model; Digitalization; Model design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

There are different methods that girls in rural areas use to manage their menstruation such as cloths or pads. This project focuses on menstrual pads as they are hygienic, absorbent, and comfortable. Therefore, pads enable girls to have a better experience during their period. Girls who live in rural areas of Uganda are the main users this project focuses on. Older women in rural areas are considered as the target consumers who purchase the pads.<br/>Currently, the women who live in rural areas of Uganda only have access to the commercial expensive pad brands. Therefore there is a need of affordable menstrual pads to be accessible in the villages. MakaPads produces affordable menstrual pads. However some years ago they lost their biggest client who was doing the distribution of the product and they were left to rethink their distribution strategy. Presently, MakaPads wants to change their strategy from B2B to B2C and therefore, distribute the pads directly to the end consumer in the rural areas of Uganda.<br/>Thus, the goal of the project is to design a launch strategy for MakaPads to increase the availability and accessibility of menstrual pads for women and girls in rural areas of Uganda. The project was scoped using the framework of the four A’s of marketing: Acceptability, Awareness, Availability and Affordability. Acceptability and Affordability were left out of the scope. Awareness and Availability were subdivided after desk research and context interviews were conducted. Awareness subdivisions were MHM communication and product communication, and Availability was subdivided into information distribution and product distribution.<br/>Interviews were conducted in Uganda and a workshop was performed with the MakaPads team to decide on the direction of the project. The project findings brought key partnerships with opinion leaders in the villages and added crucial consumer groups for the company. By adding these two stakeholders, MakaPads can increase their reach in the villages using less resources. The strategy created is designed for MakaPads to establish in new markets and replicate in rural villages of Uganda.

However, current SFaaS systems cannot provide performant transactions across operators with strong semantics. In this thesis, we present three conceptual transaction protocols for SFaaS dataflow systems based on Two-phase Commit (2PC), Deterministic Databases and Conflict-free Replicated Datatype (CRDT)s. Based on these insights, we implement Rhea, a deterministic transaction protocol in the prototype SFaaS execution engine, Universalis. Two optimizations are implemented for Rhea: deterministic reordering and a fallback mechanism, to reduce aborts caused by Read-after-write (RAW) and Write-after-write (WAW) dependencies, respectively. We present a transaction benchmarking client for Universalis that supports workloads from the Transaction Processing Performance Council Benchmark C (TPC-C) and the Yahoo!

(graduation committee); de Brauw, Maurits (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Hand suturing is one of the most challenging tasks in laparoscopic surgery and requires high cognitive effort from the performing surgeon. Nevertheless, it is also one of the basic skills of minimally invasive surgery and it is a critical skill due to its high requirements and broad application. <br/><br/>During gastric bypass surgery, there are multiple moments of hand suturing which makes the procedure physically and cognitively challenging. This research focuses on possible alternatives for internal tissue closure to reduce the frequency of hand suturing. The main objective of the research was to develop a method which reduces cognitive effort and procedure time while enhancing comfort for the surgeon. <br/><br/>To get insights into the current procedure of hand suturing, it was analysed on the example of anastomosis closure. Observations of gastric bypass surgeries gave the required information to generate a detailed workflow which identified hand suturing as a key difficulty during the process. The analysis results gave a starting point for the ideation of a new closure method. Additionally, requirements for the closure method were formulated and taken into account during the development. <br/> <br/>Multiple concepts like differently shaped clips, hooks and staples were created and prototypes were built. Materials like metal wire staples and 3D printed prototypes were used and tested on foam, silicon and rubber. Through tests and interviews with healthcare professionals, one concept could be chosen and further detailed. <br/><br/>The newly developed method combines the advantages of both hand suturing and the commonly used stapling technique. The staples are attached in an alternating way on the edge of the tissues, while a suture is pre-threaded through the staples. When pulling the suture, the two sides approximate each other. The advantage of this method is that the tissue does not need to be positioned before the application which makes the procedure less challenging for surgeons. <br/><br/>A real scale prototype of the method was build to test manufacturability and proof of principle. Further optimization was done with Finite Element analysis and co-creation sessions with medical doctors. The evaluation of the concept was done in close collaboration with multiple bariatric surgeons, by conducting interviews and hosting discussion sessions. <br/><br/>The result of the evaluation showed that some of the safety requirements on anastomosis closure cannot be met with the newly developed concept. More suitable alternatives like the closure of mesenteric windows was investigated. Mesentery defects occur e.g. due to anatomic changes during gastric bypass surgery. If left untreated they may lead to internal hernia and small bowel obstruction. The newly developed method has the potential to close mesenteric windows time efficiently while enhancing the surgeon’s comfort. Risk assessment and further interviews showed that this application is safer and more accepted by surgeons which makes it a promising solution for hernia repair. <br","laparoscopy; hand suturing; mesenteric defect; anastomosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

Furthermore, floating offshore wind turbines enable the capture of wind resources in deeper waters. This has created the possibility of locating wind farms far offshore. This study looks into the technological and economic feasibility of in-turbine hydrogen production, storage, and transport via vessels from far offshore floating wind farms. Transport of hydrogen via pipelines and transport of hydrogen via a large vessel connected to the entire wind farm are also studied for comparison and bench marking purposes. To investigate the performance of various transport methods, a wind farm model is built that includes the components required for hydrogen production at the wind turbine as well as the components required for hydrogen transport. The model simulates wind farm operation, vessel operations with regard to onsite storage, and vessel operations when connected to the entire wind farm. Based on the levelized cost of hydrogen(LCOH), the performance of the three different farms has been compared. The study was conducted over distances ranging from 100 to 700 km. Throughout the range of distances studied, on-site hydrogen storage and periodic removal via vessel proves to be the least cost effective solution. Weather conditions are seen to be a significant factor in the operation of the vessel fleet servicing the farm with on-site storage. When combined with a four-vessel fleet servicing the entire wind farm, the optimum storage size in the farm type with onsite storage is found to be equal to the wind turbine average weekly production. A key distinction is seen in the cost trends, a steady increase is seen in hydrogen transport via pipelines with increase in distance, while, the LCOH of hydrogen remains nearly identical for the transport of hydrogen via vessels over the range of distances studied. The farm produces the most hydrogen with pipeline transport of hydrogen followed by transport of hydrogen via a large vessel, and the least hydrogen with in platform hydrogen storage and periodic emptying of the storage by vessels. The study indicates that the pipeline transport of hydrogen is the most cost effective transport option.","Hydrogen; Wind farms; Offshore renewables","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This has resulted in the requirement of power electronic converters such as DC/AC converters. For different operating conditions of the DC/AC converter it is not recommended for the converter to operate in open loop. Hence, while designing the control for the converter there are challenges such as the presence of unbalance on the grid leading to higher losses, offsetting of AC voltages at the output and grounding of the converter leading to higher common mode voltage and currents. This thesis explores the control strategy that can be implemented on the converter to mitigate the unbalance in different operating conditions and compares different modulation techniques to reduce the common mode voltage and currents.<br/>To begin with the islanded operation is considered for the converter and the voltage control is implemented on this type of converter. Further a modification on this type of control is proposed for the operation of converter under overcurrent scenario. Subsequently the control strategy for grid connected operation is analyzed such that the issue of unbalanced currents on the grid is mitigated. Three different operating modes are considered under grid connected operation for validating the control strategy proposed. Following the controlled operation in islanded and grid connected scenario, the active methods for reducing the common mode voltage are reviewed by comparing different modulation techniques. <br/>On the discussed control strategies for different operating conditions of the DC/AC converters, an optimized implementation of the control on the microcontroller is presented. Other functionalities such as protection of the converter against unwanted actions is investigated through implementation of state machine. The results of the controlled DC/AC converter operating in islanded operation is presented and modifications in the existing PCB are discussed to make it compatible to operate under grid connected condition. The operation of control strategies implemented is validated for the real time application of the converter with unbalanced load conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Moreover, in order to ensure adequate protection, full spatial coverage is a must for every such system. However, the research literature focuses on staring radars that have a limited field of view, but which yield rich target information via time-frequency distributions that facilitate the target recognition task. In this thesis, surveillance radars that offer full spatial coverage are presented, albeit their usage for classification is made more complex because of the rotating nature of their antennas which limits the dwell time on targets.<br/><br/>Additionally, due to the incredible fast growth of the drone market, novel counter-drone radars that are able to jointly localize and classify small targets while on-the-move now represent a highly in-demand remote sensing system. Nonetheless, surveillance sensors anchored on moving vehicles are a brand-new technology that is currently being developed. This work therefore investigates surveillance systems in a novel scenario, and presents the technological challenges alongside the proposed solutions to achieve reliable object detection via grounded counter-drone radars on-the-move. Specifically, the required pre-processing steps to remove the clutter from the data while the radar is rotating and moving on the ground are developed and discussed.<br/><br/>In the end, the joint detection and classification problem is traditionally solved separately by different algorithms due to the computational complexity of the task.

This means that it is important to keep evolving as a company and to find the whitespace to grow. The brand centered in this research is TBWA\NEBOKO, a big advertising agency located in Amsterdam. Their job revolves around finding this whitespace for other brands and creating advertising campaigns to initiate this growth. This is done by Disruption, where the strategists hunt for conventions and construct a vision, to eventually create a Disruptive idea for the brand. <br/><br/>To stay at the top of the list of advertising agencies, TBWA needs to keep innovating and start implementing change, to find their own whitespace. TBWA\Worldwide initiated this change, by shifting its focus from traditional media campaigns to disruptive experiences and focusing more on where to find growth in business. This requires a new methodology to be implemented within the organization. However, the new methodology, Disruption X, is not adopted by the Dutch TBWA\NEBOKO. <br/><br/>This project aims to implement Disruption X into the organization by creating a solution that will enhance and connect the three components of the TBWA\NEBOKO intangible asset: human capital, information capital and organizational capital. The strategists, Disruption X and the TBWA\NEBOKO culture respectively. By using the context mapping approach, this research uncovers why the implementation of Disruption X has been unsuccessful up until now. The research focused on the strategists from the Dutch teams and included a couple of people from the account teams to gain a broader perspective. With the use of sensitizing booklets and by conducting interviews useful data was gathered. The analysis of this data revealed that Disruption X was not actively used and not all employees were aware of its existence. Most data pointed back at the teaching method and appearance of Disruption X. People have to watch hours of difficult online lectures on their own initiative to educate themselves while they do not have time for this. Besides this, Disruption X appeared to be enormous, too difficult, lacking purpose and thus frightening, making the entry to the method too complicated. <br/><br/>The AIDA funnel is used to cluster all the relevant data conclusions and pinpoints how Disruption X needs to be enhanced for adoption within the strategy department of TBWA\NEBOKO. Narrowing the scope of the project leads to a focus on the Desire and Action phase of the AIDA funnel. A simplified presentation and clarifying its purpose need to generate Desire to use Disruption X. Delivering this tool in the “right” way will get the strategists in the Action phase. <br/><br/>An iterative design phase, where the concept is constantly validated by the strategists, results in the final product. The Disruption X Compass functions as a platform that invites, guides, assists, shows and inspires the strategists with Disruption X. The platform helps strengthen the intangible asset of TBWA\NEBOKO by enhancing: the culture through the celebration of achievements; the strategist by learning new working methods and Disruption X by delivering the method in a comprehensible way that incorporates all necessary information and data in one platform. <br/><br/>Since the platform solves only a small part of the whole challenge, the final part of this research will present an implementation plan. The plan initiates and suggests several activities for the successful adoption of Disruption X, including the finalization of the platform, the launch of the platform and how to track and improve the platform. Combining the Disruption X with the implementation plan will hopefully serve as a stepping stone to reaching the TBWA ambition.<br","Intangible asset; Disruption; Implementation strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The sub-models are the mean, linear and expectation-maximisation (EM) model. The linear model gives the most accurate expectations, whereas the mean model scores the lowest. Therefore, we have improved the mean model's estimations by creating a new estimator. Furthermore, we have investigated if an out-of-stock (OOS) period influences the sales and, therefore, the direct demand estimations. From this investigation, we conclude that for a part of the products, the sales are affected by OOS periods. However, these results are dependent on how they are investigated. Moreover, the OOS periods' influences are as likely to be positive as negative on the sales.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Bicycle disc brake noise and vibration, which usually falls in the frequency range of 0-2 kHz, is a principal braking quality attribute that has started to attract significant interest from bicycle manufacturers. Brake noise is an irritant to their customers, who see it as a symptom of a defective brake and that leads to unnecessary warranty claims. <br/><br/>Over the years various theories (e.g. stick-slip, sprag-slip, modal coupling) have been developed that explain the noise and vibration generation mechanism in the frictional brakes. Traditionally, research groups working on this issue have conducted their investigations by combining analytical and experimental studies. Likewise, this report aims to predict the brake noise using finite element analysis where the experimental data validates the finite element model. <br/><br/>In order to reproduce the brake noise in the laboratory setting, the brake test machine at the Koninklijke Gazelle laboratory was used. This novel test bench made it possible to run the experiments on the actual bike by providing features to control the bike speed, brake pressure, and weather conditions within the setup. The dynamic characteristics of the brake system were captured with the microphone and the laser Doppler vibrometer. % The audio frequency spectrum was generated by placing a microphone close to the sliding interface of the pads and rotor. A Laser Doppler vibrometer was used to generate the mode shapes and the vibration velocity spectrum of the brake components. <br/>It was established from the results of the brake noise audio and the vibrometer scans that the entire bike vibrated at three peak frequencies during the brake noise events. Brake noise level as loud as 95 decibels was captured. Stick-slip as one of the friction-induced instabilities was identified during the experiments. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a detailed finite element model of the disc brake assembly was developed. Modal analysis on the components of the assembly and a pre-stressed modal analysis on the entire brake assembly was performed. The finite element results compared well with the experimental results. It was observed that there exists doublet modes and intermediate modal coupling in the system. <br/><br/>Limiting the rotor symmetry by adding weights on the rotor ribs was shown to be effective in reducing instabilities. Other ways to counter brake noise by increasing the rotor mass and by introducing a parallel slot in the brake pad were successfully tested.","Brake noise; Bicycle brake noise; Squeal; Experimental modal analysis; Finite element analysis; Laser Doppler vibrometer; Stick-slip; Doublet modes; Chatter; Mode lock-in","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-22","","","","","",""

These factors form the basis of the final decision of a member when they decide whether or not to invest in a start-up. To investigate this topic, the factors that affect member decision-making are investigated when these members receive a pre-validated set of investment options from an investor club. To collect data, eight interviews with members of one investor club in the digital health sector have been conducted. These members are of diverse member type and nationality to analyze differences between members. During these interviews, different factors that influence the investors, like regulatory approval or a strategic fit, have been indicated by members. Throughout these findings, differences of focus between different types of members were observed. In some cases, the service provided by the investor club does not line up with the strategy of members, posing a question for their future collaboration. This dissimilarity in strategy shows as well in the factors of importance for members. Where business angel members have many commonalities with traditional business angels and usually fit well with the opportunities provided by the club, especially corporate members focus on other factors. Because of these differences in focus between members, providing a satisfying service to all their members is complicated for the investor club. Creating a more synonymous member portfolio will lower the variance in member demands, allowing them to provide a better service. Although the results show many similarities between the decision-making of business angel members and individual business angels, this will need to be researched further to definitively come to this conclusion.","Investment; Angel group; Angel network; decision-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

These gradients can then be incorporated in a gradient-descent type optimization pipeline.<br/><br/>One such type of design problem is caustic design with free-form lenses. This is the process of obtaining the geometry of lenses in an optical system such that the light that passes through this system forms a desired illumination distribution on a target screen. A typical application of this is distributing the light from streetlights or car headlights in a pleasing and efficient way over the street.<br/><br/>The non-imaging optics literature offers many methods to design free-form lenses for caustic design, but differentiable ray-tracing is largely unknown in this field. Therefore this thesis proposes a method of optimizing free-form lenses for caustic design with differentiable ray-tracing. <br/><br/>The optimization pipeline starts with a multi-layer perceptron neural network which outputs parameters that define one free-form lens side in the form of a B-spline surface. A specially implemented ray-tracer then produces a caustic render by tracing through this lens from either a plane wave or a (grid of) point source(s). Back-propagation and optimization takes place using automatic differentiation in PyTorch and the Adam optimizer.<br/><br/>The results, which are verified with LightTools, show great promise for this technique, especially for the plane wave optimizations. The point source grid optimizations proved to be more challenging, but also here the optimization was able to achieve improvement. This shows that the proposed technique also has potential in positive etendue optimizations.","Optics; Differentiable ray-tracing; B-spline surfaces; Free-form lens; Neural networks; Caustic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-22","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

However, not all sectors can electrify fully or at an even speed. The industry sector for instance, is heavily reliant on fossil fuelled feedstocks. Power-to-X is named in literature to resolve that dependency. A practical example of the Power-to-X principle is the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen. The Dutch government aims to have 500MW of electrolyzers capacity installed by 2025, and 8GW by 2030. However, currently there is 1MW of capacity installed. This thesis aimed to find the rationale behind the discrepancy between the reality and the set targets. In this thesis, the Technical Innovation System (TIS) is analysed in an effort to delineate what the impact of the innovation system is on the development of the technology.<br/><br/>With the use of a structural-functional analysis as proposed by Hekkert et al. (2011), an inductive research approach is taken, and the following research question is answered:<br/><br/>How do the systemic functions impact the implementation and development of electrochemical synthesizes of hydrogen in the Netherlands and how can this performance be improved?<br/><br/>The data is gathered via 13 expert interviews. The seven key processes are assessed. By doing so, the impact of the systemic functions is given. The resource mobilization scored a 2, the entrepreneurial activity, knowledge diffusion, guidance of the search, and market formation a score of 3, and knowledge development and creation of legitimacy a score of 4. In total, 36 systemic problems arose from the analysis. The systemic problems concentrate around the market uncertainty, lack or absence of institutional guidance and incentives, reluctant attitude of stakeholders, and insufficient resource availability. Systemic problems occurred in all system functions.<br/><br/>The relevance of the seven system functions is questioned in the context of sustainable technologies since this analysis showed the extremes housing within SF4. Additionally, the use of a label score and an analysis score delivered a method for decreasing the subjective influence of the researcher with the ability to indicate weights to an argument. Both add to existing innovation literature and could be considered by future TIS analysists. Furthermore, this analysis showed the impact the innovation system has on the development of the technology. This is in contrast with existing techno-economic research on the challenges for hydrogen electrolysis, whom reason from the perspective of the technology. Further research could include adoption theory, in which the preferences of consumers are added, whilst the TIS analysis would result in the current capabilities of the system to uphold to these preferences.","hydrogen production; Sector Coupling; TIS analysis; Techno-economic analysis; barriers and drivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Previous research revealed the use of PPP is still being in question, whether the benefits outweigh the costs of PPP. It is also found the utilisation of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) in transport PPP project appraisal remains a niche. Therefore, this study aims to research what PPP brings societally, as well as to contribute to the existing literature of transport infrastructure by exploring the social potential of PPP project compared to traditional public procurement through the use of societal CBA. <br/><br/>A theoretical conceptualisation is performed by means of modelling the social potential of a PPP project. The result from the conceptual model development is then investigated in an empirical setting (case study). Based on the analysis, an inventory of the potential costs and benefits of a PPP project is presented into two models: PPP project with actual tolls and shadow tolls. The similarities between the two models include the potential social impacts resulting from cost-saving investment, quality-enhancing effect, better risks management, and higher up-front transaction costs in a PPP project. Conversely, implications of PPP with both tolls also have different societal impacts due to distinct payment arrangement between them. Actual tolls provide users with incentives to decide whether or not using the road, since they have to pay the tolls independently. It is thus understandable if there will be a reduction in traffic volume on the road (mobility loss). Road users who decide to avoid such costs will experience a loss of consumer surplus. However, those who keep using the road will experience travel time gains due to less congestion. It is also important to note that mobility loss in PPP project with actual tolls will result in more societal gains, such as environmental gains in which less CO2 emissions would be generated on the road (less pollution). In contrast, the demand for the road use will not be influenced in PPP project with shadow tolls, thus neither environmental nor travel time gains can be obtained. Nevertheless, the private party would receive higher revenue. It has to be acknowledged this study is conducted on a positive case, where all potential impacts in the theoretical conceptualisation were confirmed in the empirical analysis of the Indonesian context.<br/><br/>To conclude, the key takeaway of the research is that in doing the CBA, outcomes of a PPP project compared to traditional public procurement is dependent on the way the tolls are implemented. The research shows the importance of distinguishing between PPP with actual tolls and shadow tolls. Reflecting on the theoretical conceptualisation and empirical analysis, there have been huge implications for the CBA outcomes since there are different potential societal costs and benefits to be expected in the two models. The significant implications have been outlined for the public party, the private party and the road user.","Public-Private Partnerships; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Transport Infrastructure; Societal Impact; Actual Tolls; Shadow Tolls","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The need for haptic feedback to perceive tissue stiffness and the reduce in haptic feedback when using laparoscopic instruments suggest an inability to sufficiently experience stiffness perception during laparoscopic surgeries. Better understanding of the perception of tissue stiffness could contribute to the development of better laparoscopic instruments. A stiffness ranking task has been performed with 16 participants, to study the influence of force transmission ratio, contact area and grasping strategy on the haptic perception of variable tissue stiffness. Using a newly developed set of laparoscopic grasper handles varying in the chosen independent variables, being the force transmission ratio and contact area, the participants performed multiple grasps with each grasper handle on a randomized order of tissue samples with three different stiffness levels and ranked them according to the perceived level of stiffness. Force measurements were done during the task and a survey was conducted afterwards. The results indicate that force transmission ratio and contact area do not influence the haptic perception of variable tissue stiffness. In terms of grasping strategy, a lower force exertion is shown to be desirable for perceiving the variable tissue stiffness, while the amount of grasps per tissue sample have not shown to influence the perception. Future studies with larger sample sizes might indicate a difference between high and low force transmission ratios. It is concluded that future designs of laparoscopic grasper handles might not be restricted in terms of force transmission ratio and contact area requirements when a greater haptic perception is aimed at. More haptic perception of variable tissue stiffness is gained in the surgical domain of applying the appropriate grasping strategies.","Laparoscopic surgery; Haptic; Tissue stiffness; Grasper; Force measurement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fully grasp and consequently design the ultimate measurement system, the governing equation—the fluorescent radiative transfer equation—is solved analytically for a plane-parallel system. The new solution method assumes that fluorescent radiative transfer is well-described by the first two photon generations. Verification is done experimentally and by a concurrent Monte Carlo method. The model also successfully predicted the response of a real measurement setup.

In this thesis the sound waves that can be generated inside the flute are studied on their shape and frequencies. To achieve this, two mathematical models of the sound waves inside a flute are developed. To develop these models, solutions to the second dimensional wave equation are calculated analytically and numerically. The exact model is found within a rectangular parallelepipid region with homogeneous boundary conditions. By the method of separation of variables the second-dimensional wave equation is solved and a function of the air pressure inside the flute is calculated. This model can be used to visualise the waves inside the flute. It allows approximate true frequencies of measured musical notes in the flute. The second model, the numerical model is found in the same domain as the exact model, but with non-homogeneous boundary conditions.These are more realistic boundary conditions and therefore this model might be more accurate than the exact model. By the method of finite difference the numerical second-dimensional wave equation is solved. A system of two numerical equations is found. One of the equations calculates the pressure of the air inside the flute by inserting the previous pressure and velocity of the wave inside the flute. The other one calculates the velocity of the sound wave inside the flute by inserting the previous pressure of the sound wave inside the flute. The visualisation of this model however is not yet an accurate model to visualise waves inside the transverse flute.

Finally, the sensors decorated with different metal types and coverages are investigated for their response to H2O and NO2. The study shows that both the pristine devices and the sensors decorated with NPs hardly response to water molecules, while the responses to NO2 are larger and vary depending on the NPs.

One of these technologies is a diamond-based quantum computer using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. In order to sustain the mentioned growth, the limits of electronics as well as computer engineering need to be explored. Consequently, an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) defining the functionality of the NV centers must be constructed that, in turn, controls the electronics needed to operate the qubits within the NV<br/>center.<br/><br/><br/>In this thesis, we created a simulator to verify the functionality of the ISA and, more importantly, utilize the simulator to explore the capabilities of a diamond-based quantum computer. The simulator mimics the interaction between components and qubits in a diamond-based quantum computer and maps these interactions onto quantum mechanical instructions, such as qubit rotations. The simulator is implemented by modeling the electronics based on literature and creating interaction between the components using an event scheduler. The event scheduler is part of the NetSquid framework in which this simulator is built. The framework has models implemented to represent qubits and perform operations on qubits as well. The qubit representation model represents the electron and carbon nuclei qubits. The quantum operations are used to perform quantum mechanical operations on the qubits.<br/><br/><br/>The simulator is tested for physical accuracy using single diamond tests from literature, namely magnetic biasing, rabi cycle checking, and charge resonance checks. The simulator returned an accurate value for the Larmor frequency and Rabi frequency meaning that it was close to the expected value. For example, setting the Larmor frequency to 1.72GHz and using the magnetic biasing sequence to determine the Larmor frequency resulted in the same 1.72GHz$value.<br/>After single diamond tests have been performed, the control of multiple diamonds and their qubits is tested using a quantum algorithm, the surface-7 code. The simulator accurately mimics the expected behavior of the noiseless execution of the surface-7 code. The results of the simulator follow the trend of the expected values.<br/><br/><br/>The final product of this thesis is a simulator that can accurately describe the interaction between an ISA and the components of the diamond-based system-architecture in the noiseless case. The simulator provides a setup for a future simulator with noise sources implemented, resulting in a simulator that can be used to determine the limits of electronic properties or to predict the outcome of lab experiments.","Quantum computing; Quantum electronics; micro-architecture; QISA; simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-08-31","","","","Computer Engineering","Fujitsu Project",""

Investigated scenarios include a single wind turbine and rows of three and ten wind turbines aligned to the inflow.<br/>Compared to the baseline case, outboard thrust distribution produces lower wake velocity deficits, increased momentum transfer and increased turbulence generation. The wake-diffusion rotor concept increases the wind farm power generation by 3.8 % and 2.5 % in the three and ten wind turbine row scenarios respectively, with the largest relative gain in wind turbine power of 13.9 % for the second wind turbine in the row. Consecutive wind turbines in the row experience diminishing gains. The inboard shifted thrust distribution had opposite effects for all of these aspects.<br/>The benefits in wake mitigation and power generation in wind farms from using the wake-diffusion rotor concept are concluded to come from higher turbulence mixing caused by the outboard shifted thrust distribution.

ECs enhance the spread of other transitions, not only the energy one, e.g., car-sharing services, EVs, and initiatives against energy poverty. However, an energy community, even though is now acknowledged as a legal entity by the European Union and by local governments, is still facing barriers that are hindering its full deployment. According to the academic literature, those barriers concern, for instance, the lack of a factual regulatory framework, absence of intermediaries, and new business models. Moreover, ECs have not been analyzed through the Multi-Level Governance, specifically on how institutional setting and governance can influence the emergence of these initiatives and support their spread. This Multi-Level Governance implies the study of the stakeholders’ interaction among different levels, EU, national and sub-national, until the local level. This multi-level approach was acknowledged in the literature as relevant when examining energy and climate policies, also due to the importance which is recognized in those topics of the local and regional levels. Thus, the use of this framework for further analysis can provide clarity concerning the different responsibilities of local, national, and international actors, as well as intermediaries, and support the identification of additional barriers which has not been highlighted yet.

Claus is an auxiliary drive train module for last-mile delivery hand trucks. The objective of the concept is to enable delivery workers to deliver parcels to the growing amount of addresses in urban environments with limited mobility access.<br/><br/>Due to the combination of urbanization, the rising popularity of e-commerce and rising congestion levels in cities, delivery companies are increasingly struggling to transport their goods to the customer. Conventional delivery fleets, consisting of big delivery vans to handle the rising delivery volumes, are not suited to the urban environment anymore as cities are undergoing rising congestion rates and as automobiles are becoming a less prioritized mode of transport. Consequently, delivery workers have to cover larger distances from the van to the front door of the customer by foot. Usually, delivery workers use hand trucks to cover these last meters, but as these distances increase, walking the hand truck becomes a time consuming job.<br/>Claus is proposed as a solution for this last leg of parcel delivery. Claus is an auxiliary module with a built in electric drive train that connects to any regular hand truck. By connecting Claus to a hand truck, a four-wheel vehicle is created that can transport a the delivery worker along with his or her cargo. The hand truck acts as both the cargo carrier as well as the steering device, while Claus acts as a standing deck and a drive train. Thanks to Claus’ geometry and volume, Claus can be transported in a conventional delivery van similarly to the hand truck. By bringing both a hand truck and Claus during delivery shifts, delivery workers are enabled to quickly and easily cover areas that are becoming less accessible to delivery vans.<br/><br/>Two prototypes were created that were used to validate the concept. A technical prototype acted as a means to validate the driving characteristics and the ergonomics. Furthermore, it was used to validate technical aspects such as the battery capacity and the drive train system. An aesthetic prototype was used to communicate the design to the stakeholders.","Last-mile Mobility; Last-mile delivery; Logistics; Hand truck; Light Electric Vehicles; Mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

According to Feinberg et al. (2021), Urban Commons can promote social, environmental, and economic resilience, and Park et al. (2020) suggest they can act as a haven for the excluded. Commons could, therefore, become a policy alternative to address the grand urban challenges of the 21st Century.<br/>However, it is still unclear whether the benefits of Urban Commons are ultimately accessible to the culturally and socioeconomically vulnerable. For instance, in a literature review study, Huron (2017) found significant uncertainties in how Urban Commons relate to feminism, race, gender, and ethnicity – factors that could constitute immaterial barriers of access, following Vrasti &amp; Dayal’s (2017) terminology. In fact, while several studies have investigated the commons’ role in promoting urban justice, explorations of whether access to the commons itself is just have been neglected.<br/><br/>This master’s thesis explores what constitutes material and immaterial barriers to accessing Urban Commons to understand whether these initiatives can work, policy-wise, as a driver of social inclusion. 29 Urban Commons in Amsterdam were selected as a case study. A quantitative geo-spatial analysis was conducted to evaluate the material accessibility to each initiative. In parallel, commoners were surveyed about their perception of immaterial barriers and benefits of commoning. Finally, a representative of the municipality of Amsterdam was interviewed to assess the potential challenges and benefits of policies involving Urban Commons.<br/><br/>Concurring with Park et al. (2020), the case study findings suggest commons could indeed promote social inclusion. Moreover, it was also found that the excluded could face, in addition to the initially proposed material and immaterial walls, an ecosystem barrier to access commons. Yet this could be addressed from a policy standpoint with the development of a commons ecosystem that is capable of scaling the benefits of commoning across an entire city.<br/><br/>The results have academic and societal relevance. This study provides a new theoretical framework to research the factors influencing access to commons and also contributes to literature with a unique city-wide case study. It can also function as a reference for policy-makers who wish to learn about the commons landscape in Amsterdam and who interested in understanding the factors that contribute to participation in a commons.<br","Urban Commons; Accessibility; Social Inclusion; Amsterdam; Commons; Ecosystem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

I performed four days of GPR and GCM surveys over three simulated clandestine burials at ARISTA. I collected common-offset GPR data to investigate changes to burial detectability due to different central antenna frequencies (250 MHz and 500 MHz), different GPR instruments (NOGGIN or pulseEKKO), changes to survey grid orientation relative to burials, and increased soil moisture content in the survey area. Additionally, I acquired common-source GPR data to examine the efficacy of electromagnetic interferometry (EI) and adaptive subtraction (AS) methods in improving burial detectability. I conducted GCM surveys with two coil configurations, (horizontal co-planar (HCP) and vertical co-planar (VCP)), three intercoil spacings (0.32 m, 0.71 m, 1.18 m), two different line spacings (0.5 m, 0.25 m) and in the presence of variable soil moisture content. I also performed low induction number (LIN) correction and elevation correction procedures on GCM data to determine the extent to which these influence the detectability of clandestine burials in this environment.<br/>In common-offset radargrams characteristic burial anomalies take on many forms, appearing as disruptions to existing features (direct-wave arrivals and soil horizons) and as isolated reflection events (hyperbolic events and burial length horizontal anomalies). In timeslices, burials are characterized by high or low amplitude rectangular anomalies. When used in conjunction, radargrams and timeslices produced characteristic responses regardless of survey grid orientation, consistent with the locations of the burials. Increased soil moisture at the site improved the detectability of burials and the 250 MHz antenna was found to be superior to the 500 MHz antenna in obtaining a characteristic burial response, though both were successful to a large extent. EI and AS processing techniques were successful in removing direct-wave contributions in radargrams, though detectability was not significantly improved when compared to raw data. Overall, the three burials were detected using GPR to various extents, and in future work thorough historical data in addition to zero-measurements should be obtained for all burials in order to investigate the source of these differences. GCM surveys conducted in this work were largely unsuccessful in detecting simulated clandestine burials due to significant conductive noise sources (metal fence, sensors, etc.) and the limited conductivity contrast in the soil. Low conductivity zones were detected over some burials using HCP at an intercoil spacing of 1.18 m, however, confidence in the validity of these responses is low due to the dominating noise sources.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

Similarly, such data-driven methods are implemented into partially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS). PANS is a young bridging method that fulfils the requirements of bridging methods set by Speziale [1]. It can be adjusted according to the fraction of a flow field that is desired by the user to be resolved and modelled by changing the value of fk, a parameter that takes a value between 0 and 1. In this thesis, PANS is extended via a combination of two data-driven methods: k−corrective frozen RANS [2] and data-driven stochastic closure simulation (DSCS) [3]. The k−corrective frozen RANS method aims to correct for the model errors in the k−equation and the anisotropy of the Reynolds<br/>stress tensor derived from the Boussinesq approximation. While DSCS also aims to correct for the anisotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor, it considers that PANS solves for the unresolved part of the flow field and thus corrects for the unresolved anisotropy. While PANS and the two data-driven methods have independently been proved to work as they were theoretically desired, combining these ideas has not yet been attempted. As any turbulence kinetic energy solving RANS turbulence model can be developed into PANS form, the k − ω SST model was chosen for the best initial prediction. This SST model for PANS is extensively derived and then reformulated to produce the target correction terms. The correction terms are analysed at various values of fk and they show good agreements with fk.","PANS; RANS; data-driven; k-omega sst; k-corrective; stochastic closure; frozen-k","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/ckpark96 Repository link Contains repsitories of the relevant programs","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The first strategy is utilising a crane vessel to replace a component in offshore, this is called the heavy lift maintenance (HLM) strategy. The other strategy is the tow to port maintenance (TTPM) strategy, where the floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) is towed to port to be serviced. Royal IHC is looking for a reliable and relatively quick method to determine the potential of both strategies and test new vessel and equipment concepts, which will allow a head start in this upcoming maintenance market.<br/><br/>To determine the three output parameters; CO2eq emission and cost originating from the support vessels and FOWT downtime, a calculation model has been developed, as this was not available. The calculation model compares seven different support fleet configurations for the two maintenance strategies. The configurations contain at least one heavy lift vessel (HLV), platform supply vessel or anchor handling supply vessel type, which are varied in this study on their empirical based parameterised designs. The calculation model also allows the possibility to include, amongst others, preventive maintenance, breakdown maintenance and utilization of different fuels. In total three FOWT farms, varying in size and distance from shore, were considered to determine the effect of those parameters on the different support fleet configurations.<br/><br/>The calculation model was verified and provides a reliable and relatively quick method to compare different support fleet configurations, concerning the two major component replacement strategies. With the use of this model it was found that the most sustainable support fleet configuration for both preventive and breakdown maintenance is a standalone HLV. However, this conclusion does not hold for full blade replacement campaigns. The cost of this HLM strategy is relatively high compared to the TTPM configurations, especially when considering preventive maintenance campaigns. Therefore, it is suggested that the TTPM strategy is preferred for preventive maintenance campaigns. It must be noted that this is also based on the assumption that the port of repair has unlimited facilities to replace the components as soon as the FOWT arrives. It should also be noted that the FOWT downtime is greater for the TTPM strategy, which could be a potentially important aspect of the repair. The calculation model also allows to test new innovative concepts, such as a quick mooring (dis)connection system and the climbing crane. Both show to have a beneficial effect on the replacement operation.<br/><br/>This research has shown that the developed calculation model is well suited, reliable and a relatively quick method determine the potential of both strategies. This research already provided Royal IHC insight into the new market, but can also be used to inform clients who request an advice. The flexibility of the model allows it to be used for different field, fleet and vessel parameters. Moreover, due to the modular programming method additional information can be added at a later stage. This also leads to some recommendations for further research. A suitable weather module has to be introduced in order to get a better estimation on the vessel downtime. After this is done the program should be optimised in terms of runtime efficiency, in such a way that a Monte Carlo method could be run. The added value of this method is that a more accurate support vessel downtime can be estimated. It is also recommended to include bunker time into the calculation as it is currently set to 0 h and potentially leads to an overoptimistic outcome. Lastly, two other floater types should be designed for a 15 MW turbine and included in the model. These floater types are the tension leg platform and barge floater.","Floating offshore wind turbine; Maintenance; Sustainability; Cost; Heavy lift maintenance strategy; Tow to port maintenance strategy; Support vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

Due to this inherent complexity, there are numerous emerging challenges that need to be tackled. In those complex environments, various-interest groups collaborate and compete to achieve their goals and interests, constituting a vital part of urban planning. The advancement of technology and ICT, and the abiding need to keep citizens engaged, marked a critical shift in the way that urban planning confronts the increasingly contemporary complex issues. This advancement has offered citizens a way to digitally participate in urban planning procedures, overcoming certain limitations, while posing, also, challenges related to the level of its effectiveness. <br/>While many methods and tools have been developed over the years, for enhancing citizen engagement and the effectiveness of public participation, there seems to be an evident gap in substantial and two-way collaboration among the (relevant) urban stakeholders. This thesis project aims to hark the perspectives and needs of the urban stakeholders, translating them into a conceptual design of a digital public participation platform. Next to that, except for the importance of the platform itself, as a tool, the focus was also given to participation, as a process, considering that such a platform could and should act as a promoter of effective public participation rather than a stand-alone solution. Consequently, the main research question of this study is: Which characteristics need to be included in designing a public participation platform so that it can enhance citizen engagement and facilitate more effective public participation in urban planning?<br/>For this research, a design science research approach was chosen. A theoretical background was developed on existing theories, methods and frameworks related to public participation and digital platforms. Data collection was conducted using multiple methods, including workshops, semi-structured interviews, and questionnaires, while data analysis was conducted inductively, to identify all the emerging patterns and their interrelations. <br/>From the data analysis, five core themes emerged: General findings; (De)Motivational factors for public participation; Characteristics; Technical requirements; Technological features. Retaining these themes, the analyzed results were then critically synthesized, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, to provide a holistic overview. <br/>Combing the obtained results, the main research outputs were developed, providing an overall answer to the main research question. First, a trifold validation of the results, related to the past, present, and future, was conducted, fulfilling the rigor and design cycle of the design science research, and attaining a continuous assessment. Building upon the evaluation results, for the platform as a tool, a conceptual design was developed, based on the different views of the urban stakeholders. For the process of public participation in general, a set of guidelines was developed, providing recommendations on how to enhance citizen engagement and the effectiveness of public participation, based on the different views of the urban stakeholders. <br/>This thesis concludes with some important final remarks, including limitations, recommendations for future research, research relevance, and the author’s final reflections on the research. <br","Public Participation; Urban Planning; Citizen Engagement; Digital Platforms; Digital Tools; Decision Making; Effectiveness; Design Science Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The upscaling of perovskite-based solar cells to the module must be done at minimal losses.<br/><br/>The following research is performed on an opaque double cation p-i-n perovskite module of aperture area 4 $cm^2$. The focus is on the laser scribing patterning technique to develop a quality interconnection in a module. The various laser parameters to be optimized and the approach to achieve a quality P1-P2-P3 scribe for the module are reported. With an ultrashort pulsed laser, the ablation of photoactive perovskite material varies remarkably. There are many possible scenarios regarding the level of ablation of $NiO_{x}$ and ITO using a picosecond pulsed laser with a wavelength of 355nm. In this study, the characterization concerning the emergence of contact resistance at ohmic contact is essential to identify the optimal ablation for interconnection in the module. The optimization is performed using a Scanning electron microscope in EDS mode, optical microscope, and Transmission line measurement. It helps to study the impact of different parameters on interconnection in a device.<br/><br/>This research shows that it is optimal to ablate beyond the HTL to completely remove the $NiO_{x}$ and minimize the contact resistance. The optimized laser parameters for each scribe helped achieve an optical gain, by reducing the dead area in a module. It helped in improving the geometrical fill factor by 3\%. Furthermore, the set of laser parameters also helped improve the electrical performance of a module by minimizing the drop in FF\% when up-scaled from cell to module.

These power electronic converters introduce electrical stresses in the form of complex waveforms into the grid caused by their switching operations. The High voltage (HV) equipment is subjected to these stresses. To maintain the reliability of the power system it must be able to withstand these kinds of complex stresses. To test the HV equipment with such stresses and assess its correct functioning, it is important to be able to reproduce such complex waveshapes. A new Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC) based arbitrary waveshape generator with 67 sub-modules in each arm rated for 100 kV is being designed to target the testing of medium voltage (MV) class equipment. Since the MMC has its own limitations in generating superimposed Lightning impulse (LI) waveforms, an integrated hybrid configuration combining the conventional Marx generator circuit and MMC is needed to generate the superimposed LI. This thesis intends to design and demonstrate the feasibility of such an integrated hybrid configuration focusing on two major goals. Firstly, to investigate the capabilities of the Typhoon HIL to implement the control of MMC and compare this with the existing OPAL-RT controller, and secondly, to design an integrated hybrid configuration to produce superimposed waveforms. To achieve the first goal the Typhoon HIL hardware, software, MMC topology, and the various modulation techniques were studied in depth. Phase shifted carrier (PSC) modulation-based open loop control was implemented on the CPU and FPGA of the HIL device. The results were compared with the offline simulations, and it was found that the control implemented on the CPU is suitable for up to 1 kHz, and the FPGA control is recommended for higher frequencies. The performance of Typhoon HIL is better than OPAL-RT regarding generating accurate gate pulses at higher fundamental frequencies. The approach for the second goal used is to study the literature on existing composite test setup to understand the requirements to design the decoupling circuit between impulse generator and MMC. A downsized model of an integrated hybrid configuration was designed and validated by offline simulation. Next, a 300 V hardware prototype was implemented in a step-by-step manner. First, Rapid control prototyping was performed separately on the MMC comprising 2 sub-modules in each arm with the FPGA control developed using the Typhoon device. Thereafter, the impulse circuit was coupled with the MMC to test for both power frequency and DC superimposed impulses. It was observed that the real-time simulation results were identical to the offline simulations and the superimposed impulses could be generated with high accuracy. Finally, the output of the MMC for higher signal bandwidth was tested using the Typhoon FPGA control. It was found that the MMC could generate sinusoidal waveforms up to 3 kHz.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Hybridisation of the propulsion system is a stepping stone to full electriﬁcation, which is required to reduce emissions of the maritime sector to zero. In hybrid propulsion systems, clutches are used to switch between drive engines when transitioning between operational modes. The operation of clutches is indicated to generate signiﬁcant disturbances in propulsion systems, however, this impact is overlooked in hybrid propulsion simulation studies in the scientiﬁc literature. The identiﬁed research gap is addressed in this thesis by simulating propulsion mode transition in a hybrid propulsion system and analysing the impact of clutch operation, using a model developed for this purpose. A hybrid propulsion system is deﬁned by introducing multi disk wet friction clutches in a reference propulsion system consisting of a 9.1 MW diesel engine in parallel with a 3 MW electric motor. A broad scope of impact measures, that includes the electric load on the power system and the temperature development of the clutch, is deﬁned and the system is thoroughly modelled to enable evaluation of these measures. The transmission system is modelled with a higher ﬁdelity than typically applied in propulsion system simulation studies to enable assessment of the basic vibratory behaviour of the transmission system. The considered propulsion modes transitions are between diesel and electric propulsion. To enable these transitions, three transition control approaches with an increasing degree of sophistication are implemented. The developed model is used to perform simulations, from which it is concluded that torsional vibrations, gear hammer and a drop in propeller speed characterise the signiﬁcant impact of clutch operation on hybrid propulsion systems in propulsion mode transitions. It is also concluded that the impact of clutch operation can be limited by implementing an appropriate propulsion control approach for the transition. A torque controlled handover of drive torque between engines is identiﬁed as a suitable approach. However, the induction machine switching from torque to speed control introduces power peaks in the load proﬁle that have the potential to severely disrupt the stability of the ships power system. It is ﬁnally concluded that the temperature development of the clutch during the propulsion mode transitions is not signiﬁcant. It is shown in this thesis that there can be a signiﬁcant impact on the propulsion system as a result of the operation of clutches in propulsion mode transitions. Therefore, this impact has to be taken into consideration when designing hybrid propulsion systems. The model described in this thesis can be used to predict the impact of clutch operation in the early stages of the design process. Furthermore, the model can be used to develop and evaluate propulsion mode transition control approaches.","Propulsion System Simulation; Propulsion Mode Transitions; Clutch Operation; Hybrid Propulsion System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

These so-called ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) are used to register both compressional and shear waves. The recorded seismic information is used to enhance our understanding of areas of interest located offshore, like hydrocarbon reservoirs, mid oceanic ridges, and continental margins. A lot of progress has been made on OBS applications. However, there are still some distinctive problems mainly related to clock drift, orientation, and coupling. We use and test \textit{OCloC}, a new method which seeks to improve the ability to detect and correct clock errors of OBSs. The method was successfully developed using an extensive dataset from a seismic network, which included many land- and ocean bottom-seismometers. One of the objectives is to understand under which conditions OCloC can be used when the dataset is relatively small. To do this, data from a network deployed in the Red Sea coastal area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is used. This network includes two ocean bottom seismometers which are complemented by several land-stations. We collected all used data during five campaigns, both offshore and onshore. To analyse the data quality we designed and applied an extensive data quality control, where after the data is prepared for Ocloc through pre-processing. Both workflows are presented in a roadmap. This roadmap is made applicable for ocean bottom seismometers by including an orientation estimation, for which we used a technique based on Rayleigh wave polarization. Our quality control shows that the data from both ocean bottom seismometers show significant attenuation, primarily for short periods, which is possibly caused by a poor coupling to the loose sediments on the sea bed. The noise source illumination turns out to be highly anisotropic, with a high microseism noise source concentration in the Red Sea. This results in a poor signal to noise ratio for the interferometric surface wave responses. As a consequence, we find that the limited station deployment time and data quality interferes with the ability to obtain an accurate clock error. Nevertheless, the technique to estimate the OBS orientation turns out to be successful.","Clock drift; Interferometry; OBS; Red Sea; Coupling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

LIDAR acts as an auxiliary ranging technique, such as radar, thermal image ranging, image recognition, and time-of-flight (TOF) sensor. As a special type of direct time-of-flight (D-TOF) system, this work presents the system design and the hardware implementation of a one dimension time-of-flight (1D-TOF) sensor that uses LIDAR with single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). The system is designed for consumer electronics, serving for short-distance target ranging in proximity and face detection. <br/>A typical 1D-TOF LIDAR system is composed of a pulsed laser which emits photons, and a sensor which measures the photons that are reflected back from the target. In 1D-TOF LIDAR systems, the following elements are of great importance: SPAD, time-to-digital converter (TDC), TOF histogram, and depth estimation algorithm. <br/>SPAD is the key component of the system, which is designed to detect a single photon. The target ranging can be estimated by measuring the travel time of the photons. With the help of SPADs, the detection of the photons is converted into a response of the SPAD circuity, in which the optical signal is converted to the electrical signal. And, we can measure the moment in which the electrical signal is active to estimate the travel time of the photons.<br/>TDC is a tool for time measurement. In a 1D-TOF LIDAR system, it measures the exact moment, when a SPAD is triggered by a single photon. The measured time is called the timestamp of the photon.<br/>A TOF histogram accumulates the timestamps of the photons at every time interval. In a TOF histogram, we can observe the time distribution of the photons. In essence, the photons come from two sources, noise and signal. With the help of algorithms, we can derive signal information and reject noise information from a TOF histogram. Also, the algorithm enables us to retrieve the TOF information of the histogram, in which the distance between the target and the sensor lies within. <br/>In this work, the basic concepts of the 1D-TOF LIDAR system is described in chapter 1, and a prototype architecture is discussed in chapter 2. Next, the design is decomposed into stages, including system modeling in chapter 3, system trade-off analysis in chapter 4, algorithm design in chapter 5 and hardware implementation in chapter 6. Moreover, we also propose novel approaches both in system level modeling and algorithm design based on artificial intelligence methods.","LIDAR; 1D-TOF; D-TOF; depth sensing; target ranging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-19","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Another alternative is the use of vector field magnetometers, which can be processed with a Gauss-Newton inversion. Both the Basin-hopping and Guass-Newton inversion consist of a two step inversion. First, an inversion to estimate the centre location and magnetic dipole moment of a point source is carried out, the so called point-source inversion. Second, the retrieved magnetic dipole moment can be used to reconstruct the magnetic moment with a prolate spheroid model, which is called the prolate-spheroid inversion.<br/><br/>First, both the TMI and vector data inversion are tested on 3000 noise-free synthetic datasets located in the North Sea where a prolate spheroid with varying shape, orientation and magnetic susceptibility creates an anomaly field. The largest global root mean square (GNRMS) error for the point-source inversion of the Gauss-Newton vector data inversion has a value in the order 10<sup>−9</sup> whereas the Basin-hopping inversion for the TMI data returns for only 61% of the cases a GNRMS error in the order 10<sup>−7</sup> or lower.<br/>The result of the point-source inversion serves as a plateau for the prolate spheroid inversion; when the point-source inversion does not reach the set level of accuracy, it cannot be determined if the prolate spheroid model describes the true object well. For both the TMI and vector data, the UXO was correctly classified in 72% of the 3000 datasets. <br/>Second, comparing the current industry standard to the Basin-hopping point-source inversion only gave inconclusive results. The estimated centre location of both methods are within a 0.15 m radius but the disagreement in magnetic moment leaves an advice on which technique would work better indecipherable.","UXO; marine; magnetometer; survey; inversion; geophysics; unexploded ordnance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-22","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

(mentor); Sharif Azadeh, S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the airline industry revenue and inventory is managed tightly, with the intent to sell each seat at the right price to the right customer at the right time. This does not always go to plan and seats remain unsold, or demand can be greater than what is available. The question then becomes how can capacity and revenue be managed more efficiently? How can capacity and revenue be maximized to ensure that seat spoilage is minimized. This thesis takes a look at this problem and aims to solve this problem by dynamically allocating capacity as well as becoming paired with revenue management processes. By being able to move capacity around to different flights, it is believed that revenue can be maximized and that seat spoilage can be minimized, creating a more effective use of a perishable product. The goal of this thesis is to show that increases are possible, even if by small margins. This thesis looks to use real-world data to help support its findings along with a random distribution to pair alongside a Monte Carlo simulation to help ensure accuracy. In this data driven methodological approach revenue management and a capacity swapping algorithm are integrated. The revenue management module creates a series of seat inventory allocations as well as demand forecasting. This information is then fed into a simulation which will then simulate the entire booking life- cycle of a fight. Here each flight will build its passenger load and will swap aircraft with other aircraft of varying capacities when the algorithm has determined it is necessary and would create a positive increase in revenue and passenger counts. To assist in this approach a further random forest model is developed to help make informed decisions. These changes are further evaluated by the algorithm to ensure that every change that was made was beneficial and if so will accept the swap and continue to build loads as this new flight. Different case studies were developed that introduced different timing scenarios as well as different decision making tools. The two different decision making tools would use either the random forest model that was developed or a simple logic model that would look at estimated final revenue and estimated final passenger loads. The timing scenarios would look to see when swapping would be needed, whether it is a true daily swap or if swaps can be performed once a month. Ultimately there were positive results, with each scenario tested yielding positive increases in the three KPIs examined (Load Factor, Passengers, Revenue). Each scenario involved testing either the simple logic, or random forest model with varying swapping intervals. The best performing scenario was one where flights were allowed to be swapped daily using a random forest decision model. In this best scenario load factor saw an increase of 1%, the number of passengers increased 1.4%, and revenue increased 0.9%; all against the baseline scenario where zero flights were swapped. This translates into a 36,000 USD weekly increase for a small sample in a route network. Across a full route network, even greater increases can be achieved.","Revenue Management; Dynamic Capacity Allocation; Air Transportation; Airline; Optimization; Random Forest; Network Schedule; Airline Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The objective is to determine whether the assumption of Li et al. (2021), that capillary pressure is uniform in the region of interest, with static foam in an artificial fracture, is justified. This would be the case if water can flow through Plateau borders at a rate that is quick enough for pressure differences to dissipate rapidly. Images of foam in the fractures are turned into networks of slits that are scaled down to flow through Plateau borders in foam. The results of this show that the capillary pressure can be assumed to be uniform.<br/><br/>The second problem concerns steady-state two-phase flow in microfluidic devices. The objective is to determine whether two phases can simultaneously flow at comparable fractional flows through a microfluidic device without alternating pore occupancy. This would be the case if the total mobility values of both phases are similar. To find the relative permeability values, a microfluidic device is simulated consisting of interface shapes based on the findings of Cox et al. (2022), arranged in a network according to bond percolation theory. The results show that it is unlikely that two phases with similar viscosity values can maintain steady-state flow at comparable fractional flows, and impossible if the viscosity ratio is that of gas and water. This implies that flow experiments done using microfluidic devices reflect the high-capillary-number flow regime where flow paths fluctuate in the pore network.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Energy Engineering","",""

A promising technology in this direction, is the use of lidars for remote sensing of wind fields and particularly for lidar-assisted control of wind turbines. Many investigations have been carried out to study the performance of lidars for measuring global wind statistics and test out lidar-assisted control strategies. However there appears to be less research efforts towards identifying and characterising localised and specific flow structures within the wind field, which is the aspect of focus in this study. <br/><br/>Whilst the main objective is to detect flow structures, this study also dives into the lidar measurement process. A striking feature of this process is the extensive data processing procedure applied to reduce noise and provide a final output in the form of the line-of-sight velocity. As this consists on relatively large data reduction and condensing steps, the question therefore arises, is useful information lost during this process?<br/><br/>To investigate the different stages of the lidar measurement process, a continuous wave lidar emulator was developed and served as the main tool for simulating lidar operation under controlled conditions. The first part of the investigation was performed on the Lamb-Oseen vortex, and was aimed at finding traces of the vortex within the lidar outputs. Besides, the line-of-sight velocity output, the Doppler spectrum was also analysed in a statistical sense with the use of moments. Three main indicators of the presence of the vortex were identified in the velocity envelope and the variations of the Doppler spectrum standard deviation and skewness across the vortex core. Tests were performed to see the effects of varying conditions (core size, noise, line-of-sight effects, etc.) on these patterns. From these sensitivity tests, a possible approach at characterising the vortex position, core radius and circulation was formulated. Further testing was then performed by adapting the methods used to a LES simulated wind turbine tip vortices.<br/><br/>In all tests performed, it is clear that the most detrimental obstacle to reliable vortex detection arises from the surrounding flow field which distorts the structure of the vortex and hence the regularity of the patterns identified within the lidar measurement process. An additional barrier are measurement process noise sources which tend to damp the signal rather than distort it, thus weakening but preserving the general shape of the identified features.<br/><br/>Applicability of the detection method developed is possible, but challenging in real operating conditions, due to the noisy background wind field and the ignorance of the approximate vortex location in the wind inflow. However, with continued and improved future studies, the approach shown may result in a suitable way of determining wake regions from the detection of tip vortices, thus providing a valuable input for wind turbine control and wind farm power optimisation.","Wind Energy; LiDAR; Lidar modelling; Vortex; Tip-vortex; Vortex detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Rotor Design Track","",""

Attackers have commonly used phishing as a social engineering technique to deploy a ransomware attack. Critical infrastructures such as hospitals have been the common target of these attacks due to hospitals’ sudden increase in digitization and interconnectivity, and the richness of data housed by them. 70 percent of the ransomware attacks against organizations were attributed to the shortage of cybersecurity skills amongst employees. The basic knowledge amongst employees in recognizing suspicious signals is scarce even though there are numerous workshops, programs, and online websites to educate users of such threats. To tackle this problem, effective employee awareness methods are necessary and in this research serious games are used to help solve the problem. The Game Design Research Approach was used to design a serious game based on the combination of the PMT and MINDSPACE frameworks. The game design focuses on creating awareness on phishing signals in the players by using the elements of the PMT framework, that is, threat appraisal (making the players aware of the severity of and vulnerability to a threat) and coping appraisal (coping responses available to the player to deal with the threat). The influencers of the MINDSPACE framework are used in the design of the game to act as catalysts to improve threat appraisal and coping appraisal. The designed game, Phish Phishy, is a tabletop card game with four different sets of cards and is played in two rounds. Two gameplay sessions were conducted in two large academic hospitals in The Netherlands. Based on the game design, the results from the game survey suggested an increase in the awareness levels, that is, improved understanding of phishing signals (threat appraisal) and improved response to threat by reporting them (coping appraisal). Therefore, the PMT and MINDSPACE framework combination suggested by Briggs (2017) was explored for the first time through the serious game, Phish Phishy, to make hospital staff aware of phishing signals in the work environment and report them. The imitations of this research are that the gameplay was conducted only in two hospitals so the sample size is too small for generalisability. Future research should focus on conducting more gameplay sessions by replicating the samples to consider the potential of making the PMT and MINDSPACE frameworks as the industry standard for creating cybersecurity awareness interventions.","Phishing; Cybersecurity; Serious Games; Hospitals; Social Engineering; Ransomware","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The controller extends the conven- tional capabilities of INDI by including actuator dynamics in the inversion law and introducing a state dependent compensation term to reduce the effort of the error controller. A complementary filter is employed to reduce the degrading effect introduced by the filtering-induced delay in the feedback loop. Both simulated and real flight tests are conducted on a quadrotor configuration with artificially slowed down actuators and a drag plate mounted on top, to better observe the effect of actuator dynamics and state dependent dynamics in trajectory tracking accuracy. Simulations show that the combination of the two additional features increases tracking accuracy both in the short and long term response. It is also found that an overestimation of the state compensation term leads to instability, which makes the strategy not robust to model mismatch. Real flight tests, involving the tracking of a series of doublets on the pitch attitude and a lemniscate of Bernoulli, show that, as the complexity of the maneuver increases, the less the state compensation term effectively contributes to an improved tracking when the model is incomplete. On the other hand, trajectory tracking accuracy due to the consideration of actuator dynamics shows consistency and improvement respect to conventional INDI solutions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AE5310: Thesis C&S (2021/22)",""

Organisations acknowledge the need to innovate in order to keep up with the competition. When robots were first introduced, they took over human tasks if they could execute the task faster than humans. However, this often has a negative effect on the meaningfulness of work. That’s why cobots were introduced, robots that could work together with humans in the same workplace. This provided the industry with many new opportunities. However, as with any new technology, research has to be done to find out how this technology can best be implemented. That’s why FRAIM was founded. They are researching how cobots can be introduced without decreasing the meaningfulness of humans’ work. FRAIM decided to join the Brightsky project, to take their research into practice. However, with the Brightsky project, FRAIM is facing other challenges. Not only does the technical feasibility have to be researched, but also the employees’ needs and other stakeholder values have to be taken into account. A challenge that can be perfectly tackled with a human-centered design approach.<br/><br/>Firstly, through interviewing and stakeholder mapping, the essential stakeholders are identified. These stakeholders have high power or/and high interest in the company and thus contribute to the future of the organisation. Afterwards, the stakeholders are brought together for a co-creation session. In this session, the stakeholders discuss their individual needs and values to identify the contradictions and similarities. Next, a shared vision is created, representing the stakeholders’ view on ‘optimising’ the workflow. <br/>A stakeholder which is often negatively affected by the implementation of robots, is the employee, their needs are often neglected. That’s why this project’s focus is mostly on this stakeholder. During context mapping sessions, the themes of meaningful work are identified. These themes represent the conditions of meaningful work for the employees at KLM Engines.<br/><br/>During the research phase, it became clear that the stakeholders are unaware of the contradictions and similarities of their values. Furthermore, the knowledge and skills needed to understand the possibilities and limitations of implementing robots and their consequences on the stakeholders are lacking. <br/>In the design phase, a co-design is created to tackle this challenge. Co-design is chosen, because it is well-known to be used for bringing together different expertise and for sharing knowledge and skills. Besides, the concept of game design is used. Game design helps to represent a real-life situation in a fun and engaging way and helps the participants to explore different scenarios. Using game design helps to visualise the consequences of robots on the workflow well.<br/><br/>The co-design is tested and evaluated to assess if the co-design meets the design requirements and to discover how the tool can be improved. A final iteration is done to improve the concept.<br/><br/>Lastly, the project is concluded and reflected on. The limitations of the project are discussed and future research and design recommendations are proposed.<br","Co-design; Robotisation; Human-Centered Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Verma, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis demonstrates that there is a need for improving the working conditions of gig workers. It establishes a need for an increase in empathy from consumers towards delivery riders. Delivery riders often make use of E-bikes which provide an excellent foundation for data collection. The main research question is stated as follows:<br/><br/>How can empathy towards delivery riders be increased through communicating behavioural data to the consumer?<br/><br/>After establishing background and related work through desktop research, an exploration into the implementation of multiple sensors was initiated. This led to the insight that communicating heart rate data is the most promising dataflow to evoke empathy. The effect of communicating live heart rate data, next to static personalised information was empirically tested. After which all insights were synthesized into 5 design drivers which provided input for a brief design cycle. The final output is a demonstration, including a prototype, of a proof of principle that evokes empathy through communicating live heart rate data.<br/><br/>The most important insight substantiated in this thesis is the positive correlation that communicating live heart rate data has to the experienced empathy from end-consumers towards delivery riders. This led to the final proof of principle that revolves around a way to implement this into the delivery service context.<br/><br/>The conclusion of this study is that there is a strong indication that showing live heart rate data to consumers increases the experienced empathy. This could be implemented in various ways and provides a foundation for future work. More research is needed to establish the exact origin for the increase in empathy. This study is limited to exploring one way of communicating live heart rate data so more research is needed on different possibilities regarding visualization, communication and information versus the effect on experienced empathy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Two notable branches that revolutionized the approach toward reducing the CO2 in the atmosphere are Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture Utilization (CCU). CCS has its shortcomings in the long run, a study from MIT shows that the united states have an adequate land area to store CO2 for 100 years [64]. The important question is, what about after 100 years? The need for efficient methods to utilize the stored or captured CO2 is a reasonable solution; therefore successful development of efficient methods in utilizing CO2 is the need for the hour. This work comprises of using reverse water gas shift that utilizes CO2 as raw material and H2 produced via electrolysis using renewable electricity from wind or solar energy to produce syngas replacing gasification of coal or natural gas that produces CO2. Syngas is a major raw material for producing useful chemicals such as methanol, dimethyl ether, acetic acid, hydrocarbons and other valuable chemicals. <br/><br/>On this wide field of syngas production technology, this work aims in determining the optimal operating condition of the reverse water gas shift reactor to produce hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon heavier than C5+ are used to produce liquid fuels, reverse water gas shift reaction followed by Fischer Tropsch (FT) synthesis is utilized to achieve liquid fuels. FT synthesis requires a particular composition of syngas for effective operation and high selectivity. The challenges faced are side reactions such as Boudouard and CO hydrogenation that produces carbon and methane in the reactor that are undesired. Carbon deactivates the catalyst and carburization causes ineffective conversion of CO2 resulting in high operational costs. Methane is hazardous side product that needs to be minimized in the outlet stream of the reverse water gas shift reactor before feeding the same stream into the Fischer Tropsch reactor. <br/><br/>Less to no literatures are available on reverse water gas shift with respect to carbon formation and methanation. The above mentioned objective is countered by modelling a plug flow tubular reactor. A nickel on calcium alumina catalyst is used in the reactor. The model is used to determine the operating conditions for the reverse water gas shift reactor to minimize carbon formation and methanation in the reactor. The parameters such as inlet conditions, pressure, inlet temperature, heat input to the reactor are all determined for a desired syngas composition, with no carbon formation inside the reactor and minimum methane in the reverse water gas shift reactor outlet.","RWGS; Syngas; carbon capture and utilization; Synthetic Fuels; Parameter estimation; carbon formation; methanation; Hydrocarbon Production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It differs from many other visions as technology is not used as the basis for development, but behavioural change. The starting point is chosen as the upcoming Digital Nomad culture: Working from anywhere in the world. The thesis is done in cooperation with Contest Yachts, a sailing yacht builder from the Netherlands. <br/> <br/>The analysis is done in two parts, which meet at the conclusion of the chapter. It consists of a brand analysis and a future use study. <br/><br/>Contest as a brand has three important values to cherish in the future to remain true to their current brand identity. These values are safety, quality and comfort and innovation. There is also a foreseen change, to make their current semi-custom approach more manageable in the future. <br/><br/>With the use of the ViP-method, future behaviour is predicted and separated in four different quadrants, each characterised by multiple habits. From these four, one is chosen to design for: The Trusting Tribe. With a strong focus on community and an inherent drive to be in nature, these people are interesting for Contest to build a new model around. The following vision is formulated: “We want people to uninterruptedly explore themselves and the planet through an open and flexible yacht.” <br/> <br/>The starting point for the ideation is shared ownership in combination with the tribe analogy. As the model of sharing is getting increased attention in the yachting business, also noticed by Contest. Within this system, it is important that the sailor still has a feeling of responsibility. The result is the Florence CS. She is a combination of a lease service in combination with ownership. The yacht exists of a fully functional interior and two empty private modules with their own heads. The shared space holds a galley, lounge area and workstation. <br/><br/>Future Tribe members can lease a yacht on one of the seven Contest harbours (Seen in step 1.) with friends, family or strangers. The local Contest crew fits the interior and prepares the yacht for departure (step 2). Contest provides a full and careless sailing experience to their future members (step 3). After the trip, the Contest crew removes the interiors and store them in local warehouses (step 4). The ship is checked, serviced and prepared for the next group of nomads to use. <br/> <br/>The final proposal disrupts the current yachting market. It introduces a new business model for Contest in the shape of a lease service. Also, it includes shared ownership. <br/><br/>For future developments and innovations, it is up to Contest to make further work of this. Possible next steps are: redoing this project with another graduate student; developing it into a case study and share it with more experts and enthusiasts; organising a creative day for employees and let them share their thoughts and expertise. <br/><br/>As innovation is embedded in Contest, the above-named options should be within reach. Outcomes of these options can help to make Contest future-proof as well as to make the brand the booster the yachting world.","Digital Nomad; Yachting; Shared Ownership; Future Vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Because quantification is necessary for spits in such complex environments, sedimentation was quantified around both spits using polar coordinates and morphologically simplified elevation levels around the spit-platform. It was found that, sediment rich currents that pass over the spit-platform boundary at a certain direction drive spit-platform growth in that direction. The spit-platform growth in turn dictates the growth of the emerged spit. Spit growth quantification enables a detailed understanding of the Marker Wadden spits, which gives insights in spit behaviour in low-energy lake environments.

The thawing of permafrost causes the release of greenhouse gases accelerating Arctic warming. Monitoring and quantifying spatial and temporal changes of the active layer are challenging but crucial for reliable climate projections. Geophysical methods offer a non-invasive investigation of electrical properties and their distribution in permafrost areas, revealing phase transitions from water to ice. Subsurface electrical resistivity images can be obtained through inversion of electromagnetic data, yet are inherently ambiguous because of the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. Since regularization methods offer the possibility to stabilize the inversion, lateral and spatial constraints are incorporated in the inversion algorithm to produce quasi-2D and quasi-3D subsurface models. The developed methodology is evaluated based on synthetic data sets to determine suitable inversion parameters, which are subsequently applied to a field example from the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Laterally constrained inversion methods based on a few-layer starting model succeed in resolving sharp interfaces in quasi-layered environments. In more complex settings minimum-structure models can retrieve accurate subsurface representations leveraging on vertical and horizontal smoothness constraints. Enforcing lateral and spatial consistency between neighboring soundings thereby yields a similar degree of model smoothness. The inverted field data confirms the conclusions drawn from the synthetic study, as meaningful three-layered models with regard to electrical resistivities are recovered, indicating resistive snow overlying the conductive active layer and highly resistive permafrost. However, the inversion results imply that the snow layer has a significant effect on the predicted model. The implemented constraints help in reducing the ambiguity of the models, but uncertainties introduced by limited data availability cannot be overcome. The potential of adopting spatial and lateral constraints to the inversion is shown, although it becomes evident that additional a priori information needs to be integrated in the objective function in order to comprehensively image the active layer.","Geophysics; Permafrost; Electromagnetic induction; Inverse Modelling; Regularization methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

Focusing on accelerating the research and development of photovoltaic technologies is an important step towards energy transition. The thin-film silicon solar modules has shown a great potential and a high market prospect. It is flexible, light-weight and also has a low manufacturing and installation cost. It is used for solar pumps and building integration. However, the highest initial conversion efficiency for a micromorph is 14.8%. Thus, we focus on further optimizing the multi-junction solar cells to reach higher efficiency by focusing on the improving the p-layer, texturing and silicon oxide intermediate reflector(SOIR). Further, standardized and error-free external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was done to obtain reliable Jsc values. <br/><br/>This work introduces deposition of single, micromorph and triple-junction thin-film solar cells on glass and wafers. The experiments were designed to study the effects of varying the material, thickness of the p-layer and n-SiOx reflective layer and textures of the solar cells. The Jsc from the EQE, Voc, FF and efficiency were the main parameters used to analyze the results. <br/><br/>The Jsc from the EQE measurement was not reliable as the EQE had an artifact while measuring micromorph devices. It was solved by increasing the bias light intensity and decreasing probe light intensity. The forward voltage bias was also found to be important for a cell with low shunt resistance and to measure the target cell in short circuit condition. The standard bias lights to be used are 1-3 to bias the top cell and 7-8 to bias the bottom cell combined with 50% reduction in the probe light intensity.<br/><br/>After correcting the EQE, the optimization of the top cell p-layer was performed on a-Si single junction solar cells on Asahi substrates. It was found that both the contact layer and the window layer of the p-layer have a high influence on the performance of the solar cell. A maximum conversion efficiency of 10% and Voc of 910mV were achieved for the a-Si single junction solar cells. Further, it was also found that there is more than one way to reach high efficiency with an optimal p layer by changing the material composition and thickness of both the contact and window layer. Additionally, p-SiOx contact layer resulted in good performing solar cells for larger range of F_B2H6 of the window layer than p-nc-Si contact layer and the insertion of the buffer layer in the i/p interface showed no significant improvement in the performance of the solar cell.<br/><br/> Furthermore, comparison of the performance of textures of different feature sizes was done on solar cells in p-i-n and n-i-p architecture. It was found that the best optoelectronic performance was obtained from asahi and smooth pyramidal textured solar cell in p-i-n and n-i-p configuration respectively in both double and triple junction solar cell. Further, the honeycomb textured substrate with R_rms around 270nm is not suitable to deposit on double and triple junction solar cell as it resulted in shunted cells. <br/><br/>Finally, the SOIR can be used in a-Si/nc-Si/nc-Si triple junction solar cell to divide current within middle and bottom junctions. The reflection of light in the infrared region increases with the thickness of the SOIR layer. A thick 90nm n-SiOx layer with F_B2H6=3.2sccm gives the best electrical performance and current distribution property for a micromorph.","Thin-film silicon solar cells; Texture; p-layer; intermediate reflector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The quest for performance has led to existing multiprocessor platforms often featuring complex interconnected hardware components and multiple levels of cache. This brings negative interference to the execution of tasks and challenges the predictability of real-time systems. However, existing non-preemptive execution models are an effective solution to eliminate these negative effects. In addition to this, the tasks that modern real-time systems process are becoming increasingly complex. Traditional sequential task models cannot cope with this situation and a stronger expressive model is required. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) that can express the complexity and parallelism of these tasks is a suitable model.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we focus on priority-based scheduling algorithms for multiple parallel DAG tasks on non-preemptive multiprocessor platforms, investigating, analysing, and improving existing global and partitioned scheduling algorithms.<br/><br/>We propose the concept of stacks to simulate a multi-processor platform and apply release-time tuning techniques based on its simulation of a task set in a hyperperiod. This allows us to impose tighter constraints on the execution of each job released from a task set in a fine-grained manner. We improved the existing priority-based global scheduling algorithm through the release-time tuning technique mentioned above. We also tried to construct a partitioned scheduling algorithm using the simulation results of stacks, i.e. so that all jobs are restricted to run on only one processor, consistent with the simulation results. Furthermore, to compare different scheduling algorithms more efficiently and to facilitate future researchers, we have developed the evaluation framework, a customisable experimental platform that includes DAG generation, application of scheduling algorithms, generation and analysis of the test results, allowing users to specify their experiments according to their goals.<br/><br/>Experiments with randomly generated workloads show that our improved algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art priority-based scheduling algorithm for different task graph structures and parameter configurations.","DAG scheduling; real-time; recurrent tasks; multiprocessor; priority assignment; release-time tuning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Being a flexible structure, the geometry of a soft kite depends on its aerodynamic loading and vice versa, which forms a complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem.<br/>Currently, kite design is usually done on an experimental basis since no model meets the requirements of being both accurate and fast.<br/><br/>In this project, an FSI methodology is developed to study the steady-state aerodynamic performance of leading-edge inflatable (LEI) kites by coupling two fast and simple models. <br/><br/>On the structural part, the deformations are calculated with a particle system model, based on the assumption that the shape of the kite can be modelled using a wireframe wing model represented by the bridle line attachment points, whose coordinate changes are modelled using a bridle<br/>line system model and canopy billowing relations.<br/><br/>On the aerodynamic side, the load distribution is calculated with a 3D nonlinear vortex step method, coupled with 2D polars obtained with a correlation model derived from Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) analysis, to account for viscous effects and flow separation. Furthermore, with the 2D correlation model it is possible to consider changes in the thickness and the camber of each section. Based on 2D thin airfoil theory, the three-quarter chord point is used to determine the magnitude of the forces, and the one-quarter chord point is used to determine the direction of these forces. <br/>Moreover, the model developed for LEI kites can consider canopy billowing and variations in kite and airfoil geometry while proving robust and inexpensive.<br/>This model has been validated with several geometries and a RANS analysis of the LEI kite, showing great accuracy for pre-stall angles of attack. <br/><br/>The coupling of these two models results in a fast aeroelastic model of LEI kites capable of predicting the steady-state deformations and aerodynamic forces on the kite for the range of actuation settings and inflow conditions expected during a normal pumping cycle. Furthermore, the results show that the deformations follow the same trends as the results from the photogrammetry analysis and that, by taking into account the deformations that the kite undergoes, the aerodynamic forces more closely resemble experimental data.","soft kite; LEI kite; aeroelasticity; vortex step method; VSM; particle system model; PSM; airborne wind energy; AWE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Techniques like auditory pacing help the athletes to have better control over their step frequency. Nevertheless, synchronizing to a continuous external rhythm costs energy. For this reason, the use of intermittent pacing may be more energy-efficient and more user-friendly for the athlete. We propose using experimental data from previous studies, that analyzed the response of runners to intermittent pacing, to find the most efficient approach for providing the pacing. For this purpose we use reinforcement learning techniques to learn and train our target behavior. This behavior is represented as the target policy and the experimental data is assumed to be sampled using a stochastic sampling policy. However, using only a single batch of initial training data presents a problem due to the continuously increasing difference between the initial sampling policy and the target policy being learned. The use of a batch off-policy algorithm with a standard deviation correction (OPPOSD) presented in (Liu et al., 2019) is then proposed. This algorithm benefits from the advantages of the sampling efficiency characteristic of the off-policy approaches and also introduces a fixing term to tackle the mismatch between the policies. To train and evaluate the learned policies based on the algorithm, a pace behavior simulator was developed from the data of the experiments. A Markov Decision Problem (MDP) was defined on top of the simulator that determines the rules of the pacing environment that the algorithm is set to learn. After translating the experimental data into MDP-like transitions, the OPPOSD algorithm is able to learn a relatively good target policy for the pacing problem. For a future application, the resulting trained model could be deployed for real runners while still having a continuous improvement of the policy in an on-policy or off-policy approach.","Reinforcement Learning; pace regulator; runners","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability of the simulator to recreate the in-vehicle experience for the occupant is established through motion cueing algorithms. Such algorithms have consistently been developed with model predictive control (MPC) acting as the main control technique. Currently available MPC based methods either compute the optimal controller online or derive an explicit control law in an offline setting. These approaches limit the applicability of MPC for real-time applications due to online computational expense and offline memory storage issues.<br/><br/>This thesis report presents a solution to deal with issues of offline and online solving through a combined/hybrid approach. For this, explicit MPC is used to provide an initial guess as warm start for the implicit MPC based motion cueing algorithm. From the simulations, it was observed that the presented hybrid approach was able to reduce online computational load by shifting it offline using the explicit MPC. Further, braking constraints and adaptive washout weights were implemented in the hybrid motion cueing algorithm, to improve the specific force tracking performance and reduce any false cue occurrences. Finally, emulator studies were performed to realize driving simulator performance with the hybrid MPC approach.

Traditional taxi services have to compete with the emergence of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Rapid developments in available algorithms and real-time inter-connectivity of travellers and vehicles offer mobility-on-demand (MOD) services new possibilities to maximise the efficiency of the ride-hailing process. It is well established that rebalancing can enable the true potential of a ride-hailing fleet. In this context, rebalancing is defined as the redistribution of idle vehicles over the service area of a ride-hailing operator. In the search for the optimal rebalancing strategy, model predictive control (MPC) and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methodologies are active fields of research. However, the computational burden of MPC limits the length of the predictive horizon in large MOD applications. This thesis proposes a novel algorithm that combines ADP and MPC. More specifically, we integrated a value function into the MPC framework as a terminal cost. We shorten the horizon of MPC and propose to use the value function as a long-term planner. For the terminal cost, we continue research into piece-wise linear value function approximation. We implement a novel multi-period approximation of the value function, where we use the maximum repositioning length as the horizon. In our case study, the value-based repositioning strategy offers comparable service quality to conventional MPC at 5.2% of the computational burden. The hybrid ADP-MPC algorithm offers flexible horizon partitions between the multi-period value function and MPC. It addresses the shortcomings of both ADP and MPC algorithms in repositioning problems. At peak performance, it offers an increase of 4.5% in service rate and a decrease of 5.2% in the average waiting time over conventional MPC, at roughly half the computational burden.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the human body calcium is the most abundant mineral and is involved in a lot of vital processes. Calcium deficiency occurs when there is not enough calcium present in the bloodstream. In the Netherlands one in three women will face this problem in their lifetime. A major factor contributing to this problem is that the intake of calcium on average is below the recommended amount which is around 950 mg/day for adults in the Netherlands. Calcium deficiency when left unattended can lead to osteoporosis. Therefore it is important to consume enough calcium rich products or take calcium supplements. Milk is a good source of calcium and is considered a staple food. This makes bovine milk a good candidate for calcium fortification. Milk can be fortified by using calcium salts to increase the bioavailability the calcium present. In this thesis in vitro methods were used to study the effects of calcium salt fortification on the phase distribution of calcium in bovine skimmed milk under different pH conditions and by using the radioactive isotope 45Ca to track the exchange between the phase casein micelles, serum proteins and the soluble phase when fortifying the milk. For unfortified milk it was found that 36.0±0.9% was present in the soluble phase, 3.7±2.9% was present in the serum proteins phase and 60.3±3.0% in the casein micelles. Acidifying the milk to simulate the gastric environment resulted in an increase of the soluble phase from 55.1±2.7% to 97.0±3.3% which corresponds to a decrease in pH from pH 6 to pH 2. For the fortification of the milk, five calcium salts were selected for synthesis. The salts were calcium carbonate, tricalcium di-citrate, calcium gluconate, calcium lactate and tri-calcium phosphate. The fortification was performed with all of the synthesized salts except calcium lactate and tri-calcium phosphate. The starting material for the syntheses, calcium chloride, was also used for fortification. It was found that for the fortification of CaCO3 under gastric conditions a bioavailability of 100% could be achieved. However the acidic environment also resulted in coagulation of the milk and therefore the bioavailability could not be accurately assessed. Calcium gluconate had the only increase in bioavailability under normal conditions. In conclusion a better understanding of fortification with calcium salts was achieved and the influence of pH on the bioavailability of calcium in milk and the effects on the salt fortification.","Bioavailability; calcium; skimmed milk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Therefore, this paper aims to design and test a novel coagulation heat measurement system that attempts to infer direct retinal tissue temperature using contactless thermal measurements. Methods: In four experiment conditions, the direct temperature on the lower surface of the tissue is measured from below with a thermography camera measuring the temperature through a semi-transparent window that holds the tissue, and contactless measurements are made with a multi-sensor containing vertically aligned micro sensors located in the fluid medium above the sample. Results: The lowest mean temperature increase at both the thermography measurements (1.52°C) and sensor measurements (0.08°C), is found in the condition of 2.2 J (2.2 W and 1”). At thermography, the highest mean increase (8.67°C) resulted from the condition of 4 J (4 W and 1”) and positive. At the sensor, the highest mean increase (0.25°C) is found in the condition of 4 J (2 W and 2”). Discussion: The use of 2.2 J appears too low for proper sensor measurement. For the two conditions of 4 J there is a contradictory indication of the influence of application time in thermography measurements versus sensor measurements, as the sensor is expected to be more sensitive to changes in the application time than the thermal camera. Conclusion: Since no similar trends have been observed between the thermography and multi-sensor measurements, the contactless sensor cannot infer the direct tissue temperature.","Coagulation; Diathermy; Electrosurgery; Intraocular; Retina; Temperature; Thermography","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dkBRU9FveNv1F7TVFaKrp6fi3u9HSK7m?usp=sharing Downloadlink of Matlab scripts and supplementary pdf's","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This has become even more relevant now, as the energy transition is taking off and the energy prices are soaring. Given the inequality in the energy consumption and energy affordability, it is therefore critical to know which factors are impacting these phenomena, and how they are impacting these phenomena. The housing-related factors are the least understood factors impacting the energy consumption and energy affordability, even though these factors are key pillars of energy policy. Thus, this research assesses how housing-related factors impact the residential energy consumption and energy affordability in the Netherlands. For this assessment, multiple data sources are combined over the years 2016 to 2018, covering a total of more than 8 million Dutch households. A regression analysis is performed on a postal code 6 level using the housing-related factors as predictors, while controlling for socio-demographic and weather factors. This revealed that the housing-related factors impacting energy consumption and energy affordability are relatively similar. This study finds that the WOZ-value is a strong predictor for both phenomena as houses with a higher WOZ-value have a lower energy efficiency. Furthermore, it shows that rental households consume less energy but spend a similar percentage of their income on energy, and that the impact of the year of construction on both phenomena has increased significantly, when compared to earlier studies. Based on this, it is concluded that rental houses and houses with an older year of construction deserve more attention in Dutch energy policy. Furthermore, low-income households should be targeted in short-term energy policy, as this study shows that the current soaring energy prices have a severe impact on the energy affordability in the Netherlands. Insights are however broader, and can be pivotal in energy demand and energy affordability projections, both in the Netherlands and the rest of Western Europe.","Residential energy consumption; Residential energy affordability; Housing-related factors; households; The Netherlands; Energy efficiency; Energy poverty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This includes lakes, fluvial drainage networks, clouds and has evidence for precipitation of methane rain. Here we explore the impact of rainfall on Titan based on an analogue laboratory approach. While the composition and structure of the Titan atmosphere and its cloud systems has been studied by the Cassini-Huygens missions, the chemical composition of rain drops remains undetermined. Recent studies have put forward the possibility of soluble nitrogen within rain drops that were earlier assumed to be purely made of methane. Based on simulations, we find a 77% - 23% distribution of methane and nitrogen. The ratio was used to develop a suitable laboratory analogue approach to study splash erosion by rain drop impacts. Using this analogue approach that involved impacting individual drops on soil sample analogues and custom-built numerical models, we find that that rain drops on Titan can redistribute soil particles at larger distances (30 - 600 mm) than Earth due to different energy transmission percentages from drop to splashed matter (15% - 50% of the drop, in comparison to water). Assuming a particle launch angle of 45◦, soil particles can reach heights of ∼10-70 mm, meaning soil splashing can create visible phenomena and proof for recent rainfall events. Such observables of Titanic rainfall can be used for more detailed surface studies by future missions, such as NASA’s Dragonfly drone.","Titan; Rain; Erosion; Methane; Kinetic energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To localize technology afterward, international technology transfers (ITTs) are often carried out. Human Resource Management (HRM) practices can help the technology transfer process achieve better performance. However, human resource interactions within organizations are complex, and a generic definition of HRM can lead to inconclusive results. How human resource activities are implemented in organizations and how they function in ITT have to be emphasized and realized in detail. <br/>Utilizing a case study of ITT between a Chinese company and an acquired Dutch medical company, this thesis analyzes the role of three HRM practices: staffing, performance-related rewards, and training in ITT. Thus, bringing clarity on how more specific features within HRM can be utilized to improve an ITT performance. The case study also defines criteria for the ITT process and establishes the difficulties in an ITT process and the implementation of HRM practices. Then it analyzes the role of HRM practices in ITT. <br/>Based on the contingency theorists, the assessment clearly addressed the use of HRM practices aligned with the business strategies. The research agrees that it is crucial to acknowledge the situation of the business context, which requires consideration of industry, organizational structure, resources, etc. Interviews are used to collect data. The details of implementing the HRM practices within the organizations are also introduced. The criteria for the ITT are defined. The connections between HRM practices and the performance of ITT are built. Then models are proposed for the effects of training, performance-related rewards, and staffing on successful ITT. The models are disassembled into details. <br/>In the studied case, the use of the HRM practices can benefit ITT performance by benefiting collaboration and communication between two organizations, transfer of tacit knowledge, and technology integration with local industries. The influence of training is the most recognized among the three HRM practices. Hard skills training is considerably more efficient than soft skills training with acquiring tacit knowledge. Recruiting and training can also help organizations gain abilities outside the organizations. Internal mobility helps transfer tacit knowledge and experience from the technology-giving side. The influence of rewards is relatively small. In the organizations studied, intrinsic rewards influence more the motivations of employees than extrinsic rewards. Cultural and organizational factors can significantly affect the implementation of HRM practices and the influence HRM practices had on ITT.<br","HRM practices; ITT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delgado Medina, Fátima (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","During the XXth century, technological breakthroughs in genetics, machinery, and improved inputs led to dramatic increases in crop yields (Pingali, 2012). This agricultural revolution was a remarkable success in food production, tripling yields while increasing the area devoted to production by only 30% (Pingali, 2012). This increase in crop yields was necessary to avoid famine, as the world population more than doubled during this period (Pingali, 2012).Unfortunately, this form of industrial agriculture, which relies on crop uniformity, heavy machinery and the intensive use of agrochemicals, leads to the loss of soil fertility, and an acceleration in soil degradation (Gomiero et al., 2011). The current system is reaching its limits, with yields either stagnating or growing much slower than needed to meet the projected demand (Hawkesford et al., 2013). In response to this looming crisis, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture aims to convert the Netherlands to circular agriculture by 2030. This shift requires the need to develop new ways of farming (Ministry of Agriculture &amp; food quality, 2020). Strip cropping is proposed by researchers at Wageningen University and farmers as a potential solution. Strip cropping is a form of agriculture, which is less reliant on agrochemical inputs and promotes biodiversity by planting narrow rows (or strips) of different crops next to each other (Zhang, 2019). Researchers at Wageningen University and farmers in the Noordoostpolder want to investigate the future economic performance of this new type of agriculture compared to traditional intensive farming. This problem is formulated in the following research question: What are the economic opportunities and risks associated to the implementation of strip cropping in the Netherlands? This research is relevant to the MSc Engineering and Policy Analysis as it can guide decisions related to horticulture. Given that agriculture is a complex socio-technical system and food security is a global challenge, this topic is an adequate fit for an EPA master thesis. The EPA master promotes the use of mathematical modeling to gain insight into societal challenges within a context of high uncertainty. The problem at hand is to determine the future economic performance of alternative farming methods, namely strip cropping, through a mathematical model with currently available information. The resulting document should enable farmers and policymakers to make informed economic decisions about the adoption of strip cropping. The detected knowledge gap relates to a lack of understanding of the economics of the strip cropping farming method. Through a study of the literature, the ecological benefits and drawbacks of strip-cropping and monocropping are examined. By gathering information from agricultural specialists, the financial impact of strip cropping is examined. A mathematical model is then used to process and analyze this data. Microsoft Excel is the program of choice because farmers and researchers are familiar with it and it would enable farmers to input their unique parameters and simulate their future financial returns for both monocropping and strip-cropping configurations. Initially, the information provided by the farmers is used to identify the pertinent financial variables. Revenue and Costs are the two groups into which these variables are divided. Yields, price per kilogram, and byproducts are all factors that affect revenue. Seeds, fertilization, crop protection, fuel price, fuel usage, labor cost, labor hours, and miscellaneous costs are variables in the Costs category. More specifically, a Monte Carlo analysis was chosen for the simulation since it has been shown to be effective for assessing the adaptability of various cropping systems to climatic uncertainty (Cary &amp; Frey, 2020). This entails assigning probability distributions to the variables affected by high levels of uncertainty and executing an experiment several times to determine how the investigated farming systems would behave in various scenarios...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This phenomenon occurs in almost all branches of science, engineering, and social life. Synchronisation is a well understood concept in classical mechanics. Quantum synchronisation involves attempting to extend this concept to quantum mechanics, where there are number of phenomena such as damping that are more difficult to realise. This thesis focuses on two things. Firstly, it explores the bridge between classical and quantum synchronisation. Both the equivalencies as well as the difficulties that must be overcome. This is initially done by looking at a simple classical model for two coupled oscillators and extending this to a quantum model, and subsequently by exploring the derivation of a master equation for a damped quantum harmonic oscillator with non-linear damping. Secondly, it explore the synchronisation of four coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. To this purpose, the six different systems (tree, chain, loop, tower, spade, all-to-all) with four coupled classical van der Pol oscillators first analysed and the Arnold tongues are determined, showing for what parameters synchronisation is expected to occur. The equivalent systems with four quantum van der Pol oscillators are explored to determine whether the classical Arnold tongues give a good indication of when quantum synchronisation is expected to occur. An alternative measure for synchronisation is also investigated for these systems based on the relative entropy of coherence. The Arnold tongues for each of the four classical oscillator systems were determined. For some systems (chain and loop) the Arnold tongues were much smaller than for the three oscillator system while for others (tree, all-to-all) they were only slightly smaller. The quantum Arnold tongues showed very similar behaviour to the classical Arnold tongues. Furthermore, when investigating the correlations between different pairs of oscillators, it was found that the correlation decreased as the number of connections separating two oscillators increased. In the chain system, an expected symmetry was found. The relative entropy of coherence is found to be a good measure of synchronisation, better than the more frequently used complex correlator. This is because the relative entropy can take into account the entire system, while the correlator describes the synchronisation between two individual oscillators in the system. <br","Quantum; van der pol; synchronisation; Lindblad; Oscillators; Entropy; Arnold tongue","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

We find that delay scheduling and priority scheduling are representations that allow variation operators of an EA to modify schedules. To evaluate the performance of the representations and fitness functions, we create a custom bug benchmark for RCA. An empirical comparison on the benchmark shows that delay scheduling with time fitness results in a significantly higher success rate than random search on one bug. Finally, we discover an in-production liveness bug in RCA.","Distributed Systems; Software Testing; Distributed Concurrency; Ripple; Search-Based Software Testing; Evolutionary Algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The survey included several scenarios corresponding to the behaviour of math teachers to which the students could indicate their level of stress. Results show that students indicated to feel significantly higher levels of stress in a scenario where a teacher shows her belief in the growth mindset by forcing a student to try an exercise again after failing once, in comparison with a teacher who shows her belief in the fixed mindset by stating that some students remain to have difficulties with math. In addition, the students indicated to feel significantly lower levels of stress when the teacher writes down the correct answer in their book immediately. The effect sizes of these differences are small and moderate, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that students indicated to feel significantly lower levels of stress, with moderate effect sizes, when a teacher evaluates their work by writing down hints, instead of drawing lines through their mistakes or grading their work in a formative manner. Another important finding of this study was the significantly higher levels of stress students indicated in a scenario where the teacher shows her belief in the fixed mindset by concluding after a few mistakes that a student finds mathematics difficult in general, in comparison with a teacher showing her belief in the growth mindset by emphasizing the learning goal. In conclusion, this study suggests that students might not be experienced in handling exercises alone and feel higher levels of stress when they are forced to do so, even though the teacher shows her belief in the growth mindset.","Math anxiety; High school; Growth mindset; Mathematics teaching anxiety; Performance goal; Learning goal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Education and Communication","",""

As the distance between exoplanet and observer is enormous, exoplanets will only make up a pixel on our image. However, the observed intensity of this pixel will fluctuate over time as the exoplanet rotates about its axis and orbits around its parent star. These fluctuations in the reflected light contain information about the planet’s surface. Previous researchers have developed a retrieval method known as spin-orbit tomography which uses these intensity fluctuations to construct a surface map of the exoplanet assuming fully diffuse reflection as a model for the reflection of starlight. In this thesis, we aim to build on this method by introducing two new reflection models, namely Fresnel and Lommel-Seeliger reflection, and by using this composite reflection model for the starlight we attempt to reconstruct the surfaces of exoplanets based on their observed light curve. We will derive an analytical expression for the observed intensity of the light reflected off an exoplanet. Next, we will simulate intensity observations along the orbit of an exoplanet with a pseudo-randomly generated surface containing terrain types found on Earth.<br/>As we assign a measure of reflectance for each reflection model, we will construct three distinct reflectance maps for one planet, nd simulate the observed light curve by linearly transforming these maps. Afterward, we attempt to retrieve the reflectance maps from the observed signal by inverting the transformation.<br/>We show that the retrieval of all three maps is successful if the light curve is observed without noise, even when the number of samples is low. If artificial shot noise is imposed on our signal, we are still able to retrieve glossy reflectance maps for Lambertian and Lommel-Seeliger reflection by truncating the transformation matrix. Lastly, we show that even if the original light signal originates from an exoplanet that only reflects according to the Lambertian model, then the composite reflection model still retrieves the Lambertian map accurately. On the other hand, if the original light curve is simulated by the composite reflection model, then the Lambertian method does not retrieve an accurate surface map.","Exo-cartography; Exocartography; Spin-Orbit tomography; Exoplanets; exoplanets; Lambertian; Fresnel; Lommel-Seeliger; Light curve; tetrahedral subdivision","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

One way to achieve this is via high voltage photovoltaic (PV) devices which can directly drive electrolysis reactions to produce hydrogen or other chemical fuels. Group IV based multijunction (MJ) PV devices are a candidate to function as these high voltage devices.<br/>This work is focused on improving the efficiency of crystalline silicon/nanocrystalline silicon/amorphous silicon (c-Si/nc-Si/a-Si) triple junction (3J) solar cells through better current matching. On top of that, the low bandgap material germanium tin (GeSn:H) is characterized as it shows potential for use as bottom junction in multijunction photovoltaic devices.<br/><br/>Several methods were tried to improve current matching in the 3J PV devices. Varying the nc-Si middle absorber thickness was successful at improving the shortcircuit current density (J &#x1d460;&#x1d450; ) in the middle junction, which was the current limiting junction. A range between 35μm ncSi absorber thickness is effective at keeping the middle junction J&#x1d460;&#x1d450; high while keeping opencircuit voltage (V&#x1d45c;&#x1d450; ) and fill factor (FF) losses at an acceptable level. Varying the n-type nanocrystalline silicon oxide (n-nc-SiO&#x1d465;) intermediate reflective layer (IRL) thickness was also effective at improving the J&#x1d460;&#x1d450; of the middle junction. Introducing a silver IRL between the n-layer of the middle junction and the player of the bottom junction was ineffective, as was introducing various transparent conductive oxides (TCOs). The J&#x1d460;&#x1d450; of the middle junction did not increase with the introduction of these layers. In the case of the TCOs, the shunt resistance decreased drastically resulting in decreased V&#x1d45c;&#x1d450; s and FFs. The best performing device in this thesis was manufactured using a 400nm a-Si:H absorber, a 4.5μm i-nc-Si:H absorber and a 60nm n-nc-SiO&#x1d465; intermediate reflective layer. This device had a V&#x1d45c;&#x1d450; of 1.947V, FF of 0.789, a J&#x1d460;&#x1d450; of 9.51mA/cm2 and an efficiency of 14.6%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest conversion efficiency achieved to date with this device architecture.<br/><br/>Introducing tetramethyltin (TMT) to process GeSn:H films resulted in carbonization of the films. Carbon passivates Ge dangling bonds better than hydrogen. This reduces the defect density, leading to higher activation energy (E&#x1d44e;&#x1d450;&#x1d461;) with high TMT injection rates. A high germane flow rate resulted in dense, relatively defectfree films with a high photoconductivity, low bandgap and near intrinsic semiconductor properties. A high germane flow of around 2 sccm is therefore recommended. Varying the pressure in the deposition chamber offers some control over postprocessing oxidation, where higher pressure results in less oxidation. Changing the radiofrequency power offers a tradeoff between film growth rate and film quality.","photovoltaic; crystalline silicon; multijunction solar cells; Silicon; amorphous silicon; germanium; germanium tin; nanocrystalline silicon; silicon oxide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The dominant system in food production is monoculture, using agrochemicals and motorized equipment. However, monocultures are not the only way to produce food. Agroforestry can reach similar production levels but with environmental benefits such as enhancing biodiversity, reducing erosion, increasing soil carbon sequestration, and reducing agrochemicals pollution. Agroforestry also has a water saving potential, by reduction of runoff and improvement in water infiltration in the soil. The deep roots of trees can access deeper water and redistribute it to the upper layers. Additionally, the increase of shade in the system increases soil moisture and decreases soil evaporation and crop transpiration.<br/><br/>In the Maule Region, Chile, agriculture is strongly focused on fruit monocultures and is the region that consumes most of the fresh water in the country. The region has been affected by a prolonged drought, with an uninterrupted sequence of dry years since 2010. Climate projections estimate that it will get worse in the future, with an increase in temperature and a reduction in precipitation. To address this complex scenario of water scarcity in agriculture, a solution could be to move from conventional agriculture to agroforestry. This study seeks to answer the research question: What is the potential for water savings in the Maule watersheds, moving from conventional agriculture to agroforestry without affecting economic returns?<br/><br/>The study uses the agroforestry project ""Huertas A Deo"" (HAD) as a case study to analyze the productivity of the agroforestry system, calculate the water footprint, and perform economic and spatial analyses. The results show that the agroforestry system could be highly productive and have a lower water consumption per hectare compared to conventional monocultures. Also, it is economically competitive with the highest profit among the crops analyzed. The spatial analysis shows a five time reduction in the water footprint if all fruit monocultures are transformed to agroforestry. We conclude that the agroforestry system is a powerful tool to face water scarcity in the Maule region while still being competitive against monocultures.","Agroforestry; watersheds; Chile; Spatial Analysis; Economic analysis; Regenerative agriculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","Huertas a Deo","-35.087, -72.065"

Combining the Bayesian approach with distributed optic fibre sensors can potentially improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in parameter estimation problems, given the large amount of quasi-continuous data produced by this sensing technology; however, its computational cost could be prohibitively high when using conventional methods since Bayesian inference typically involves a large number of samples, each of which entails a physical model evaluation.<br/>The focus of this work is on performing Bayesian system identification for real-world civil engineering structures within an acceptable running time, while using optic fibre measurements with a high spatial resolution. The proposed methodology employs a cheap-to-compute Gaussian process (GP) surrogate that replaces the main bottleneck of the Bayesian workflow for these type of problems: the evaluation of the log-likelihood. The GP surrogate is actively built by sequentially selecting new training points in areas that are expected to highly contribute to the accuracy of the posterior distribution. Once convergence is achieved, the surrogate is used to obtain the parameter estimates via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Additionally, in order to accelerate the Bayesian workflow, cloud-based parallelization is used to perform multiple finite element analyses simultaneously.<br/>A first synthetic case with an inexpensive frame model is used to test the methodology for problems with two and five probabilistic parameters. An encouraging outcome is obtained with the actively learned GP surrogate, with posterior distributions very close to the full MCMC procedure while requiring a number of physical model evaluations orders of magnitude lower. <br/>After that, a second case study consisting of an existing reinforced concrete bridge with real measurements and a relatively expensive finite element model is investigated. A subset of discrete strain and translation sensors are used to perform an initial parameter estimation that almost exactly resembles the results from previous research on this bridge by Rózsás, et al. (2022), successfully validating the proposed procedure. Then, another parameter estimation is computed using available high resolution optic fibre measurements, after which is shown that the optic fibre provides the best improvements in model predictive capacity among all sensor groups, confirming its potential when combined with Bayesian system identification.<br/>The results of the case studies indicate that the approach presented in this thesis has the capacity to greatly reduce the wall-clock time of Bayesian parameter estimation for real world civil engineering structures with optic fibre measurements, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. Nevertheless, additional research is required for cases where the statistical parameters governing the measurement and model uncertainty are inferred along with the physical parameters.","Surrogate modelling; Fiber optic sensors; Gaussian process regression; Bayesian system identification; Bayesian updating; Bayesian inference; Parameter estimation; Structural Health Monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

These interactions create emerging collective behavior over time. For example, inspectors will try to influence non-compliant actors to become compliant, while inspectees may comply or thwart inspections. Inspection agencies such as the Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) evaluate inspectees’ adherence to regulation and aim to boost compliance within an industry. However, they have limited resources and a wide range of potential societal challenges to address. They face an action dilemma, having to decide on what actions to take without full knowledge of whether their actions lead to higher compliance or improved social outcomes. Previous studies of the inspection environment rely on behavioral theories to investigate the underlying motivations of inspectees’ behavior. However, these theories presume inspectees’ motivations and characterize them homogeneously, often assuming they have perfect rationality. This leads to an inaccurate depiction of inspectees, reducing them to one-dimensional actors when in reality, their behavior is motivated by multiple factors and can be idiosyncratic. Data science techniques provide the opportunity to understand behavioral phenomena with data, leveraging datasets to identify statistical patterns in behavior to help inspectorates make decisions within a degree of certainty. A particular modeling technique that focuses on representing empirical data without assuming behavioral motivations is phenomenological modeling. Coupled with agent-based modeling (ABM), phenomenological modeling allows the researcher to simulate possible outcomes of observed behavior before the underlying motivations are understood.

The lander includes the SEIS instrument, which measures the seismic signals on the planet (NASA, 2022b). Because seismic waves are altered by the medium they travel through from the source to the receiver, they contain information on the interior structure of the planet. This information about the structure of Mars can be extracted by applying different data processing and evaluation techniques. <br/>One of the proposed methods is the polarization analysis of the first-arriving P-wave, which is expected to contain information about the near-surface S-wave velocity structure. The technique uses the polarization of an incoming P-wave in horizontal and radial direction to estimate the apparent P-wave incidence angle (Knapmeyer-Endrun et al., 2018). The measured P-wave incidence angle can further be used to estimate a frequency-dependent S-wave velocity from the first break, given that the ray parameter is known. An inversion of such frequency-dependent S-wave velocity curves can then potentially lead to velocity-depth profiles of the near-surface zone.<br/>A first pre-testing of the polarization analysis on a synthetic model should help to understand the process of frequency-dependent S-wave velocity extraction and to work out the limitations of the method. The synthetic data testing showed, that there are a range of important parameters, which influence the velocity estimation. It is highly frequency-dependent and later arrivals, as well as noise, can affect the accuracy. One of the indicators that can be used to evaluate whether or not the extracted S-wave velocities can be trusted is the ellipticity of the polarized wave, which should not be above a threshold of 0.2. The time delay between the Pand the mode-converted PS-arrival (defined as ∆t_app) could be used to define the areas where the estimated velocities change from their expected value. It was found, that ∆tapp has to be greater than 1.4×1e-4 - 2×1e-4 s, that a velocity estimation of the first layer is possible. This is valid for frequencies between 0.08 Hz up to 6 Hz. The second layer velocity could only be calculated for frequencies lower than 0.6 - 2 Hz for the tested models. Furthermore, a proper velocity extraction is not possible for certain ∆tapp and frequency combinations because the angle estimation in this area can not be calculated properly, so far. However, synthetic tests showed that the velocities of a two-layer model could be extracted for specific first layer thicknesses in a given frequency range and a following basic inversion enabled the extraction of the interface depth between these layers.<br/>The application of the polarization analysis to two Martian events allowed a frequency-dependent Vs-velocity extraction for the event S1222a, as 2451 m/s and 2665 m/s for the frequencies of 0.21 Hz and 1.43 Hz respectively. These values could be further used to compare with velocity extractions from other methods. For the second event S0235b, the ellipticity of the first break was above the 0.2 threshold and did therefore not lead to trustworthy outcomes. The polarization analysis applied to real data showed, that a velocity calculation is challenging but possible under certain conditions. Many parameters like the source and its frequency content should be known to actually invert the data, which is why a further analysis with receiver functions is recommended. For further processing, an extended synthetic data testing for other parameters should be performed.<br","Polarization Analysis; Mars; InSight; Near-Surface Characterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","InSight Mars Mission",""

The European Union (EU) is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 (European Commission, 2018).The cornerstone of the EU’s climate policy to combat climate change is the EU Emission Trading System (ETS). It is the world’s first major compliance carbon market and remains the biggest one. Currently, the focus of the EU is to strengthen the market of the EU ETS for the next decade and beyond (European Commission, 2022-a). An important development in this phase is the recognition of global carbon markets to reduce global GHG emissions effectively. Three main challenges of ETSs are identified in this research: lack of system compatibility to link with other ETSs, security issues, and (manual) monitoring of transactions. To realize the full potential of ETSs, the added value of a blockchain-based architecture to support the carbon trading market and counteract the current deficiencies is explored. Although the reviewed literature is useful to identify the possibilities of blockchain solutions to address the current challenges in ETSs, it is not clear how the current EU compliance market could allow extension by providing a large, transparent, verifiable, interoperable, and robust carbon system. Research about blockchain-based EU ETSs would contribute so that the development of global carbon markets could happen. This results in the following main research question: What blockchain-based design can be used by the European Union to improve the technical design of the EU ETS while allowing for the extension to other Emission Trading Systems?. For this research project, a Design Science Research (DSR) approach is taken to ensure a discipline-oriented creation of a successful design that addresses the challenges in the EU ETS. This research proposes a blockchain-based solution that is able to cover the core functions of the system while actively improving system compatibility, preventing security issues and non-transparency, and enable automatized monitoring of transactions. It is concluded that the proposed design is able to improve the current system by enabling extension to other ETSs, automatizing manual processes, providing data security through encryption, and providing transparency in the narket and trade of emission allowances. Additionally, this research provides a blockchain governance framework to align policy and stakeholder interests with governance and technical blockchain control points in the emission trading sector. Besides contributing to closing a gap in a growing research field, the use of the architecture offers a technological solution in which systems can be integrated with each other without having to throw away the existing principles. This is beneficial because these existing principles have been developed after a great amount of learnings, investments, and experience. Also, the design enables more authorities to join a system that is already running while also able to have a say in the governance. This could lead to convergence of market mechanisms and prices where as a result, a more efficient and unified carbon market will emerge.","Blockchain; Emission trading; Carbon; European Union; Interoperability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

These disasters are claiming the lives and livelihoods of local communities, which lead to more challenges such as economic consequences and forced migration. Immediately after hazards like floods strike, local communities are always the first ones to respond before external aid arrives. Their deep understanding of their own context enable them to tap into local resources and tackle specific challenges which are often neglected by official organizations. This thesis sought out to explore possibilities on how local communities like those in Eastern Uganda can be empowered to anticipate and mitigate the risks of floods.<br/><br/>Context:<br/>Fieldwork was done in the Bugisu sub-region, Eastern Uganda. This region is heavily affected by flash floods from Mount Elgon and riverine floods every year.<br/><br/>Themes:<br/>This report revolves around the subjects of disaster risk reduction and anticipatory action. Themes surrounding top-down governance and domestic response on floods were explored to investigate current and preferred future states.<br/><br/>Process:<br/>The process started with literature study and the exploration of the state of floods in the Bugisu sub-region. Then, a prototype of an early warning and early action strategy was designed for a specific flood challenge. Finally, a toolkit was developed to achieve scalability of impact.<br/><br/>Challenge:<br/>The challenge that was chosen for the development of the prototype is how to get women to safety in emergency flood situations. The location of choice is Namabasa sub-county in Mbale city, Eastern Uganda.<br/><br/>Results:<br/>A community-led early warning and early action strategy that is low cost, involves the active participation of local stakeholders and maximises the use of local resources.<br/>A toolkit that consists of manuals, documents and templates to replicate the strategy in another location in Uganda.<br/><br/>Impact:<br/>Fields Data, the main client of this project, has published the toolkit on their website for organizations to freely download it and replicate the early warning and early action strategy in Uganda.<br/><br/>The Netherlands Red Cross and 510 (initiative of the Netherlands Red Cross) have shown interests to develop the strategy and the toolkit. They are interested to review them to establish more community-led approaches and see if the workings complement the current tools and methods being used by them.<br","Climate change; Disaster risk reduction; Floods; Participatory design; Early warning systems; Uganda; Service design; Strategic design; Early Warning Early action; Anticipatory action; Collaboration strategy; Humanitarian design","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.fieldsdata.org/living-with-floods","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To provoke the needed energy transition, European Union (EU) countries initiated significant offshore wind energy investments in the North Sea. However, there also exist adverse aspects to the use of higher renewable electricity levels:<br/><br/>• renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind energy, may threaten the security of our energy system, since they are characterised by a high variability, and limited predictability and controllability;<br/><br/>• the effectiveness with respect to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions is limited, because electrification can be not applied within all sectors, such as heavy industry and heavy duty transport; <br/><br/>• a large increase in offshore wind capacity requires moving further off shore. This results in relatively high costs because of the energy losses within the (longer) electricity cables. <br/><br/><br/>One way of coping with these challenges, is by producing hydrogen offshore, by means of wind energy, and transporting it to shore by for example repurposing the existing offshore natural gas infrastructure. Such an offshore hydrogen system located in the North Sea might sound favorable; however, the feasibility of such a system on this scale is yet to be determined.<br/><br/>In this thesis the possibility is investigated to design a future proof offshore hydrogen system. Such a system would consist of (current as well as new) wind farms, electrolysers to produce hydrogen by using (a part of) the electricity generated by the wind farms, and an infrastructure to bring the hydrogen to shore. Given the EU investment plans in offshore wind energy, a phasing period is used from 2030, 2040, to 2050. This research is done by:<br/><br/>• deriving multiple hydrogen system designs by for example optimising the transmission infrastructure; <br/><br/>• analysing the supply potential of these system designs. <br/><br/><br/>The results show that a cost-competitive hydrogen system in the North Sea can be realised. The proposed system design has a Levelised Cost Of Hydrogen (LCOH) of 2,08 EUR/kg and a positive Net Present Value (NPV) for the most relevant pricing scenarios. This LCOH is relatively low compared to other researches, which are mostly between 2 and 3,5 EUR/kg. <br/><br/>An interesting result concerns including refurbished pipelines of the existing offshore gas infrastructure. When using only new pipelines, the transmission infrastructure costs increase with 36%. Furthermore, the results show that it is more cost-efficient to downscale electrolyser capacities than to use the peak of the available electricity to determine the capacity of the electrolysers. Additionally, the productivity of the wind farms can increase up to even 220% by using the different electricity surplus for hydrogen production.<br/><br/>Based on this research, recommendations can be given:<br/><br/>• National governments should formulate policy on whether or when gas extraction in the North Sea should stop. Thereupon, the (energy) transmission system operators should scope their plans towards transporting offshore hydrogen to onshore, as well as start planning the onshore hydrogen backbone.<br/><br/>• The EU should decide whether to build one interconnected system in the North Sea, or multiple isolated (per country) hydrogen systems. Based on this decision, it is important to start shaping rules and standards for hydrogen trade, as well as determining regulatory regimes to support offshore hydrogen production.<br/><br/>• Further research should be done on the electrolyser costs and efficiencies, as well as the different types of electrolyser locations; on the possibilities of hydrogen storage; and, to include (regional) hydrogen demand values.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Roos, S. (graduation committee); Ersoy, O. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising solution to the blockchain scalability problem. They move payments off-chain, i.e., not all payments have to be included in the blockchain. Thus, they do not require that every payment is broadcast to all participants and verified by them. Not requiring global consensus reduces latency, computation, and hence energy consumption. <br/><br/>In PCNs, a payer can route a multi-hop payment to a payee via intermediaries. Yet, Lightning, the only prominent payment channel network, has two major issues when it comes to multi-hop payments. First, the payer decides on the path without being able to take local capacity restrictions into account. Second, due to the atomicity of payments, any failure in the path causes a failure of the complete payment. While there are suggested solutions for each of these problems --- namely splitting payments, local routing, and adding redundancy ---, there is no solution that solves both of them.<br/><br/>In this work, we propose JustForward: The payer adds redundancy to the payment by initially committing to sending a higher amount than the actual payment value $v$. Intermediaries decide on how to forward a received payment, potentially splitting it between multiple paths. If they cannot (or do not want to) forward the complete payment value, they may reduce the amount they forward. If paths for at least $v$ coins are found, the receiver and source jointly select the amounts of sub-payments that make up the full payment. Payment commitments are updated accordingly and fulfilled. In order to guarantee atomicity and correctness of the payment value, we use a modified Hashed Time Lock Contract (HTLC) for paying that requires both the payer and the payee to provide a secret pre-image. JustForward furthermore is the first local routing protocol to include fees: The source adds a maximal amount of fees they are willing to pay to the payment. Intermediaries take fees as they see fit, taking into consideration that subsequent nodes on the path will not forward the payment if there are insufficient fees left.<br/><br/>We prove that the proposed protocol achieves balance security, atomicity, bounded loss for the sender, and optionally unlinkability of split sub-payments of the same overall payments. Furthermore, our evaluation on both synthetic and real-world Lightning topologies shows JustForward outperforms existing algorithms in terms of the fraction of successful payments as long as the degree of redundancy is not too high. Concretely, for a moderate amount of redundancy, JustForward increases the success ratio of payments by about 10%.","Payment Channel; Routing; Distributed Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The objective is to study the different material properties of the mixtures, determine their impact in the structural performance and define the extent of applicability of current methods of analysis for conventional concrete structures, as defined in EN 1992-1-1 and the Rijkswaterstaat’s Guidelines for NLFEA, for geopolymer concrete. The structural performance of the elements subjected to flexural (at 28 days and 9 months) and shear (at 28 days) tests is studied by analytical methods and 2D plane stress nonlinear finite element analyses, which are compared to experimental results in terms of deformations, load-deflection response, principal strains, normal stresses, damage evolution, cracking stages, maximum load and failure mechanism; the effect of the long-term material properties (e.g. elastic modulus, creep and shrinkage) of the geopolymer concrete mixtures in the prestressing losses, cracking load and maximum load carrying capacity is analyzed. The elastic modulus of both geopolymer concrete mixtures decreases when exposed to drying and is lower than the estimates from EN 1992-1-1 for OPC concrete of the same strength class. The increase of creep and shrinkage between 30 and 60 days suggest a pronounced viscous mechanical response. The prediction models from EN 1992-1-1 for conventional concrete to determine the material properties from the 28-day compressive strength do not capture the long-term material properties. The isotropic elasticity-based prediction models underestimate considerably the creep coefficient and shrinkage strains leading to unsafe design assumptions. The short-term flexural resistance is higher (8% by analytical model and 3% for the numerical simulation) than the maximum load during testing. The stress distributions at characteristic phases and the cracking load (3% higher than the experiment) are practically equal from the analytical and numerical model. The flexural cracking pattern in the topping in the NLFEA shows more cracks at smaller spacing because higher stresses transfer from the precast girder due to perfect bond. The short-term shear resistance was 12% higher from the numerical simulation and 16% lower from the analytical model, as compared to the experiment. The cross-section of the numerical simulation is stiffer since the precast girder and the topping are perfectly bonded, in the experiment debonding occurred. The position and orientation of the shear critical crack causing failure from the NLFEA was consistent with the DIC observations. The prestress losses at 28 days are higher than for conventional concrete and increase from 26% after 28 days to 38% after 270 days. The variation in the elastic modulus at 28 days has a marginal effect in the short-term response to the flexural test. The cracking load is decreased by 15% in the specimen after 9 months but the prestress losses will continue to increase over time and the cracking resistance will decrease which is critical for the performance over the service lifetime. The design criteria of conventional concrete result in non-conservative estimates of the cracking resistance and flexural load carrying capacity.","geopolymer concrete; prestressed concrete; nonlinear finite element analysis; long-term material properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

Compared with the conventional imaging, which has high requirements on the manufacturing of optical elements, ptychography, as a computational imaging technique, uses a set of measured intensities of the diffraction patterns to reconstruct the image of the object and hence no imaging system is needed. This technique is especially useful in the short wavelength, e.g. EUV, regime, where manufacturing high quality optical elements such as mirrors is extremely expensive. <br/><br/>Most of the present ptychographic algorithms require the illumination of the object to be both spatially and temporally coherent so that the diffraction pattern can be interpreted as the intensity of the Fourier transform of the field exiting the object. However, the coherence of the sources that produce the EUV radiation often cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, it is crucial to extend the ptychography method to consider partial coherence effects. This requires the use of a flexible propagator which depends on the wavelength to deal with the temporal partial coherence and a modal representation for the spatially partially coherent field. Also, the ambiguity of the reconstructed modes of the probe will be solved by an orthogonalization approach, which could enhance the reproducibility of the results. These methods will be implemented on an existing ptychography platform based on automatic-differentiation and will be validated using both simulation data and experimental data.","computational imaging; Ptychography; Automatic Differentiation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

The POE database consists of 29 7 Tesla (T) whole-brain MRI scans, including both male and female participants covering the age group between 80 and 91 years old. We used this data to extend the currently existing Amsterdam Ultra-high field adult lifespan database (AHEAD), covering the entire adult life span (18-80 years). Data was acquired at a submillimeter resolution using a the MP2RAGEME sequence, resulting in complete anatomical alignment of quantitative $R_1$-maps, $R_2^*$-maps, $T_1$-maps, $T_2^*$-maps, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). <br/> <br/> As qMRI acquisitions and reconstructions are slow, we also investigated the potential of deep learning to speed up this process using the same dataset. Conventional MRI acquisitions are already time consuming, scanning the multiple images necessary for qMRI may take even longer. Computing a quantitative susceptibility map requires several processing steps involving phase unwrapping, background phase removal, and solving an ill-posed inverse problem, which all together is computationally expensive. COSMOS is currently seen as gold standard for solving the dipole inversion, although sampling from different orientations makes it a lengthy procedure and not feasible for clinical practice. Iterative methods were developed to make high quality QSM maps out of a single orientation measurement, however they suffer from artifacts and can be computationally expensive. Deep learning may improve the QSM pipeline in terms of time, convenience and quality. Neural networks were developed to learn processing steps like phase unwrapping and dipole inversion. Especially for the dipole inversion step several methods are proposed to calculate a high quality QSM map out of single orientation measurements which could speed up the QSM pipeline. We propose a method which can be useful in accelerated end-to-end QSM calculation and highlight advances and possible points for improvement.

Next, they find top-n images closest to the query image by nearest neighbor search (NN search). After NN search, the engine outputs results.

By using two actuated armatures and foot platforms, the machine can provide users with force feedback while they enjoy a multitude of simulations that do not feel like a workout at all. Regular physical exercise is very difficult for many people. This can lead to poor health and increased associated risks for the body and the mind. The Ethereal Engine offers a solution: With exhilarating and exhausting experiences, users can fly with an ornithopter through magical landscapes or paddle through alien waters on foreign planets. Invented and under development by the company Ethereal Matter in the US, the project spans multiple countries, TU Delft faculties and student projects. In this graduation project, the next design of the frame for this very machine is proposed, with a special focus on user perception on the one hand, and engineering-related topics on the other. The project commences with user research into spatial perception emotion and the experience of transitioning from and to VR. Practical limitations such as maximum carrying weights, door and truck dimensions, and intended use cases result in manufacturability, transport, assembly and durability requirements. By using and adapting generative design tools (McNeel’s Rhino, Grasshopper and the plugin Karamba3D) for structural spaceframe design, a satisfying solution is found for the main structure. This basic structure is then designed around and iterated upon using VR reality tools like Gravity Sketch to create frame layouts that feel comfortable and safe. Constant iteration and testing in VR leads to a modular frame layout that allows multiple machines to be connected, but also up or downgraded to more or less extensive versions. Features like a mirror, a space to safely store personal belongings, and integrated lighting are proposed. The machine has fabric for the outside covering which is customizable, affordable and easy to transport. The final design includes a seat in the back with an attached screen for outside viewers to see what is happening in VR. Added interactive elements could lead to whole new interactions between people in the real world with the people in VR. Accompanying the project was the construction and assembly of a partial prototype of the frame and one armature in the Dreamhall of the TU Delft.

Additionally, the majority of the buildings in Serbia are outdated and need to be refurbished. This is aggravated by the fact that the residential sector represents the largest final consumer of energy in the country. Countries presenting a higher range of low-quality and energy-inefficient dwellings tend to present higher levels of energy poverty (and vice versa). Typically, residents living in energy inefficient households present below-average disposable incomes. Similarly, low-income groups are more subject to energy poverty. This hints to the “vicious cycle of energy poverty”, where households presenting low disposable incomes eventually end up spending more on energy since these are unable to afford inefficient dwellings and/or house appliances. The correlation between household energy efficiency and energy poverty has been recognised throughout the literature and among governmental institutions. In fact, increasing energy efficiency is a target present both in the Fit for 55 package delineated by the European Commission and the Sustainable Development Goals developed by the United Nations.<br/><br/>Considering the previously mentioned “vicious cycle of energy poverty” and the fact that low-income groups are more affected by energy poverty, it was decided to focus on this specific strait of society. Additionally, being a contracting party of the Energy Community Treaty, the Republic of Serbia adheres to implementing EU climate directives (sustainable goals) in the country. Stemming from this, the following Main Research Question was delineated, around which the whole research process was structured: Which energy policy strategy should the Ministry of Mining and Energy implement in Serbia as to achieve household energy efficiency and energy poverty objectives set by the European Commission directed towards low-income groups?<br/><br/>A case study-mixed methods approach was utilised for the following study. By merging the two methodologies, the proposed policies presented elements and were analysed from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. On the one hand, the institutional, legal, and policy framework in the field of energy in Serbia was analysed, as to ensure the proposed policies were politically and socially feasible. On the other hand, the technical effectiveness in terms of final energy consumption and expenses reduction was also considered. To that end, a MS Excel linear and static simulation model was employed. It was found that performing a simulation-backed analysis of the available policy strategies in Serbia, delineating an optimal one to reduce energy poverty levels and improve household energy efficiency among low-income groups in Serbia, satisfying the sustainable targets set by the European Commission, represented a knowledge gap in the literature.<br/><br/>Three main policies were delineated corresponding to three different simulated scenarios. Namely, (i) the implementation of an emissions trading scheme extended as to also include the residential sector; (ii) the phasing out of heating oil and fossil fuels in 2030, followed by natural gas in 2040; (iii) the implementation of Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) in the residential sector. The latter resulted as the best performing policy, presenting the highest reduction in final energy consumption and expenses, resulting politically and socially feasible, delivering a positive social impact among low-income households in Serbia. <br","Energy Efficiency; Energy poverty; Energy Efficient Buildings; Serbia; household energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Recent advances in robot-material systems, on the other hand, have focused on mechanical properties, design, and production methods. Making it possible to create cellular structures in harsh and remote environments. These systems, which are built up of voxels and small mobile robots that live on top of the structure and move the cellular structures, nevertheless lack a connecting mechanism that reduces total system complexity and assembly time to a level that is desirable to people.<br/><br/>The design of these voxels prioritizes ease of assembly through simple actuation and is investigated by proposing a method to connect voxels via an end effector without removing mechanical qualities while maintaining the system’s modularity principle. Modularity is a design idea that divides a structure into smaller sections called voxels that can be built and assembled separately to build the required structure. Simultaneously, the end effector’s design aims to connect a voxel with the fewest degrees of freedom possible, while also holding a voxel throughout transit and placing the voxel in the desired spot.<br/><br/>A new connection mechanism for cuboctahedral cellular structures was devised, which would enable the building of required large-scale structures faster and easier. Several prototypes and experiments were used in the design of this connection mechanism. The final prototype was built by fused deposition modeling and demonstrated by attaching the end effector to a Universal Robot 5 (UR5) and completing a series of movements to simulate the autonomous assembly of a bridge. The concept evaluation resulted in an end effector that can connect all sides of the voxel with only two movements, without requiring the robot to go around the voxel. This idea lays the groundwork for enhancing the way robots form cellular structures and creating a mechanism to make them more appealing to humans when exploring remote settings. The study finishes with future research opportunities and prospective applications of such a connection mechanism in robot-material systems.","Cellular structures; Voxel; Modularity; Cuboctahedral; Robot-material system; Harsh environments; Modular assembly; Path planning; Mobile robot; End effector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Currently, all eyes are on the quantum computer, the promising computer that can solve problems which are unsolvable for regular computers. In order to understand this new technology, it is necessary to understand the qubit, the basic unit of quantum information.

The aim of this thesis is to find the density matrix of a single qubit in closed (isolated) and open quantum systems. In the case of a closed system, an alternating sequence of two processes with different Hamiltonians is considered, which both last a fixed amount of time after one another. These systems have been solved using a direct formula for a 2 × 2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues raised to the power n for any n ∈ N. In the case of an open system, dissipation is taken into account compared to a single process in a closed system. These open systems have been solved numerically using the Lindblad master equation and the spin-boson model to model the environment as a bath of bosons. However, the use of multiple approximations and assumptions questions the validity of the results for ’strong’ interactions. Suggestions for further research include investigating quantitatively when the Lindblad equation is valid to use and solve open quantum systems using different models for the environment.","Quantum Mechanics; Qubits; Density matrix","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

In this research a machine learning model was developed and deployed to determine energy consumption, usage pattern and energy efficiency characteristics of real-life dishwasher usage based on smart meter data. The developed NILM system was deployed on a full year of smart meter data for nearly 130.000 households in the Netherlands. The analysis was accompanied by a survey to gain additional information on the households usage behaviour. The average energy consumption for all households was found to be 1.18kWh per wash, with dishwashers used 240 times per year on average. Dependencies are shown for household size, washing temperature, machine efficiency label as well as time of day, week and year. It was estimated that 9 in 10 households could reduce their dishwasher energy consumption, with an average saving potential of more than 30% per year. The developed method showed to be suitable to gain insight into average electricity consumption and usage patterns on an appliance level, non-intrusively and at large-scale. Additional survey data was shown to provide comparative insight between different user groups.

To allocate tasks to ground support equipment (GSE) vehicles, an auction mechanism inspired by temporal sequential single item (TeSSI) auction is proposed. Ground handling tasks scheduling for GSE vehicles is modeled as several single-vehicle pickup and delivery optimization problems (SPDP), and the values of the objective functions are applied to generate bids for GSE vehicle agents in the auction. Moreover, Prioritized Safe Interval Path Planning for large agents (LA-SIPP) is used to plan collision-free paths for GSE vehicle agents in the model to execute tasks. Experimental studies have shown that the system is able to perform task allocation and path planning of ground handling tasks for flights in 3 aircraft stands within a 4-hour time in a reasonable computational time.

The ALERD is a sustainable and cost-effective solution to perform coastal replenishment work along the Dutch coastline and will be used for submerged dredging operating fully electric. The ALERD is modelled as an underwater vehicle in six degrees of freedom, from which the forward speed, the depth, and the pitch angle are controlled using motion controllers. The ALERD is the successor of the Autonomous Underwater Maintenance Dredger (AUMD), for which it is shown that the power for propulsion can be reduced with 55%, and the power required for the dredging pumps can be reduced with 80%, due to the submerged operations. A simulation model is used to determine the required power for stability and buoyancy control of the ALERD, since this was up to this point still unknown. To be a cost-effective solution, the energy consumption for motion control should be minimized. Traditional motion control methods such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control are widely used for controlling underwater vehicles. The more advanced motion control method Model Predictive Control (MPC) is seen as a more promising motion control method, in terms of both trajectory-tracking and minimizing the control effort. A Model Predictive Control strategy is developed and used to minimize the energy consumption of the ALERD for stability and buoyancy control. It is shown that MPC indeed outperforms PID control on tracking the desired reference signal, while minimizing the control effort and thus the corresponding required energy. A sensitivity analysis is done using Monte Carlo Simulations, to show the effect of modelling uncertainties on the outcomes of the simulation model. There is a minimum variation in the outcomes, considering the modelling uncertainties. MPC is better capable of handling with modelling uncertainties compared to PID control, in terms of trajectory-tracking and minimizing the corresponding energy requirements. The MPC controlled ALERD is compared with the PID controlled ALERD, and a conventional dredger, and it is shown that for a similar operational profile, the MPC controlled ALERD is the most energy efficient solution. The results from the simulation model still show significant advantages of submerged dredging compared to conventional dredging, even when considering the energy demand for stability and buoyancy control, based on the used operational profile.","Underwater Vehicles; Model Predictive Control; Dredging; Autonomous Shipping; Monte Carlo Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-11","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

So, harvesting ambient energy and converting it into electrical energy to power wireless sensors has become an alternative to the traditional power sources. Harvesting energy from heat using thermoelectric generators (TEG) has become a prevalent topic in recent years. Since the system is required to startup with zero energy stored, the cold startup technique is necessary to activate the operation of the system in the very beginning stage without any assistance from the energy storage block, for instance, battery and capacitor. It is noted that any machines that moves, shakes, or rotates not only dissipate heat while working but also vibrate, thus the mechanical vibration can be used to startup the system. In this thesis project, a novel piezoelectric generator (PEG) startup technique is proposed to activate the system. This project focuses on pushing the minimum startup TEG voltage to an ultra-low level with the help of the PEG startup circuit.<br/> <br/>The design of the system follows the top-down approach. Firstly, the inductive DC/DC boost converter was chosen to be the basic topology. Then, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique is exploited to make sure the TEG always works at its optimal state. In addition, a Zero-current Switching (ZCS) block is proposed to regulate the synchronization of the switches and control the gate switching. Next, the state detector block monitors the state of the harvester system and instructs other control circuits to respond to the changes in the operation state. To avoid the impact of the fluctuation of supply on powering internal control circuits, a low-dropout regulator (LDO) is adopted to generate a stable supply instead. Finally, the power losses, conversion efficiency and startup principle are analyzed and calculated for performance improvement.<br","Thermoelectric energy harvesting; piezoelectric generator; thermoelectric energy generator; DC-DC converter; cold-startup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Verburg, R.M. (mentor); Oudshoorn, Arjan (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Addressing climate change is a challenge that governments, society, and companies have to face. For companies this becomes a major challenge as they are required to innovate in order to become more sustainable whilst still remain competitive. However, carrying out technological innovation may be useless if it cannot be diffused in the market. Due to this, ventures must go further and modify their current business models to change the way they are doing business and thus generate sustainable value and remain competitive. Within this context, a research gap that relates sustainability, business model innovation, and technology can be identified. To address this gap, an empirical exploratory case study is used as approach. The case study analysed is the Fermentation Acceleration by Separation Technology (FAST), a breakthrough technology in the biotechnology industry that is able to produce chemicals by means of a more cost-effective fermentation process. The technology was developed by DAB, a Dutch biotechnology spin-off from TU Delft. The main research question that was proposed to address the research gap was: “How can the FAST technology be a driver for sustainable business model innovation of biobased chemical companies?”. To answer the question, two business models were generated using the triple layered business model canvas for assessing and visualising, under a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective, to what extent and in which elements of a business model the FAST technology drives sustainability. The models assessment considered DAB as a producer and a licensor for 2-phenylethanol (2PE) production by means of FAST, respectively. The main finding of this thesis project is that it has proven that FAST drives sustainable business model innovation within the biobased chemical industry. This is as sustainable business model innovation is found in both value proposition and value creation &amp; delivery of the two sustainable business models generated by complementing FAST with the use of organic raw materials and solvents, and renewable energies as power source. More specifically, FAST sustainable innovativeness can be seen in the elements of value proposition, key resources, key partners, and customer segments of these novel sustainable business models. FAST drives sustainable business model innovation within these four elements by being a breakthrough innovation (key resources) that includes a sustainable and efficient production of biochemicals within its value proposition. Moreover, innovation is also driven within key partnerships as FAST requires strain designers to adopt a different approach when engineering new microorganisms. Here, the technology has an effect outside its business model, modifying the value chain. Furthermore, FAST can reach new customer segments and be competitive with current production processes of chemicals as it was shown for the case of 2PE. This sustainable innovativeness differs from the practices other companies within the industry have implemented which are focused on changing the fossil origin of raw materials but do not consider the creation of new value propositions/business models to balance the financial, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. Regarding the theoretical contribution, this thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of the two business models outlined from the biotechnology sector and shows how they are able to capture the value of a novel sustainable innovation. By doing this, the research gap among business model innovation, sustainability, and technology is reduced. The generation of the sustainable business models was performed by: carrying out a literature review, a questionnaire on sustainability indicators, the Delphi method to obtain a consensus, and simulations of processes for 2PE production. The contribution for practitioners is an example on how they can design business models for a novel technology using a tool that offers a comprehensive analysis of its effects on sustainability. Moreover, the integrated LCA allows practitioners to have a quantitative analysis for measuring the impact of their technology, processes and activities. Furthermore, it may be also useful for redesigning current business models by assessing which components may be modified or kept to achieve sustainability. ","biobased economy; bioproduction; Business Model Innovation; Fermentation; Sustainability; Sustainable business models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-11","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); ter Horst, Wouter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The combination of climate change and increased urbanization has resulted in cities with no historic flooding experience suddenly vulnerable to extreme flood events. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of rainfalls, whereas urbanization decreases the total porous surface area, resulting in pluvial (rainwater) flooding. One such affected city is Valkenburg, located in South Limburg in the Netherlands. Valkenburg flooded on 14 July 2021 after experiencing an unusually heavy rainfall that deposited 146 mm of rain into the Geul Catchment, causing up to €600 million in damage. In such communities, flood early warning systems (FEWS) are emerging as possible non-structural solutions to minimizing costs of damage and loss of life from flooding. These systems are people-centered, end-to-end networks that predict floods before they are meant to occur to warn people living in vulnerable areas so that they can protect their homes, businesses, and themselves. <br/>The FEWS network for the Geul uses forecasted precipitation data to predict discharge and water level conditions for the Geul. In the event that the predictions result in an abnormally high water level, warnings can be communicated to the necessary parties and to the population to allow for ample preparation. At the time of the July 2021 flood, the system was offline, with experts familiar with the network believing that it would not have worked even if it was online. This project aimed to analyze the existing FEWS from data collection to communication of warnings to locate existing issues and potential sources of weakness, thereby improving the system to effectively warn for future floods. <br/>Each step of the FEWS was tested to find and strengthen potential weaknesses. The data inputs were analyzed and compared to the recorded precipitation that occurred in July 2021. Then, this data was inputted into the FEWS prediction models to understand how the system would have calculated the discharge and water level for that event. Both the July 2021 flood event as well as four non-flooding scenarios (summer storm, winter storm, dry season, wet season) were tested. The models were then used to create a flood map, and this flood map was inputted into the Damage and Casualties Model (SSM2017) to estimate how much in damage costs could be saved for the case with FEWS and the case without FEWS. Communication and evacuation were not extensively tested in this research project due to these components being determined by social and political frameworks. <br/>When inputting the precipitation data associated with the July 2021 flood, it was found that the 1D model overestimated the water level to be 76.5 m+NAP, 6.5 m greater than the expected water level. Implementing a 2D grid reduced this value to 70 m+NAP, which matched the expected water level. It was also found that both HBV and SOBEK produce simulation results that consistently do not align with recorded data, suggesting a need to recalibrate the models to better reflect the behavior of the Geul River. Analyzing the recorded discharge and precipitation data found that using forecasted precipitation data gives Valkenburg enough time to communicate warnings and evacuate if necessary. Cost-benefit analysis that compared the economic impact of warning versus not warning revealed that warning and evacuation is more cost-effective than not not warning and evacuating, even in the case of a false alarm. An evacuation in the event of a false alarm can cost 1/10 of the difference in damage costs with and without evacuation. However, false alarms must still be avoided, as they erode trust in the warning system, thereby reducing its effectiveness in possible cost and loss of life reduction. Analysis of the expected costs of damage with and without the warning system revealed that the inclusion of the warning system has the potential to reduce the total expected damage by more than 50%. <br/>The insights found in this project can be used to improve the FEWS for the Geul. Future research can be done to create a 2D or quasi-2D model that can predict the discharge and water levels of the Geul in a timely manner (no more than one-two hours’ simulation time). The 2D aspect is important to a warning system as the expected amount of water affects how the community prepares for the disaster. This project can contribute not only to the improvement of the FEWS for the Geul but also for the improvement or creation of FEWS for other river catchments in newly vulnerable cities.","SOBEK; Flooding; FEWS; Flood early warning system; Valkenburg; SSM2017; Flood risk map; Geul River; Geul catchment; Limburg floods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","50.863382, 5.835961"

A specific type of error caused by radiation are soft errors which can be corrected by Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) methods. Unfortunately, it is uncommon for MCUs to have an (optimal) EDAC solution integrated in their memory controller. In these cases an external solution is required. <br/>This work proposes a generic methodology towards transparent FPGA-based correction of soft errors that can be applied given a specific microcontroller and its off-chip main memory. To determine how powerful the EDAC solution must be the methodology uses reliability models to evaluate the MTTF of the memory system. Then, the methodology describes how the EDAC logic must be designed in the FPGA fabric such that the FPGA and its EDAC logic are transparent to the MCU. A method to periodically scrub the memory transparently to the processor is also included. <br/>A major trade-off of the FPGA based design is that it requires the clock of the MCU memory controller to be lowered to meet the timing requirements of the SDRAM interface. For some designs it is also necessary to lower the memory capacity or to use more SDRAM devices to store the ECC parity bits. <br/>Lastly, a hardware demonstrator was built to provide EDAC capabilities to the onboard computer developed by ISISPACE. The design consisting of an ARM9 microcontroller, an FPGA and two SDRAM devices is capable of correcting a single error in each byte of the 32- bit SDRAM interface of the MCU and can scrub the entire memory in 33 seconds. Software benchmarks showed that computing performance is about half of the original board as a result of halving the memory controller clock.<br","space; fpga; sdram; error correcting codes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

In 2019, 15 percent of the Dutch citizens are victims of High Impact Crimes (HIC). Policy-makers have been mainly focused on disseminating information to businesses and individuals on how to protect themselves and their properties against crime and violence. However, an increased arrest rate is likely to have the largest impact on reducing the negative effects of HIC. Therefore, this research aims to explore the criminal escape route decision-making, to understand the choices made by criminals during their escape, resulting in a higher arrest rate. Since there is a lack data on escape routes, the modelling approach is used for this research. Therefore, a simulation model is developed to predict the prospective fugitive escape routes. The developed discrete-event model for criminal escape route decision-making within Rotterdam is developed based on both expert knowledge from the Dutch Police and the dual-process theory for criminal’s decision-making developed by van Gelder. Analysis of the interviews held with the Dutch Police shows that, type of crime, location of crime, and time of crime are varied to explore the escape route decision-making of criminals. From the analysis of the model outcomes, we conclude that organized crime criminals prefer the bigger (S and N) roads to escape the spatial area. Whereas local criminals prefer smaller (S and collector) roads to escape the spatial area. Traffic density influences the destinations and road use of organized crime criminals in a more distributed use of smaller roads instead of the bigger S and N roads. The location of crime results in different behavior in terms of destination, road use, and choices. The acquired knowledge of this research can result in catching the criminals faster after the crime, due to improved knowledge on potential decisions a criminal could take. Further research should focus on low-level decision-making to give researchers more detailed insights in criminals escape route behaviour. However, additional research is necessary on how personal and micro-level spatial factors influences the criminal escape route decision-making. Also, further research should focus on developing a real-time simulation model for the Dutch Police to predict possible locations of the criminals during the fugitive escape. Therefore, implementing additional features (e.g., live traffic, traffic lights, and micro-level spatial characteristics) to increase the feasibility of the simulation model is recommended. However, additional research is needed on how the additional features influences the criminal escape route decision-making.","Criminal Escape Route Decision-Making; Dual-Process Theory; Hot and Cool Framework; Discrete-Event Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Analysing the behaviour and properties of this material is vital for modern day society. Currently, this is mostly done in labs using actual asphalt mixtures. However, this is a very expensive and time consuming process. An upcoming alternative approach is the use of computational models. The finite (FEM) and discrete element methods (DEM) have been used in the past, but both of these have shown significant disadvantages regarding the modelling of discrete particle movement and shape, respectively. An upcoming alternative is the use of physics engines, such as Bullet Physics, to model porous media. This method can have substantial benefits in terms of costs and research time. Also, phenomena can be visualised that cannot easily be observed in experiments. <br/><br/>This research focusses on the utility of Bullet Physics for modelling hot asphalt compaction. Therefore, a complex contact model is implemented which can describe the contact forces of the bituminous mixture. The superpave gyratory compaction process is digitally modelled. The model has been programmed in PyBullet, an open source physics engine, programmable in Python. A parametric study has been performed, which reveals the significance of certain properties, which cannot easily be investigated during laboratory compaction. <br/><br/>Bullet Physics was not initially designed for scientific research in the field of structural engineering. Therefore, alterations are needed to make the software usable. The implementation of a complex contact model is challenging. Although the Burgers’ contact forces can be correctly described, it proves difficult to implement custom contact forces directly in PyBullet. Two attempts have been made. In the case of a custom integration scheme, the computation time proved too long to be applicable for large scale simulations. In case of a direct implementation in Bullet Physics with the application of external forces, instability occurs. The only correct way to implement a custom contact model is by altering the source code. <br/><br/>During the simulations with a simpler contact model, substantial improvements of digital simulations over actual experiments are presented. The consistency proves far better than the prescribed minimum. The influence of inertia and friction can be assessed. It turns out that inertia, as well as the friction of the mould, can be disregarded. Another phenomenon that can be clearly illustrated is the revolving of aggregates inside the mould. Further analysis has shown that the average contact area depends on degradation, but in a typical asphalt mixture does not depend on the size of the individual elements, and could rather be treated as a constant. Further analysis shows that Bullet Physics is incredibly efficient, thus yielding the possibility of performing large scale simulations within reasonable time.","Bullet Physics; Compaction; Contact model; Micromechanical modelling; Porous asphalt (PA)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In many cases, sound reduction is needed to meet this new requirement.<br/><br/>To reduce this noise, a sound reducing enclosure can be placed over the unit. Van Cappellen Sound Solutions has developed such a product called the Brockx. This company offers products for noise and vibration control. At the core of their business however, the company provides services in the maritime sector. They measure, model and predict noise and vibrations for luxury yachts. Their expertise in the acoustic area, combined with their innovativeness and the new development of the sound legislation has led to the development of the Brockx.<br/><br/>The problem that this project tries to solve, is how to continue with this product. No strategy has been developed yet, and not much is known about the market or how to conduct marketing. Van Cappellen can be classified as a small-medium company (SME), which also needs to be taken into account. To solve these problems, a structure has been created which is shaped by three chapters: SME marketing, 4C-analysis &amp; marketing mix.<br/><br/>The chapter SME Marketing is intended to find out whether the situation of Van Cappellen is unique, what characterises small companies such as Van Cappellen, and how marketing is conducted. Through literature research and primary research it was found that similar situations are recognised among other SMEs. Three themes were also found which characterises SME marketing: networking, customer engagement &amp; digital marketing.<br/><br/>The 4C-analysis consists of competition, company, context and consumers. The main conclusions are that the Brockx can differentiate from its competitors by being the enclosure that is of high quality while offering the perfect balance between sound reduction and size and weight. Next, the company should use its reputation in creating a brand image, to differentiate among other acoustic companies. Context factors such as the growing market of ACs and heat pumps and the sound legislation indicate that the market for sound reducing enclosures will increase. Finally qualitative and quantitative research has been conducted to find out what consumers find important. Selling the Brockx in cooperation with a wholesaler is considered the most viable option, as they have all the required logistical resources. Consumers' attitudes towards the Brockx are positive, as it provides the most sought after benefits. With this information a market positioning has been determined.<br/><br/>Continuing with these findings, the marketing mix is determined by filling in the 4P’s: product, price, place &amp; promotion. The ‘product’ chapter describes the Brockx in more detail. Manufacturing the Brockx can be done in the Netherlands first, and later in Central Europe as this will be cheaper. The price of the Brockx is determined through a competition-oriented method. The place of the Brockx is in the Netherlands, and made available through channels of a wholesaler. For the promotion, offline and online marketing methods have been proposed, together with an implementation plan.<br","Marketing; Strategy; Master thesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Blok, K. (mentor); Scholten, L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The global wicked problem of climate change forces us to policymaking, implementation, and climate action. In a hopeful attempt to reach the ambitious Paris Agreement goals, science indicates that collaborative action and science-based targets are required. Consequently, the political arena recognizes the importance of actors beyond national governments for collaborative climate action. These non-state and subnational actors could have a great impact on global emissions reductions, but current targets and pledges are often subject to a lack of transparency and greenwashing practices. In addition, current commitments and actions are often too modest in ambition to close the emission gap. As a response, a plethora of International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) has arisen. This research focuses on the promising and important role of corporates in non-state climate action, by assessing corporate determinants for participation in the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). To date, the SBTi is the most prominent ICI in the corporate landscape with more than 1,500 companies that are committed to science-based targets. Due to its popularity and rapid growth of the initiative, the SBTi evidently contributes to global emission reductions.<br/><br/>With their step-wise process to science-based target commitment, development, and validation, the SBTi promises to prevent ”the worst effects of climate change”. To track the progression of this hopeful promise, a handful of studies have been conducted on the SBTi’s emission mitigation. However, the literature on the SBTi has remained inextensive. Furthermore, why corporates participate in the initiative was unaddressed. This thesis work is pioneering in the sense that it creates a novel, important, and relevant contribution to fulfilling this knowledge gap, by identifying determining factors for participation in the SBTi. Thereby, assessing associations be- tween firm characteristics and SBTi participation, in addition to whether and how these firm characteristics and several motives, reasons, and drivers cause a corporate to participate.<br/><br/>To this end, we have constructed a mixed-method study with a sequential explanatory design that entailed econometric statistical analysis and interviews. The group of corporates selected for the study was the Fortune 500 of the year 2015, which marks the start of the SBTi. We conclude that this research design is a good fit for the type of study which aims to find relations between firm characteristics, motives, reasons, drivers, and SBTi membership, or climate action in general. Mostly because our approach allowed for a more comprehensive picture of relevant factors to participate in the SBTi, compared to extant literature that is often lacking on detailed information due to exploratory designs that assess association rather than causation. We, therefore, want to shed light on the added value of semi-structured interviews in this work and potential future work, despite some of our main limitations of data availability, relatively small sample sizes, and selection bias.<br/><br/>We found that determining factors for corporates to participate in the SBTi relate to the concepts of Legitimacy, Market Success, Social Insurance and Organizational Culture. The latter added an angle that did not seem covered by the concepts derived from previous studies, while this concept became one of the most influential but controversial in management and organization studies. Our findings show that the pressure of stakeholders such as investors, competitors, the U.S. government, employees, end-consumers, and purchasers is an important determinant for corporates to participate; whereby we have shown that joining the SBTi is unexpectedly mainly driven by purchasers rather than end-consumers in the U.S. at this point. In addition, competitive pressures cause a company to join since corporates want to maintain their front-running position, find peer benchmarking important, and are experiencing peer pressure within their sector. Furthermore, a corporate’s perception of internal and external leadership is important in deciding to join the SBTi. In particular, a firm’s strategy and CEO determine whether the corporate wants to be a leader by joining the SBTi or not. On top of that, we found that the presence of a sustainability committee increases the likeliness of a firm becoming a SBTi member since it connects sustainability expertise in the organization that is needed to feed top management so that sustainability decisions can be made.<br/><br/>Interestingly, contrary to our expectations, our results show that corporates in the energy sector are not the most likely to join the SBTi. Albeit those companies are facing impressive stakeholder pressures, they often choose to lobby against future policies rather than set science-based targets. Moreover, we expect conservative corporate culture and the maturity of a sustainability program to influence the decision to join the SBTi. To specify, we believe that conservative corporates, possibly with a mature sustainability program, tend to stick to their system-centric targets and management processes rather than participating in the SBTi.<br/><br/>Overall, our pioneering research outcomes contribute to the inextensive body of academic literature on the SBTi, and it enriches the extant literature on ICIs participation, voluntary initiative participation, and corporate climate action in general. Moreover, the implications of this research are important to policymakers, government, as well as corporates, and the SBTi, in terms of responding to the determinants for SBTi participation. Especially because it is expected that the number of SBTi members will exponentially grow soon, thereby further enhancing the initiative’s prominent character. In addition, we argue that SBTi membership is and will not be a form of corporate greenwashing. We also think that SBTi members will environmentally and financially perform better in the long term, due to continuously aligned targets with science, and growing pressure and recognition of the SBTi by stakeholders.<br/><br/>Our study implies that the SBTi will most likely see a pattern of early adopters, the frontrunners; and late adopters, the followers or the firms that experience difficulties with emission identification. However, one should also be aware that there will be a group of outliers, identified as the corporates that will not voluntarily participate in this initiative, or corporate climate action in general. Yet, it requires global collaboration of the entire corporate landscape to close the emission gap. Therefore, our findings are valuable in the sense that they can aid different stakeholders to develop more effective strategies for encouraging businesses to develop a sustainability agenda. Thereby, understanding what motivates corporates to take climate action is important for policymakers, since the effectiveness of policies also depends in large part on how firms will respond to them.<br/><br/>To reach the tipping point in which companies cannot deny joining the SBTi, we recommend the SBTi to focus on targeting new sectors, firms with conservative corporate cultures, and mature sustainability programs. As well as responding to this expected growth within their own organization and establishing a network of experts and corporates which aids in scope 3 identification. In turn, we advise corporates to join forces that support emission identification and disclosure in comprehensible language. Furthermore, our results encourage corporates to establish an organizational structure that enhances collaborative action and sustainable decision-making, for instance with a sustainability committee and dedicated leadership. Additionally, purchasing companies should use their power to trigger a cascade of science-based targets amongst the supply chain. Moreover, corporates should always lobby for science-based climate policies, even when forms of voluntary climate action are already present. It is thereby up to the government to engage with corporate communities that promote climate policy formation, formulate policies on compulsory emission identification, and join forces with the SBTi to promote the advantages of standardized science-based targets by understanding what truly drives corporates to take voluntary climate action. Following our work, there is abundant room for formulating more detailed policies, investigating additional external pressures that affect corporates to join, and zooming in on each individual sector to account for existing sector differences.","SBTi; Corporates; Fortune 500","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Blok, K. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","One of the main strategies for reducing energy demand—and thereby carbon emissions— is increasing energy efficiency. In the Netherlands, energy efficiency policy and energy reduction targets in the residential sector are based on the theoretical energy consumption of buildings, which often over- or underestimates the measured energy consumption. The difference between the actual energy consumption and the calculated energy consumption of a building is referred to as the energy performance gap (EPG). As a consequence of this discrepancy, the estimated energy savings are inaccurate and the energy-saving targets are unattainable. Narrowing the EPG is necessary to develop more accurate estimates of energy savings and realistic targets, and to improve the effectiveness of energy reduction policies and campaigns. Most studies on the EPG have focused predominantly on data from the social rental housing sector, failing to represent the national distribution of home ownership type. At the same time, homeowners and tenants have been shown to behave differently regarding energy consumption. <br/>This thesis investigates the effect of home ownership on the actual natural gas consumption and the EPG by descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression on a representative sample of the Dutch housing stock. The multiple regression analysis controls for building and occupant characteristics that are expected to influence the actual gas consumption and the EPG, in order to measure the ceteris paribus effect of ownership type on the actual gas consumption and the EPG. <br/>The results show that ownership type does not have a practically significant effect on actual gas consumption or the EPG, while controlling for building and household characteristics. However, without controlling for these factors, there is a moderate positive correlation between home ownership and actual gas consumption, and a weak positive correlation between home ownership and the magnitude of overpredictions. This suggests that observed differences in gas consumption or EPG between ownership groups may be explained by building and household characteristics, rather than by potential behavioral differences. Specifically, the positive correlation between home ownership and actual gas consumption can be explained by the larger floor area, type of buildings, higher income, and larger household size. The positive correlation between home ownership and the size of overpredictions is explained by type of building and larger floor area. Thus, there are no major differences in energy consumption behavior between homeowners and tenants that cause large differences in their actual gas consumption or EPG. Nevertheless, the distinction of ownership type may still be of practical use to policymakers. Targeting homeowners could be an efficient way to promote energy-saving measures in the largest and highest energy-consuming dwellings.","theoretical gas consumption; actual gas consumption; home ownership","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Thick layers of soft material such as peat and clay are present and pile foundations into deeper sand layers are required when objects are constructed that have to transfer significant loads to the subsurface without inducing settlement (differences). This also counts for pile foundations of wind turbines which, apart from compression and tension loads also are subjected to horizontal loading. The horizontal translational stiffness is an important and depending on the wind turbine manufacturer governing aspect in the required dimensions of the pile foundation (number and type of piles). In order to improve this horizontal translational stiffness, the foundation designer usually opts for the use of battered (raked) piles. The basic principle is that the axial stiffness of the pile will, in this way, contribute to the horizontal stiffness of the foundation as a whole. The verification of wind turbine requirements usually involve the use of generally accepted analytical 2D methods, simplifying the more complex 3D effect, to model the interaction between soil-pile and the group effect for closely spaced piles. Although the analytical model generally provides good results, investments can reduce significantly when only a small amount of piles can be saved upon.

Given that any person who encounters a cardiac condition should undergo cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a program to rehabilitate the heart and learn to manage it in daily life, it is expected that the health system will also grow exponentially in order to meet the high care demand. However, this is not the case. Currently, only 28 percent of the eligible patients get referred to CR because the health system does not have the capacity to include all of them (Van Engen-Verheul et al., 2012). Moreover, the full take-in and supervision of the cardiac patients in CR lead them to find the transition to their daily life after finishing CR quite hard. <br/><br/>One solution to tackle this problem is to delegate some of the care parts at home, called blended care, so that more patients can enter CR while learning to manage their condition early on. <br/><br/>However, there are two main problems concerning this structural change in CR care. First, because of the loss of frequent contact with health professionals, implementing blended care risks losing personalization in care.Secondly, when delegating care at home, health professionals lose insights and feedback into the care delivered at home. Therefore, patient health outcomes might become compromised.<br/>In this regard, this project proposes a design concept to support the blended CR care for the patient (with an app) and physiotherapist (with a dashboard) by homogenizing the care delivered at home and the CR center while centralizing the patients by making them active and responsible for their care. Moreover, it personalizes the CR care path, not in terms of exercises or changes in the workflow, but in a way that makes sense to the patient following their CR interests. The concept is composed of an intelligent solution with three different modules that utilize the feedback loops integrated into it to understand the patients’ input and adapt to them, realizing the personalization effect. <br/><br/>The first module concerns the personal goals that patients need to set as they enter the care path and explains the motivation and type of the goal the patient wants to achieve. The second module aims to engage the patients with their exertion data during the care path (a subjective score from six to twenty with which patients report how heavy they find an activity) by helping them actively reflect on their performance and goals to take necessary actions. It realizes this effect by understanding their exertion zones and asking patients subsequent questions to make sense of the data via a quick check-in after rehabilitation. The third module uses the outcomes of the previous modules to provide personalised insights and advice.","cardiac rehabilitation; intelligent solution; data-enabled design; personalisation; patient centered care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

This research therefore aims to develop a multi-criteria decision model to assess the impact of VGS in Dutch DC’s near airports to enhance the decision-making process for the implementation of VGS. The main research question was formulated as follows: ‘How can a MCDM tool on the quantitative performance of VGS in delivering ecosystem services be developed and applied, in order to facilitate the impact assessment and evidence-based decision-making in the context of Dutch DC’s near airports?’<br/>The research question was answered through a mixed-methods approach including literature research and expert interviews. A case study was used to apply and validate the MCDM model. VGS were found to offer a range of supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services. The performance of VGS in delivering these services was mainly determined by the plants, substrate and support system. In general, living walls have a higher performance than green façades, among which modular living walls perform best. However, context-specific valuation was considered key. Evaluating VGS on the interaction effects between the main system components and the ecosystem services is an effective approach for developing a MCDM model that enhances decision-making and creates support base for implementation. A context-specific impact assessment can be achieved by weighing the relevance of the ecosystem services. Further research that compares the impact of distinct types of VGS is needed to further develop and validate the model, specifically with regard to grey water treatment, education, and wellbeing.","Vertical Greenery Systems; Ecosystem services; Multi-criteria decision-making; Distribution Centers; Impact Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

Not only in research but in the industry as well, has ML been receiving increasing amounts of interest. Many companies rely on ML models to increase the efficiency of existing processes or offer new services and products. The industry, however, is facing several additional challenges compared to the academic context. One of those challenges is applying the Development Operations (DevOps) model to an ML application, also referred to as MLOps. This thesis sets out to find the specific challenges that practitioners encounter while operationalising ML models. To do so, we perform a single-case case study on an ML pipeline built by the Trade &amp; Communication Surveillance team at the ING bank. This case study consists of conducting a set of interviews and performing a manual code inspection of the pipeline. The team faces challenges ranging from having insufficient time for operationalising each ML project individually to operating in the highlyregulated fintech context. Their pipeline is able to deploy a single ML model but it does not generalise well to other projects. We present the first version of an application that mitigates these challenges. The application is able to deploy ML models to the development environment at ING and can be operated by data scientists to reduce the effort of operationalising an ML model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

However they could also be dynamic, allowing road space to be allocated for a multitude of activities over time. The Code the Streets project envisions a digital system for managing urban mobility in Amsterdam that would allow for this dynamic allocation of road space. Road rules are intended to be used to foster specific civic values such as livability or sustainability within the city. But how do we ensure fairness within such a system? This project explores how we can reimagine the smart allocation of road space in Amsterdam for fairness. Fairness is framed within this project as an ideal that cannot be reached but can be approximated through continuous adaptation. Inspired by literature on contestable AI, the continuous adaptation of the system is approached through stakeholder participation. The project relied on research in the form of literature review, expert interviews, and hands-on experimentation as well as the review of related design work. This research inspired design goals and criteria for the project’s design outcome: a system map and a speculative prototype. The map presents a system in which stakeholders have substantial influence over the values that the system and its design process foster. The speculative prototype, a low-tech user experience installation, makes parts of this system tangible and presents a provocative proposal for an alternative perspective on the current practice of road space allocation. The project ultimately produced several insights contributing to existing literature in the fields of public AI and design methodology research as well as delivering recommendations for Code the Streets.","Artificial intelligence; Mobility; Speculative Design; Ethics; Fairness; Road rules; Road infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Due to the growing need for high efficiency solar cells, new materials such as perovskites are being researched. While the conventional experimental methods are still used to test new PV materials, PV modelling is gaining importance as an efficient and cheap alternative to physically synthesizing and testing each new material. In the PVMD group at TU Delft, multiple stages of modelling PV materials to study their efficiency have been researched, however, an ab initio method to obtain fundamental opticaland electrical properties of new materials is currently absent. While these properties are currently studied using experimentation, this thesis aims to provide a reliable simulation procedure to calculate the optical and electrical properties of PV materials using Density Functional Theory (DFT) softwareand verify its accuracy.<br/> <br/>The fundamentals of DFT and its implementation in DFT software are first studied to better understand the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) software, on which simulations are performed during this thesis. The VASP software is a plane wave classical DFT software that employs the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method for electron structure calculations and has a wide range of electron density functionals available in its library making it a perfect fit to study optical and electrical properties of materials using DFT. <br/><br/>Based on their success in previous computational research on material properties, the PBE and HSE06 electron density functionals are used in this thesis for simulations. A step-by-step procedure is then developed for simulations on the VASP software using both the PBE and HSE06 functionals detailing every step involved in the simulation, the inputs required at each step and the configuration of the input files at every step in order to obtain the density of states, band structure, band gap and complex refractive index for PV materials. Monocrystalline Silicon, a wellstudied PV material is then used as acase study to examine the accuracy of the developed procedure. <br/><br/>The procedure is then employed to study new and promising solar cell materials such as inorganic halide perovskites and inorganic perovskites with mixed halides. Multiple simulations are performed to study the variation in the band gap and complex refractive index of inorganic perovskites as the composition of the halides is changed. Finally, the trends visible in the properties of the different perovskites are analyzed to better understand the usefulness of the VASP simulations. Finally, recommendations are provided for future research into the study of PV material properties using DFT software such as VASP.","Photovoltaics; Modelling; Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The aviation industry is responsible for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, emitting over one billion tonnes of CO2 in 2018 (Ritchie, 2020). The International Air Transport Association (IATA) committed to net-zero aviation by 2050 (International Air Transport Association, 2022). The first steps toward net-zero aviation can be taken in the ground operations. Air France KLM set the goal for net-zero ground operations by 2030 (KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, n.d. -b). The aircraft hangars are responsible for 67% of all ground operations emissions at KLM (Veldhuizen, van, 2022) and a large portion of those emissions can be regarded to the heating of the hangars. <br/><br/>The process of heating the hangar is neither efficient, nor effective, despite the large amount of energy it consumes. The opening of the hangar doors to pull aircraft in and out of the hangar cause the temperature inside the hangar to approach the outside temperature. It takes 4 to 6 hours for the hangar to be up to the desired temperature again, but oftentimes the hangar doors will have been opened before the desired temperature is reached. It was found that heat in the hangar is firstly needed for the mechanics working there and secondly for the aircraft when specific repairs with a curing element have to be performed. The fluctuations in temperature lead to thermal discomfort for the mechanics (Lampret et al., 2018) and negatively affect the drying times of sealants. <br/><br/>This study discovered potential energy savings of 69% when the base temperature would be lowered to 10°C and heat would be provided locally where it is needed. The 69% in energy savings can be translated to money savings of €60.000,- per winter month (December 2021 taken as reference), or close to €400.000,- per year and 436 tons of CO2. <br/><br/>Alongside the research into potential energy savings in the hangar, ideas were collected within the company. The ideas were visualized and feedback was gathered at different divisions within KLM. The ideas were divided into two main categories, namely Heat Conservation and Local Heating. In the course of the project it was chosen to focus on local heating. The heating analysis showed that conserving the heat in the hangar was not a feasible solution since the hangar doors are opened for too long for heat conservation to be effective. Furthermore, when the base temperature is lowered, and additional heating is done locally where needed, there is not a lot of heat to be preserved in the first place. <br/><br/>The study proposes to lower the base temperature in the hangar to 10°C and provide local heating for the mechanics through heated apparel. The aircraft is heated locally during the curing phase of composite repairs but is often not heated with other curing processes such as after paintjobs. It should be considered to heat the aircraft locally more often to ensure optimal fleet availability.<br","KLM; Aircraft hangar; Heating; Heated apparel; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In this work a straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (SB-VAWT) is explored which can temporary adjusts its rotor blades in order to increase its overall performance. Also, shape memory alloy (SMA) as an actuator is shortly investigated as a potential addition to the wind turbine. After generating and evaluating several concepts, the vertical axis wind turbine shaped in a V (V-VAWT) was still undeveloped and proves to be a potential candidate. There is a relationship between the turbine solidity and the optimal TSR which directly affects the coefficient of power. For design purposes, this is an excellent instrument to utilise. The overall performance of the V-VAWT and the SB-VAWT were compared using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software from ANSYS Fluent. The SB-VAWT and the V-VAWT have the same solidity. Both the dynamic mesh and sliding mesh methods were executed with mainly the standard k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. The results indicated that the SB-VAWT performs better regarding the starting capabilities whereas the V-VAWT performs better at the optimal tip-speed ratio (TSR). However, the V-VAWT does not have a higher absolute power output compared to the SB-VAWT at every TSR. The SB-VAWT is overall the better candidate considering the peak efficiency, average power coefficient, absolute power output and operational range. Therefore, it is not desirable to morph the SB-VAWT into a V-VAWT.","vertical axis wind turbine; VAWT; CFD; actuation; structural adaption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

Scholars have, for example, introduced rough and modified surfaces to reduce turbulent skin friction. One of the technologies proposed in the literature is an array of chevron-shaped protrusions; however, there is no academic consensus on the drag performance of this technique. Furthermore, although the theoretical working mechanism has been documented well, there is no experimental evidence in the literature to support the hypothesis around this mechanism.<br/><br/>In this study, the experiments from the literature are replicated, and new array configurations are tested to characterise the effect of individual parameters on the drag performance. The test plates are manufactured by applying vinyl protrusions of roughly 100 μm in thickness to an aluminium base plate. This thickness corresponds to 5δ<sub>ν </sub>- 6δ<sub>ν</sub> for the design Reynolds number of Re<sub>τ</sub>= 1270. Direct force measurements are performed in the M-tunnel at a Reynolds number range of approximately 630 &lt; Re<sub>τ</sub> &lt; 1850 to determine the drag performance. Furthermore, the coherent structures are characterised by means of 2D-2C PIV of a wall-parallel plane at a minimum distance of 17δ<sub>ν</sub> from the wall.<br/><br/>The drag reduction reported in the literature could not be replicated, and the balance measurement results offer relevant insights into the drag performance of chevron-shaped protrusions. The results consistently show that the added roughness due to the presence of the protrusions is not the only parameter that determines the drag performance, confirming a meaningful interaction between the protrusions and the flow. Moreover, the results are found to be highly sensitive to the randomisation of the array. No substantial effect of the protrusions on the coherent structures close to the wall has been observed. In particular, no evidence has been observed that supports the working mechanism as proposed in the literature.<br/><br/>An analysis of possible causes to explain the discordance between this study and the literature is performed. Based on this analysis and the results from the aforementioned parametric study, an improved design is proposed, and recommendations for future research are postulated. This technology has inherent benefits for real-world implementations as it can easily be (retro)fitted to aircraft by means of a foil. Further research into this flow control technique is thereby deemed relevant due to the combination of the large drag reduction reported in the literature, the advantages in practical applications, and the novel opportunities for additional investigations.","drag reduction; turbulent boundary layer; protrusions; chevron","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-05","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

With the Add-in strategy, something is isolated from the inside, with the Wrap-it strategy from the outside and with the Add-on strategy something is added to the existing. With the Add-in strategy, it is important that the material is somewhat resistant to moisture because of possible moisture accumulation. To promote the use of biobased materials, a set of examples will be developed showing the application of these materials in these three different strategies. However, the choice of a material application depends on a number of factors. During this research, the CO2 sequestration through fast growing materials, CO2 footprint, cost, thickness, weight, lifespan and source location are investigated. The results of this research are shown in Appendix 1. From the research it can be concluded that fast growing materials have a great potential with regard to CO2 sequestration. For example, grass insulation appears to be able to store the most CO2 per year per hectare of land compared to other insulation materials. Other findings are that I-joist constructions create fewer cold bridges, which can have a positive effect on the Rc value, decreasing the total width of a panel. Research also shows that straw scores different areas, namely lowest CO2 emissions, longest lifespan and most affordable. All the knowledge gained from the research comes together in the set of examples (Appendix 3). Here the different materials are combined with each other, whereby elements of the three strategies for retrofitting external walls are sorted according to the various testing factors. The different material combinations give an idea of how these elements can be built up. However, these can still be varied and further developed, and are intended to help the user in the initiation phase of choosing a building method for a building.","Biobased; Retrofitting; CO2 Sequestering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Engineering","Architectural Engineering Graduation Studio",""

But to speed up its development, a lot of emphasis is made on conducting tandem solar cell device simulations to have get a good idea on the experiments that can be carried out. Solar cell simulations for tandem devices are carried out in advanced 2D/3D solar cell simulators like SETFOS or Synopsys TCAD Sentaurus. These softwares have large computational time and have complex user interface making simulations challenging. There are 1D solar cell simulators like ASA (Advanced Semiconductor Analysis) developed at TU Delft that has less computational time with an easy and intuitive interface. But ASA does not have the appropriate tunnelling models to simulate the tunnel recombination junction characteristics of perovskite silicon tandem devices. <br/><br/>To make ASA a complete software suite for simulating perovskite silicon tandem device, tunnelling models proposed by Ieong et al. is used for both direct and band to band tunnelling. These tunnelling models use basic inputs like band energy data, electrostatic potential data and electric field data for a particular device and outputs the tunnelling generation rate that can simply be added to the continuity equations for electrons or holes during the simulation of the device. A fully fledged algorithm was designed for the automation of the direct tunnelling and the band to band tunnelling process with limited input from the user while using the models proposed by Ieong et al. In simple terms, the algorithm takes in the required input and scans through the device for every interface to check for tunnel contributions and performs calculations when necessary. All necessary conditions are included inside the algorithms to ensure that the simulation is accurately solved.<br/><br/>The validation of the newly developed tunnelling algorithm was commenced for PN junction, Silicon hetero-junction and finally the Perovskite-Silicon tandem device. The JV curve for the above device simulations with and without incorporated tunnelling models was extracted and a comparison was made with literature results and simulation results from other software suites. The newly developed tunnelling algorithms was concluded to be accurate. The JV curve obtained from the ASA simulation showed good agreement with literature results and simulation results from other software suites with error percentages of less than 3% for open circuit voltage, short circuit current and fill factor. With proper tuning of the device layer thickness, texturing on multiple layers for the tandem device and enhancing the mobility of the non-absorber layers for the perovskite top cell, further improvement can be expected in the simulation. These methods can eventually lead to reaching the Shockley Quisser limit of about 35.7% efficiency for the perovskite silicon tandem solar cell even when general opto-electrical losses are taken into account.","Perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells; ASA; Simulation; multijunction solar cells; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; simulation models; GenPro4; silicon heterojunction; efficiency; High bandgap Perovskite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-05","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Decision-support tools help airlines with disruption management. However, long computational times are associated with integrated recovery models that compute globally optimal solutions, which makes these tools unfit for large airlines. Faster sequential approaches have been proposed, which recover one resource at a time, but often only provide local optima. This paper presents a real-time decision-support tool to solve the integrated airline recovery problem. The model simultaneously recovers the schedule and allocates aircraft and pilot pairs to the flights, while minimizing additional incurred costs. Passengers are implicitly recovered by considering missed connections. Recovery actions include delaying and cancelling flights, swapping aircraft, and swapping, deadheading or using reserve crew. A machine-learned ranking algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the problem by selecting a subset of the resources that are likely to be involved in the recovery plan, such that only part of the network is considered. The decision-support tool was evaluated on disruption scenarios of one of the largest airlines in the world: Delta Airlines. The results show that the machine learning selection reduces the average computational time 15- fold compared to the integrated recovery model that uses the complete network, increasing the percentage of solutions computed under two minutes from 13% to 96%. The proposed model is able to find globally optimal solutions in 58% of the cases and yields similar results in terms of delays, but more flight cancellations in comparison with the globally optimal solutions. The proposed integrated model found a feasible solution to all disruption instances, while a benchmarked sequential model returned infeasible solutions in 4.4% of the cases. Besides, the sequential model produces 68% more flight cancellations, 4 times more aircraft sink node violations and twice as many crew sink node violations in comparison with the proposed integrated airline recovery model.","Disruptions; Airline; Recovery; Integrated; Machine Learning; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Air Transport and Operations","",""

Generally, we find that modules operating in tropical high irradiance climates have the lowest efficiency. For all locations, the difference in losses compared to STC follow similar trends. When the two-terminal perovskite/silicon module is simulated at STC, the loss distribution of the fundamental, optical, electrical, and system losses are 54.8%, 8.9%, 8.5%, and 0.1%, leaving a DC module efficiency of 27.7%.<br/>At real-world operating conditions, various differences can be found. The most significant differences are the thermalization, reflection, and recombination losses, which increase with 1.4%, 1.1%, and 0.5% respectively for the two terminal perovskite/silicon tandem module. Furthermore, the simulated two-terminal module has a higher efficiency than the three-terminal modules for all operating<br/>conditions due to lower mismatch losses.<br/>Additionally, this study was able to quantify the fill factor gain for two-terminal devices. Due to spectral variations, there can be a mismatch between the absorbed current in the top cell and bottom cell, which can lead to losses. However, this loss is partially compensated by an increase in fill factor. For example, a current mismatch of 7.0% is reduced to a power mismatch loss of 1.2%, due to an increase in fill factor. Therefore, the power mismatch should be used as an indicator for mismatch losses instead of the current mismatch.<br/>Finally, this study simulated different improvements on operating conditions. The results show that solar tracking does not only increase the in-plane irradiance of the PV system, but can also increase the efficiency. For example, dual-axis tracking can increase the efficiency with 1.1%. Also, the gain of active cooling is simulated and quantified. The increase of efficiency when cooling at 20oC<br/>compared to a PV system without cooling is around 0.4%, mostly caused by decrease in emission and recombination losses. Furthermore, the optimal perovskite thickness for real world conditions is found, by simulating different thicknesses for the perovskite layer. The results shows that the optimal<br/>thickness under STC (575 nm) is also optimal under real-world operating conditions. Finally, the optimal bandgap energies for reducing the fundamental losses are found for tandem cells. For all conditions (including STC), the optimal bandgap energies for the top and bottom cell are 1.73 and 0.94 eV respectively.<br","Loss analysis; Tandem PV; Fill factor gain; solar tracking; Energy yield of PV system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-05","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Thus, these structures are important in many applications in geosciences. Yet, little research has been done to test the effect stylolites have on the strength of limestones, due to their seemingly obvious role as stress concentrators. Furthermore, there has been no research into whether the morphology of stylolites plays a role into this weakening, and to what extent. Ultrasonic monitoring using coda-wave decorrelation has shown to be effective in monitoring temporal changes in homogeneous rocks during loading tests in the laboratory. However, no research has shown that this technique can detect small changes in rock deformation for rocks with stylolites. To investigate the effect stylolites and their morphology has on the mechanical and acoustic behaviors of limestones experimentally, uniaxial compression tests with active source ultrasonic testing were performed on Treuchtlinger Marmor samples containing sedimentary stylolites and Meyrargues Limestone samples containing tectonic stylolites. Samples were grouped based on stylolite morphology using a novel classification<br/>scheme utilizing the geometric features of 2D traces of the stylolites. Acoustic data was analyzed in conjunction with stress-strain curves, by utilizing coda-wave decorrelation, which allowed small perturbations such as microcracks and pore-collapse in the rocks to be detected. Additionally, X-ray micro-CT experiments were conducted on some samples pre and post-deformation, for greater insight into the weakening effect of stylolites. These experiments found that stylolites, for almost all samples, weaken the rock, however, this weakening effect depends on the degree of stylolite morphology. In these cores, the larger the stylolitized zone, the greater the strength of the rock, when compared to samples containing stylolites. Additionally, stylolite morphology impacts the frequency content of ultrasonic waves, whereby rougher stylolites attenuate higher frequencies during loading.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

During the structural reassessment process, a problem related to an outdated or even missing documentation of the in-use infrastructure occurred. This issue forced utility companies to gather the data regarding the geometry of the lattice towers on-site, using specialized and labor-intensive geodetic measuring methods. The scale of the required data acquisition endeavor and stability checks to be performed encouraged the use of alternative methods to capture the geometry of the in-situ structures and reconstruct geometric models to be applied during the structural stability checks in a reliable and efficient way. <br/><br/>This work presents an innovative method to generate a geometric CAD model using point cloud data captured by a LiDAR scanner. The CAD model can be later implemented for FEA utilized during structural stability assessments. The modeling process defined in this study is fully automatized, enabling to obtain repeatable results and save the time required for manual data processing. For the input point cloud data, two types: Aerial and Terrestrial LiDAR point clouds have been investigated allowing to identify the applicability of both data sets for the proposed method. <br/><br/>The model generated with the automatic method proposed in this study is compared in terms of geo-metric discrepancies to an idealized model based on design documentation and a LiDAR point cloud based model manually generated with a commercial software. The two models used for comparison depict a traditional structural engineering approach and a state-of-the-art method within the point cloud processing field accordingly. At the final stage of this work, the automatically generated point cloud based model is used for a non-linear FEA and compared to a FEA response of the idealized mod-el. <br/><br/>Results showcase that LiDAR point cloud data is a good source of geometric information to reconstruct a geometric CAD model which can later be implemented in FEA. Obtained results are comparable to the ones of an idealized model based on design documentation in terms of collapse mechanism and ultimate load applied at the failure step. Additionally, the geometrical comparison between the point cloud based models generated with the manual method and the one proposed in this work underline the ad-vantage of the automatic method in terms of permissible level of detail and overall precision of the final geometric model. What is more, the impact of point cloud data usage for FEA modeling is shown. Investigating differences between FEA results of the point cloud based and idealized models allow to showcase the influence of real life imperfections on force redistribution across the analyzed structure and ultimate forces reached by members loaded in compression.<br/><br/>The modeling method and analysis results presented in this work can be applied as a set of guidelines for future applications related to point cloud data processing of steel lattice structures used for FEA modeling purposes.<br","Point Cloud; Steel structures; Lattice tower; power grids; Laser scanning; FEM analysis; FEM modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Experiential components are therefore expected to become central in human automotive mobility. In this context, the design of future in-vehicle experiences is a research gap to still discover, that concerns both academia and industry alike.<br/><br/>This graduation project explored the opportunities of using robotics and AI technology for the provision of meaningful autonomous in-vehicle experiences. In that aim, different user interfaces (UIs) were analyzed, as a way to visualize and study different user-technology interactions. The outcomes of the research comprise recommendations about promising scenarios that could be included in autonomous vehicles as well as insights into how different UIs shape user experiences differently.<br/><br/>The project first reviewed prior academic work on the topics of fundamental needs (from positive design), vehicle automation, user experience design, robotics, AI, and user interfaces. A research approach was proposed based on that analysis; because robotics and AI present ample capabilities, in-vehicle scenarios should be designed first, to later define (through UIs) the role that technology should have in those scenarios. These are the research questions that were proposed:<br/><br/>1. What in-vehicle scenarios can be designed to support <br/>fundamental needs?<br/>• How do different user interfaces enable those use cases?<br/>• How do different types of user interfaces affect the in-vehicle user experiences?<br/><br/>2. What are the most promising scenario and user interface <br/>combinations?<br/><br/>To answer those questions, a co-creative workshop was designed, with the aim of collecting user needs and perceptions as data. The participants were asked to envision future needs in AVs, based on the typology of 13 fundamental needs, as well as to design meaningful scenarios that would fulfill them. Through a questionnaire, they voted for the most promising scenarios (i.e., most attractive and most innovative scenarios). The workshop was conducted three times and a total of 18 participants were recruited.<br/><br/>The preliminary results from the workshop were 13 meaningful scenarios, each of them aimed at fulfilling one fundamental need; additionally, those scenarios were adapted to ambient, graphical, and tangible UIs. Besides, promising UI and scenario combinations were identified, according to the participant‘s perspective. Finally, insights were clustered on how different UIs shape the in-vehicle user experience. Those outcomes were contrasted and enriched in validation sessions, where a total of six field experts contributed. The experts brought in insights from the HCI, future mobility, and positive design fields.<br/><br/>This research aims to contribute to both industrial and academic practices. First, fundamental needs and sub-needs have been explored in the context of autonomous vehicles. Second, design directions and examples are offered for the development of meaningful in-vehicle experiences. Additionally, conclusions on how users perceive tangible, graphical, and ambient UIs are given, which could be used as guidelines for designing interactions. Finally, insights are offered about how end-users perceived innovations, as well as how innovative and attractive solutions are differently framed.<br/><br/>Finally, additional research paths were revealed through the study, that future research may consider. For instance, activity-based fundamental need hierarchies could vary across different demographic groups. Apart from that, further work could be done in the classification of the UIs, as well as in mapping out the interactions that they enabled. Finally, in-vehicle scenarios could be related to the concept of ’innovation adoption’ to study what solutions to develop further in the coming years.<br","autonomous vehicles; user experience; fundamental needs; user interfaces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Most microvalves to date are made by using silicon micro-machining, which is a complex manufacturing process, or soft lithography using Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which has a high gas permeability. Next to that most microvalves in literature have small actuation forces resulting in small pressure ranges and large leakages at low pressure levels. In this paper, a normally open microvalve which is fabricated by only using 3D printing techniques with a bio-compatible resin is presented, making it more easy and accessible to manufacture. The novelty is the integrated micro-channels, membrane and microfluidic connections in a single 3D printed piece. The utilized actuator is a commercially available piezo stack, which has a displacement of 34 µm at 150V. Due to its large actuation force the microvalve can modulate fluids from -600 to 600 mbar, with measured flow-rate levels between 0-90 µl/min and projected flow-rate levels between 0-410 µl/min. In fully closed state the leakage-rate of the microvalve is 1.67 µl/min at 600 mbar, with a static power consumption of 442.5 mW. Subsequently it is shown that after using higher clamping torques (&gt; 0.7 Nm) the microvalve can operate leakage free up to 1.5 bar. Additionally a 3-to-1 fluid selector is designed using three microvalves, which can be integrated into a portable microfluidic platform for Organ-on-Chip (OoC) applications.","microvalve; monolithic; piezo stack; fluid-selector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

To optimize and improve the design of these joints, it is essential to find out the changes that the components inside a cable joint go through. In this thesis, the effects of accelerated thermal ageing on electrical and mechanical properties of medium voltage cable joints have been investigated. For this research, three cable joint components were selected, that are being used and developed at Lovink Enertech. These components are silicone grease (insulation used at cable insulation-deflector interface), Lovisil (main insulation liquid filled inside the joint) and deflectors (geometric field grading to distribute electric field). These components were thermally aged and then tested, with the aim of observing the extent of change in physical and electrical properties.<br/>Silicone grease was tested for its breakdown strength, under normal and tangential voltage application. Normal breakdown strength of unaged grease was measured at different temperatures, and of aged samples was performed at 50 °C, as that is the average operating temperature inside a cable joint. Tangential breakdown strength test was performed on XLPE and unaged silicone grease interface, at room temperature. It was observed that the breakdown strength under normal electric field of silicone grease reduced with ageing and with operating temperature. Also, the tangential breakdown strength is approximately half of the normal breakdown strength. For the deflectors, experiments to determine hardness of the material, young’s modulus, conductivity and weight of silicone grease absorbed into the deflector, were performed to characterize and compare the material properties at different stages of ageing. It was observed that silicone grease got absorbed into the defector at all ageing temperatures, as the weight of the deflectors increased. Hardness of the inner surface also increased with ageing. Whereas there was not a considerable change in young’s modulus and conductivity of deflector samples. Lovisil was thermally aged and tested to observe changes in its breakdown strength and influence of crosslinker polymer on the same. The measurements were made using Baur vessel, sphere-sphere electrode configuration and under two voltage applications: constant ramp and step voltage. Lovisil got darker with ageing and a decrease in the breakdown value was observed. Measuring breakdown strength under constant ramp voltage gave more reliable and repeatable results in comparison to step voltage. It was also noted that crosslinker enhances the dielectric properties of the Lovisil and is responsible for its curing and discoloration.<br/>Three joints of 12/20(24) kV were prepared and aged to see if silicone grease helps in avoiding degradation at the cable insulation-deflector interface. It was observed that not applying silicone grease at the interface led to a degradation, whereas applying it did not cause any damage even after overstressing the joints. These tests also validated the newly developed silicone grease as an insulation at the interface. <br","Breakdown Strength; Silicone grease; Cable joint; Deflector; Thermal Ageing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Optimal homogeneous configurations outperformed all heterogeneous configurations irrespective of number of TCPMs in parallel or reference signal. For unidirectional configurations, a nontrivial fiber diameter optimizes tracking performance. For antagonistic configurations, tracking performance improves monotonically with increasing fiber diameter.","Artificial Muscle; twisted and coiled polymer muscle; Redundant actuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulators do not know how goods flow from supplier to retailer. There is uncertainty about whom is involved, where goods originate from, and what quantities are being shipped. Simulation models are effective tools to find measures against the distribution of illicit goods such as personal protective equipment. However, simulation models often solely handle uncertainty through the variation of parameters. Structural uncertainty, which is uncertainty in the structure of the model, is often neglected. This study focuses on accounting efficaciously for structural<br/>uncertainty in supply chain simulation models using model-driven exploratory modelling.<br/><br/>Model composability, which is a specific form of model driven exploratory modelling, is used in this study. The methodology is applied to a supply chain of illicit personal protective equipment. Using a model composer, many plausible models are generated of this supply chain. A model composer works by coupling model components in different configurations, while complying to preset constraints. Model components are submodels of a supply chain actors, for example, a retailer. Constraints help to restrict the way the model components can be coupled, making sure that every model generated by the model composer is plausible.<br/><br/>A ground truth is established to test the model composer on its efficacy to account for structural uncertainty. A ground truth is a simulation model of an illicit supply chain that functions as a benchmark. Five sets of 100 models are generated by the model composer to estimate the ground truth. Each set of models is generated with a different set of constraints. A constraint set consists of elements such as the maximum number of suppliers, the locations of supply chain actors, and the maximum number of customers of a supplier. These sets reflect different perspectives on an illicit supply chain.<br/><br/>Results show that structural uncertainty can result in significantly different simulation outcomes. The time in system, the production time, and the international transport time depend the most on changes in the constraints of the model composer. The time in system, the production time, and the international transport time of the models generated by the model composer are significantly different from the ground truth. The distributions of these outcomes have a different shape and have a wider range of possible values. Therefore, this study shows that model composability, a specific form of model-driven exploratory modelling, is efficacious in accounting for structural uncertainty in supply chain simulation models.<br/><br/>In the future, the methodology shown in this study can be used to model structural uncertainty in other fields such as water pipes networks, gas pipes networks, and telecom networks. Furthermore, the methodology can be used to identify robust measures to tackle the problem of illicit supply chains. Another recommendation is to use model composability for the individual components of the model. For example, a component such as a retailer can be build from several components: a cash register, a shelf, and a distribution area.","Structural uncertainty; Simulation; Uncertainty; Model composability; Supply Chain; Illicit Supply Chains; Exploratory Modeling; Discrete Event Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","51.895987, 4.299775"

To manufacture devices in the scale of nanometer cost-effectively, an accurate measurement for lithography process calibrating is necessary. Ptychography is a computational imaging technique which has the potential to serve as a metrology solution for semiconductor devices. It can reconstruct complex-valued permittivity function of an object from an extensive set of measured intensities of the diffraction patterns in the far field. It should be noted that also 2D and 3D a-periodic objects can be measured with this technique. Currently, this technique has been widely used in reconstructing thin and weakly scattering (satisfying the first Born approximation) objects in a transmission geometry (detectors and sources are placed on different sides of the objects).We propose an accurate 3D ptychography multi-layer Born model, and apply it to reconstruct refractive index distributions of semi-conductors. This model slices the sample into thin layers and first Born approximations are applied to each layer sequentially. For a transmission geometry, this model considers both forward scattering effects and backward scattering effects \cite{Chen2020Multi-layerMicroscopy}, as opposed to normal beam propagation models. For reflection geometry (detectors and sources are placed on the same side of the object), this model collects reflected fields on each layer of the sample and these fields will interact with the object again later together with other upwards fields. This procedure enables detectors arranged in a reflection geometry to gather complete information about the object. We implement the model on the existing ptychography platform based on the auto-differentiation (AD) solvers and manage to reconstruct high-resolution images of 3D objects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro-optics and Optomechatronics","",""

However, the algorithmic and quantitative systems do not seem to access people’s experiences, which always include emotional and qualitative factors. How can an AI system understand people’s feelings? How can an AI system like GANs optimize for meaningful human values, like beauty?<br/><br/>Our approach<br/>In this project, I mainly build two approaches for designers to translate the human experience into GANs. Starting from the exploration of GANs, I investigate their potential chances to “understand” human experience. Then, the qualitative research<br/>on human experience reveals the aesthetic factors influencing people’s feelings<br/>about GANs‘ output. Through the interviews, some pain points from AI product<br/>designers are concluded. Combining the exploration results in those three scopes, I<br/>hypothesize that retraining with the highly-rated images and building new computational models to iterate the factors from the human evaluation can help designers inform the AI system about the human experience. I cooperated with CSE students and proposed two approaches- CURATION APPROACH and ALGORITHMIC<br/>AESTHETIC APPROACH- based on the above assumptions. The build process demonstrates the achievability of the assumptions. In the evaluation part, the retrained images in both methods are rated higher than the original ones. Both approaches are proved to be practical and feasible.<br/><br/>Our result<br/>For the curation approach, all produced models with highly-rated images outperformed the original model. The original model’s score is 0.2. When replacing 500,1000,2985 highly-rated images into the input dataset, their scores increased to 0.245, 0.269, and 0.255. For the algorithmic aesthetic approach, we select three categories of images(coastline, forest/desert, arctic). In each category of images, three factors are selected to improve. Among the nine groups whose corresponding factors are iterated by algorithms, eight groups’ new images are rated higher by people than the original images. The curation and algorithmic aesthetic approaches are verified to help inform AI systems of human experience.<br/><br/>Potential impact<br/>Following the curation and algorithmic approaches, designers can successfully inform GANs about people’s aesthetic evaluation of their images. Using the human experience to improve AI systems is a starting point. It also proves the importance of the human experience for AI and provides a template for designers in all AI fields to inform their AI systems of human experience.","Aesthetic; Human Centered Design; Generative Adversarial Networks; Artifical Intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

With charging light EVs being the main focus in the past decade, a trend of promoting the charging infrastructures dedicated to heavy-duty EVs (HDEVs) such as E-trucks, and Ebuses has emerged to further the electrification of global transportation. Accordingly, the market is calling for advantageous standards, architectures, and power electronic circuits specialized in the fast charging of HDEVs. For the charging of HDEVs, the power rating of chargers can reach an ultra-high-power level (&gt;1 MW) to ensure a charging time comparable to the refueling time of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. At this power rating, the classic full power processing (FPP) two-stage AC-DC plus DC-DC architecture has limited space for improvement in terms of the efficiency and effective cost of the charger circuits. <br/>This thesis proposes a solution to the HDEV fast charger topologies. Firstly, the<br/>state-of-the-art EV fast charging technology, concepts of the hybrid rectifier, and partial power processing (PPP), which could be beneficial in advancing<br/>the charging architecture are reviewed. Based on the results of the literature review, a new unidirectional Input-Parallel-Output-Series (IPOS) three-phase hybrid rectifer topology is proposed and analyzed. This topology is derived from<br/>the Input-Parallel-Output-Parallel (IPOP) hybrid rectifier in [1] by connecting the<br/>DC-links in series instead of in parallel. The IPOS topology is beneficial at ultrahigh power rating to interface heavy-duty EV batteries which require a high and wide output voltage range, enabling the system to deliver an output voltage range of 800∼1500 V to interface the next-generation of EV batteries with available 600/1200V commercial semiconductors. Besides, the proposed topology is efficient, cost-effective, and scalable with the grid input current harmonic components in compliance with the IEEE-519 standard. The benefits of the IPOS topology are supported by circuit derivation, control strategy, analytical modelling, simulation, and experimental verification of the current modulation technique. <br/>Index terms— fast charging, hybrid rectifier, partial power processing, power factor correction, AC–DC converter","fast charging; hybrid rectifer; AC–DC converter; partial power processing; power factor correction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bourgeois, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With the rise of digital technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies, all the products we use every day are increasingly becoming ‘intelligent’. Machines, objects, and tools are slowly evolving into robots, objects-with-intent (Rozendaal et al., 2019), and agents. At the same time, their capabilities are also increasing. These capabilities come from their ability to process large amounts of data. In this digital era, how can designers create user-centric solutions by leveraging the strengths of these digitally-enabled products at an early stage in the design process?<br/><br/>This thesis explores this topic in the context of pedestrian mobility. More specifically, outdoor mobility for people with vision impairments. When people with vision impairments travel, they must process an extensive amount of spatial information without relying on their vision. How can an agent partner with these users to make this process less demanding and thus, make it easier for people with vision impairments to travel independently?<br/><br/>Combining these two visions, this thesis focuses on uncovering the problem areas, information needs, and desires of PVIs traveling outdoors by leveraging behavioral data. Two main user studies, both involving different types of behavioral data have been explored. <br/><br/>Based on the exploratory research, in which physiological data was collected, two behavioral states, ‘following’ and ‘reorienting’, were identified. These two states also reflected the PVI's mental state, moments of ease, and moments of uncertainty. This inspired the initial idea for a user-aware navigation agent, which could announce different types of data depending on whether the user was ‘following’ a route or ‘reorienting’ on the route.<br/><br/>In the evaluative research, the agent’s capability to detect the two states was tested by training a machine learning algorithm. In addition, a second evaluative user study was conducted to test the hypothesis of the information needs in the ‘following’ and ‘reorienting‘ states. The study setup was designed to generate a new type of behavioral data, which consists of the location users requested additional information. Thus, the user needs were quantified. <br/><br/>This kind of behavioral data; one that embeds rich information about the user needs, becomes the building block of future prototypes of the user-aware navigation agent. Those iterations will then produce more data that embed further insights. This positive feedback cycle will be key to keeping the PVIs constantly in the product development loop and hopefully, result in a navigation agent that allows PVIs to easily travel safely and independently. <br","data-centric design; human-agent interaction; visually impaired people","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the field of mining and dredging engineering, oftentimes slurries are involved in transport. Understanding the behaviour of these slurries in a flow is important as the energy and water consumption need to be determined. The slurries have an interesting rheology due to the presence of clay. The rheological parameters cause the flow to be non-Newtonian. Further, the presence of coarse solids (sand particles) in these slurries also influences the rheological parameters. Through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, these aspects can be predicted.<br/>Previous work in non-Newtonian CFD with coarse solids made use of a free surface flow through a rigid-lid approach (van Rhee, 2017). A shortcoming of this is that the flow needs to be uniform and the flowdepth needs to be known beforehand. In the mining and dredging fields, this is not the case and a different approach is required.<br/>This report will focus on multiphase CFD simulations. One of the fluids will be a non-Newtonian model including sand particles, and the other fluid will just be air. The sand particles will be subjected to transport, segregation, and settling behaviour.<br/>OpenFOAM is the weapon of choice, but as it stands it does not have a solver that’s capable of including sand particles. The interFoam solver is chosen as a starting point and it’s code is adjusted. A Bingham Plastic transport model is implemented, including sand particles. A sand transport equation is also implemented.<br/>Using the adjusted interFoam solver, two sets of simulations are ran. A first set of simulations is performed using a 2D mesh for an open channel. The first simulation utilizes a Bingham Plastic fluid without any sand particles included. The resulting velocity profile is compared to the analytical solution and is found to agree well. The second open channel simulation includes sand particles. The results show a sand bed forming as well as the sand concentration to be roughly constant throughout the plug flow. This is compared to experimental work and concluded effects is captured well from a qualitative perspective.<br/>The second set of simulations is performed using a 3D mesh for a pipe section. These results were not as satisfying as the results for the 2D open channel. Unfortunately, all 3D pipe simulations either showed the pipe to fully fill up with the Bingham Plastic fluid, or the solver crashed at some point. Many attempts have been made at this, and no conclusive reason has been pointed out as the cause for this.<br/>It’s recommended to continue research in this direction with the main focus being the simulation stability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This evolution brings about concerns regarding social equity, which refers to the fairness of distribution of certain attributes to groups or individuals. Transport equity is one of the dimensions of this issue, and accessibility distribution is a commonly used indicator for its measurement. Such measurements are applied to urban transport systems to analyze the ease of accessing public services and areas of economic activity. With the development of complex network metrics and increased availability of historical data, temporal analysis of transport systems is gaining more attention. Complex network models based on graph-theoretical approaches provide a repeatable means for quantitative analysis of transport systems in terms of accessibility to opportunities. This research investigates the development of transport equity from the lens of spatial accessibility distribution over time and seeks to analyze its evolution using complex network theory. A random walk based accessibility methodology is developed for this purpose. This methodology is tested in a quantitative case-study, where the City of Helsinki is analyzed in terms of accessibility to education opportunities via walking as a travel mode. The results show that the developed methodology is useful for the identification of accessibility distribution, as well as equity evaluation. With the aid of topological network indicators, and spatial analysis of school locations, the effect of transport systems and land use can be distinguished. This method requires a complete data availability for each historical timestep, as well as adaptation of its parameters based on real-world travel behavior and infrastructural changes. Future research should investigate the multi-layer approach with the inclusion of other travel modes in the model. Furthermore, accessibility to other opportunities such as job locations can be tested with this methodology.","Complex Network Analysis; Accessibility; Equity; Graph Theory; Temporal Spatial Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The research focus is currently on vehicle technology and pedestrian warning systems. Whether aiding pedestrians with camera views from unobstructed positions helps to overcome the view occlusion problem is unclear.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Methods: Twenty-eight participants engaged in a virtual reality urban road crossing scenario, in which they took on the role of a pedestrian. The pedestrian was situated on the curb and positioned such that the view on the road was largely obstructed. An autonomous vehicle approached and drove past from the left of the pedestrian. Through a head-mounted display, the participants experienced seven prototypes: baseline (i.e., no display), see-through display, transparent car, and both a head-locked and body-locked display with and without view guidance. The order in which participants encountered the prototypes was determined by a balanced Latin square, and each interface was tested by means of six trials with a non-yielding and a yielding scenario randomly selected such that in total three non-yielding and three yielding scenarios occurred in each block. The participants were instructed to continuously indicate whether they felt safe to cross by pressing a button. The interface's acceptance, workload and preference were measured with questionnaires. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Results: The participants' perceived feeling of safety revealed improved performance for all interfaces compared to the baseline condition. For the baseline condition, in which the vulnerable road user did not have access to occlusion-free information, the perceived feeling of safety was the lowest on average and decreased the earliest in the autonomous vehicle approaching phase, as well as scoring the lowest rating on acceptance. The see-through display and the transparent car interfaces, which used a combination of augmented and diminished reality properties to convey the information in a world-anchored manner to the pedestrians, achieved a higher acceptance and perceived feeling of safety than the head-locked and body-locked display interfaces.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Conclusion: A vulnerable road user's perceived feeling of safety can be increased by means of camera views from unobstructed positions to help overcome the view occlusion problem in common road crossing scenarios. This study's findings suggest a positive effect for diminished reality techniques for pedestrians, and future research could examine this technology further in more demanding scenarios.","Diminished Reality; Augmented Reality; VRU; Pedestrian Safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

They can result in casualties, massive damage, and hurt the economy. Therefore, one would like to predict earthquakes as early as possible and with the highest accuracy possible. This paper contains the proposal for the optimal prediction-time, which is the time between the execution of a prediction and the actual earthquake strike, for deep learning models. Only short-term predictions and high-magnitude earthquakes are considered. A prediction means to define whether an earthquake happens or does not happen in an upcoming amount of seconds. A short-term prediction means a forecast to the extent of seconds. A high-magnitude earthquake means an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.5 or higher. This research uses the Long Short Term Memory deep learning model to test the optimal prediction-time value for earthquake predictions.<br/>The optimal value for the prediction-time is found by testing the model with different values for the prediction-time and concluding when the model performs best. For prediction-times from moments before the strike until 40 seconds, the model is performing worse compared to higher prediction-times. The model's performance peaks at a prediction-time of 70. When increasing further than 70, the performance decreases until a prediction-time of one hundred. When rising even further, the performance is stabilising. Thus, for predictions with the highest performance, one should use a prediction-time of 70 seconds.","Earthquake; Deep learning; Prediction; Machine learning; LSTM; long short term memory","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""
