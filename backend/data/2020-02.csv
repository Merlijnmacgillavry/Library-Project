A TW is a period of time during which the aircraft is required to arrive at a waypoint in the flight trajectory. It is characterised by an opening time, which represents the earliest possible time to cross the waypoint, and by a closing time, which represents the latest possible time to cross the same waypoint. Any delay from the TW in crossing the waypoint is as much a distortion of the trajectory as a change in horizontal position. The width of the TW indicates the amount of flexibility that airlines have during flight execution, as aircraft have to remain within the TW to avoid potential demand and capacity imbalances in sectors. The larger the TW width, the more flexibility a flight has. <br/><br/>TW flights allow for flexibility in operations, through the TW width, while simultaneously maintaining predictability. The flight schedules increase traffic predictability as they are developed in the strategic (months before the day of operation) and pre-tactical (seven to one day before operation) flight planning levels. Therefore, they facilitate the development of flight schedules that satisfy demand and capacity imbalances in the air traffic network early in the planning process and provide a common view of the air traffic environment on the day of operation. <br/><br/>This research tackled the challenge of evaluating the impact of the TW concept of operations on individual flight performance during the tactical phase (day of operation) of air traffic flow management. The flight time and fuel consumption needed to adhere to the TWs are under consideration. For the tactical assessment, a control model based on speed adjustments that allow aircraft to track contiguous TWs placed at critical waypoints along the trajectory was proposed.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Transport and Operations","",""

(mentor); van de Giesen, Nick (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Accurate weather forecasting plays an important role in predicting precipitation events. With the warming climate the precipitable water vapour in the atmospheric is increasing. Since weather parameters as precipitable water vapor have a high spatial variability, interpolation of water vapor data over an area of hundreds of kilometer does not have a sufﬁcient quality for weather prediction applications. Nowadays, researchers are investigating if the precipitable water vapour can be quantiﬁed using GPS transmitted signals in a densiﬁed GPS network. An accurate quantiﬁcation of the ionospheric delay is important to efﬁciently calculate the precipitable water vapour. Moreover, the ionospheric delay is the biggest error and limitation of the GPS signal. It is important to understand how the ionospheric delay varies spatially and in time. Therefore, variability in the ionospheric delay is an interesting factor in weather forecasting and climate change. To monitor the ionospheric delay a high temporal (in minutes) and spatial resolution (in km-grid) is needed, because the ionospheric delay changes spatially and throughout the day. A possibility to achieve this is to densify GPS networks. Previous research has shown that it is possible to measure the ionospheric delay with dual frequency receivers. In developing countries this densiﬁcation of GPS networks cannot be achieved with expensive dual-frequency receivers. This study investigates if a higher receiver network density can be achieved with the help of low-cost single frequency receivers. Therefore, a densiﬁed GPS network of dual and single frequency receivers is set-up in and around Kampala, Uganda. This research demonstrates how the Satellite-speciﬁc Epoch-difference Ionospheric Delay model (SEID) can be used to compute the ionospheric delay for a single frequency receiver through time. The SEID model creates a second frequency for a single frequency receiver which is used to resolve the ionospheric delay. The intensity of the ionospheric delay depends on the electrons in the ionosphere. The number of free electrons in the path of a signal is expressed as the total electron content. This research shows how to compute the total electron content in the ionospheric layer of the atmosphere. After computing the second frequency for the single frequency receivers the observations need to be processed using Precise Point Positioning (PPP) to compute the precipitable water vapour. As a case study Uganda is chosen, because it is located on the equator. The ionospheric delay ﬂuctuates more at the equator so this is an interesting region to investigate the variability. The analysis shows that an high accuracy of the GPS signal is needed to create desirable results. Therefore, ﬁeld campaigns with single frequency and dual frequency receivers should incorporate antennas with noise reduction. In order tot assess the accuracy of the ionospheric delay obtained by using single and dual frequency receivers, future research should be focus on better network set-up and getting the right equipment with better noise reduction","GPS; Single frequency receivers; SEID model; Ionospheric Delay","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","TWIGA","0.347596, 32.582520"

However, most of the classical navigation solutions require several steps of data pre-processing and hand tuning of parameters, with separate modules for vision, localization, planning and control. All these modules work independently and make their own parameter assumptions to optimize their own performance without taking into account the effect these assumptions have on the performance of rest of the modules. Hence, even though each module in the whole system tries to achieve an optimal performance for the task it has been assigned, the lack of interdependence exhibited by these modules for decision making means that the overall performance of the whole system is sub-optimal in most of the cases. An alternating approach for addressing these issues is to train certain parts of the vision module to incorporate partial tasks from the planning module. Deep Learning architectures have achieved great success in the field of pattern recognition and object detection and as a result are usually being deployed to design such a module that jointly learns to carry out perception and path planning. This master's thesis, making use of Deep Learning, proposes an End-to-End Learning architecture that learns to directly map raw sensor readings to control commands for a ground based mobile robot.

Currently, chemo-radiation therapy treatments are prescribed as a separately optimized radiotherapy treatment with the addition of a generic chemotherapy regimen. The dosing of the combined therapies is mostly based on clinical experience. Hence there is a clear need for the optimization of dosing for combined chemo-radiation therapy treatments. The goal of this thesis is to propose novel approaches to optimize cancer treatment efficiency when combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy by using control-theoretical methods as well as radiation therapy models. A positive switched system is a dynamic system consisting of a set of Metzler state-space matrices and a specific switching law, which determines when and how to switch between the subsystems. Positive switched systems seem particularly appropriate to model cancer evolution under different treatments, and therefore to determine optimal treatment scheduling. They are used to model the effect of combined chemo-radiation treatments, thus enabling the systematic design of optimal therapy planning. The proposed model is especially appropriate for heterogeneous tumors, since it describes the impact of therapies on different tumor cell lines, and includes the possibility of mutations. Metastases are also included since the model considers separate tumor compartments, and the possibility of migrations between compartments are modeled as well. Undesired consequences due to toxicities are incorporated, and an upper bound can be set to limit the possible damage. A clinical dataset was obtained from the Erasmus MC, which was used to validate chemotherapy-alone model outcomes. Combined chemo-radiation treatments were also developed for a set of initial tumors. The model shows promising applications for cancer treatment design. The use of positive switched systems for combined chemo-radiation treatments is a new approach to obtain optimal drug usage and radiation fractionation schemes for each body compartment. The achieved findings could have a significant impact on effective treatment planning by choosing optimal drug durations or by using radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy, for instance, to target certain chemotherapy-resistant areas, to achieve tumor control with minimal side effects.","optimal control; chemotherapy; radiotherapy; cancer care; combined chemo-radiation therapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-05","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The core of this algorithm is a second order Taylor expansion with which the backscatter is normalized at a reference angle. Studies have shown that the first and second order derivative within this Taylor expansion, known as slope and curvature, are somehow related to the wet biomass and structure of vegetation. The general approach to forward model satellite observations with land surface variables in a data assimilation framework is through a radiative transfer model (Albergel et al., 2017). However, this requires plenty of assumptions about the vegetation canopy (such as stem height, shape, size, orientation etc.) and is therefore relatively inefficient for understanding the impact of soil moisture and vegetation dynamics on backscatter on a large scale. This study investigates the possibility of using support vector machines as a surrogate model instead of a radiative transfer model to link the TU-Wien normalized backscatter and slope to land surface variables soil moisture and leaf area index. The land surface variables are simulations from the CO2-responsive ISBA-A-gs land surface model. Support vector machines have the advantage of providing implicit kernel functions, which make them very useful for non-linear problems. The ISBA-A-gs data is provided by Météo-France. In total, 1324 support vector machines have been optimized through a cross validated grid search. The optimized hyperparameters were shown to have spatial consistency and look promising as an initial approach to forward modelling backscatter and slope. The SVM performances are further investigated through corresponding land cover types of grid points and the land surface variables.","ASCAT; Remote Sensing; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-01","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

Sporting events involving multiple cyclists leads to aerodynamic interactions between the cyclists and these interactions have been exploited for performance benefits. One such aerodynamic interaction is drafting, where cyclists closely follow each other and experience a reduction in aerodynamic drag. The benefits of drafting are profound with drag reductions as high as 49\%. The aerodynamics of drafting have been studied previously using qualitative and quantitative techniques such as wind tunnel test, numerical methods and track testing. However, large discrepancies exist between various studies partly due to the fact that most investigations focus either on flow visualisation or drag measurements, and thus a complete picture is not obtained. The Ring of Fire technique is an innovative flow measurement system that provides both flow field information as well as aerodynamic drag force for full-scale on-site transiting cyclists. <br/><br/>The Ring of Fire technique is used in the current study to investigate the aerodynamics of on-site drafting cyclists in an outdoor environment. The effect of drafting distance and cyclist size on drag reduction are investigated using different configurations of two cyclists in drafting formation. Large-scale time-resolved stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is conducted using Helium Filled Soap Bubbles (HFSB) at cycling speeds of 13.3 m/s. Planar pressure fields are reconstructed from velocity data using the 2D pressure Poisson equation (PPE). Modifications and improvements are made to existing data reduction techniques utilised in previous Ring of Fire experiments. <br/><br/>Qualitative examination of ensemble averaged flow fields is performed for the full wake of an individual cyclist and the near wake of the three cyclists are compared as well. Quantitative analyses of drag area, focusing on variation with distance, sensitivity to wind and statistical uncertainty are conducted. Measurements of individual cyclists show that the size of the cyclist is a qualitative indicator of relative aerodynamic performance between cyclists, provided cycling equipment and skill are reasonably common between them. Statistical uncertainty of the individual measurements are improved from previous outdoor Ring of Fire experiments.<br/><br/>Flow fields from drafting obtained in-between the cyclists and behind both the cyclists, which are compared with the wake of individual cyclists and the main mechanism of drag reduction for the trailing cyclist is addressed. Quantitative analyses of drag area of the leading, trailing and the two cyclists as a group are performed, with a particular emphasis on drag reduction of the trailing cyclist and its dependence on longitudinal and lateral drafting distances. Anomalies in the drag data indicate towards a complex interaction between the leader wake, phase difference in crank angles and the wake of the trailing cyclist.","Cycling aerodynamics; Drafting; Ring of Fire; PIV; Drag Reduction; HFSB; Drafting distance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Its unsurpassed active corrosion inhibiting capabilities, its incredible versatility and its economic benefits made it a popular all-rounder. Nowadays the widely known toxic and carcinogenic nature have restricted its use within the European Union. More and more research in the field of corrosion science has been focussing on finding safer alternatives, since hexavalent chromium was officially added the US annual report on carcinogens in the 1980s. Before it was used in almost every step of corrosion protective schemes consisting of a pre-treatment, a primer and a topcoat. In this work a novel approach to two industrial anodising pre-treatments (sulfuric acid anodising and tartaric sulfuric acid anodising) was investigated in order to improve the corrosion performance of the corrosion sensitive aluminium alloy 2024-T3. Both are currently used as alternatives to the historically often applied chromic acid anodising procedure, which contains hexavalent chromium compounds. In this work the effect of the anodising electrolyte viscosity, the anodising interelectrode distance and the addition of ceric sulphate to the anodising bath were investigated. Different fractions of ethylene glycol were used to vary the electrolyte viscosity. All anodising procedures used a fixed anodising voltage, temperature, acid concentration and agitation speed. These parameters were not changed. All samples were cleaned before anodising. In order to assess the corrosion performance linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and immersion tests were deployed. Furthermore scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to evaluate the chemical composition of the anodised substrates. <br/>It was found that an increase of the electrolyte viscosity results in a decrease of the anodising current density, which was related to a decrease in the overall thickness of the oxide layer created by the anodising process. The addition of 25 vol% ethylene glycol did not show any significant changes in corrosion performance although some indications of a slight improvement were found. Slightly smaller pores and a tighter barrier layer were proposed to be a possible explanation. A fraction of 75 vol% on the other hand dramatically deteriorated the corrosion performance, due to much slower oxide growth kinetics resulting in a much thinner oxide. The addition of ceric sulphate did not lead to any significant improvements in the corrosion performance for any of the tested procedures with one exception. The tartaric acid based procedure without ethylene glycol addition did show a significant improvement. Negatively charged complexes of cerium and tartaric acid compounds, which are supposed to be drawn towards the substrate during anodising, were proposed to be a possible explanation. The interelectrode distance did not show any significant differences except for the tartaric acid based procedure with ceric sulphate but without ethylene glycol addition. A higher electric field strength as a results of the smaller interelectrode distance was held responsible. The electric field strength should directly affect the amount of cerium complexes attracted towards the substrate, increasing the chance of cerium ending up as residues in the pores of the anodic oxide layer.","Anodising; Corrosion; Aluminium; AA2024-T3; Chromium-6; Chromic acid; Sulfuric acid; Tartaric acid; Ethylene glycol; Interelectrode distance; Inhibitor; Cerium; Linear sweep voltammetry; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; Immersion tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Furthermore, the fear of falling has a significant influence on the life of the elderly, and therefore they reduce their physical activity. Two new balance assistive devices are being developed to reduce the risk of falling. Both devices use a control moment gyroscope (CMG) to generate a moment to counter the falling motion. One device consists of a single CMG. The other device consists of two CMGs that are coupled such that the gimbals rotate in opposite direction. This is called a scissored pair CMG (SPCMG). The purpose of this study was to examine whether it is possible to design an (SP)CMG with a passive mechanism that exploits gyroscopic precession of gimbal(s) to emulate different types of impedances for balance assistance. To examine this, first, the equations of motion of a CMG and an SPCMG were derived. Next, the equations of motion were used to derive the impedance of the system. The impedance was optimized such that it would simulate the behaviour of a spring, a damper, a mass, a mass-spring-damper system, and a rotational PD controller which is proportional to the XCoM (PDXCoM), a measure of stability. The optimization used a gradient-based algorithm to find the minimum. Multiple optimizations with different random initial guesses were performed to increase the chance to find the global minimum. Two sets of optimizations were performed.<br/>One optimization with and one optimization without bounds on the optimization. The sets parameters that led to the best fit were used in a walking simulation to calculate the moments the device would generate during normal walking.

However, it was not possible to replicate the dynamics of the PDXCoM with a CMG and an SPCMG. A walking simulation showed that the generated moments of the (SP)CMG were in the opposite direction of the angular velocity of the human. Therefore, using a passive mechanism to control an (SP)CMG could be used as balance assistance.","control moment gyro; optimal design; impedance optimization; balance assistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-28","","","","","",""

The goal is to estimate the current alignment in the frontal and transverse plane of the individual’s knee and therewith identify the changes that should be made to achieve an optimal swing of the shank.<br/>A forward kinematic model of the swing phase of a prosthetic knee is combined with an inverse kinematic model to estimate the adjustment setting of the individual’s knee. This is done with the data from two inertial sensors on thigh and shank of the prosthetic leg of the patient. Furthermore, the desired alignment that creates an optimal swing phase is estimated. With the comparison of the estimated and the desired alignment, an adjustment proposition is calculated. In addition, a sensitivity analysis on the sensor-body orientation is conducted. The results for the current alignment setting show a rough accumulation around the expected linear trend. Deviations and outliers are explained with mistakes during the measurement and errors in the data processing. Also, the calculation of the optimal alignment angles and proposed changes show promising results. The results for the sensitivity analysis on the sensor- body orientation show a linear trend. However, the slope is much smaller than the expected 1. This means that disturbances in the sensor-body orientation have a smaller influence on the results of the estimated alignment angles than assumed. The influence on the adjustment angle in the transverse plane is even smaller than on the one in the frontal plane. These results lead to the conclusion that there are additional factors with an impact on the calculations.The basis towards a working algorithm is laid out. Future work on eliminating sources of error in the data processing is suggested. Among other things, a robust approach to define the walking direction has to be established. Further, an additional measurement with a motion capture system is recommended to create a better foundation for further analysis.","Prosthetic knee; Alignment; Inertial sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

These sensors may already be deployed as part of a smart lighting system to provide temperature data for HVAC controls. Firstly, a statistical sensor model for thermopile temperature measurements is proposed. The proposed people counting method enhances the CUSUM RLS algorithm to estimate temperature change caused by people entering or leaving. We estimate mean temperature changes upon detection of an occupancy event, and then estimate the people count using a maximum likelihood on the estimated temperature change. Finally, PIR vacancy data is merged with the people count estimation to increase accuracy. We obtain an average counting error of 0.11 and 0.19 for 90% of the instants respectively when considering 15 minute windows for simulated and experimental datasets. A second aspect of the thesis considers the problem of commissioning plan detection. We leverage the two-sided CUSUM signals to address this problem.

Clear communication between drivers and pedestrians is one way to reduce their plight. Non-verbal communication in particular plays an important role in road safety, and eye contact is a kind of non-verbal communication that has the potential to minimize on-road collisions. However, with the advent of automated vehicles, driver-pedestrian eye contact loses its meaning since there is no longer a driver. It is therefore useful to study and detect eye contact so that the knowledge obtained may be applied to automated vehicles of the future. To this end, the following research goals were adopted: (a) What is eye contact between a pedestrian and a driver in a car? How can eye contact be defined/operationalized using an algorithm?, (b) How accurate is the algorithm that operationalizes eye contact?, and (c) How is it possible to use two eye-trackers with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and pedestrian recognition in a Toyota Prius car to reconstruct the entire driver-pedestrian interaction through a 3-D animation? An indoor experiment, designed to resemble a driver-pedestrian interaction at a pedestrian crossing was conducted with 31 participants. Participants’ (pedestrians’) eyes were tracked using a Tobii Pro Glasses 2 eye-tracker and the researcher’s (driver’s) eyes were tracked using a Smart Eye Pro dx eye-tracker,<br/>both of which were synchronized. Participants’ locations were also tracked using a stereo camera equipped with pedestrian detection capabilities. Pedestrians imagined that they were on a real road and performed six types of trials<br/>where they stood on / crossed from the left / right side curb in front of the stationary vehicle while either making eye contact or not making eye contact with the driver. The order of the trials was randomized, and each trial consisted of 3 repetitions of a driver-pedestrian interaction. If the driver and pedestrian were looking at each other at the same time there was eye contact, otherwise there was no eye contact. Significant differences in the percentages of eye contact between pedestrians standing on the left (median duration of 0.42 s) and the right (median duration of 0.54 s) were found. No significant differences in the percentages of eye contact between pedestrians crossing from the left (median duration of 1.23 s) and the right (median duration of 1.39 s) were found. Eye contact instants within trials were algorithmically detected by finding the angle between the 3-D gaze direction vectors of the driver and the pedestrian, and comparing it to an ‘eye contact threshold’. Trials were classified as either involving eye contact or not involving eye contact based on their percentages of eye contact instants. The classification performance of the algorithm was quantified using two ground truths: (1) Imposed eye contact (in half of the trials, participants were instructed to make eye contact; in the other half, participants were instructed not to make eye contact), and (2) Manually annotated areas of interest (AOIs) from the Tobii Pro Glasses 2 showing pedestrian eye contact seeking. The algorithm’s performance was found to be fair/poor and eye contact could be detected with an accuracy of 15-30°. A 3-D reconstruction of the driver-pedestrian interaction was achieved (in the form of an animation) by using the locations, head orientations and gaze directions of the driver and the pedestrian. This thesis provides objective measurements of driver-pedestrian eye contact and demonstrates how eye contact may be detected and reconstructed for use in automated vehicles of the future.","Eye-tracking; Eye contact; Driver-pedestrian interaction; Human factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Despite a control authority that has been proven, in several applications, to exceed that of classical control techniques, there is yet much to be studied about these control techniques. Theoretical gaps include the effectiveness of these techniques in handling time-delays as well as their robustness to sampling rates. Addressing this theoretical gap has been the focus of the research that is presented in this thesis. To meet this research aim, the control system has been analyzed through the lens of the Time-Delay System (TDS) framework. In particular, the analytic curve frequency sweeping approach as well as a set of suitable matrix inequalities that are based on the discretized Lyapunov functional method have been applied to perform this analysis in the frequency domain and<br/>the time domain, respectively. Moreover, the time-domain results have been extended to the case of neutral time-delay systems, the derivation of which is also presented in this thesis. Furthermore, a new robust stability analysis technique is presented which is based on combining the analytic curve frequency sweeping approach with the edge theorem. This approach is made applicable to systems with different uncertainty structures through determining generator quasipolynomials that form a convex hull that overbounds the family of quasipolynomials considered. The effectiveness of these methods has been shown through their application to an INDI-controlled damped pendulum and to the INDI-controlled short period dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft, and it is shown that the results from the frequency-domain analyses and the time-domain analyses corroborate.","Time-delay Systems; Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion; Robust Stability Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In the field of HPC demands on throughput are steadily growing. <br/>Not all of the algorithms used have a clear HW architecture which performs the best. Our work explores the performance of different HW architectures in solving a convex optimization problem. These algorithms are a sequence of dependent operations making it an interesting use-case because parallelism is not easily found. Our work focuses on a use-case of an on machine computational model present in ASML, we explore the acceleration of a quadratic programming Active-Set algorithm on dedicated hardware. There are libraries available to do this on both the CPU and GPU, while nothing is available for the FPGA. Our work focuses on filling this gap by implementing the algorithm using a high-level abstraction parallel programming language in order to ease development for FPGA accelerators. We use the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL framework to evaluate the performance trade-offs involved with FPGA acceleration and compare the performance to both the CPU and GPU using library functions. To fit FPGA architecture the algorithm is converted to a dataflow algorithm to enable streaming of data between kernels. The implementation leverages the features introduced in the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL framework to stream data using on-chip low-latency communication between kernels. We demonstrate that such a complicated algorithm can efficiently be implemented using the OpenCL framework. Our implementation achieves competitive performance compared to optimized library function on both the CPU and GPU. The OpenCL framework allows for easy design space exploration. We have explored different optimization strategies. The execution time of the final FPGA implementation is 3.5x and 1.2x longer than the CPU and GPU respectively in double precision floating-point. If the accuracy of the FPGA implementation is reduced to single precision there is a speedup of 2.2x in execution time compared to the double precision variant. Higher throughput can be achieved by duplicating the implementation. With the current size of the algorithm, two additional copies are possible. A handcrafted implementation could further improve the FPGA performance by manually managing local memory structures and reusing processing elements. However, significantly fewer lines of code are required, and a significant reduction in development time is achieved by using the OpenCL framework compared to traditional hardware description languages.","FPGA; OpenCL; HLS; GPU; BLAS; LAPACK; convex optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proportion aims to innovate for social impact by applying the human-centred design approach to current problems in society (proportion.global). One of the challenges Proportion wants to tackle is youth unemployment in Kenya. There are two parties connected to this challenge of youth unemployment within this graduation project. Firstly, there is a significant problem of youth unemployment in Kenya. This problem was addressed by Proportion, whereby they want to explore possible interventions against this unemployment. Secondly, social businesses in Kenya aim to create employment. Therefore, this graduation project seeks to redefine the relationship between social businesses and young professionals in Kenya, tackling the problem of youth unemployment. To be able to redefine the relationship between social businesses and young professionals, in-depth context research was required. This context exploration consisted of desk and field research with social entrepreneurs and inspiring youth alike. Additionally, creative sessions with Kenyan youth and social business owners were carried out. The qualitative information was used to identify the challenges of the current situation of youth unemployment. Furthermore, this helped to gain insights into the desired condition for both social businesses and young professionals. This qualitative research resulted in three problem areas of youth unemployment; the challenge of personal identity, the difficulty of what journey to take in life and the gap between theory and practice. These problem areas are linked to three opportunity areas: identifying the capabilities of the youth, creating an open company culture and providing mentorship. These opportunity areas, which were derived from identified problems, created a frame of reference for the future relationship between social businesses and young professionals. This frame of reference initiated secondary literature research on employee engagement. The findings of the theory on employee engagement led to an adapted diagram of the employee performance pyramid (Stum, 2011). Several levels need to be fulfilled to create employee engagement. These are the following in chronological order; rewards, comfort, collaboration, relations and growth. The designed concept needs to incorporate these levels to create a relationship between social enterprises and young professionals where engagement is enhanced. The findings of the research resulted in a strategic framework, in the form of a future vision on the relationship between social businesses and young professionals. It indicates the boundaries of the solution space and future developments. The future vision describes a collaborative working environment, where support and involvement for every individual are essential. Moreover, personal and organisational development is established by creating independent goals and future expectations for the company and youth alike. The final creative capacity-building concept (CCB-concept), is a solution within this framework. It supports social businesses in their employees’ journey, specifically in the onboarding process of young professionals. The CCB-concept bridges the gap between social enterprises and young professionals in Kenya by identifying the skills and goals of the employees and translating them into personal performance journeys. The proposed concept comprises three steps: an experience workshop, a reflective moment, and a group reflection and planning. It relies on a cycle of action, reflection and planning (Kolb, 1984). Through collaboration and creative capacity-building, the CCB-concept aims for better personal and organisational development. In this way, it enhances the relationship between social businesses and young professionals in Kenya. It is recommended to do a pilot test of the proposed concept in Kenya to evaluate the feasibility, viability and desirability. Furthermore, it is suggested to explore the several service packages. Lastly, a partner able to financially fund the project for early implementation is recommended.","Human Resources; Capacity Building; Kenya; Strategic Design; Youth unemployment; Knowlegde gap; Systemic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It is focusing on collecting qualitative feedback from families, consisting out of children between 8 and 12 years old and their parent or grandparents. The Maritime Museum Rotterdam has various interactive exhibitions which learn their visitors about the maritime world. The museum was looking for a way to get qualitative feedback from their visitors about these exhibitions. The museum wants to learn what contributes to or deducts a positive experience of their exhibitions, so they can create even more inspiring exhibitions in the future. The assignment for this project is to design a tool-box, containing all elements needed to conduct a successful qualitative evaluation of a family exhibition. The Sea monster exhibition in the Maritime Museum was chosen to be a test-case for this project. During the project, several methods for gaining feedback were explored. It was decided to build an evaluation process around the concept of a heat-map which shows what areas visitors do or don’t like. The method that was chosen to collect the data to create the heat-map is experience sampling. During the exhibition visit, visitors are asked to give a small sample of feedback. They can do this by pressing a smiley that indicates how much they like what they are doing or seeing at that moment on a special developed tracking device. This device also keeps track of the location of the visitors. A line, showing the route of the visitors and the given feedback samples will be created from this information. For this concept, a framework of the evaluation process was created. In this framework, two tracks were distinguished. One track, called version 1 in this project, collects the route and feedback samples of over a hundred visitors. An interactive stand will ask automated questions based on this data. The other track, called version 2 in this project, only involves five families. A heat-map is created for each family member and based on the heat-map an interview is held. A process poster was developed which shows all steps of both tracks. However, the focus during the project was on this last track, version 2. The tracking device (the tool), the interview, and the analysis and communication of version 2 were developed further. Several tests were done to find the characteristic the portable tracking device should meet to collect the right data to create a heat-map that can be used to structure the interview. In the final design, a working prototype of the tracking device was created. Besides that, an interview guide was developed containing all information needed to conduct an interview, based on the heat-map. Lastly, all steps of the analysis and communication were distinguished and finding-cards were designed To validate the concept, various tests were done to evaluate the evaluation process.","Evaluation; Interactive exhibition; Experience sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The islands are separated by the Larantuka Strait, which has a width varying between 600 and 1000 meters. The local government would like a bridge between the two islands. However, as the water in the 18 meter deep strait is heavily subjected to tidal forces - creating a tidal amplitude of about 1.5 m and tidal flow velocities ranging up to 4.5 m/s - structural design is challenging. As traditional bridges were deemed too expensive, a new type of bridge was introduced: the `Tidal Bridge'. The pendulum founded floating bridge, which is proposed to span the deepest 400 meters of the cross-section, is designed with tidal turbines attached to the bottom of the structure. The energy production mitigates the financial burden that the 225 million US dollar Palmerah Tidal Bridge will bring. At the time of writing, a pre-feasibility study has been performed by Antea, proposing initial structural dimensions. BAM took over the design process, which lead to questions regarding the dynamic stability of the design. The objective of this report is to answer the following two research questions: 1. How can the dynamic response due to two-dimensional forcing of a Tidal Bridge be determined? 2. What design choices can further optimise the dynamic behaviour of a Tidal Bridge? A numeric tool has been created to predict the dynamics of the proposed design as function of an input of wind, waves, and current. Based on (experimental) literature, hydrodynamic coefficients determining the fluid-structure interaction were determined. The complex shape of the floaters did not allow appropriate validation of the accompanying added mass and radiation damping coefficients. Comparison with a model constructed in Ansys Aqwa showed values of similar magnitude, but precise magnitudes could not be determined. In order to find these important coefficients, a set of experiments has been performed to determine the added mass (moment of inertia) and radiation damping (moment of inertia) for heave and roll motion. The experiments showed that the added mass equations for heave were well defined, while the added mass moment of inertia equations for roll motion deviated up to 250 per cent. The acquired data was used to find better relations between the added mass (moment of inertia) and the floater dimensions. Please note, the empirical relations are based on limited data and with little mathematical background. Hence, the relations should be used with care. The radiation damping coefficients that were also extracted from the experiments showed no clear trend, but did confirm that the hand-calculations were of correct magnitude. Using the constructed model, forcing characteristics of the Tidal Bridges are investigated. In these computations, the Palmerah Tidal Bridge dimensions are used as a case study. It was noted that the extreme non-linearity of different elements of the problem (changing pendulum angle, hydrodynamic pressure field, and particle velocity/acceleration field) do not allow for linear approximation. While a linear mass-spring system predicts that the natural period is about 6.7 seconds, the maximum dynamic amplitude is found for wave periods of 9 seconds. This coincides with the largest expected waves for the Palmerah Tidal Bridge location. Reducing the natural period of the design is recommended. Additionally, research was done into the contribution of the various types of forcing, where it was found that traffic weight has negligible effect on the dynamics. Wind forces add only a few percent to the pendulum forces, but do have a significant contribution to the displacements. Furthermore, research into the impact of an approaching wave field showed that accelerations during first impact may overshoot the maximum steady state acceleration by more than 200 per cent. A parametric study on the dynamics of Tidal Bridges was performed, which did research into the the forcing combinations that lead to most amplification of the dynamics. It shows that different loading combinations are governing for accelerations in the three different degrees of freedom present in a two-dimensional system. In here, difference was found for the dynamic behaviour induced by waves from the two different wave directions, leading to two sets of three forcing combinations. This data was used to investigate the effect of three design parameters: the angle of the pendulum, the hinge location of the pendulum and the depth of the strait. Moreover, a sensitivity study is performed on a set of parameters defining the Tidal Bridge. It shows that the mass of the segment, the added mass, the floater length, the design turbine force, and the pendulum angle are most important if it comes to design optimisation. Based on the parametric study and the forcing characteristics, conclusions and recommendations are made for improvements of Tidal Bridge designs in general and more specifically: the Palmerah Tidal Bridge.","Tidal Bridge; Dynamics; Waves; Morison; Dorgelo; Turbines; Current; Experiments; Heave; Added mass; Roll; Pitch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This technique is currently used in the automotive area and is used to enhances the current state of FEM with the inclusive of test- based models. Building test-based models for EDS (Experimental Dynamic Substructuring) requires very accurate measurement, and this thesis examines how uncertainty on sensors and impacts affects the accuracy of the test-based model. Dynamic Substructuring is the collection of methods to describe large and complex systems by using the models of its substructures. This approach assumes that the dynamics of each substructure is enclosed in a so-called super element at interface DoF. Modeling domains that engage condensed dynamic information, like admittance FRFs in the frequency domain, are therefore particularly suited for substructuring [49]. One of the methods to model the interface between two (or more) substructures, is coupling two sub- structure by a single mutual point, so-called Virtual Point. This single point is a collocated point, a super-element, which has both translational and rotational DoFs., In order to obtain the FRF of the coupling point of each substructure, an experimentally gained in- formation is transforming into the super-element’s admittance (Virtual Point FRF). The experimentally gained information is recorded by sensors and roving impacts. The transformation uses projection ma- trices for both input and output and is called Virtual Points Transformation (VPT). In all experiments, we almost always have some uncertainties, and achieving true experiments is al- most impossible. Making errors while mounting the sensors and roving impacts is very plausible. This mounting errors can be positional as well as directional. Because of these uncertainties, we can never find the true transformation matrices. In this thesis, the propagation of the positional and directional uncertainty of measuring equipment (sen- sors and roving impacts) into the calculation of Virtual Point frequency response function is investigated analytically, as well as numerically. It is shown which error and in what extend is the most dominant er- ror source, and in which frequencies and in which cross-functions of V P we can expect the least precise. Expectations can be made on the inputs’ or outputs’ DOF with dominant effect on error generation for a particular mode shape, based on the local mode shape-motion of measurement area, and by using the Component Mode Synthesized method (CMS). It is shown that the error generation on measurement, and further error propagation into super-element caused by a particular error source is mode shape- and frequency-dependent. Further, an estimation is given for the amount of influence of each dominant error source on the cal- culation of the forces and responses of Virtual Point, on both rotational and translational forces and responses. Since the dominant error generation is depending on the mode shape motion, the V P’s cross-functions with the least precision can also be defined.<br/>It is shown that based on the decomposition of transformation matrices, the rotational/ rotational cross- functions are the most sensitive ones to both positional and directional uncertainties if we are looking to absolute value. Then, base on the numerical results, a comparison is made between all four studied cases; Impacts Positional Uncertainty (IPU), Impacts Directional Uncertainty (IDU), Sensors Positional Uncertainty (SPU), and Sensors Directional Uncertainty (SDU). The possibility of error cancellation and the maximum error propagation is introduced.","Experimental Dynamic Substructuring; uncertainty propagation; virtual point transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Families are recognized as a unit for food choice and consumption. The influence of family members on food choices happens throughout family life and takes place in the private home or in the public sphere, mainly grocery stores. Picnic is an online-only grocery store delivering groceries in The Netherlands and Germany. Families are their biggest target group, averagely placing the largest and most frequent orders (Picnic, 2019). However, since Picnic does not have brick and mortar stores, all orders are placed via their smartphone app for iOS and Android devices. This deviation from traditional grocery shopping profoundly changes the family decision-making process in food buying and consumption (Suwandinata, 2011). Whereas grocery stores can act as arenas of family interactions including children constantly influencing their parents, directly and indirectly (Haselhoff, Faupel, &amp; Holzmüller, 2014), the online grocery shopping process is mainly an individual experience. This behavioural change significantly affects the sense of shared responsibility within families. Moreover, it prevents kids from learning how to act and behave as responsible consumers, to get educated about healthy eating habits and to understand the value of money (Suwandinata, 2011).Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore ways to actively engage multiple family members in the online grocery shopping experience. With the goal of ultimately fostering a feeling of togetherness and shared responsibility within families, making the online shopping process resemble a festive family ritual while celebrating the involvement of kids.Various design methods and tools are used during this project, mainly following the Design Thinking methodology and applying parts of the Vision in Product Design framework. After empathizing with internal and external stakeholders and gathering insights on the context from a higher perspective, a design statement has been formulated. Subsequently, multiple rounds of prototyping rounds were executed, constantly involving the target audience and gathering feedback from the company.The final design takes a granular approach towards creating a collaborative digital grocery shopping process loop. “Picnic Family” facilitates a variety of collaborative family touchpoints throughout the entire service journey and offers new playful ways of grocery shopping. It supports the creation of new family rituals by providing tools that enable new habits of family communication and interaction during online grocery shopping. The “Picnic Family” has been designed and prototyped for smartphones and tablets and each prototype has been evaluated with the target group and internally within Picnic. However, to fully validate the long-term effects of the app, it should be used by families in real life and over time. Additionally, the research of this project and the effects of the designed tools can be used to investigate family collaboration on other digital services, such as e-commerce businesses, travel planning tools, entertainment streaming platforms.","Grocery shopping; Family behaviour; Design Thinking; Picnic; User-centred design; Rapid prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

One way to mitigate risks is to use advanced guidance strategies to centralise mission planning and guidance-navigation and control. Successive convexification is a technique suitable for this purpose as it solves second order-cone optimisation problems (SOCP) sequentially in polynomial time. Nevertheless, atmospheric re-entry is quite challenging as it contains a large number of non-convexities. Therefore, an advanced optimum control optimiser based on successive convex optimisation (SCOPT) was developed. A novelty of this optimiser is its wide flexibility and in the incorporation of a golden section line-search method to enhance convergence when non-convexities are present. A novel formulations incorporating angle of attack and based on different degrees of convexification. A direct-linearisation approach, although slightly sensitive to initial guesses, was seen to be robust when compared in different objective formulations. On the other hand, an hybrid approach using a lossless convexification was seen to perform better for most problems, although it relied on a regularisation condition which was sometimes difficult to satisfy. The reachability capabilities of the SPHYNX vehicle during orbital and descent aborts were analysed and showed that around 14 minutes are available to perform an abort to an alternative landing site for a nominal mission. While there is a large room for improvement, the study shows that successive convex optimisation could be potentially used for mission planning and on-board applications as an optimum trajectory planner algorithm during realistic re-entry missions.","successive convexification; abort guidance; convex optimisation; re-entry; lifting-body; optimum control; space mission; Optimisation Algorithms; GNC; Mission Analysis; trajectory optimisation; trajectory tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Floating production units require to be permanently moored offshore. For shallow water field developments, typical designs include soft yoke mooring systems which is a single point mooring technology. Produced fluid is transported via a geostatic tower along the transfer hoses to the production unit. Single point mooring systems will weathervane into the offshore environment (wind, waves and current) and can often be considered as surge dominant induced by low frequency wave drift forces. Due to low damping at these low frequencies, an oscillation close to the natural surge frequency appears causing dominant mooring loads. By connecting the floating structure to the tower with various rigid steel frame components, including multiple hinges, unconstrained motions are preserved. This results in dynamically complex systems requiring advanced numerical methods for time domain simulations, in order to deliver the mooring design loads. By selecting mass and dimensions of the soft yoke mooring system, the stiffness of the mooring system can be adapted to influence the response of the floater.<br/><br/>Currently, mass and dimensions of new soft yoke mooring designs are established using proven mooring solutions by conducting small adjustments of mooring components in time consuming dynamic simulation software. Improvement in efficiency of the design process is accomplished by developing a computational efficient design tool, to be used before dynamic modelling, to provide the designer with an optimized set of mooring design parameters in a given environment. The developed design tool contains an integrated single degree of freedom model including given vessel properties and extreme collinear offshore environment, in order to produce estimates of the maximum surge response based on the given mooring characteristics. Eventually, by adapting the mooring stiffness accordingly, the design tool is able to provide an optimum set of mooring design parameters which minimizes the maximum mooring load.<br/><br/>The mooring characteristics are implemented using a linear and non-linear approach. A validation of surge response results has been performed for three collinear extreme offshore environments including wind, waves and current using state-of-the art dynamic modelling software OrcaFlex. Results showed that the linear model can capture the sensitivity of the surge response related to mooring design parameter variation. It was demonstrated with the Runge-Kutta method that the achieved accuracy with the proposed non-linear model will be similar or even worse than using the linear model without the relevant computational costs. Therefore, the linear model was implemented in the design tool and accomplishes surge response calculations of 10,000 sets of mooring design parameters within a few minutes.<br/><br/>Results showed that the consequence of the linear mooring force and single degree of freedom assumptions in the design tool leads to an underestimation of the surge response in an extreme collinear environment. Despite the surge dominance, especially heave and pitch motions induce high mooring loads at maximum surge offset. Analyses of two moderate collinear environments in OrcaFlex revealed less underestimation and even overestimation of the surge response by the design tool, which indicates the high dynamic complexity of soft yoke mooring systems. However, the surge response validation procedure using OrcaFlex affirmed that the design tool provides the correct set of mooring design parameters resulting in a minimum mooring load within 2~10% accuracy for all three environments. By implementing the proposed set in OrcaFlex and obtaining the design loads, a 25% decrease in absolute maximum mooring load is demonstrated when compared to the benchmark mooring design parameters. This indicates the increased efficiency of the design process by using the developed design tool. <br/>An additional graphical user interface is programmed where the designer can import their own vessel properties, environmental conditions and can vary desired mooring design parameters. Conclusively, a design tool has been developed for preliminary estimations of the set of mooring design parameters that have been shown to minimize the mooring loads and to limit the number of time domain analyses in future projects.<br","FPSO; Soft Yoke Mooring System (SYMS); Design tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-28","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Since the optical properties of those materials are complex to model and require finer theory than what implied in geometrical optics, systematic integration study of those solutions is not reported in Literature and motivates this research. In previous work, the design of polarization-sensitive spectral filters based on metasurfaces devices and integrated into Bragg reflectors has been reported. The use of such a spectropolarimeter concept may lead to significant miniaturization improvements in Space applications, where launches of small satellites are becoming accessible to not-governmental companies and trending. Typical spectral and polarimetric functionalities are currently integrated with several additional components required for the propagation of light. The metasurface based spectropolarimeter concept operates in a division of focal plane and can be integrated on off-the-shelf CMOS sensors, when opportune factors are taken into considerations, with the use of a single lithographic step. The main difficulty in their use arises from the limited bandwidth dictated by the Bragg reflector and the polarization response of the metasurface, as well as strict requirements of telecentricity to limit angle-dependence at the focal plane. In the present work, we offer novel modeling tools to predict the electromagnetic performance of the device in terms of diffraction and spectral response. We explicit how those tools, in comparison with other approaches like Finite Element Methods, can provide an efficient and physical-based assessment for the design of the spectro-polarimetric filters. We apply then such tools to analyze the diffraction of the filters and the integration of the sensor in a Space Mission for aerosol detection in the VIS and SWIR range, by designing a set of filters able to overcome the bandwidth limitations above mentioned, finally providing simple engineering figures in terms of integration requirements to be considered. The work sets the bases for further improvements, on one side, in the modeling of those structures and on the other side in their integration in complex systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Chassagne, C. (mentor); Wang, Zhengbing (mentor); Hendriks, Antoon (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","To exploit its socio-economic functions, engineering measures are regularly applied in estuaries. Estuaries are, however, known to be very complex systems. Stemming from this complexity is the generation of a so-called estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM), which poses great siltation problems to the engineering measures. An engineering measure, which is looked upon in this thesis, is a trench accommodating for the construction of a submerged tunnel. Despite the complexity of estuaries, trench siltation rates are predicted in practice by simple empirical engineering tools. However, a lot of uncertainty is associated with the predicted trench siltation rates, as such engineering tools do not capture the complex estuarine mechanisms. These mechanisms are found to dominate the sediment supply to the trench and the subsequent trapping of sediment in the trench. Therefore, in this thesis, it is investigated to which degree of certainty trench siltation rates in estuaries can be predicted, based on a process-oriented and engineering-oriented viewpoint. This is researched according to the implementation of a detailed process-based numerical model, which is considered to be highly accurate. For this purpose, the following case study is adopted: a trench near the ETM of the well-mixed Scheldt Estuary, at Oosterweel, Belgium. The uncertainty of the numerical model is estimated based on a sensitivity analysis, which maps the epistemic uncertainty, and a scenario analysis, which approximates the intrinsic uncertainty. For verification purposes, modelling results are compared with the state-of-the-art theory on trench siltation mechanisms, and estuarine sediment transport and trapping mechanisms. These are thoroughly analyzed in this thesis based on an extensive literature study. Additionally, a link to practice is made by comparison of the degree of certainty and practicality of the numerical model with the engineering tools. It could be estimated, based on the parameter uncertainty, that the epistemic uncertainty of the numerical model equals approximately 1.5 times the expected siltation volumes. A similar uncertainty due to intrinsic uncertainty was estimated, as the trench siltation rates showed a strong dependency on the variation in forcing regarding tide, river and storms at sea. In total, this led to a quantifiable uncertainty in the order of 2.5 times the expected siltation volumes.<br/> Regardless of this uncertainty, great confidence is put in the performance of the numerical model, as in accordance with existing literature of the study area and theory on well-mixed estuary, important mechanisms in the supply of sediment to the trench were found to be: salinity-induced circulation, tidal rectification, Stokes’ drift and river discharge. Additionally, the governing sediment trapping mechanisms of the trench, found by the model, are in line with state-of-the-art literature. In contrast, yet unidentified by literature, the longitudinal salinity gradient over the estuary also seem to dominantly influence the trapping efficiency of the trench, in particular during flood in which it induces a strong decrease in sediment trapping. In comparison, it is believed that engineering tools, applied for trenches in estuaries, are prone to very high epistemic uncertainty caused by model inadequacy. This is because stand-alone application of the engineering tool on the problem gave a significant over-estimation of the siltation volumes, as predicted by the numerical model. Furthermore, the engineering tool was found to behave differently within a tidal cycle, and on changing environmental conditions. Above epistemic uncertainties due to model inadequacy could, however, not be quantifiably supported, as the total quantifiable uncertainty was in the same order of the numerical model. In conclusion, the degree of certainty of the trench siltation rates is believed to be improved significantly using a detailed numerical model instead of engineering tools. However, a huge drawback of the application of detailed numerical models, is the complexity and the impracticality of the numerical model. Therefore, this thesis opts for the development/use of a more sophisticated semi-empirical tool for engineering measures in estuaries. Though, more research is recommended on trenches in both similar and different type of estuaries in order to generalize and confirm the findings of this thesis.","Trench siltation; Estuaries; Well-mixed; Coastal Engineering; Trench; Siltation; Estuarine turbidity maximum; ETM; Estuarine circulation; Drivers; Barotropic; Baroclinic; Mechanisms; Processes; Numerical model; 3D; Fine Mesh; Scheldt; Lower Sea Scheldt; Scheldt Estuary; sediment transport; sediment trapping; Suspended Particulate Matter; Suspended load; Bedload; Salinity; Tide; River Discharge; Wind; Storms; Longitudinal circulation; Lateral circulation; Transverse circulation; Horizontal circulation; Sediment Supply; Sediment Availability; Mud; Clay; Silt; Sand; Oosterweel; Immersed Tunnel; Vorticity; Micro-scale; Macro-scale; salinity gradient; Suspended Sediment Concentration; SSC; SPM; Lag effects; Tidal rectification; Flocculation; Salinity-induced circulation; Stokes' drift; Trapping efficiency; Current adaptation; SSC adaptation; Turbulence; High-resolution; Uncertainty; Process-based; Engineering-oriented; siltation rates; detailed; environmental variability; environmental conditions; environmental components; spring-neap; seasonality; tidal cycle; Monte Carlo; Sensitivity Analysis; Scenario analysis; Parameter uncertainty; Epistemic uncertainty; Intrinsic uncertainty; Model inadequacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.2, 4.3"

Medicine Men has developed a eHealth solution for patients with chronic diseases which is called the Emma Activity Coach. This application runs on a Fitbit smartwatch and is part of the Emma system which consists out of a smartphone application called Emma.6 and a desktop application called Emma dashboard. The aim of the Emma Activity Coach and the Emma system is to empower patients with a chronic disease in monitoring their activity in their own environment with the support of an informal caregiver and a healthcare professional in order to improve the quality of life of the patient. Project focus The focus of this project is on exploring the target group of the Emma Activity Coach and its needs in order to improve the Emma system. The user interaction and experience of the user are explored. Problems that come up are translated into design iterations which result in a proposed final design that fulfils the found needs and the set design vison. The ecosystem of the project consist out of three parties: • The patient • The informal caregiver • The healthcare professional Target group Literature research and interviews with several healthcare professionals showed that the use of the Emma Activity Coach would be beneficial for patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, Type 2 diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). The target group is characterised by comorbidity; I.e. suffers from more than one chronic disease. This means that there is an overlap of disease symptoms of which activity, and therefore the use of the Emma Activity Coach is found to be beneficial. Target group challenge and needs The target group is explored via several patient interviews who suffer from COPD and/or Type 2 diabetes, three informal caregivers and three healthcare professionals. The main challenge for the target group is knowing their activity limits in order to gain back trust in their physical and mental condition. The target group has problems with getting enough activity or sometimes getting too much activity, which is often the case for patients with COPD. Their disease makes it hard for them to recognize their limits due to constant being short of breath. The challenge of the target group is translated into four needs; the need for autonomy, security, stimulation and support. Several design criteria are setup according to these needs and translated in the concluding design vision; to make the patient feel in control of their physical and mental health condition, by providing clear feedback on their activity. Design process Several user studies with COPD patients who had experience with the use of the Emma Activity Coach on a Fitbit smartwatch were performed. Interviews, observations and user tests revealed multiple design and comprehensibility problems with the current design of the Emma Activity Coach. These problems were tackled via three iteration rounds with the target group participants. The Emma dashboard of the healthcare professional, with the focus on physiotherapists, is also explored by interviewing 4 physiotherapists who have made use or still use the Emma dashboard in combination with the Emma Activity Coach. The iteration is presented as a starting point for further development. The evaluation with the target group shows that the proposed design of the Emma Activity Coach achieves the set design vision of this project.","smartwatch; Design for Interaction; UI/UX design; Patient Empowerment; eHealth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Computational demands of simulation software are continuously increasing. As such for many applications traditionally computed on the central processing unit the question arises of whether moving to GPU computing is a possible cost effective way of meeting these demands. <br/> The fundamental nature of GPU architecture that makes it so cost effective at doing bulk computation also poses restrictions on which applications are suitable for it. The shallow water equations are a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations and describe water levels and flow currents in suitably shallow water such as rivers, estuaries and the North sea. The main research goal of this thesis project was to determine whether the shallow water equations are suitable for implementation on a GPU. Two options exist, the equations may be solved with either an explicit or implicit time integration method. First, a literature study was conducted to familiarize with the tools required to build explicit and implicit shallow water models on a GPU. Then both an explicit and implicit shallow water solver were developed first in the MATLAB programming language and later in CUDA C++ on both CPU and GPU. The main findings are that both explicit and implicit methods are well suited for GPU implementation. Both methods proved to be compatible with a wetting and drying mechanism of numerical cells. The Cuda C++ implementation was in the order of 10 times as fast as a MATLAB implementation for both CPU and GPU. For the benchmark cases tested, the Cuda C++ GPU implementation was in the order of 50 times faster than the equivalent multithreaded CPU implementation. <br/> The implicit implementation was benchmarked using the conjugate gradient method to solve the linear system. Various preconditioners were tested and a Repeated Red Black preconditioner was found to be the most effective. The computation time of the RRB preconditioned implicit method was compared with the explicit method and it was found that the two methods reached parity in computation time when the implicit time step was taken roughly 50 times as large as the explicit time step. For implicit time steps smaller than that the explicit method was faster and when the implicit time step was larger the implicit method was faster. For the benchmark cases tested, the implicit method using a time step 50 times larger than the explicit method was found to be less accurate and less stable than the explicit method. The conclusion is that for cases similar to the benchmark cases an explicit method is the fastest, most stable and most accurate method and thus the preferred choice.","GPU; Shallow Water Equations; Time integration; Structured grid; Conjugate Gradient; CUDA; Preconditioner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Rubble mound breakwaters are essential to preserve desired hydraulic conditions within the hinterland, avoiding damage to inhabited or industrial areas. This research focuses on the wave overtopping of rubble mound breakwaters as failure mechanism. To assess the wave overtopping engineers can adopt multiple methods. These methods can be ordered in increasing degree of accuracy and costs: empirical methods, neural networks, numerical models and physical laboratory experiments. The preliminary design phase is a highly iterative process. Using physical laboratory experiments within this phase is an expensive choice, therefore empirical methods are often preferred. Nevertheless, this research revealed that empirical methods, e.g. the so called EurOtop 2018, show significant shortcomings in assessing average overtopping quantities over rubble mound breakwaters, even more when the geometrical complexity of the structure increases (presence of protruding wave wall). This thesis re-calibrated the roughness coefficient proposed by the original EurOtop 2018 approach, referred to as the updated EurOtop 2018 method. Numerical models are proposed as a possible solution between empirical methods (which can be carried out quickly given their low complexity) and physical laboratory experiments (which need more time but are characterised by high accuracy). They have been increasingly used and accepted in the past decades. Following this trend, the Joint Industry Project (JIP) CoastalFOAM was launched with the objective to develop and validate a numerical model (OpenFOAM, waves2Foam, OceanWaves3D and JIP additions; referred to as CoastalFOAM) capable of accurately modelling the wave-structure interaction of rubble mound breakwaters. This research aims to calibrate and evaluate the CoastalFOAM model to assess small to large wave overtopping of rubble mound breakwaters with protruding or non-protruding wave wall, considering 500 waves. The evaluation of CoastalFOAM shows that this numerical model can be used, instead of empirical methods (e.g. updated EurOtop 2018), to assess the average overtopping discharges. CoastalFOAM showed excellent agreement with measurements for large and medium overtopping cases, while resulting less accurate for small overtopping cases. The analysis revealed, however, that the average overtopping discharge as a quantity is not capable of identifying the magnitude of large overtopping events (without modelling all 500 waves). This can be considered critical in determining whether the structure is safe enough in terms of Serviceability Limit State (SLS) or Ultimate Limit State (ULS). Consequently, this thesis proposes a new methodology to assess the maximum overtopping volume within a storm, applying the concept of wave focusing and using the NewWave theory. The input variables for the NewWave profile are extracted from the spectral properties at the toe of the breakwater. A first order wave maker is used to generate the NewWave profile, making the methodology sensitive for the degree of non-linearity of the considered wave conditions. This NewWave methodology offers improved accuracy to assess the maximum overtopping volumes when compared to the EurOtop 2018 approach. Furthermore, this research proposes to apply the inverse EurOtop 2018 technique to assess the average overtopping discharge using the NewWave maximum overtopping volume. However, the accuracy of this methodology is lower than that obtained with the updated EurOtop 2018 guidelines. This study shows that CoastalFOAM can be used, instead of the current empirical methods, to assess the average overtopping discharge within the design cycle of rubble mound breakwaters. However, according to what has emerged, CoastalFOAM shows to be less accurate in calculating small overtopping discharges as opposed to medium and large. On the other hand, when considering the maximum overtopping volume as design criterion the proposed NewWave methodology showed to be the most efficient and accurate.","Rubble mound breakwater; Wave overtopping; EurOtop; Numerical modelling; OpenFOAM; waves2FOAM; Focused wave group; NewWave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","JIP CoastalFOAM",""

We explore under what read and write access patterns the HBM bandwidth of 460.8 GB/s can be met and identify specific circumstances under which this bandwidth can be achieved. The sorting algorithm is implemented in hardware as two steps: partitioning and sorting. We design two partitioning architectures and one sorting architecture. The sorting architecture sorts buckets generated in the partitioning step and is based on merge sort. It uses HBM and wide merge trees to reduce the number of passes through a memory. The architectures themselves are to be instantiated multiple times on the FPGA to achieve a higher sorting throughput. Simulating each architecture at 225 MHz, they are all designed to output up to 3.6 GB/s of 8+8 byte key-value pairs under ideal conditions. We measure the first and second partitioning architectures and identify a bottleneck in HBM for the former, resulting in only 0.44 GB/s with a (uniformly) random input, due to a strided access pattern. With a sorted input, the throughput is 2.18 GB/s. The second partitioning architecture is not affected by this and achieves a throughput of approximately 1.7 GB/s for both types of input. The sorter performs best, sorting buckets at approximately 2.7 GB/s. Synthesis results show that the target FPGA has enough resources for tens of partitioners and sorters, allowing to create a sorting hardware that saturates system bandwidth.","FPGA; acceleration; OpenCAPI; High Bandwidth Memory; HBM; partitioning; sorting; bucket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An examination of trust development and misuse in a large CAVE-based pedestrian simulation environment","Kaleefathullah, Anees Ahamed (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)","de Winter, J.C.F. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","b>Aim:</b> In this study, we aimed to investigate pedestrians’ trust, crossing behaviour, and misuse of an automated vehicle (AV) equipped with an external human-machine interface (eHMI). We hypothesized that participants’ trust would drop to a low level when the eHMI fails (i.e., the eHMI turns on, but the vehicle does not brake), followed by a sustained low of trust in subsequent crossing trials. Furthermore, misuse of the eHMI was expected, operationalized as a situation where participants who are exposed to the eHMI signal before the AV starts to decelerate (-1 group), would start to use the information from the eHMI and cross early instead of relying on the implicit communication from the vehicle. Finally, it was expected that participants who are exposed to the eHMI signals after the AV began to decelerate (+1 group) would be run over by the AV less often when the eHMI fails as compared to participants in the -1 group.   <br/><b>Literature: </b>Prior studies showed that pedestrians tend to overtrust eHMIs, and when there is a malfunction of the eHMI, pedestrians’ behavior changed significantly in terms of showing hesitation, longer decision times, and rating an increased risk and reduced trust. However, there is no consensus on the evaluation of pedestrians’ overtrust and subsequent misuse of eHMI at different eHMI onset timings. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted this study at the University of Leeds CAVE simulator. Sixty participants encountered an AV in a typical Britain street virtual environment. The AV was fitted with an eHMI in the form of a 360° light band on the top and sides of the AV and additionally on the grill. The eHMI indicated that the AV has started yielding or is yet to yield for them. All participants experienced fifty trials during the entire experiment. Each trial had a variation of the independent variables: (1) behavior of the AV: Yielding with an onset of braking at 33 m and 43 m from the participant, and no yielding, (2) eHMI state: On/Off, (3) eHMI onset timing: early onset (-1 s) or late onset (+1 s). One half (N = 30) of the participants experienced the early eHMI onset timing (-1 s) where the eHMI turned on 1 s before the vehicle started braking. The other half of the participants (N = 30) experienced the late eHMI onset timing (+1 s) where the eHMI turned on 1 s after the vehicle started braking. After each trial, participants rated three subjective measures (perceived risk, comprehension of the eHMI, and trust in the eHMI) on a scale of 1 (strongly agree) to 10 (strongly disagree). The objective measure was the position of the participant in the simulator.   <b>Results:</b> Participants trusted the AV more with the eHMI than without the eHMI. Furthermore, participants in the -1 group crossed the road considerably earlier than participants in the +1 group. When an eHMI failure occurred, the trust levels and the comprehension of the AV in both groups dropped significantly, whereas self-reported risk rose to high levels. After the first eHMI failure experience, the -1 group trusted the AV with eHMI on significantly less compared to their trust before the failure. Additionally, the results showed that about 30% of the participants in both groups crashed with the AV when the eHMI failed for the first time. There were no significant differences in the number of crashes between the two groups.<br/><b>Conclusion: </b>Pedestrians’ trust considerably reduces when the eHMI fails. Also, there is a sustained loss of trust in the AV’s behavior after experiencing the failure in the eHMI. When the eHMI provides early information (before the implicit communication from the AV), pedestrians cross early as compared to the eHMI providing late information (after the implicit communication from the AV). Pedestrians who repeatedly encountered either the ‘early’ or ‘late’ onset eHMI crashed with the AV in similar numbers when the eHMI failed for the first time. However, the -1 group managed to avoid crashes when the eHMI failed for the second time. <b>Application:</b> This study is useful in considering the safety of pedestrians who interact with an eHMI-equipped AV. <br","Autonomous vehicles; Pedestrians; External Human-Machine Interfaces; eHMI failure; Trust development; Misuse; Risk; Comprehension; eHMI design; Light band; CAVE simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering","interACT road automation project","51.9963, 4.3759"

It is an apparatus that grabs and steers a flexible needle remotely, so it could be used in an MRI while the physician controls the needle based on the scans. In this way, the physician has a clear sight of the position of the needle and the targeted tissue. He could perform the intervention with a higher accuracy, which could result in a higher success rate. Furthermore, a great benefit of this way of performing interventions is that the targeted tissue is found directly and no extra internal tissue needs to be damaged. It results in a shorter recovery time for the patient and therefore, higher patient satisfaction and lower costs. All in all, the needle control device increases the success rate of interventions, increase the patient satisfaction and could lower costs.<br/>The principle of controlling a needle depends on a hypothesis which reads:<br/>“if the needle is pre-curved, the needle could be steered by translational and rotational movement towards a target.” <br/>If the pre-curved needle moves forwards, it will make a curve in the brain since it follows the path of least resistance. If the needle is rotating, it will move forward. With these functionalities, a mapped-out path can be made. And so, the physician could steer a needle while the patient lays in the MRI and the physician is located in the control room. The needle is remote-controlled.<br/>During the project, a focus was set on the elaboration and embodiment phase of designing. A functional prototype has been developed and a start is made with the final design. The next step would be to integrate the results of both processes.","MRI; control; Needle; Steerable needle; MR Safe Actuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

Antarctica is the most productive region for collecting meteorites, as the visually contrasting meteorites are easily detectable and tend to concentrate at specific areas exposing blue ice. Blue ice areas act as meteorite stranding surfaces (MSSs) if the flow of the ice sheet and specific geographical and climatological settings combine favorably. Previously, possible meteorite stranding surfaces were identified by chance or through visual examination of remote sensing data, which have limitations in discovering new locations for future meteorite searching campaigns. In this study, datasets are combined in a novel machine learning approach in order to estimate the likeliness of a blue ice area to be a meteorite stranding surface. Input data consists of positive and unlabeled observations. The ca. 2,500 positive observations are defined as the centers of regularly spaced grid cells containing one or more meteorite finds. The ca. 2,000,000 unlabeled observations, for which the presence of meteorites is unknown, are defined as the centers of regularly spaced grid cells overlaying blue ice areas. The size of a grid cell is 450 by 450 meter. Features of the observations, such as the surface velocity, the surface temperature, and the ice thickness, are extracted from geospatial datasets. Individual features and correlations between features indicate that positive observations differ from unlabeled observations.<br/><br/>The unlabeled observations are classified as MSS or non-MSS by training a classifier with the nontraditional training set consisting of positive and unlabeled data. The obtained classification is validated and evaluated quantitatively with positive and negative observations, where the latter are defined after investigating fieldwork reports. With an estimated accuracy of 80%, the classification shows promising results. The influence of the different features on the classification does confirm the current, qualitative, understanding of the meteorite concentration mechanism and provides a quantification of how individual features affect the meteorite concentration. In the visualization of the as MSS-classified observations, the probabilistic character of the obtained results is considered by using a color scale ranging from yellow to red. These colors indicate how likely it is to find meteorites at a MSS-classified observation (i.e. the precision of the classification).

Accordingly, ambitious targets have been set for the industrial sector. This will require additional investments in the Dutch industry which is expected to reduce the CO2 emissions at limited costs in comparison with other sectors. However, the ambition to reduce the emissions can create a risk of loss of activity and jobs if the industrial businesses prospects are not ensured. Power-to-heat technology provides an opportunity to the industry to reduce the emissions for heating processes. This technology can be implemented in hybrid configurations to ensure the electrification of heat. Hybrid configurations are characterised by their ability to switch between natural gas and electricity which could cost-effectively reduce the emissions consuming electricity at low prices. In this research, a techno-economic evaluation of hybrid boiler systems is performed to analyse the potential of this technology to cost-effectively reduce the CO2 emissions for steam generation in a production process, in 2030. To this end, the operation of hybrid boiler systems was simulated and assessed. The performance of hybrid configurations was compared to alternative options. Finally, the hybrid systems were analysed under different scenarios for 2030. The results for the case study presented, showed that hybrid configurations saved operation costs and reduced the direct CO2 emissions by almost 20%. Therefore, the hybrid boiler could cost-effectively reduce the emissions. However the potential benefits of hybrid boilers are subjected to variation of electricity, natural gas and CO2 prices.","Hybrid Boilers; Power-to-heat; Industry; Emissions Reduction; Renewable Energy; Techno-economic analysis; Electricity Prices; 2030","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

With the rapid growth of renewable but intermittent sources of electricity, energy storage systems can help smooth the variations, making the grid more stable and reducing the need for maintaining an overcapacity of power production infrastructure. Among energy storage solutions, power-to-chemical storage is of particular interest due to the high energy density of chemicals and seasonal storage capabilities. Developments made in power-to-chemical technologies can also go a long way towards making the transportation and chemical industries sustainable. The chemical considered in this work is ammonia (NH3), which has advantages of being an easily liquefiable fuel, and has also been in industrial use for over a century. This thesis project aims towards the development of an efficient power-to-ammonia energy storage system using reversible solid oxide cells. The system designed in this thesis is based on direct ammonia utilisation in fuel cell mode, and steam electrolysis coupled with Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis in the electrolysis mode. A steady state process model is designed in Aspen Plus. This is followed by extensive thermodynamic exergy analysis, used as the basis for the further design and optimisation of the system, with a goal to maximise the round trip efficiency. Exergy analysis is used to identify the sources with most scope for improvement.<br/> The final system can attain a maximum round trip efficiency of 61.20 %, improved from a basic system efficiency of 19.79 %. The maximum round trip efficiency is comparable to values reported in recent times for thermodynamically studied models from literature using other fuels, such as 56.72 % for methanol. The optimised system attains high efficiencies without the need for thermal energy storage or an afterburner. Further, it is demonstrated that the designed system is efficient enough that heat integration across modes with high temperature energy storage does not provide any significant benefit.","Energy storage; Reversible solid oxide cells; Solid oxide fuel cells; Ammonia; Reversible fuel cells; High temperature electrolysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-25","","","","","Balance Project",""

A between participants experiment (N = 28) was performed through which participants, divided over two groups, were guided by means of a training script developed according to the Four-Component Instructional Design model. Participants from both groups had to perform a simplified Conflict Detection &amp; Resolution task in which the rule of thumb was implicitly integrated. In addition, one group received additional support from an ecologically designed cognitive tool that was unexpectedly removed after a transfer manipulation. Results show that applying an instructional design method to the experiment design indeed leads to a more structured learning process and participants making significantly more use of optimal strategies, corresponding to the execution of the rule of thumb. Additionally, being trained with the cognitive tool leads to an increased awareness of the implicit rule of thumb but does not lead to an increased use of this rule. It was furthermore found that participants, who were trained with the tool, showed increased dependency on this tool. It is therefore recommended to further extend the experiment design and investigate whether including additional instructional design elements, such as phased visual elimination of the elements of the cognitive tool, could reduce participants’ dependency.","Air Traffic Control; Ecological Interface Design; Solution Space Diagram; Air Traffic Control Training; Conflict Detection & Resolution; Instructional Design; Discovery Learning; Cognitive Tools; Air Traffic Control Strategies; Competencies; Learning Tasks; Scaffolding; Transfer of Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-25","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In genetic generalised epilepsy (GGE) patients, conventional neuroimaging methods such as the MRI often appear normal and even in focal epilepsy (FE) an obvious structural abnormality is not always visualised. The objective of this exploratory case study is to identify white and grey abnormalities in epilepsy patients based on diffusion weighted imaging in comparison with healthy subjects. <br/>Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) at 3 Tesla is performed on 2 genetic generalised epilepsy patients, 1 focal epilepsy patient and 2 healthy subjects. Four DTI metrics (Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Axial Diffusivity (AD) are compared based on the mean per region of interest between subjects and between hemispheres. A DTT map of the thalamo-cortical radiations is constructed based on a probabilistic tractography (iFOD2) as implemented in MRTrix. Based on this data the structural connectivity matrix is generated. A graph theoretical analysis is performed comparing node degree, global and local efficiency, characteristic path length, (average) clustering coefficient and (average) betweenness centrality. Constructed connectomes are compared for significant different connections between nodes using network based statistics. <br/>Results: Decreased FA and MD values are reported in the hippocampus of the FE patient. DTT showed decreased tract density in the thalamo-cortical radiations in one of the GGE patients and the FE patient, together with a decreased mean streamline length compared to the two healthy subjects, which can be interpreted as a reduced structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is decreased in the FE patient compared to the other four subjects based on graph analysis. This is demonstrated by the relatively high average clustering coefficient and characteristic path length, together with a low node degree, high local efficiency and high clustering coefficient in the thalamus, the basal ganglia and the hippocampus. Conclusion: These results are potentially of aid in identification of white and grey matter abnormalities in epilepsy patients. Especially in the FE brain several abnormalities in both DTI, DTT and graph analysis are observed compared to the healthy and GGE brain. However, for the use of DTI, DTT and graph analysis as a possible imaging biomarker, a standard processing pipeline with validated reference values ranges from the healthy population needs to be developed. Also the biological interpretation of changes in network measures needs to be validated.","Epilepsy; Diffusion MRI; Structural connectivity; Tractography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","VBMEG project",""

(mentor); de Ridder, David (graduation committee); van Halem, Doris (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Arsenic in groundwater can constitute a persistent nuisance for water treatment facilities when it exceeds the admissible limit of 10 μg/L. Recently, a stricter limit has been set as a new challenging target by many companies in the Netherlands, which is below 1 μg/L. However, most of the groundwater treatment plants have been conventionally designed solely for the removal of the most common undesirable groundwater constituents, namely iron, manganese and ammonium. The current research aimed at the investigation of the operational conditions facilitating As removal in biological rapid filters simultaneously with the required Fe removal. This improved As retention should be correlated with an extended length where its adsorption takes place, thus with the deeper Fe penetration inside the bed. Therefore, this was attempted in this research. The process water used throughout the experimental tests contained As(III) and Fe(II) in order to simulate a typical anoxic groundwater quality. For the most part, a triple-layer filter bed was used, consisted of anthracite, sand and garnet. The different settings under examination involved a range of pH values (7.8, 7.1 and 6.4), two filtration velocities (2.5 m/h and 5 m/h) as well as the recirculation of the filtrate back to the feed stream. Finally, the multimedia bed was compared with a single-layer sand filter. <br/> The results of the conducted pilot column filter experiments revealed that high pH values were accompanied with high oxidation rates and thus with the creation of Fe flocks, already in the supernatant water. Due to this, at pH 7.8 and 7.1 lower Fe concentrations were detected in the effluent, denoting a higher Fe retention as compared to pH 6.4. Interestingly enough, a relatively deep Fe penetration was observed for every pH value tested. Regarding As removal, it was evidently favored by high pH values owing to the oxidation-floc formation removal mechanism of Fe (homogeneous reaction), which prevailed under those conditions. On the other hand, at pH 6.4 the adsorption-oxidation mechanism was predominant (heterogeneous reaction), which obstructed the AsOB activity. As far as the tested filtration velocities is concerned, they didn’t seem to significantly impact both Fe spread over the bed as well as As removal at the higher pH levels. Nonetheless, this was not the case for pH 6.4, in which the slow flow rate enabled the generation of more and larger Fe flakes (due to sufficient residence time in the supernatant water), which were then retained in the top part of the bed. The high flow rate on the other hand allowed Fe to reach deeper in the filter. Surprisingly, As removal seemed to be improved at 2.5 m/h, despite the Fe flocks accumulation in the upper layers. Possibly, the short experimental times not allowing equilibrium to be reached could comprise a reasonable explanation of this unexpected result. Furthermore, the filtrate recirculation stream didn’t seem to positively influence As removal. The induced dilution effect resulted in a relatively large dispersion of Fe inside the filter bed, however the essentially halved incoming Fe concentration was not sufficient to adsorb the oxidized As(V). Finally, the comparison between the multimedia bed with the single-layer filter reveals a considerably wider Fe dispersion over the bed height in the former case, which in its turn promotes a more efficient As removal. The overall conclusion of the current study is that triple-layer bed filters facilitate a more gradual Fe removal and its deeper penetration in the bed as compared to single-layer filters. This fact stimulates As removal and additionally allows for longer filter run times. Moreover, heterogeneous Fe removal seems to obstruct As oxidation by AsOB and therefore homogeneous reaction can be considered as more favorable in terms of As removal. This specific removal mechanism becomes predominant at pH levels above 7, when sufficient oxygen is available. Lastly, the operational setting of filtrate recirculation back to the filter inlet, displays a negative impact regarding As removal.","Multimedia filtration, Arsenic removal, Iron removal,","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

However, studies on the influence of the blade tip vortices on flow separation on a flap due to their interaction with the wing boundary-layer are missing. The results obtained from unsteady RANS simulations in this thesis show that the blade tip vortices significantly contribute to flow separation by causing an additional adverse pressure gradient. To prevent flow separation, the propeller can be inclined with the flap such that the slipstream increases the momentum in the flap boundary-layer. Furthermore, an increase in propulsive efficiency compared to a decoupled propeller-wing system can be achieved if a reduction in propeller thrust is prevented.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Although the underlying equation seems simple, −∆φ − k2φ = f, the numerical challenges are not. This time harmonic wave equation is known as the Helmholtz equation. The main challenge to be studied is the pollution error, which is the difference between the actual and numerical wavenumber. Due to this error, the solution of most numerical methods deteriorates rapidly when increasing the wavenumber. So far, either problem specific solutions have been found or solutions which require knowledge of the solution itself. In this thesis a numerical method is developed to approach this challenge. A mimetic discretization of the Helmholtz equation using C1-continuous Hermite interpolating polynomials is developed to model the Helmholtz equation in 2 dimensions. Mimetic theory is briefly introduced after which the Hermite polynomials are defined and analysed for their interpolating properties. A least-squares variational problem is defined and discretized using 49 basis function at its lowest order. The model is verified using a single sinusoidal wave after which<br/>plane wave problems are solved and analysed for their wavenumber-dependence. A diffraction and interference problem is set-up and compared to analytical solutions. The proposed method shows no significant advantages over the use of C0-continuous Lagrange polynomials in terms of effectiveness. Both methods show deterioration at the same wave numbers and equal polynomial order. The Hermite polynomials require less unknowns to reach the same accuracy. In short, a p-accurate solution is found using Hermite polynomials<br/>at the cost of a p − 1 model using Lagrange polynomials. This benefit in efficiency does not outweigh the additional effort and boundary information necessary to construct the problem. However, the variety of coefficients offer an opportunity for further research to find relations to the numerical wavenumber in the search of a wavenumber conserving discretization.","mimetic discretization; Helmholtz equation; Hermite polynomials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The following problem statement was formulated: <i>“To what extent do Dutch EV drivers accept V2G at long-term parking?” </i>Based on a literature review and 20 exploratory semi-structured interviews with Dutch EV users, the conceptual model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour was contextualized for V2G acceptance by extending it. The resulting model includes V2G acceptance as a core concept and following influencing main factors or categories: perceived benefits, perceived barriers, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, EV driver’s profile characteristics, trust and intention to accept. Based on the interviews, the main conclusion was that EV users predominantly showed high acceptance of V2G at long-term parking, but that it was dependent on a relatively high number of different underlying factors or sub-factors (85) and that their individual attitudes differed with regards to several topic areas or categories (e.g. perceived benefits and barriers). Most interviewees would have the intention to use V2G at long-term parking on condition that they could receive monetary compensation for possible battery degradation, compensation for experienced discomfort and that the (technical) risks of V2G participation are transparently communicated. Furthermore, the interviewees indicated that the use of V2G systems should be simple, easy-to-use and not significantly different from (using) regular charging devices. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that future research should focus on EV drivers that have practical experience with V2G systems. Furthermore, V2G system designers should adopt a consumer-centric approach by focussing on clear-cut information provision for EV users, create business cases so that EV users show a level of content, choose for V2G bi-directional charger vendors and aggregators that offer a user-friendly interface, so that EV drivers can have the option to exert control.<br","V2G; Vehicle-to-Grid; Dutch EV drivers; V2G acceptance; long-term parking; bi-directional charging; Theory of planned behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Parcel deliveries have seen a massive grow over the past several years, mainly in the B2C sector due to rise of online shopping. Due to this growing market more transport movements in the last mile are required. These extra driven kilometers add up to an increase in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In a world where the ask for more sustainable operations is on a rise, this can be seen as a problem.<br/>Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) are trying to come with solutions to tackle this problem, where most of them are of strategic kind, pushing the outcome to future instead of achieving results in the present. One of the solutions to realize emission reduction is the use of zero-emissions vehicles in the last mile delivery phase. However, current operations of these zero-emissions vehicles are not optimal. For that reason, a model is designed to optimize vehicle allocation to predetermined routes in order to keep the GHG emis- sions to a minimum.<br/>This optimization model requires a method on how to determine the GHG emissions values per driven kilo- meter and energy source used by the vehicle. People tend to think solely about CO2 when talking about environmental harming gasses. However, the largest human influence of global warming is not caused by CO2 alone, but through a combination of gasses, summarized under the term greenhouse gasses. The sum of emissions caused by these gasses is standardised with the help of a Global Warming Potential (GWP), and is presented as CO2 equivalents. Calculating and reporting on these GHG emissions can be done according to a variety of methodologies and standards.In order to achieve sector wide comparable results, the EN 16258 standard, issued by the European Committee for Standardization, is used as a guideline to specify emission values.<br/>The optimization model is setup to cope with a heterogeneous vehicle fleet. A heterogeneous vehicle fleet is considered a fleet where multiple vehicle types exist with individual characteristics in terms of range and parcel capacity. It also considers the possibility that a vehicle is able to drive multiple routes on a single given day, taking a decreasing range in to account.<br/>The effect of the optimization model is determined with the help of adequate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are total GHG emissions, total energy consumption, capacity utilization, electric vehicle utilization ratio, fuel costs and network performance. The network performance calculates the emitted grams of GHG emissions per parcel. In order to create a more insightful result the result of the KPI is rearranged to represent the number of parcels delivered per kg emitted GHG emissions.<br/>The impact of the optimization model on these KPIs was simulated and compared in a LSP’s last mile delivery network. Results from the case study showed that allocating vehicles to routes on a day to day basis, instead of a fixed schedule, improves the environmental impact as the total GHG emissions decreased and the network performance improved. Depots with higher average route distance had a negative impact when accounting for a decrease in battery capacity of electric vehicles, concluding that the model should account for cold win- ter days. By allowing vehicles to charge between routes during a single given day, depending on the charging power and time only showed a positive effect at depots with these longer average route distances. Finally, as the total fuel costs also decreased, it was concluded that no argument can be given that the model might impose extra costs, and thus a reason for not implementing it.<br/>Although the case study showed promising results for the scenario where vehicles are to roam freely between depots of a LSP at the end of each day, emissions caused by the relocation of these vehicles cancels out the achieved savings. For future research it is therefor recommended to add these relocation emissions so that a truly dynamic vehicle fleet for depots in vicinity of each other can be established.","logistics; GHG emissions reduction; Last Mile; Optimization model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

But there are still numerous obstacles that need to be overcome for telework to live up to its full potential. The proposed solution to overcome these problems is by developing more ‘human’ solutions, which means to innovate from a human perspective. This project proposes a concept that can be seen as a step towards this vision: “A more human digital workplace”. It provides one example of how technological innovations can occur through user understanding. This example has taken the form of a concept called The Hotline. A need for better cross-site collaboration has been identified and through numerous Tryout iterations the Hotline concept occured. The concept has been validated with end users. In a survey 70% of the respondents wanted the Hotline to stay and 44% was willing to pay over five euros each month for the service. At the same time organizations as Barco, the case company of this thesis, struggle with understanding their user. This is a common problem of larger organizations. Barco is a business to business technology company specialized in image processing technology. Barco has three departments: Entertainment, Healthcare and Enterprise. The last department offers solutions for the workplace such as Clickshare, a wireless presentation tool. The Enterprise department has a focus on the future of work making it the perfect candidate to receive this thesis. In parallel this project also shows the taken steps from idea to user value. The process can serve as input for best practices in the fuzzy front end of new product development.","Corporate Innovation; MVP; User research; Fuzzy front-end innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These bridges are built before 1980 and do not comply with the current standards. To evaluate the structural safety and capacity these bridges are being assessed. A total of four girders were taken from the Helperzoom bridge, named HPZ1 through HPZ4, and have been destructively tested at TU Delft to determine the shear capacity and failure mode. The first two experiments, HPZ1 and HPZ2, have been considered in this research. Shear-tension failure is one of the failure modes that was being looked for and where the experiments were based on. The most important results of HPZ1 and HPZ2 have been combined and summarized in the experimental analysis, such as the failure load, the failure mechanism, the load at which the first inclined crack occurred, the cracking angles of the observed cracks, the calculated inclinations of the compression field from the LVDT measurements, the contribution of the shear reinforcement and the contribution of the prestressing cables to the shear capacity. Remarkably, the outcome of the test resulted in shear-compression/flexure-shear failure instead of the predicted shear-tension failure. The purpose of this thesis is to check whether the observed shear capacity and failure mode from HPZ1 and HPZ2 can be validated with existing models that are currently used by (inter)national standards and numerical programs. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and five (inter)national codes: ACI 318-14 (American Concrete Institute), AASHTO 8th Edition (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials), NEN-EN 1992-1-1:2011 (Eurocode 2), RBK 1.1:2013 (Richtlijnen Bestaande Kunstwerken) and EC2 draft 2018 (prEN 1992-1-1:2018 D3), have been used to calculate the shear capacity and if possible the failure mode of the Helperzoom girders. Next to the nominal shear resistance, failure of the compression field is considered for three codes: AASHTO, EC2 and EC2 draft 2018. For the two Eurocodes the value of the inclination of the compression field can be chosen by the user: the EC2 has a lower limit of theta = 21.8°, the lower limit of the EC2 draft 2018 (based on state of strains) is reached when theta is chosen such that failure of the compression field occurs simultaneously with yielding of the stirrups. For the EC2 draft 2018 different ways have been used to determine the longitudinal strain: with the expression given in the code, analytically determined with a sectional analysis and with the results of the LVDTs in the two experiments. In addition to the analytical calculations, a non-linear finite element program Response-2010 has been used, with which a cross-sectional analysis was made with two values for the prestressing force. With this program it is easy to determine the maximum shear capacity, the failure mechanism and many other results per loading step, such as the inclination theta, acting and maximum compressive- and tensile stresses, strains, etc. The maximum shear capacity is divided into components: the contribution of the uncracked concrete, cracked concrete, transverse reinforcement and a vertical prestressing force. Four different shear capacities have been calculated: the inclined cracking load, the nominal shear resistance according to the general procedures of the design codes, failure of the compression field and the moment that failure of the compression field occurs simultaneously with yielding of the stirrups. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, ACI (flexure-shear) and Response-2010 show that the load for the first inclined crack are close to the results of HPZ1 and HPZ2. For the nominal shear capacity, none of the codes nor Response-2010 are in line with the results of the two tests: all shear capacities are underestimated. The AASHTO overestimates the shear capacity for failure of the compression field,<br/>because the inclination theta is not included in the expression. The EC2 overestimates failure of the compression field due to limitation of theta = 21.8°. The EC2 draft 2018 allows for lower values for theta, when the longitudinal strains are based on the state of strains with theta lower than 19.08°. The results for the shear capacity and inclination of the compression field of the latter design code are much more in line with the observed failure loads and inclinations calculated from the LVDTs. The lower limit for the shear capacity is when failure of the compression field occurs simultaneously with yielding of the stirrups. With this limit, the shear capacity is underestimated and the inclination of the compression field is lower than the inclination calculated from the LVDTs. <br/>The results between the three analyses have been compared with each other and it was concluded that there are major differences between the analyses for the calculated shear capacities, internal lever arms, critical positions and the inclinations of the compression field. None of the results from the codes match the observed failure load in the experiments. Considering the expressions given for failure of the compression field, the EC draft 2018 based on the state of strains were closest to the test results for both the shear capacity and the calculated inclinations of the compression field from the LVDTs. The moment that yielding of the stirrups occurs simultaneously with failure of the compression field, the EC2 draft 2018 gave too low values for the shear capacity. For the numerical results, Response-2010 gave a representative shear force for the first inclined crack and failure mechanism, but not for the ultimate shear capacity. After the onset of the first inclined crack, the girder did not build up extra capacity as was observed in the experiments. The critical position was also not in line with the results from the test. It can be concluded that the results should always be looked at from a critical point of view and that no clear answer can be given as to which analysis is the ""best"" to determine the shear capacity of (prestressed) concrete T-girders. For the Helperzoom girders the EC2 draft 2018 based on the state of strains with theta lower than 19.08° gave the best results for the shear capacity.","shear-tension; Helperzoom; Response-2010; shear-compression; ACI 318-14; AASHTO 8th Edition; Eurocode 2; RBK 1.1; Eurocode 2 draft 2018; LVDTs; failure of the compression field","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

To deal with the undesirable consequences of these events and mitigate the flood hazard, the research of flood reduction measures is necessary. In this effort, the hydrodynamic modelling is a useful tool.<br/>In this master thesis a 2D model was developed for the simulation of urban flood events in Jingan District in the downtown of Shanghai. The main objectives of the thesis were the production of the flood hazard maps for numerous rainfall events and the assessment of the proposed flood mitigation measures. Delft3D Flexible Mesh was used as a tool to produce the inundation maps. Also, several data were considered regarding the grid for the numerical calculation, the surface elevation, the local drainage system and the rainfall events. SOBEK was used for the set up and the preprocessing of the sewer system. For the simulations, data from three historical rainfall events were used: August 2005, August 1997 and September 2013 and five rainfall events with return periods of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 50 years were generated by using the Chicago hydrograph.<br/>For the validation of the model, the rainfall event of August 2005 was used. Although the validation of the model was not proven due to the simplifications that were made in the input data and the lack of data, the model showed that some processes can be simulated, and inundation maps can be produced. By comparing the results that occur with and without the inclusion of the drainage system, it was concluded that the local drainage system should be included in the analysis for the assessment of the flood hazard in an urban area, since its presence plays an important role in the flood reduction. The results showed that the maximum inundation depth can decrease by around 45%. As flood reduction measures, the creation of water storage areas and the increase of the drainage capacity were considered. The water storage areas covered around 10%, or less, of the block areas with available space, leading to a water depth reduction that depends on the location in the map. For the increase of the drainage capacity, the value of 1 m3/s was assigned in a single and in multiple locations in a specific area of investigation. The results showed a percentage of water depth reduction around 15.9% and 45.5%, respectively. For the same location the percentage of water depth reduction due to the water storage areas was 22.5%.<br/>Finally, uncertainties were introduced in the model due to the assumptions and the simplifications that were made in the input data. However, this model can work as a base for future researches to accomplish more realistic results, by improving the current model and adding more updated and precise data.<br","urban flood modelling; Delft3D flexible mesh; flood hazard management; Shanghai","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31.224361, 121.469170"

The economic activity codes in the Dutch business register are less accurate for small enterprises since small enterprises are not labelled manually. To increase the quality of the register, automatic classification of enterprises based on their websites has been tried with supervised text mining techniques. The performance of current supervised text mining techniques is limited by the available accurately labelled training data. Since inaccurate labels are available for all enterprises, the current study investigates how to leverage the noisy labelled data to improve the economic activity classification of small enterprises based on their webpage texts. The current study compares the performance of various semi-supervised methods that enlarge the training data by leveraging the abundance of noisy labelled data. The methods are compared against a supervised baseline, which uses all noisy data as is. The proposed proportional weakly self-training method queries noisy labelled instances through high probability sampling and filters mispredicted instances. Results showed that proportional weakly self-training improves upon the supervised baseline while requiring far less training instances. From qualitative analyses, we conclude that the filter of proportional weakly self-training reduces error propagation compared to classic self-training. Additional experimental results showed that large enterprises are less suitable as training data for prediction of small enterprises and that top-k performance scores improve results but are not yet sufficient for semi-automatic classification. Further examination of error detection methods is recommended to improve web-based economic activity classification.","text mining; label noise; text classification; semi-supervised learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

A number of protocols that perform this task have been proposed. In particular, the verifiable hybrid secret sharing (VHSS) scheme proposed by Lipinska et al. (2019) realizes this task while reducing the number of required qubits, as compared to other existing protocols. The VHSS scheme was proven secure for noiseless quantum networks. In this work, we analyze its performance in the presence of noise. To do that, we first define different noise models in which qubits can be randomly erased or depolarized. Then, we propose several modifications for the protocol that allow us to run it more efficiently on quantum networks described by such noise models. Additionally, we explore a new approach to the VQSS task using approximate quantum error correction. We propose the verifiable trap secret sharing (VTSS) protocol, which combines the scheme by Lipinska et al. (2019) and the trap code by Broadbent et al. (2013). Our protocol achieves the same functionalities as the VHSS protocol and only requires that a strict majority of the nodes follows the protocol honestly, raising the maximum number of nodes that can cheat from ⌊(n-1)/4⌋ to ⌊(n-1)/2⌋. We can do this at the cost of increasing the probability of error in the protocol.","Quantum Cryptography; Quantum Error Correction; Quantum Secret Sharing; Secret Sharing; Verifiable Secret Sharing; Trap Code","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Pol, Joost (mentor); Mosselman, Erik (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Backward erosion piping is a form of internal erosion where small pipes are formed below a dike. These pipes are formed in a direction opposite to the flow that transports sand particles. Piping is a very important failure mechanism in the protection of dikes, which can be unpredictable due to the different soil characteristics. Piping is well managed in the Netherlands, but there is a lot to be discovered regarding theerosion processes inside the pipe. For example, how fast the pipe develops and what this is dependent on. The objective of this thesis is to monitor and study the development of the pipe, to extend the knowledge about the different processes that influence the progression rate of the pipe. The main research question is: How do the different parameters and processes influence the progression and the sediment transport rate in laboratory experiments of backward erosion piping? To monitor the development of the pipe, different small-scale laboratory experiments were performed to obtain new data regarding piping and to study the influences of different parameters. The piping experiments were performed in three series: (1) configuration of the setup, (2) effect of grain size and (3) hydraulic loading. These experiments were performed in the previously developed setup of Vera van Beek (Van Beek, 2015). This setup was modified to measure the pore pressures and to guide the pipe through the middle of the setup. While conducting the experiments, different measurements were performed. This included measuring of the pipe length and geometry, collecting the sand boil and a dye injection to follow the flow. The literature study performed for this thesis has shown that in the past many experiments were performed regarding piping, but these studies did not focus on the different processes and the sediment transport rate of the pipe. By focussing on the progression phase of the pipe (continuous transport), the experimental data is compared to existing models (primary and secondary erosion). Sellmeijer’s model (Förster et al., 2012) is the current rule that is applied in the Netherlands for dike safety, but this model does not include time-dependency. This research showed that the development of the pipe is not a stationary process but depends on various conditions, such as<br/>soil characteristics. The hypothesis formed at the beginning of this thesis listed several soil parameters which influence the progression rate of the pipe. Concerning the sediment transport rate of the pipe, Cheng’s model for bedload transport (Cheng, 2004) is evaluated and compared with the measured results. The analysis showed that the adapted formula of Cheng (Equation 2.24) overestimates the sediment transport rate in the pipe. From the analysis of the experimental results, it can be concluded that two parameters play an important role in the progression and sediment transport rate of the pipe: the particle diameter and hydraulic permeability. These parameters showed an influence on the progression rate which can be used to study piping on a larger scale. The most interesting result is the fact that experiments with a larger particle diameter have an overall larger progression rate.","Backward erosion piping; Progression rate; Sediment transport; Small-scale experiments; Experimental research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This method uses microbiological DNA analysis of shallow soil or seabed samples to detect vertical upward microseepage from hydrocarbon accumulations, which change the composition of microbes at the surface.<br/>Microbiological DNA analysis of shallow soil or seabed samples results in a high-dimensional dataset, which is interpreted using machine learning. Using the machine learning method Elastic Net, features (microbes) are selected from an existing DNA database to classify new shallow soil or seabed samples. Multiple models, each with a different combination of externally set parameters (called hyperparameters), are trained to improve accuracy, essentially creating a grid of models. The aim of this thesis is to investigate if it is possible to accelerate feature selection on high-dimensional datasets by implementing a parallel design on a GPU to train this grid of models, and to investigate the performance of this GPU implementation. Inspired by an implementation called Shotgun, which is able to improve performance by exploiting parallelism across features when training a single model on a CPU, an implementation, named GPU Shotgun (GPU-SG) was devised, which could exploit parallelism across samples, features, and multiple models in the grid (of combinations of hyperparameters). Depending on the size of the grid and the hardware, using GPU-SG, a speedup of between 0.2 and 5.26 can be reached for sparse datasets (a datasets with lots of 0 values) when compared to standard CPU implementations. When considering dense datasets (a dataset with few 0 values), using GPU-SG, a speedup of between 0.5 and 10 can be achieved. The amount of memory available to store a dataset is lower for GPU's than for a CPU, and currently the design is limited by this, because the design does not allow a dataset that is larger than the memory available. GPU-SG can be used to design improved implementations, which reduce the time when the GPU or CPU is idle to improve performance.","Machine Learning; Elastic Net; GPU; Grid Search; Feature selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Nitrogen ends up in water bodies where it causes eutrophication, which can lead to a decrease in biodiversity. Nowadays, it is removed from water at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) via denitrification – nitrification or the anammox process. In both of these processes the end product is N2 gas, which is again emitted into the atmosphere. In recent years, however, nitrogen in the form of ammonia (NH3) has received increased attention as a valuable resource and can be found in different types of wastewaters. To produce energy from ammonia, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are used, to which ammonia should be fed in its gaseous form. For the production of ammonia from wastewater, a low carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is desired. The overall goal of the research project is to identify nitrogen-rich wastewaters from the industry and apply a series of treatment steps for the production of ammonia. Protein-rich wastewaters are especially suitable for the production of ammonia. Effluents fitting these criteria have been identified, so far, in several industrial settings, namely the slaughterhouse, food and dairy industry. Proteins can be converted to ammonia through anaerobic digestion, while producing biogas in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which can also be used for energy purposes. Next to proteins, carbohydrates and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) also make part of protein-rich wastewater. However, not a lot is known about the co-digestion of proteins and these simple carbon sources. Some aspects have been investigated, but thorough research on the whole degradation is needed to fully understand the process. The master thesis research presented in this report focused on the anaerobic degradability of proteins in the presence of sugars and VFAs. Three proteins (bovine serum albumin [BSA], casein and gelatin) were selected from the identified industries and assessed based on degradation efficiency and kinetic rates, under mesophilic batch test conditions. Furthermore, the conversion of protein to ammonia was assessed and parameters to define a biological ammonia potential (BAP) are defined. An increase in the degradation coefficient after the co-digestion with sugar was observed for gelatin (1.1 to 1.6 d-1) and BSA (0.57 to 0.68 d-1). Pure proteins were degraded efficiently with 71 - 96% compared to 76 - 97% of the co-digested batches. A combination of conversion efficiencies and the newly introduced biological ammonia potential gave a good indication on the conversion of protein to NH+4 . Acidification with VFAs resulted in process instabilities with respect to the methane production rate, which was due to the applied ratio of propionate to acetate. To prevent this in future trials, amino acid analysis to predict the production of VFAs from protein was evaluated with a maximum deviation of 14% of measured to theoretical values. This study demonstrated the efficiency of co-digestion to degrade protein-rich substrates. Further research is required to unveil the impact of high ammonia concentrations and explore the microbiological aspect of protein fermentation. Finally, considerations for a test to assess the biological ammonia potential are given.","Anaerobic Digestion; Proteins; Amino Acids; Kinetics; Removal Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-21","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The Amsterdam UMC currently exists out of the two hospitals VUmc and AMC merging to become one hospital. The neonatology department is one of the first departments that will merge. There will soon be two large changes ahead for the department: (1) employees of both hospitals will work together and (2) the AMC will be renovated to a new center that holds neonatology and obstetrics. 'Sharing the same vision and wanting to achieve a common goal with employees are key elements for successful change' (Gill, 2002). As the current vision of neonatology was not shared amongst all employees and there was a multi-annual plan or road to the vision missing, this was concluded the assignment of this graduation thesis. First, nine future themes were created by combining insights from stakeholder interviews and future foresight. These nine themes were used to create a vision concept that was further improved by cocreation with internal stakeholders of both hospitals. The new vision was then concluded as the new shared department vision in several stakeholder sessions. The new vision states: 'a department with the best care, which is child- and family-centric'. Thereafter it was evaluated with all internal stakeholders (nurses, doctors, management of both hospitals) how the vision is currently being reached in projects and what was ought to be missing. With these insights, a map of current change was created. To enhance this road to reach the vision, a design roadmap (innovation strategy) was created. As one of the largest changes in the vision is the family-centricity, this was used as an innovation vision. Ideas were proposed in three horizons with a different focus, though all to enhance the family-centred services. These are ideas for improvement on employee experience (1), family experience (2) and integration of perinatology (3) to enhance the current road ahead. It provides a focus for the department: what are short-term solutions that need to be focused on now and what are long-term solutions that can be focused on later on in the change process. The short-term solutions have a focus on employee experience to enhance their happiness and satisfaction during a difficult time of change and new way of working in the renovated department. Improved employee experience is expected to have a large positive influence on the family experiences. The longer term solutions improve family experiences with services of value creation towards families. This is important at neonatology, as the emotional state of parents can influence the condition of the premature on short and long term (Civic &amp; Holt, 2000; Manning, 2012). Lastly, the final horizon solutions provide a further integration of perinatology: where nurse roles work from a parent journey perspective and cross silos of neonatology and obstetrics.","Innovation Strategy; Vision; Change management; Stakeholder engagement; Health Care; Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

They also gain a valid (set of) idea(s) , which they can start using already.The goal with the Circularity game was to improve the Circularity Deck, through gamification, in such a way that it...: ...stimulates creativity, multidisciplinary cooperation and innovation more;...motivates its users to engage more with it, driving enthusiasm and use;...is an easily accessible, stand-alone, ready to use product.From a project perspective, the value lies in showing that gamification is a worthwhile approach to reaching these goals and that further research and design in this direction is warranted.The project started with understanding the theory behind creativity and gamification. Taking the understanding of this and combining it into one theoretical construct that could be used in the design.The next step in the project was to better understand what the Circularity game should be. To know this, the various methods and tools were evaluated and chosen (most notably Octalysis) and an understanding of the intended user needs was created. The original deck was analyzed on a functional level and the goals for it, from the creators’ perspective, were established.What followed was creating a functional design filling the gaps of the original and laying the basic framework of what the new design should be. It took into account the various goals of the creators and the needs of the users in conjunction with the tools that Octalysis provided, specifically the core drives and the amount they needed to be applied in the design. This resulted in a ‘skeleton’ of requirements that could be filled with the right amount of ideas, fitting the established requirements.Next up was filling this ‘skeleton’ with the needed ‘meat’. This was done through various ideation methods, creating solutions for the problems provided by the framework. Which solutions to use and which to exclude was based on the established understanding at that point.To avoid a ‘Frankenstein’s monster’, the design included an envisioning of how it would be used and interacted with by the users. This helped to shape the Circularity game into a coherent, well working and pleasant experience.Near the end of the project, a working prototype of the new Circularity game was made and tested in a small student group, the results of this can be found near the end of the report.The report ends with conclusions and reflections on the design and provides recommendations for further research and development. The main conclusion is that the gamification seems to be working and that further development in this direction seems a worthwhile endeavor for the Circularity deck or game. However, the conducted test was very limited and can only be seen as a positive early indicator of the value of gamification.","Gamification; Everyday creativity; Circular design; Circularity deck","en","master thesis","","","","","","The showcase file is a .zip.

Traditional propulsion control systems do not take these variations into account, and attempt to maintain a constant shaft speed. These changing torques, in combination with inefficient control efforts, can increase mechanical wear and tear on the diesel engine, and reduce efficiency. More advanced control algorithms relying on the axial flow velocity of water through the propeller have shown great promise. Unfortunately, this velocity, also known as the advance velocity, is very difficult or impossible to measure. Therefore, it is possible to use state observers to estimate the advance velocity using available measurements of shaft speed and torque. However, the current state of the art regarding advance velocity estimation is very limited.In this paper, a complete model of a ship propulsion system is created. Several different observer structures are applied to the propulsion model to estimate the advance velocity. These include a Luenberger observer, a Shaft Kalman Filter (SKF), a Power Balance Estimator (PBE), a Measured Shaft Acceleration (MSA) observer with and without measurements of shaft acceleration, an Immersion &amp; Invariance (I&amp;I) observer and a Random Walk Kalman Filter (RWKF). The performance of these advance velocity observers using different observer gains is compared using several load cases. These load cases are used to assess time domain accuracy with and without measurement noise, and robustness to errors in a priori information regarding the propulsion system. The findings indicate a clear trade off between noiseless accuracy, and robustness to noise. If an observer has high observer gains, it is more accurate when no noise is present, but more sensitive to measurement noise, and vice versa. Furthermore, higher gains also lead to more robustness to errors in a priori information. The errors that lead to the most significant estimation errors were errors in the open water propeller diagrams, with errors in the shaft inertia proving to be much less significant. That being said, if accurate shaft acceleration is available, the MSA observer is most effective. If this data is unavailable or inaccurate, a choice must be made. If measurement noise robustness is paramount, the RWKF or an I&amp;I observer with low gains is most effective. If absolute accuracy is most important, and the measured variables are virtually free of noise, an I&amp;I observer with high gains is the best choice. The RWKF provided a very good compromise between noise robustness and noiseless accuracy, but requires a large amount of a priori information. Suggestions for future research include testing the observers in both cavitation tunnels and full scale propulsion systems, and implementing multivariable propulsion control using the estimated advance velocity.","advance; velocity; observer; marine; propulsion; CPP; propeller; controllable; pitch; ship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

By doing so, we aim to create an environment in which teenagers can seek help. Where they can learn how to cope with uncertainties before they turn into bigger and long lasting mental health issues. The thesis does not aim to solve the problem of mental illnesses nor be a solution that prevents it. It aims to create an environment where this changes just enough to move in the right direction and offers a space for solutions with bigger changes. <br/>The thesis starts with research. The research phase consists of literature, interviews with people who work with teenagers and a workshop with teenagers themselves. Four cornerstones are selected from the research to build the design upon. These cornerstones are: the tool will help teenagers discover their talents, give them control, show teens they are not the only ones and use gaming to increase motivation. Based on these corner stones the tool is designed through ideation, first testing, development and prototype testing, phase. The tool consists of three elements: a game, amulet and application. The first test consists of 23 teenagers in three sessions in which the assumptions and first ideas are tested. The prototype testing is done during 8 sessions of 6 teenagers. The 48 teens played the game. 42 Interacted with the amulet and 15 offered feedback on the application as well. The teenagers show excitement in discovering their talents through a game. They like the fun and social aspect and the fact that they did not have to assign talents to themselves. However, they experienced that the initial size of the amulet as too big. In the next iteration the size is reduced. Furthermore, the application is given more attention and function. The teenagers express that simply having an object to touch was too abstract. The teenagers also express a need for practicality and understandability. The designed tool helps teenagers discover their talents through a story based game. The game is played with six teenagers and facilitated by a teacher. The teenagers explore these talents over the next week. Through touching the amulet when the teens use their talents, it functions as a non-intrusive cognitive offloading. Later, the app will send a notification and ask them to explain more about the activity during which they used their talents. The app provides guidance in exploring those moments. It breaks the moments up in smaller pieces. It also covers moments in which teens cannot use their talents. After a week, the teenager can use the application and data they stored during a conversation with their mentor. I chose to ask feedback from more teenagers during a short session rather than testing the tool over a week. This is the proposed next step of the project alongside development of the app and working together with experts on the story and questions of the game. The test should be validated to start the implementation phase.","Design; Teenagers; Talents; Game; Gamification; Empower teenagers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This ferry, MF Ampere, is powered by batteries and is sailing in an UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Netherlands, the Wadden Sea is an UNESCO World Heritage Site with multiple ferry routes where the most recent ferries are sailing on natural gas to reduce emissions. However, there are no initiatives for zero-emission ferries yet. Therefore, the research question of this thesis is: What is the potential technical, economic, social, and political feasibility of zero-emission ferries in the Wadden Sea? The political economy model for transport innovations of Feitelson and Salomon (2004) is used as framework. Literature and policy papers are used in combination with six interviews with actors. <br/>In total, four zero-emission alternative technologies are selected (batteries, hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia) with in total eight configurations. The technical and economic feasibility of these suggested innovations are analysed for three different areas in the Wadden Sea. The total weight of the energy storage systems and the frequency of bunkering or charging are major factors for the feasibility. Since zero-emission hydrogen is produced with electrolysis and hydrogen-carriers methanol and ammonia are produced with hydrogen, air (CO2/N2) and electricity, the electricity rate is the most important factor for the operational expenditures for zero-emission ferries. Batteries have the lowest total cost of ownership, even lower than diesel (which is used as reference fuel). This is mainly due the high efficiency during production, charging, and converting. Zero-emission ferries are socially desirabe in the Wadden Sea. However, there are negative aspects for each selected alternative. Furthermore, the sanctioned discourse includes aspects that can make adoption of innovations more difficult. The political feasibility is based on the social feasibility and the decision making process. Many interviewees see concessions and the concession criteria as a policy tool that can be used to stimulate zero-emission ferries. However, the first window of opportunity is most likely before the next concession starts in 2029 and long-term planning with ferry operators is difficult in the concession system. Zero-emission ferries can be used as platform to show ferry-users why the Wadden Sea has an UNESCO World Heritage status.","Wadden Sea; Ferries; Zero-emission; Battery-electric; Hydrogen; Methanol; Ammonia; Feasibility; Emissions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

A concept artefact on design choices was developed and evaluated with domain experts. The study shows that openness is desired from the perspective of IS suppliers but that openness can never come at the cost of loss of quality or security.

Moreover, having a fail-safe provision to return the crew back to Earth in case of a mission abort situation is highly desirable. This thesis research investigated several optimal/sub-optimal and feasible solutions for the high-thrust interplanetary transfer and abort trajectories of a reconnaissance human Mars mission. A conjunction-class mission architecture has been analyzed to transport the crew to and from Mars during the transfer opportunities in 2028 and 2030, respectively. Baseline requirements of such a mission were defined by finding the optimal ballistic Earth-to-Mars and Mars-to-Earth transfer trajectory solutions. A number of propulsive abort trajectory solutions were then computed that can return the crew back to Earth when the nominal mission is aborted either during the Earth-to-Mars transfer or during the Mars surface stay period. A semi-analytic trajectory model was used for the design of such abort trajectories that can include one or two deep space maneuvers and a powered Mars swing-by. With the use of a meta-heuristic global optimization algorithm, multi-objective optimization problems were solved to minimize the ΔV cost and the interplanetary transit duration of the mission. By comparing the transfer and abort trajectory solutions, it was concluded that various abort trajectory options can be provided for a reconnaissance human Mars mission, that also satisfy the imposed constraint on the arrival excess velocity. The effects of such abort trajectory options on the ΔV cost and other baseline mission requirements (such as the total mission duration) were analyzed. Critical challenges of such a safe human Mars mission architecture have been identified and discussed.","Trajectory design; Human Space Flight; Mars; interplanetary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-20","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Exploration","",""

The fluid pipes are integrated in the foundation piles, which makes it cost-attractive, but also relatively new to the Dutch geotechnical industry. By lowering the temperature limit of the anti-freeze fluid in the pipes the heat extraction and thereby also the necessary pile length can be optimized. However, the resulting thermal loads might influence the structural function and are therefore a main obstruction for the industry. Within this thesis three aspects of freezing-thawing of an axially compressed end-bearing energy pile are evaluated: (i) frost resistance of concrete, (ii) thermal analysis and (iii) geotechnical analysis. The objective is to work towards a conclusion on the degradation effects of freezing-thawing processes along the edge of an end-bearing energy pile and come up with practical advice for the design. The behaviour of the concrete is evaluated by literature, wherein the concrete thermal conductivity and mixture are key elements. For the thermal analysis a pile group simulation and a detailed single pile analysis is performed in Comsol Multiphysics. The soil stratigraphy is simplified and based on the Western part of the Netherlands. The input originates from the heat-cool demand of a single household related to the monthly gas usage in the Netherlands. Typical heat extraction for this specific case, i.e. long-term average amount of 7 W/m, for 7 years did not result in freezing temperatures at the edge of the most critical piles. Freezing occurred after an increased heat extraction until 10 W/m. Furthermore, the influence of daily cycles in the single pile analysis damped by the thermal resistance of the concrete pile. The geotechnical analysis is assessed in an axisymmetric model in Plaxis with and without a fully-coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) module. The first set of analyses with THM examines the influence of expansion and contraction of materials including phase changes, but without changes in soil mechanical and physical properties. Two situations are considered that are different in terms of the position of their neutral plane and negative shaft resistance. The resulting settlements can be distinguished as initial structural load and settlements due to thermal seasonal cycles, which fluctuate between 1 mm. A ratcheting behaviour was observed and resulted in a settlement of 12 and 3 mm over 5 years. However, the volumetric strain accumulation around the pile indicates unrealistic results in the THM module and conclude that the simulation of freezing-thawing cycles has to be done in a more advanced constitutive model which can capture freezing-thawing behaviour of soils. Within the second set of analyses the impact of the soil strength and stiffness due to a freezing-thawing cycle was investigated for the two situations to determine their effect on the pile behaviour in terms of load-displacement and shear distribution. The results indicate that effective cohesion is most influencing the pile behaviour and it indicates that no need exist to change the design approach of end-bearing piles as long as the potential negative shaft resistance along the pile over all layers above the bearing layer is included in the design calculation and considered fully mobilized.","energy pile; Geothermal Energy; Ground source heat pump; Thermo-hydro-mechanical; Freezing-thawing; Concrete degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Using GNSS systems for Lunar navigation proves difficult, however, due to the signals being weak and having limited coverage. This thesis investigates, through numerical simulation, the usage of a constellation of Polar or Equatorial Medium Earth Orbit (PECMEO) satellites for Lunar navigation. The system is proposed as alternative for orbit determination using ground-based observations, making navigation of the spacecraft more autonomous, without limitations on the number of receivers. A navigation constellation of 9 satellites at an orbital radius of 14 000 km is designed by minimizing the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP). The resulting Pareto front of optimum solutions consists of two distinct groups of constellations. Firstly, constellation with lower mean GDOP and higher maximum GDOP have two orbits approximately orthogonal to the ecliptic plane, while the third orbit is in the ecliptic plane. Meanwhile, a second group of solutions with slightly higher mean GDOP, but significantly lower maximum GDOP are found for constellation with one plane approximately orthogonal to the ecliptic plane, while the remaining two planes have an inclination of near 45 degrees. One of the latter group of solutions has been chosen for the system for its lower maximum GDOP. The effect of omitting observations passing through the ionosphere is investigated to determine if there is a need to obtain observations at multiple frequencies to allow for ionospheric corrections. Omitting those observations results in a slightly increased GDOP right before and after a satellite passes behind Earth, of up to 56.4%. However, only 13.9% of the samples are effected, making the overall effect rather small. The positioning accuracy of the system is assessed by simulating pseudorange and carrier phase observations, and solving these with point position and kinematic least squares methods. Two main error contributions on the solutions are caused by observation noise and navigation satellite ephemerides errors. A solution for observations without ephemeris error, a mean 3-dimensional position error of 3.3m is obtained. A solution for noiseless observations yields a mean 3-dimensional position error of 26.8m. Finally, the solution obtained from observations with all simulated errors results in a mean 3-dimensional position error of 27.0m, to which the ephemeris errors are thus the main contributors, despite optimistic assumptions on their magnitude. The observed accuracy shows that the system is a viable navigation method for Lunar spacecraft.","PECMEO; Navigation; Positioning; Cosntellation; Moon; Lunar; GDOP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This happens in layered structures where the thickness of the individual layer is small with respect to the induced wavelengths. An example of these structures is the wall of a typical blast furnace. Imaging these domains require a method based on the interference pattern in the frequency domain. This method is already widely used for imaging concrete structures. However, these consists of only one or two layers. This study introduces a FullWaveform Inversion scheme which extends the usability of themethod to multilayered domains. Itminimizes the error between measurements and a forward model. To reduce the computation load, a simplified forward model based on a plane wave response in a vertically layered medium is adopted. Pre-processing steps are necessary to remove the effect of the source wavelet and to enhance the peaks and troughs positions. A sensitivity analysis provides information about the usability of the method. This shows only layers with standing wave frequencies in the range of the induced source wavelet can be imaged. Furthermore, results show it is impossible tomeasure the wave velocity and thickness of a single layer simultaneously given our simplified forward model. Multichannel measurements over an aperture of 500 mm are required to transform a spherical wave response to its plane wave equivalent in order to fit the forward model. Tapering the sides of the aperture is essential to reduce simulation artefacts. The inversion scheme is successfully tested on synthetic data of a blast furnace wall in the acoustic and elastic domain using realistic simulations of the measured data.","Inversion scheme; Ultrasound; Multichannel; Impact Echo; IE; NDT; Frequency Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shipping lines aim to gain market share in the container port hinterlands by means of offering inland transport chain services to their customers, which should be sufficiently attractive based on costs, operational efficiency and provided services. A particular way of improving the inland transport chain is by effectively making use of inland terminals. Inland terminals allow to transport containers through cost-efficient intermodal set-ups and can be used as local storage spaces for customers’ containers. By setting up inland terminals dedicated to the needs of the shipping line and its customers, capacity can be sufficiently committed to import and export container flows and a unique selling point in the hinterland can be created which facilitates the provision of door-to-door services to customers. The location of such an inland terminal within the inland transport<br/>chain is essential; it determines the distances between the terminal and the seaport and shipper/consignee locations, and thus the (cost-)efficiency of the broader transport chain.

Although the success rate of dental implants is high, complications such as lack of osseointegration and peri-implantitis can occur. In this study a new type of dental implant is designed that mimics the root shape of the to be extracted tooth. These types of implants can be placed directly after extraction. To create these type of implants, CBCT scan, 3DXpert software, and SLM printing techniques are used. The aim of this current study is to investigate the application possibilities of antimicrobial surfaces created with the PEO process on these new types of dental implants and compare them with standard screw-type implants. Both implant types were analysed in terms of surface morphology, chemical composition, phase composition, Ag ion release profile and in vitro antimicrobial activity. All surfaces of the implants were successfully treated using the PEO process. The titanium oxide layer was formed homogeneously on all implants and resulted in a microporous surface layer. Using the zone of inhibition test, it was identified that all implants showed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), however a larger growth inhibition zone was identified for porous patient-specific implants than screw-type implants. The ion release test indicated that a higher ion release was found on the porous patient-specific implants with a higher surface area than the screw-type dental implants, which is probably related to the surface area of the implants. This study indicates it is possible to create patient-specific dental implants that show antimicrobial properties against MRSA.","antimicrobial surfaces; Dental implants; 3D print","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-22","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This work has focused on identifying orbital designs which would optimise the geodetic parameters estimate, and thus best help characterise the asteroid's internal structure. The orbit determination solutions have been computed from simulated tracking data in various orbital configurations. To compensate the highly perturbed nature of the binary asteroid's environment, pseudo-periodic solutions identified around Eureka have been used as stable initial conditions for the spacecraft orbits. As Eureka's shape, gravity field and rotational state are not well characterised yet, large resulting uncertainties have been accounted for. They have been propagated to assess the robustness of the spacecraft orbits and subsequent orbit determination solutions to dynamical mismodelling, in order to eventually limit the science risk of the mission. For single CubeSat configurations, an optimal semi-major axis has been identified, being the one closest to the asteroid before orbital instability would start deteriorating the orbit determination solution. Non-equatorial retrograde orbits have been found to provide the lowest formal errors for geodetic parameters. Moreover, the benefit of simultaneously deploying two or even three CubeSats around the asteroid has been demonstrated. In both the two and three CubeSats configurations, promising orbital designs have been identified. They provide an estimation of the geodetic parameters which is accurate enough to bring insights into Eureka’s internal structure, and has been proven to be robust to dynamical mismodelling. <br/>The methodology developed in this work is of interest to design other small-spacecraft small-body missions, and optimise their achievable geodetic parameters estimate. Additionally, Eureka's dynamical model and the large uncertainties assigned to it have been mostly based on models available for other binary asteroids. This brings confidence in the possible applicability of the identified optimal orbital designs to CubeSats missions targeting other binary asteroids.","Binary asteroids; Orbit determination; Orbital design; Small satellites; Uncertainties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Currently, up to two-thirds of the cycle time is spent on heating and cooling. To meet the growing demand for flex-on-substrate production in the future, the heating and cooling steps must be more time-efficient. In this thesis, a bonding module is designed that is heated and cooled by using a 150W halogen lamp as a heating source and a staggered-tube heat exchanger with forced airflow as a cooling system. The design requires understanding of the bonding process and models containing the governing physics. Therefore, finite element models were made for both heating and cooling which were validated by manufacturing a demonstrator and applying a typical thermocompression bonding temperature profile to the heating element. From the experiment it follows that the concept shows potential for further product development but does not yet perform as required. The reflector surface reflectance,which has an important impact on the energy efficiency, was too low in this demonstrator. Furthermore heat leaks away from the heating element which inhibits a fast temperature rise and the complex cooling system geometry leads to manufacturing errors, which cause leaks in the cooling channel. By improving the design on these points, this concept can decrease the current cycle time by more than 50% and keep up with the growing demand for flex-on-substrate assemblies.","Thermocompression bonding; electronics assembly; ACA; ACF; Flex-on-substrate; Flex-on-board","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Climate models have difficulties in predicting the frequency and intensity of future droughts on regional scales, possibly caused by inadequate representation of land surface hydrological processes. Vegetation is controlling the Earth's water and energy balance by transporting water from the subsurface to the atmosphere, through its roots. The water storage capacity in the vegetation's rootzone is a key parameter in predicting evaporation fluxes in land surface models because its size determines how long into the dry season vegetation is able to evaporate. Ecosystems design the size of their rootzone water storage reservoir to optimally function and to overcome dry periods, based on climatic conditions. Whereas climate is the major driver of root development, the rootzone storage capacity in the HTESSEL land surface scheme is only dependent on soil type and modelled soil depth. Moreover, the model describes root parameters by tables based on scarce observations of individual plants that do not represent ecosystem scales. This research aims to analyse the effect of the climate-based mass balance method for estimating the maximum water storage capacity in the vegetation's rootzone on the representation of water and energy fluxes in the HTESSEL land surface model. Maximum rootzone water storage capacities are estimated for 15 river catchments in Australia based on catchment-scale water balances. These estimates are implemented in the current surface parameterisation of the HTESSEL land surface model and offline simulations are performed. The current model performance and the model performance with adapted rootzone water storage capacities are evaluated regarding simulation of water and energy fluxes. According to this study, the storage capacity in the vegetation’s rootzone represented in HTESSEL is larger than the mass-balance derived estimates. The model strongly overestimates evaporation fluxes and thereby underestimates river discharge, with larger relative simulation errors in the dry season than in the wet season. The climate-based mass balance total rootzone water storage capacities have small effects on the representation of water and energy fluxes by the model, but contribute to a consistent improvement in predicting these fluxes. Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies of the modelled river flows improve on average from 0.44 in the base model to 0.51 in the model with mass balance rootzone water storage capacities. The results indicate that the inadequate rootzone representation is a source of modelling error. However, it is expected that other hydrological process are also inadequately represented by the model, as the modelling simulation errors remain large when implementing mass balance rootzone water storage capacities. Moreover, it was found that internal vegetation dependent model parameters strongly influence the simulated fluxes and could therefore be another source of model bias. This study shows that investigating uncertainties in the representation of the rootzone in the HTESSEL land surface model is paramount. More research on the representation of hydrological processes in land surface models could lead to significant improvements in climate model predictions.","Hydrology; Rootzone; Land surface models; Climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The statistics from Centers for Medicare services (CMS) [15] website shows that in 2017, in USA, the healthcare industry has invested USD 7.4 billion for research collaborations with physicians. These research collaborations in CMS is spread across multiple facets ranging from contributing towards research, developing new products, running clinical trials, royalty, licences, patents, providing innovative ideas etc. In this thesis, we make an assumption that, a relationship between investment made by the healthcare company and the research profile of a physician exists. We aim to answer, what could possibly be the relation between payments made by the healthcare company; on the physicians and the research profile of the physicians. The research profile of a physician includes factors like h-index, years of research experience, citation count, physician citation network, etc. To validate this relationship we use the data corresponding to returns of the healthcare company. Some of the measures of returns, from a research collaboration between physicians, include, innovation, good will, fame, market share, Return on Investment (ROI). We choose ROI, as a measure of return, due to the availability of data and to determine the relationships mentioned above. <br/> <br/>To understand the above mentioned relationship, we explore two types of relationships, i.e., direct and indirect relationship. In the direct relationship, we use multiple regression model to understand the direct relationship between the research payments and the research profile of the physicians, by making an assumption that the research profile of the physician describes the research quality of the physician. In the indirect relationship, we make use of a weighted physician co-author citation network, to investigate the relationship between his/her co-author interactions and the research payments he/she received from the healthcare company. To accomplish this, we developed a spreading process that models influence diffusion in a physician citation network. The diffusion of influence is dependent on the topological property of the node in the network.<br/><br/>Our models are an exemplification of the direct and indirect relationships, which exists in the real world. To evaluate our models, we use metrics such as coefficient of determination, Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation. Once the models were evaluated, we inferred that the model for indirect relationship, explains the relationship between research profile, investments, and return 96.3% more than the model for direct relationship. We also perform a deep analysis, by investigating the nature of the distributions of the variables and scatter plots to understand the relationship between the variables used in understanding the direct and indirect relationship. Lastly, we propose two different redistribution methods, where the original payments made to physicians are redistributed to a potential group of physicians in the physician citation network. These potential physicians are identified based on their topological property. In consequence, our redistribution methods may inspire the healthcare companies, to design their future investments made to physicians. <br","Spreading Process; Network Topological Metrics; Payment Redistribution; Regression Analysis; Physician Citation Network; Research Profile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","","",""

The development of the Cofra Roller Compaction (CRC), a non-circular impact roller, has proven to be valuable in these projects. However, the heterogeneity of the subsoil causes locally a non-uniform degree of compaction. Traditional compaction control tests are limited in measuring depth, expensive and cause time delay. Therefore, the Continuous Compaction Control (CCC) and Continuous Impact Response (CIR)method were developed<br/>in order to provide more real-time information of the compaction based on the response of the drum of the roller. The aim of this study is to develop a semi-empirical energy model which is based on the contact forces of the roller-soil interface as most CCC systems, but also uses field test data as was given in the CIR system to validate this model. The relevant parameters needed for this model were obtained from the field test conducted for the HES Hartel Tank Terminal project in Rotterdam. These included the impact acceleration, the cone resistance, the in situ density, the dynamic modulus and the dynamic plate load test velocity. Two methods are considered in this thesis and both aim to reproduce the measured values from the dynamic plate load test during the field test. The first method considers the acceleration signals and includes double numerical integration of these signals to obtain the displacement, while the other considers modelling the roller as a dynamic plate load test and obtaining the displacement from solving a 2-DOF spring-mass-damper system.<br/>However, after analysis of the motion of the roller, it was observed that due to the non-circular shape of the roller, a wedge effect was created where horizontal shearing forces caused loosening of the soil. This inhibited soil compaction up to 0.5 m depth. The impact acceleration signals were thus not representative of the soil compaction. Nonetheless, the DPL-Soil model was proven to be successful in correlating the soil settlement to the dynamic modulus. This study considers a silty sand, so further research should be carried out to obtain correlations for various soils. In order to develop the semi-empirical energy model, it is thus recommended to capture an accurate acceleration response. This can be done by placing accelerometers at a minimum depth of 0.5 m, replacing the 8G accelerometer with e.g. 16G accelerometer and increasing the sampling rate to at least 1000 Hz. In order to filter out the soil variability, a field test with the roller should be performed on a homogeneous sand without fines. Correlations can then be drawn again for the same field tests performed in this thesis. Finite Element Modelling (FEM) could be used to model the interaction between the non-circular shape of the lobe, the rolling motion and the soil. This might form a better correction method for the acceleration signals than those explained in this thesis. Low frequency geophones can be used to measure the velocity directly. This because low frequency data of the accelerometer should be removed and the roller works on a low frequency. The load imparted to the ground could also be measured directly by burying earth pressure cells at a minimum depth of 0.5m and at various depths to get a more accurate representation of the pressure distribution through the soil layers. By using other numerical integration methods such as Simpson’s 3/8 rule and Boole’s rule, the numerical accuracy of the displacement response of the roller could also be improved.","impact roller; Compaction; acceleration","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Although traditional construction processes are optimized in terms of efficiency, costs and material use, the main disadvantages are still related to the use of formwork, labour and limited freedom of shapes in architectural design. The future of concrete structures looks promising with the development of 3D concrete printing techniques. Research to 3D concrete printing systems and printable concrete mix designs led to the development of 3D printed bridges, houses and other pioneer structures. On the other hand, the influence of printing process parameters on the mechanical properties of printed elements is still a relevant research topic. The layer-wise construction process inevitably introduces interfaces between adjacent filaments. Therefore the experimental research of this master thesis focussed on the influence of printing process parameters. Samples were tested in tension, compression and tensile splitting. The time interval between printing two filaments was the first parameter to investigate. The results showed significant strength decrease with increasing time intervals. The second variable was therefore the effect of different curing conditions applied to printed filaments with a time interval of three hours. Results showed that it is possible to limit the strength decrease when curing of the printed filaments is applied. Finally, the nozzle standoff distance with respect to the printed filament was a variable in this research, as a nozzle with backflow was used. No significant differences were observed between different nozzle standoff distances. The anisotropic compressive strength and the tensile splitting strength were hardly influenced by the different printing process parameters. 3D concrete printing shows potential, but lack of design and calculation methods are still a limitation for the implementation of this technique in the national codes and guidelines. Therefore, the second part of this research was numerical research to investigate the possibilities to match the properties of a numerical finite element model with the experimental results, to be able to verify the strength of printed structures. The tensile bond strength test and the compressive strength test were simulated and both the interface and filament properties were assigned such that the numerical results matched the experimental results in tension. In compression it was possible to match two of the three loading directions. Finally, a hypothetical case study in Mali was studied. An emergency shelter scenario was chosen because the current shelter solutions are mainly built for short term use. 3D printed shelters benefit from the short construction time, but may provide better indoor climate, and a better feeling of safety, which possibly contributes the well-being of humans. The design of the emergency shelter was based on both the construction procedure, the green strength development of printed filaments, and the final strength of the material. In the end, numerical calculations showed that the shelter fulfils the requirements and complies to the code. The 3D concrete printing technique shows potential for new solutions for humanitarian problems, and possibly let people realize that the investment in 3D concrete printed emergency shelters is feasible.","3D concrete printing; Printing process parameters; Numerical modelling; Concrete Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

It was argued that it was the ambiguity of this display leading to RREs. Later, using non-pilots, it was found that RREs were in many cases caused by expectation-induced misperception of the AI bank angle, which can arise from a pilot experiencing spatial disorientation. The current study evaluated the role of expectation in the control strategy of professional pilots using a hexapod simulator. First, an effective man-in-the-loop spatial disorientation scenario was developed, based on the ‘leans’ illusion. Here, the expectation of ten experienced and eight novice pilots was manipulated with the simulator motion without the AI, after which they had to turn the aircraft back level when the AI was shown again. An error was made in 16.7% of the runs where the bank angle on the AI was opposite to the earlier given physical motion cues, which is 2.9 times more compared to a baseline condition in which no motion, and thus no manipulated expectation, was present. In a third condition where a motion-induced expectation of the bank angle was present, but a level AI was shown later, no errors were made. It was also found that experienced pilots made slightly more errors than novice pilots and that their reaction time was on average half a second higher.<br/>It was concluded that an initially induced expectation about the bank angle does not directly influence the control strategy of pilots, but that it does make them more vulnerable to misinterpretations of the AI, leading to RREs being made. This should be taken into account when developing new displays and technologies, as it should at all times guide pilots in their decision-making, minimizing the chance of misinterpretations.","Perception; Roll Reversal Error; Hexapod; Spatial disorientation; Aerospace; Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-09","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The growing demand for more offshore wind farms and the desire to make this technology more cost-effective has created many challenges for offshore contractors and their technology, particularly for turbine installation vessels. Currently, the most widely used equipment is the jack-up type crane vessels. These vessels have been optimised for turbine installation operations but are now starting to reach their limits in performance, based on the further improvement of the wind turbines, the fact that the wind farms located further and deeper at the sea. As a result, new designs may be better suited to the challenging requirements of the wind farm developers. In practical terms, it is difficult to predict whether a new concept will perform better another. Operational data from past turbine installation vessel operations can be used to identify important parameters that influence performance but is not practical when applied to unconventional designs such as the concept ship, “Wind Turbine Shuttle” designed by Huisman Equipment in the Netherlands. An extensive study is necessary requiring perhaps the development of new analysis tools. This study attempts to identify the major parameters that influence the operations of turbine installation vessels. It investigates with the use of different operational scenarios, how the procedure of installation and transportation of these vessels are influenced by their parameters such as the pre-assembly method of the wind turbine or the wind turbine sizes and their operating environment, using a market and technology review of the wind farm market, a sensitivity analysis of various design parameters and different case strategies investigating the performance of different turbine installation vessels operating in a predefined wind farm location. Because several strategies have shown that weather delays have a major effect on the workability of the vessel, the simulation model uses wave height time series data from measurements made in the North Sea. For the sensitivity studies of design parameters, results show that for any scenario, an optimal value for both significant wave height tolerance and transit speed can be found. The optimal parameters for the scenario designed in this study are similar to the specifications of the Wind Turbine Shuttle. Overall, results show a definite advantage of using a turbine installation vessel such as the Wind Turbine Shuttle over traditional jack-up vessels. However, as the model is based on many assumptions, the accuracy of the results would be significantly improved with additional real life data. Regardless of this, the study has demonstrated the advantage of opting for a systems approach containing various models that are connected to each other. This methodology has many possible future applications, not only for the evaluation of wind turbine installation vessels but for any vessel type employed in the offshore construction segment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2030-02-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

The power generated by renewables is heavily subject to the intermittency of the source, e.g. the availability of wind or solar irradiance. Consequently, electrical grids that rely on renewable sources alternate between periods of excess power availability and periods with lack of power production. Excess power is often curtailed or exported, whereas the shortage of power production must be imported or produced through the deployment of more expensive production units. Power-to-X strategies aim to utilise the excess power from renewables more effectively, by converting power to another energy carrier within the grid, e.g. heat or hydrogen. By allowing the transition of power to another energy carrier, the system is transformed into a so-called multi-energy system. Therefore, the system takes into account the multiple energy carrier's system characteristics and loads in an integrated way. This formulation allows for optimal scheduling of energy flows in the system while taking into account characteristics of each energy carrier, e.g., storage characteristics, time-varying costs or production emissions. The main focus of this thesis to deal with the tasks of an energy management system for the aforementioned system using Model Predictive Control. The Model Predictive Control framework allows real-time optimal scheduling while incorporating data-driven forecasts of future loads and generation in the grid. Due to the stochastic nature of these forecasts, this thesis also looks into extensions of Model Predictive Control that can cope with uncertainties. Furthermore, to handle the different timescales of the grid dynamics, Model Predictive Control for multi-timescale systems is investigated. In particular, the performance of a Heuristic Model Predictive Control scheme and a Hierarchical Model Predictive Control scheme on the control of a simulated Power-to-X based energy system are compared. The simulation is based on a conceptual Power-to-X system based on historical data of the Dutch energy sector. Based on this case study, a statement is made about the suitability of the Power-to-X principles to future Dutch sustainable neighbourhoods.

A third heat treatment included fast cooling from top temperatures between 810°C and 950°C to the same bainite formation temperature of 400°C. The heat treated material has been studied by means of dilatometry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Vickers micro-hardness tests. All of the involved ferrite fractions had an accelerating effect on bainite formation, when compared to samples where no prior ferrite was present. The accelerating effect was larger for smaller prior ferrite fractions. It is proposed that the amount of preferential nucleation sites for bainite is increased by the formation of prior ferrite and leads to an acceleration of bainite formation. The presence of a significant amount of silicon (2 wt%) prevented the formation of cementite and resulted in carbon enrichment of austenite during ferrite formation. For the evaluated ferrite fractions, the accelerating effect due to ferrite presence is greater than the decelerating effect caused by the carbon enrichment of austenite, the latter becoming stronger with increasing ferrite fraction. Additionally, it is proposed that, due to the increase in preferential nucleation sites, a large amount of bainite sheaves start to grow simultaneously. Together with the autocatalytic nucleation of new bainite sub-units, this could account for the high bainite formation rates that were observed in the presence of ferrite. A change in bainite morphology from degenerated upper bainite to granular bainite with increasing prior ferrite fractions was also noticed. No significant difference in hardness was observed between the samples that contained prior ferrite, but the fully austenitised samples were slightly harder. It is expected that increasing ferrite fractions will result in a decrease in overall hardness, when macro-hardness tests would be applied.","Bainite; Kinetics; Ferrite; Intercritical Annealing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-18","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","For the design of coastal structures, the hydraulic loads that act on the coast should be known. These are often based on extrapolation of measurements. However, if the physical relation is unknown, large errors could be made. Therefore, a numerical model can be set up to take the most important processes into account.Yet, uncertainties are present in these numerical models as well. Taking for example the spectral wave model SWAN, it is hypothesised that the wave bottom refraction is not always properly modelled. Previous studies concluded that SWAN overestimates this refraction process near tidal channels, leading to an underestimation of waves entering the channel.This study uses the model SWAN in which different sensitivities are tested to assess the effect on refraction. The focus will be on the spatial and directional resolution as well as the wave propagation scheme that SWAN uses to discretise the propagation terms, which are the default SORDUP scheme and the optional BSBT scheme. From previous studies it is known that also physical processes could impact the bottom refraction, however these are only addressed shortly in this study. The aim of this study is to analyse the current performance of SWAN with respect to refraction and to assess how this performance can be improved.First, an analysis of a simple schematic channel case is made in SWAN, where waves propagate from shallow to deeper water. Physical source terms and wind wave-growth were deactivated in this part. It is found that a coarser spatial resolution can lead to a weaker wave refraction. This is caused by the way SWAN determines the turning rate, which is underestimated by SWAN compared to the theory of Snellius. On the other hand, an overestimation of wave refraction was observed for cases were waves should enter the channel. This is partly caused by the increased diffusion. These findings were taken into practice in a study of the Eastern Wadden Sea, specifically along the Ems channel, where waves propagated from deeper to shallower water. A coarser spatial resolution and the BSBT scheme showed less wave penetration from offshore into the Ems channel. The storm of January 2017 was simulated in SWAN after which a comparison was made to measurements. It was found that SWAN underestimated the wave energy for frequencies&lt;0.15Hz. However, this did not improve by refining the resolution in both spatial and directional domain or by applying a different propagation scheme. SWAN thus overestimates the wave refraction due to bottom gradients if waves propagate to shallower water. In case waves travel to deeper water, refraction can be underestimated. If all physical source terms are deactivated, the effects of resolution on refraction are clearly visible. Including the source terms diminishes this effect. Along the channel edges, effects of increased spatial resolution are notable giving a significant wave height of 12-14cm (6-9%) closer to the measured condition. However, the effects at the coast near Uithuizerwad are negligible.","Wave refraction; Spectral wave model; SWAN; Wadden Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Jet caused by transverse thrusters directly impinges quay walls, and can cause scour on the bed, therefore threatening structural stability of quay walls. Presence of vertical quay walls induces reflection of bowthruster's jet, further complicating the already complex flow field. Despite extensive research has been conduced on free flow, several knowledge gaps are still present regarding propeller induced flow when confined, for instance by a vertical quay wall. In this research, focus is on flow field on the bottom of a vertical quay wall induced by channel-type bowthrusters, which are commonly used for inland vessels. Field measurements have been conducted at the Antarcticakade, Ports of Rotterdam, using inland vessel MTS Vorstenbosch. The vessel is equipped with a 4-channel Veth Jet type bowthruster system. Use of a combination of Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers allowed measurements of flow velocities on the bottom of the quay. Data from the measurements has been analysed to investigate influence of distance between outlet and quay wall, and keel clearance, on the flow pattern at the bottom. Results have then been contextualized within the literature framework, and their impact on design of bottom protection according to most used guidelines has been assessed.<br/>The results of this field measurement showed mean flow velocities near the quay wall generally in the order of magnitude of 1 m/s, with the exception of one test, where mean flow velocities in the order of magnitude of 2 m/s were recorded. This relatively low mean flow velocities were often correlated with large turbulent fluctuations, leading to values of relative turbulence intensities higher than the ones found in literature, and sometimes even equal to 1. Comparison with the theoretical calculations of velocities according to Dutch and German methods suggested by PIANC, showed both methods to be conservative if compared with data from most tests. Furthermore, it appeared that both formulae’s sensitivity to wall and keel clearance was not reflected by the data. Similarly, results from this measurement showed that the flow generated by simultaneous use of two bowthrusters was characterized by velocities on the bed lower than expected according to the guidelines. Recommendation would be to use either linear superposition or to multiply by square root of n (where n is the number of used propellers) when considering the use of multiple propellers, but this was not reflected by most of the data. However, two of the tests taken into exam represented an exception to these general observations: ADV1, the instrument nearer to the quay wall, recorded velocities higher than the theoretical values for tests 12 (use of bowthruster 2 at high water) and 22 (use of both bowthrusters simultaneously at low water). Results from this study showed how the use of a 4-channel bowthruster system induced a flow on the bottom of a vertical quay wall which is mainly divided in two zones. Near the quay wall is where the highest velocities have been measured, and where the flow is strictly influenced by use of the bowthrusters. There is a return flow beneath the ship, which is dissipated in the space of few meters. Underneath the suction points of the bowthrusters, it is the inflow to determine the flow characteristics on the bed. In this research, the extent of the bowthruster-induced flow was found to be less than 14 m from the quay wall. The instrument hereby located, in fact, didn't record velocities which were affected by the use of bowthrusters. This research represents a step towards filling the knowledge gaps about use of bowthrusters at a vertical quay wall. The unique dataset collected can be used in the future for validating numerical or on-scale models, working for a better understanding of the phenomenon and a more accurate and optimized design of bed protections.","Bow Thruster; Field measurement; Quay walls; Propeller jet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The developed system takes in raw 2D LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) measurements as input and detects objects of interest by clustering them with the Adaptive Breakpoint Detector algorithm. The resulting clusters are fitted with oriented bounding boxes, by incorporating the Search-Based Rectangle Fitting algorithm. The tracking part of the system receives, extracted from the rectangles, L-shapes and associates them with already tracked vehicles, using the Global Nearest Neighbor algorithm. However, since LIDAR measures only the distance to surfaces that face the sensor, vehicle appearances change over time. In order to counteract tracking errors that originate from these changes, an L-shape switching algorithm is implemented. The kinematic poses of the tracked vehicles are estimated with two different tracking filters, a Kalman Filter (KF), with a constant velocity model and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), with a Coordinated Turn kinematic model. The dimensions of the detected vehicles are estimated with a constant shape Kalman Filter. The proposed system was evaluated using both simulation and real-world experiments. The real-world experiments were made on the Delft Scaled Vehicle (DSV), an experimental car platform in the form of a 1/10 scale radio controlled car, and the ground truth data were provided by a Motion Capture (MoCap) system. The simulation experiments were made in a highway environment, which was created specifically for the development and testing of this system. Evaluating the experiment results reveals that the developed system can reliably estimate the position, speed, heading angle and dimensions of surrounding vehicles and therefore it can be used in similar research platforms to expand their environment perception capabilities.","DATMO; LIDAR; ROS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In this project a prototype of such a register was built. The register is required to be designed in such a way that it is expandable and secure. From these characteristics, the conclusion was drawn that a permissioned blockchain network was the most suitable option for storing mandates in a decentralised and immutable fashion. The most fitting consensus algorithm for the blockchain network was determined to be the Raft algorithm. For implementation of the blockchain network, a widely-documented and advanced framework called Hyperledger Fabric was used, which was be configured to use Raft. A network in Hyperledger Fabric is a set of organisations of which subsets can form channels together. Each organisation consists of multiple peer nodes, each with a corresponding ledger, database and smart contracts. The mandate register network consists of two channels, the first containing seven organisations, with two peer nodes per organisation. Apart from these seven organisations, the network contains seven orderers, which work in the second channel and which are responsible for managing transactions made by an application. On top of the network, an application was built that connects to the network and functions as a simple web server. The web server allows consumers to submit their mandates as input to the network and query mandates from the network. Performance evaluation of the network shows that it requires much optimisation before being ready for deployment in the real world. Apart from optimisation, there are various tasks related to security, authentication, deployment, and the GDPR which have to be completed before the register can be used in production.","blockchain; mandate register; energy; Hyperledger Fabric","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The applied models are the regression models, the survival model, and the decision tree classifier. As a result, according to the test data of A15 in the Netherlands from 2015 to 2018, all the models indicate that the traffic characteristics influenced road performance, particularly, the traffic flow could worsen the pavement condition which already performed badly.

Decoupling of the clustering camera from the rendering camera gives way to two alternative ways of constructing the clustering: orthographic clustering and displaced perspective clustering. Orthographic clustering uses a uniform world-space grid and has been traditionally dismissed.

The design of these structures is generally done in a static way, thus without consideration of time-dependent phenomena. By treating the contact force during a brush collision as a static force, several phenomena are overlooked. First of all, it is possible that, in case of a brush collision, a second impact occurs due to the yawing motion of the vessel that is generated during the first impact. Considering the time domain in the analysis of brush collisions also enables the investigation of the length that is required for a guide work to fulfill its function. Within this thesis the time aspect is considered for brush collisions between inland navigation vessels and guide works with steel hollow tubular cross-sections.Objective of this research is to quantify the second impact and to provide a recommendation for the length of guide works, in order to answer the question: “In what ways is the design of guide works affected by taking into account the time domain?. A parametric tool that simulates brush collisions is created in Python. By variation of one parameter at a time, the influence of this parameter on the magnitude of the second impact and the required length for a guide work is visualised. <br/>Eventually, the model created in Python is translated to SCIA Engineer. By using the automatic post-processing environment of the Finite Element Software, this translation can be used to speed up the design guide works in future projects. On top of that, the influence of torsion on the mechanical behaviour of the structure is taken into account. For the investigated parameters a second impact always occurs within the 90 seconds of performed analysis, except for vessels with a large mass or length, or a small initial velocity. On top of that, the contact force during the second impact generally appears to be 30 to 40 percent larger than the first impact, while guide works are commonly designed for the first impact. Only for initial contact angles larger than 13 degrees or vessels with draught of more than 7 meters, the first impact is governing. The required length of a guide work to facilitate a brush collision itself is very well obtainable by using the created model. Nonetheless, due to the spread of the location of the first contact, a large uncertainty still remains in determining the total length of a guide work. For the translation to SCIA Engineer it holds that it is possible translate the Python model into a model involving SCIA Engineer. The long computation time of this translation, however, make this tool rather impractical.<br","Guide work; Collision; Vessels; Time domain; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

It is predicted that this will lead to a substantial increase in the amount of microgrids deployed worldwide. Especially in locationswith a less reliable grid, the microgrids are often in off-grid or islanded operation. If an electrical fault occurs when the microgrid is not connected to the grid and there are only inverter-based power sources, the fault current will not be high enough to be detected by traditional overcurrent protection schemes.This poses a challenge that can be addressed with different strategies. So far, the proposed solutions for protecting microgrids in islanded operation are highly theoretical and have limitations.This research introduces a protection strategy for a small, low voltage off-grid microgrid with only inverter-based power sources. The microgrid has energy storage, solar energy production and generic loads. In this study, a Tesla Powerpack and Inverter are assumed as energy storage devices, since the research is conducted in collaboration with the company Tesla. The microgrid is modelled in the software PowerFactory from DIgSILENT to verify that the current and voltage magnitudes during fault will be detected properly and the protection devices will be triggered. Protection devices available in the market are proposed, and their settings specified taking into account the results of several simulations.

They are also unstable, which is why they require an active control system. Current hydrofoil ships are more limited in their operation by waves. A passive suspension system could reduce the motions of a hydrofoil ship in waves but it must remain controllable. This becomes more difficult when the ship is sailing in waves because the wave orbital velocities affect the lift of the wings. In this thesis, a state-space model is developed that predicts the stability and the motions in waves of a hydrofoil ship with a suspension system between the hull and the wings. A foiling ship experiences forces of different origins. To segment the model development, three levels of equations are created; physical level, component level and system level. The physical level consists of expressions that describe the forces like the lift, drag or added mass. All forces acting on a component are then combined into the component level equations. The effects of all components are then combined to find the system dynamics. The model development is split into two parts. The first part is the development of a fixed-wing model. The predictions of this model are compared to experiments of the Demonstrator of MARIN. The Demonstrator is a 3.5m long model and has a mass of 150kg. A subset of these tests is used to compare to the predictions of the developed model. The motions are predicted well for the lowest wave frequency, but the motions for higher frequency waves are not predicted sufficiently accurate. The suspected cause for the inaccuracies is a lag in the control signal in the experiments, which plays a greater role in the higher frequencies. It is recommended to implement this delay effect into the model to improve the range of frequencies the model can be validated for. The model is also compared to higher wave amplitudes for the lowest wave frequency. The predictions of the model for the higher wave amplitudes match the measurements from the experiment reasonably well. The state-space model is then extended to allow for a suspension at the forward wing, aft wing or both wings. No experiments were available to compare to the model predictions, which means the model is only verified. The verification is done by making the increasing the stiffness to sufficiently high values, that the fixed-wing limit is reached. In the analysis of the results, it was found that the suspension system can reduce the motions of the ship, but only in very specific circumstances. In all other circumstances, the motions are either larger than the fixed-wing model or the system becomes unstable. It is therefore recommended for future research to try rotational springs.","state-space models; Hydrofoils; Hydrofoil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental understanding of how these dynamical structures change due to presence of a low-thrust force may lead to trajectories that cannot be obtained otherwise. This paper investigates the effect of a constant low-thrust acceleration on the horizontal Lyapunov (H-L) families in the CR3BP. Families of low-thrust periodic solutions are constructed in vicinity of L1 and L2 using numerical continuation methods. By either varying the Hamiltonian, acceleration magnitude, or acceleration orientation along the solution family, the effect of a low-thrust acceleration on H-L orbits is characterized. Investigating the geometry, bifurcations and hyperbolic unwinding behavior of these families provides insight into the low-thrust periodic solution structure of the Earth-Moon system. The introduction of a constant low-thrust acceleration distorts the geometry of ballistic H-L orbits into ’ear-shaped’ periodic solutions. The bifurcations of the low-thrust periodic solution families imply the existence of low-thrust halo, low-thrust axial, and low-thrust planar double-period families. Finally, low-thrust periodic solutions are identified that possess a higher rate of hyperbolic unwinding behavior than the ballistic L1 and L2 H-L families.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-14","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, due to the complexity of the equations that model these processes, the computational time and power required to run them can be large, compared to models that consider simplified equations. By contrast, simplified hydraulic models lack physical background, what leads to a minor accuracy in the surge estimations with respect to hydrodynamic models. In this project, a stochastic model has been developed with the objective to estimate surge at the coast of Mississippi (United States) at a reasonable accuracy and time, without solving equations that represent complex physical processes. The stochastic model needs to be trained by means of hurricane data, including surge levels. This information must be generated beforehand, by simulating a limited number of hurricanes with an hydrodynamic model. In this project, the hydrodynamic model Delft3D Flexible Mesh has been used for this purpose. The approach followed to build the stochastic model has been based on three main steps. The first step has been setting up and validating the hydrodynamic model in Delft3D FM. Hurricane Katrina (2005) has been simulated to calibrate the input parameters of the model, by comparing the maximum simulated water levels at 41 stations along the shoreline of Mississippi to the high water marks observed at the same locations during the event. Tide, surge and wave setup have been considered in the validation. The results of the validation show a line best fit slope from the origin of 0.912 and an R-squared of 0.996. At Gulfport, the absolute error of the surge estimation is 19 centimeters, equivalent to a relative error of 2.5%. The second step in the construction of the stochastic model has been the generation of a historical hurricane data base. The hurricane best tracks have been retrieved from the HURDAT2 data base. The variables considered have been the forward speed and the forward direction of the hurricane at landfall, the wind speed at landfall, the distance from landfall location to a reference point (Galveston Bay) and the maximum storm surge during the hurricane. In this case, only the hurricane forcing is considered as external action. The storm surge has been recorded at Gulfport Harbour (central coast of Mississippi). The values of the surge have been obtained by using the validated model to simulate the historical hurricanes making landfall in a rectangular domain of 600 kilometers, being Gulfport Harbour the center of the rectangle. Due to the scarce number of hurricanes making landfall in this region, the tracks of the hurricanes making landfall in the North of the Gulf of Mexico but outside the rectangular domain have been shifted inside the domain, in order to generate a sufficiently large data base to train the stochastic model. A data base with 140 hurricanes has been built, from which the 85% (119 hurricanes) have been used for the training of the stochastic model and the other 15% (21 hurricanes) have been used for the validation of the stochastic model. The third and last step has been the setup and validation of the stochastic model, by comparing the storm surge obtained from the stochastic model to the surge obtained from the hydrodynamic simulations. The stochastic model used to estimate storm surge has been a Bayesian Network that assumes normal copulas to represent the joint distribution between nodes of the network. The calculated slope of the best fit line for the mean surge values has been 0.861, with an R-squared of 0.885. Moreover, the average standard deviation of the estimations is 1.16 meters. These results indicate a reasonable estimation of the surge by means of the Bayesian Network. This estimation can be made in the order of seconds.","Hurricanes; Surge; Delft 3D; Modelling; Bayesian Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

It allows us to design controllers that are otherwise cumbersome to design with conventional control methodologies. Often, an objective for RL is binary in nature. However, exploring in environments with sparse rewards is a problem in RL, and finding positive reward becomes exponentially more difficult with increased environment complexity. For this project, our objective is to design an RL based controller for the landing of a quadcopter on inclined surfaces. Landing is defined as reaching these inclined surfaces with reasonable speed, such that no damage is done to either the quadcopter or the surface to land on upon impact. We aim to use a binary reward for this task. We use methods to aid exploration in sparse reward environments, namely Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), and non-optimized demonstrations. HER can resample goals from the demonstrator data and the policy rollouts. The resampling of goals is done by considering a portion of the visited states during policy rollouts as the intended goals. The demonstrations are non-optimized in the sense that the demonstrations do not follow the same objective as ours. We consider demonstrations valid if these demonstrations are obtained from arbitrary stable policies. Our results show that the RL system does generalize to other goals when using HER and demonstrations. The demonstrations are not imitated as were to happen in pure imitation learning. HER, on the other hand, enabled us to receive reward in our complex environment, while also allowing us to experience multiple goals in one policy rollout. We found that lack of HER and demonstrations were not able to overcome the problems of exploration in sparse reward environments. We found that landing a quadcopter on inclined surfaces using an RL controller is feasible. Our trajectories clearly showed a swinging motion which in theory should be a valid control strategy for this problem. This swinging motion results in dead spots with the quadcopter being in a state with a minimal translational and rotational velocities under a relatively large angle. Further research is needed to increase the accuracy and robustness of our RL based controller.","Reinforcement Learning (RL); Autonomous Control; Quadcopter; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The bottom of the two thin film silicon layers is made of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H). The current problem with this technology is that the adhesion of the nc-Si:H to a flat surface of crystalline silicon is not always ideal. This can be improved by texturing the monocrystalline silicon. This also improves the optical efficiency. The standard pyramidal texture method of crystalline silicon has proven to be too sharp which leads to cracks in the layer of nc-Si:H during deposition. The two investigated texturing methods are a periodic hexagonal texture with semispherical walls created using photolithography and a random texture of craters using a sacrificial layer of polycrystalline silicon. For the hexagonal texture, a photolithography process was designed and tested on the ability to grow crack-free nc-Si:H. It was found that a texture period of 3 µm was most suited for the desired nc-Si:H layer thickness of 3-3.5 µm. For the sacrificial layer process, the effect of the different parameters on the crater size was investigated. These tests showed that an amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer thickness of 1-2 µm gives the largest craters. The ideal implantation energy is dependent on both the implanted ion and the a-Si layer thickness. It was also found that the crater size increases with increasing dopant concentration. An anneal temperature of 950 °C for 60 minutes was determined to result in the largest craters. Furthermore, argon implantation using an energy of 250 keV in 1 or 2 µm of a-Si showed the biggest promise in terms of crater size, with an average hole diameter of around 320 nm. In terms of optical performance, the hexagonal texture results in a slightly lower mean reflectance over a wavelength range of 300 to 1200 nm. The angular distribution of the reflectance showed that the reflectance of the hexagonal texture was very dependent on the measured angle and this angular dependence varies for different wavelengths. This indicates good light scattering of this texture. The results for the large craters show light scattering at approximately the same level as the photolithography samples, but more gradual over different angles. The best hexagonal and sacrificial layer textures were used to create SHJ's. Unfortunately, the minority charge carrier lifetime measurements of these SHJ's showed that the deposited passivation layers were likely to be too thin, which resulted in very low lifetimes. Consequently, the efficiency of the sacrificial layer SHJ's was only 0.1%. The efficiency of the hexagonal texture SHJ's were much higher, at 10.0%. Still, this efficiency was lower than anticipated. The reflectance measurements of these solar cells showed that the average reflectance of the SHJ's using the photolithography texture was 13.4% with TCO. This is lower than the reflectance of the sacrificial layer SHJ, which was at 14.4% with TCO.","Texture; Crystalline Silicon; multi-junction Device; Solar Cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Wave types that are referred to as long waves are infragravity waves, meteo-tsunami’s, seiches and tides. Besides their extensive length, they distinguish themselves from regular sea-swell waves by the mechanisms responsible for their generation and the scale of their impact. Whereas short waves are generated by wind, long waves are generated by short wave-group forcing, the breaking of short waves nearshore and large atmospheric pressure variations. Long waves play a crucial role in the processes of coastline erosion and the breaching of flood defenses, as well as in the formation of rip currents and seiches. These events can lead to severe damage to hydraulic structures and possibly even casualties. A better understanding of them is thus vital for coastal safety.<br/>Rijkswaterstaat has been collecting data regarding the occurrence of long waves on the North Sea for over a decade. Their measurement campaign started in a time when digital broadcasting signals and digital storage space were not well developed yet, making sending and storing the water surface elevation time-series not feasible. The data is therefore filtered by a FIR filter, reducing the size of the data, but also reducing the information that is contained in the data. All frequencies of approximately 0,0125 퐻푧 and higher are removed by the FIR filter. As a consequence a significant part of the infragravity signal is missing and it is not possible to perform a bispectral analysis (used to determine the bound long wave contribution). Nowadays, digital broadcasting signals and digital storage space have plenty of capacity to send and store the data, making the filter unnecessary.<br/>Analysis of the spatial- and temporal distribution of long waves in the North Sea, shows that the majority of long waves have a yearly averaged significant wave height of 2,4 - 3,3 cm and a yearly averaged mean wave period of 125 to 140 cm. Based on data from the full decade, a clear trend in the spatial distribution of long waves cannot be distinguished, offshore and nearshore locations show approximately the same long wave properties. The seasonal analysis shows that the mean significant long wave height averaged out over all locations per season varies from 2,8 cm during summer, 2,9 cm during spring, 3,3 cm during winter to 3,5 cm during fall. For the mean wave period, the mean value averaged out over all locations per season varies from 127,5 s during summer, 128,1 s during spring, 135,6 s during winter to 136,3 s during fall. Predictions of the extreme wave conditions show that the significant wave height with a return period of 10.000 years (Dutch design condition for coastal flood defenses) are around 40-60 cm, although there is quite some uncertainty in these predictions. This uncertainty is due to a relatively short measurement period, usually 30 years of data is used for extreme wave predictions, and remarkable observations in the data.<br/>Time-series analysis of the hourly significant wave height of long waves and predicted bound long waves (Hasselmann, 1962) (Hasselmann, 1963) shows that during mild weather conditions significant wave heights of long waves are low, with minimal contributions by the bound long waves. At the onset of a storm, the significant wave height of both long waves and bound long waves rapidly increase. At the end of the storm, they decrease to the pre-storm values. This shows that the generation of long waves occurs mainly during heavy weather conditions. Hourly significant wave heights of long waves, and especially bound long waves, show a strong correlation with significant short wave heights. The relative contribution of bound long waves (퐸푏푙푤/퐸푙푤) during a storm increases up to values of 60%, which is considerably higher than contributions of bound long waves found in other studies (Herbers et al., 1994). The high ratio of the relative bound long wave contribution, in combination with very low bound long wave activity during mild conditions, shows that the generation mechanism involving wave-group forcing is a major generation mechanism of long waves in the North Sea.","long waves; wave-group forcing; north sea; infragravity waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But on other types of surfaces, such as soft and deformable substrates, the performance of these micro patterned adhesives diminishes. Alternative methods have to be investigated to create adhesives that optimize the ability to form and preserve contact on these types of substrates. In this study, 3D printing is used to produce a series of adhesives with internal cylindrical porous structures of various geometry. The internal structure modulates the adhesives stiffness in the normal and shearing direction, designed to affect the friction force. Friction forces are measured on glass, soft elastomeric substrates and cloth. On glass, the highest friction forces are generated by the adhesive with the lowest normal stiffness, unaffected by their shear stiffness. On soft substrates, the highest friction forces are achieved with adhesives that combine a low normal stiffness, promoting contact formation, with a high sear stiffness, enhancing contact preservation. The effect of this anisotropic stiffness becomes more pronounced when the stiffness of the substrate decreases, contributing to contact formation. On cloth, generation of friction forces remains challenging, more research is required to create adhesives that excel on these kinds of substrates.","3D Printing; Bio-inspired; Adhesion; Soft substrate; Friction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

As opposed to the conventional MRI scan, the low-field MRI prototype uses permanent magnets to create a magnetic field in the order of Milliteslas (mT). A downside of the low-field MRI application is the difficulty with spatial encoding due to small variations in the strength of magnetic field. This is a major problem for image reconstruction. The purpose of this research was to implement a deep learning (DL) network to overcome two of the major bottlenecks in image reconstruction for low-field MRI. These are the lack of real measured data for DL purposes, and the signal model associated with the low-field MRI. For DL purposes we generated synthetic data and acquired measured data. Each dataset consists of samples and each sample consist of an image and the corresponding signal. Due to technical limitations the measured dataset is small, 53 samples. To partially circumvent the problem, the data set was augmented to a total of 1908 samples. In addition, we used Transfer learning, which is a powerful method that applies knowledge gained from one problem to a different but related problem. We present three image reconstruction techniques, Model I, II, and III, based on convolutional and feedforward neural networks, which take MR signal data as input and directly and quickly outputs an image. We demonstrated that DL generates high quality images using synthetic data. In addition, we showed that Model III needs less training to reconstructs good quality images compared to Models I and III, respectively. Finally, Models I and III were unsuccessfully applied to real measured data. However, this study shows that neural networks are able to find a mapping between signal and image, therefore this idea can be extended to work on real measured data.","Deep Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

It is assumed that the composite slab consists out of a consecutive range of concrete ribs in its width direction, which are solely responsible for resisting the transverse shear force. To calculate the transverse shear capacity of these concrete ribs, an empirical formula is used that was originally derived for regular reinforced concrete beams (without stirrups). However, the concrete ribs of the composite slab are created by the profile of the steel deck, making that each concrete rib is accompanied by two steel webs on the sides. According to the Eurocode 3 (steel structures), these webs of the steel deck have their own transverse shear capacity, which is neglected by the current design approach defined in the Eurocode 4. Besides, the interaction between the steel deck and the concrete may lead to an even higher transverse shear capacity of the composite slab. In this thesis, the aforementioned two aspects, which are currently overlooked by the design principle of the Eurocode 4, are further studied by means of non-linear finite element modelling. <br/> <br/>The validation of this empirical formula of the Eurocode 2 for calculating the transverse shear capacity of the concrete ribs is the first point of interest. From the finite element analysis (FEA) of the concrete section of ComFlor 210, it is concluded that the prediction of the transverse shear capacity by the Eurocode 2 is unnecessarily conservative. The study suggests to use the mean width of the concrete rib (b0) in calculation, instead of the minimum width in the tensile area of the concrete rib (bw), as an improvement to the method of the Eurocode 2. <br/> <br/>In the next stage, the contribution of the steel deck to the transverse shear capacity of the composite slab is studied. The exact bonding properties between the steel deck and the concrete (at the interface) were not clear when the finite element model was developed, so some assumptions had to be made. When assuming that the steel deck can’t separate from the concrete and the relative slip is restrained in longitudinal direction by the embossments, an increase of 131.6% in transverse shear capacity is found. Because of the assumed interface properties, the steel deck contributes to the total transverse shear capacity in the following ways: it resists a part of the transverse shear force in its webs; it acts as reinforcement to the concrete like a longitudinal rebar; it acts as reinforcement to the concrete like stirrups. However, whether this stirrup-functioning of the steel deck’s webs is representative for the actual transverse shear behaviour of deep composite slabs is being questioned, because it relies on the assumption of no separation at the interface. Therefore, a second FEA of ComFlor 210 is executed in which the interaction between the steel deck and the concrete is neglectable. Still, an increase of 51.4% in transverse shear capacity is found, which can be considered as a lower bound value. <br/> <br/>At last, from the FEA results of this thesis, it can indeed be concluded that the current Eurocode 4 provides a unnecessarily conservative calculation method for the transverse shear capacity of ComFlor 210. However, using a simple engineering model that adds up the partial resistances of the concrete ribs and the steel deck’s webs, gives a better prediction while still being safe. For the partial resistance of the concrete ribs, the empirical formula of the Eurocode 2 is used, but this parameter bw is substituted by b0 as already mentioned in the foregoing. For the partial resistance of the steel deck’s webs, the procedures of the Eurocode 3 are followed.","transverse shear capacity; vertical shear capacity; shear capacity; deep composite slab; composite slab; composite floor; ComFlor 210; Finite Element Analysis; shear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This projects aims to investigate both, with a new service model and service roadmap as a result. A service roadmap can be seen as a future timeline for the service model and its supporting elements. The project tried to answer the following research question: ‘How can service roadmapping enable an integrated service delivery using digital healthcare innovations?’ Orthopedic care was used as a case study for this research, based on 41 concept demonstrators aimed at improving the orthopedic care journey. To answer the research question, a concept demonstrator analysis was performed, focusing on function, user and technology. This analysis showed that most concept demonstrators contained a service model focusing on achieving patient self-management, by obtaining insight, in the form of an app-wearable combination. The user analysis showed that the patient, General Practitioner, Orthopedic surgeon and the Physiotherapist should be the multi user group. And finally, the technology analysis showed a need for technological enhancements in the concept demonstrator setup. Next to the concept research, research on the Orthopedic care context was performed, with special interest in treating hip Osteoarthritis.

Furthermore, a need for enhanced personalisation, information and communication was found, with the preservation of the ‘human’ aspect. Based on this research as a whole, a selection of 13 concept features from the concept demonstrators was done. These form the basis of the service model. It consists of an patient app, on body wearable and a plugin for health professionals, making it a multi user service. The service model will focus on providing information and feedback to all users in a personalised manner, about the patient status within the Osteoarthritis treatment. Furthermore, it allows for digital communication to occur. Future adjustments are primarily focused on improving the back end of the service, by adopting shared learning with help of Artificial Intelligence. Ultimately, patient and health professional become partners in the Osteoarthritis treatment. To summarize both the drivers for innovation, the service model setup and the back-end enablers in the context of time, a service roadmap was developed. This roadmap can be used by the Smart Care Lab of the TU Delft to start further dialogue with stakeholders in orthopedic care, as well as a starting point for new research projects.","Roadmapping; Service roadmapping; Healthcare; Service model; Research by design; Orthopedic care; osteoarthritis; Service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Therefore, the noise sources should be known. This thesis assesses a new acoustic imaging method to identify sources on aircraft fly-over measurements. The proposed Global Optimisation (GO) algorithm is based on the theory behind Conventional Beamforming, but can identify sources in 3-dimensions and potentially overcomes the spatial resolution limit. This imaging method was applied to simulations, an anechoic room set-up, and two fly-over measurements (landing and take-off) performed with a 64-microphone array. The simulations and anechoic room test showed that GO can overcome the spatial resolution limit, but has difficulty finding the correct distance between the array and the source. The fly-over cases showed that the aircraft height was not found by GO. For the landing case, the engines and landing gear were found as sources. For the take-off case, GO did not find sources at low frequencies. The method is promising, but to increase the performance on fly-over measurements, it is advised to use the knowledge of the aircraft geometry when applying the GO algorithm.","Beamforming; Acoustic imaging; Microphone array; Aircraft Noise; Global Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Biodynamic feedthrough (BDFT) has shown to be a key obstacle in continuous touchscreen dragging tasks under simulated turbulence, disrupting task performance. This research therefore focuses on the implementation of a model-based approach to mitigate the adverse effects of BDFT. A human-in-the-loop experiment with 18 participants was performed. The experiment consisted of two simulator sessions, the first with the goal of collecting data used for identifying two BDFT models: a subject-average (SA) and a one-size-fits-all (OSFA) model. In the second session these two models were tested for their ability to cancel BDFT in the same two-dimensional pursuit task they were identified from, and in an additional point-to-point dragging task emulating a waypoint modification. The model-based BDFT cancellation approach was tested for two combinations of motion disturbance axis and touchscreen input direction: sway (side-to-side motion) with horizontal screen inputs and heave (up-down motion) with vertical screen inputs. The results showed it is possible to cancel between 80-90% of the BDFT in both cases despite poor cancellation for certain specific participants. The point-to-point dragging task showed much less BDFT than the continuous task used for BDFT model development, however, making the cancellation ineffective. Overall, the results show that while model-based BDFT cancellation is possible, it is crucial to account for individual variability and the specific touchscreen task.","touch-based; touchscreen; turbulence; biodynamic feedthrough; BDFT; flight deck design; flight deck; Human-machine interaction; manual control; display; cockpit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Conventional polymer, e.g., hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, dissolved in brine at high-salinity and high-temperature can be subjected to thermal degradation due to hydrolysis of amide group to acid which can result in precipitation driven by the interaction between acid groups and divalent ions, so these processes lead to loss in viscosifying power of drive fluid, thereby hindering polymer efficiency. To overcome these challenges associated with polymers at harsh conditions, a new hybrid dispersion consists of silica nanoparticles and hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide was proposed. This study aims to investigate the adsorptive and transport behaviour for this novel combination using rheological measurement and core flood experiments. Two-phase experiments were conducted to reveal the potential ability of the dispersion in increasing oil recovery compared to water flooding. Three different systems are used in this study, first, polymer solution at a concentration of 500 mg/L, second, nanofluids containing only SiO2 particles with a concentration of 5,000 mg/L and the third system is the dispersion of silica nanoparticles at 5,000 mg/L and PAM-98 at 500 mg/L. Rheological tests and single-phase experiment results showed that introducing silica nanoparticles to polymer solution led to the bulk viscosity enhancement and improvement in the adsorptive and transport behaviour of nanofluid. However, two-phase experimental results showed no increase in incremental oil recovery at the given study conditions, since water flooding was highly efficient.","Enhanced oil recovery; Polymer flooding; Nanoparticles; Hydrophobically modified polymer; Adsorption, Injectivity; core flood experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-28","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In this context maintenance plays a major role and monitoring of such structures represents a first important step in combating disasters. Over the last years low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) equipment has faced rapid and important development opening a new door to reliable and high accurate positioning applications such as structural health monitoring. This study presents a methodology for gathering, processing and analysing 1 Hz dual frequency GNSS data acquired by a network of newly released low-cost dual frequency GNSS receivers installed on a 90 metres tall steel-concrete structure in order to sense possible wind-induced displacements. At the same time, it represents one of the first studies testing the positioning capabilities of low-cost dual frequency GNSS equipment for monitoring large-scale building infrastructure. The main tools exploited in this study are PPK relative positioning together with a multipath correction procedure based on GPS satellite constellation repeatability. In addition to these, several corrections are discussed and applied on the position estimates in order to achieve millimetre position accuracy, highly needed for sensing wind-induced displacements of large-scale structures. By artificially inducing some horizontal deformations it was found that the newly released low-cost dual frequency GNSS receiver can track centimetre order permanent deformations of tall buildings. In the context of not being able to identify strong statistical correlation between possible wind-induced deformations of the case study building and and wind data patterns, the study proves that wind-induced deflections of tall structures might be traceable only if they are larger than the magnitude of the carrier phase multipath effect that is “leaking” in the position estimates.","Low-cost GNSS; Structural Health Monitoring; Multipath; Wind-induced Deformations; Sidereal Day Repeatability; Satellite Geometry","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","51.999059, 4.373468"

However, due to new manufacturing techniques and the use of composite material systems more complex structures can be made. By combining a cylindrical shell and a conical shell one structural component can be created: a cylindrical-conical shell. This is a potential design solution for launch vehicle structures, but there is limited research available about it. Not much is known about the buckling behavior or imperfection sensitivity of these structures, especially not for sandwich composite shells. The objective of this research is to understand these two phenomena in cylindrical-conical structures, considering a sandwich composite. The buckling behavior is studied by using finite element analysis and the behavior of the individual shells are compared to the combined structure. Different shell geometries such as height of the cone, angle of the cone, and radius of curvature at the transition are considered. The imperfection sensitivity of the different shells is investigated by adding axisymmetric and eigenmode imperfections using different amplitudes. The results indicate that the buckling behavior of the individual components without initial imperfections can be captured by the linear eigenvalue analysis as well as by a postbuckling analysis using a dynamic implicit solver with non-linear geometry enabled. In case of the cylindrical-conical shell, the linear eigenvalue analysis is not able to capture the buckling shape and results in an overpredicted buckling load. This can be explained by the non-linear behavior at the transition area before buckling that can be observed in the dynamic implicit analysis. This non-linear behavior before buckling is mitigated when a reinforcement or radius of curvature is added to the cylinder to cone transition region. A similar sensitivity to geometrical imperfections is observed for the cylindrical shell and conical shell. The cylindrical-conical shell has a much lower sensitivity, because the non-linear behavior at the transition region is dominating the buckling behavior of the whole structure. The results obtained from the thesis show the importance of the non-linear behavior at the transition for the sandwich composite cylindrical-conical shell. This means that for further research it is important that the non-linear effects are included when analysing such a structure.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The deterministic model that is used to do this is based on the linear wave theory. The radar is looking horizontally straight towards the waves in 5 separate beam directions of -40,-20,0, 20 and 40 degrees. Using the FMCW principle the backscatterd signal is converted into velocity and spatial range information. After some compensations (current for example) this velocity data can be treated as horizontal component of the orbital velocity of the wave. By using a least-squares solving approach (the trust-region reflective algorithm) on these orbital velocities and the expression that holds for them in the linear wave theory the model can be fitted to the measurements. The result of the least squares solver consists of a set of parameters for wave amplitude, phase and frequency. With these parameters the deterministic motion of the sea surface can be computed. This method is tested using artificial data and a generalized one directional case (using information from 1 beam under assumption of infinitely long-crested waves). For the experiments with artificial data consisting of waves with Hs = 2 meters (significant waveheight) the results are promising. A prediction time of 30 seconds over a range of 150 meters with an average error of 15 cm in the one directional model (fitted on 10 second data over 384 meters) can be achieved. For the multi directional model this lies between 20 and 30 seconds with an average error of 25 cm, depending on the spreading of the waves. Experiments with real data show less impressive results, an accurate reconstruction of the surface can be given, but the predictive capability is very limited.","FMCW radars; Sea Modelling; Inverse Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Although there are wrists available, primarily featuring 1 degree of freedom (DoF), only a few prototype 3 DoF wrists are currently known. These 3 DoF wrists usually have sufficient range of motion (RoM), but they fail in delivering high torques while being lightweight and compact, which can increase chances of rejecting the prosthesis. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate a conceptual 3 DoF wrist that is capable of replicating the RoM of the human wrist while keeping the size and mass as low as possible. Furthermore, the wrist needs to be able to deliver more torque than existing 3 DoF wrists. Results: A functional 3 DoF prototype was created. The design is actively controllable using three motors and pumps but can also adapt to different surroundings if the motors are off. The prototype is capable of a total range of motion of 142° for exion/extension and 90° for ulnar/radial deviation and can provide estimated torques of 4.52 Nm and 7.29 Nm respectively. Pro-/supination was not measured, but can provide a theoretical RoM of 134° and torque of 8.9 Nm. The complete wrist has a length of 150 mm and a diameter of 50 mm at the thickest part, and a mass of 166 g (including fluid). Conclusion: A 3 DoF wrist that is theoretically able to provide more torques than previously researched wrists is successfully designed and tested. The available RoM approaches the required RoM, except for pro-/supination. Future research should primarily focus on measuring the front part of the wrist using higher pressure. The 3D printed pro-/supination part of the wrist should be further researched to improve RoM and remove leakage while pressurized.","Hydraulic; Wrist prosthesis; Prosthesis; 3 DoF; 3 degrees of freedom","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-11","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A proper design value of these parameters is required during the design process, based on the corresponding safety philosophy and the lifetime of the structure. In this context, an extreme event is characterised by a combination of unfavourable parameters. However, the interdependencies between the parameters are not always accounted for in the design process, despite the fact that some parameters are clearly related. This potentially leads to an overly conservative or optimistic design.<br/><br/>To complicate matters further, a given sea state might consist of a combination of wind wave and swell systems, sometimes coming from different directions and with different spectral shapes. Different combinations of crossing wave systems might lead to the same total significant wave height, mean wave period and mean wave direction. Only analysing the total wave parameters might oversimplify the situation in the presence of combined wave systems. In this thesis a methodology has been developed to establish extreme offshore wave conditions given the presence of these combined wave systems.<br/><br/>A time series that partitions the total wave into a wind wave- and swell component is used as input for the analysis. The location of interest being off the coast of southern Brazil, where combined sea states are observed regularly. The main objective is to compute design values for all wave parameters of interest. With these design values a number of extreme offshore sea states are described in terms of a single total wave system and equivalent combinations of two wave systems. The former resulting in a single-peaked wave spectrum and the latter in an equivalent double-peaked wave spectrum. The extreme offshore sea states are transformed to the nearshore and compared. The single-peaked and equivalent double-peaked wave spectra may result in very similar values for the wave energy nearshore, albeit with different spectral shapes and directions. For the investigated directional combination, this means that the more elaborate approach with two wave systems potentially affects the design of coastal infrastructure if it is sensitive to spectral shape and direction, although the uncertainty of the result is not quantified. Equivalent wave systems could be compared for other directional combinations in future research to investigate if the more elaborate approach results in a more cost-effective design of coastal infrastructure. <br/><br/>The quality of the multivariate vine copula model, used to compute the set of design values for the wave parameters of interest, is assessed in multiple ways. It is recommended not to pick a single set of design values at a point of high joint probability density. Instead it is suggested to use conditionalised samples from the vine copula model to determine the most unfavourable combination of load parameters, which has to be evaluated case-by-case.","Extreme value analysis; Multivariate analysis; Bivariate analysis; ERA5 data set; Vine copulas; swan modelling; Copulas; statistical analysis; Dependance modelling; Combined wave systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The main objective of this research is to investigate the possibilities to use the alternative design approach for modelling soil behavior in the design processes of a quay wall. For this, three case studies have been elaborated. The three case studies represents soil profiles consisting 1) predominantly sandy soils, 2) normally consolidated clay and 3) overconsolidated clay. The differences between the analyses and outcomes of the conventional approach and the new approach have been compared for each case study. Based on the quantitative results of case study 1 and 3, the difference in outcome between the conventional and alternative design approaches is between 0 and 10% for both displacements and sectional forces. The outcome of case study 2 is not in line with the results of case 1 and 3. Based on the results of the first case study with sandy soil profile, the alternative design approach applied in this report is not a valid option for the design of a quay wall due to the absence of undrained soil conditions. <br/>For a soil profile consisting clay, the magnitude of preconsolidation of the soil plays an important role. For the alternative design approach, increasing values of pre-loading results in decreasing values of sectional forces and displacements of the wall. This effect is stronger in comparison to the conventional design approach. In further research the aim should be to increase the reliability of the alternative design approach. This can be done by using in-situ measurements of the displacements of the wall to validate if the model represents the reality accurately.","Quay walls; Plaxis 2D; Undrained behavior; Critical State Soil Mechanics; SLS; Hydraulic Engineering; Geotechnical Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The erosion resistance of dikes to overtopping waves is determined by the strength of the grass cover. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the erosion resistance of grass covers is desired to enable a good and effective dike management. In the existing approach to assess the erosion resistance of grass covers, the erosion resistance is empirically quantified in terms of local hydraulic loads. However, despite the cyclical nature of overtopping waves, no insights into the dependence of the erosion resistance on successive loads are available. To improve the understanding of the resistance of grass covers to wave overtopping induced loads, understanding of the development of the mechanical behaviour of grass sods is essential. In this study the mechanical behaviour of grass covers under tensile loads have been examined by means of direct pull tests executed in the field. Especially the influence of repetitive wave loading and the conditions during testing were of interest. The results of this study show that the deformation of the grass cover due to tensile load is time dependent. The failure mode of the grass cover is influenced by the degree of saturation of the grass cover. The maximum strength and mechanical behaviour of the grass cover is influenced by accumulation of damage. The findings presented in this study provide a better understanding of the processes that influence the mechanical behaviour of the grass cover. Moreover, insights in the development of the process of damage accumulation are revealed. Based on the findings of this study, a method is proposed to determine the resistance of grass covers against repetitive loads by means of direct pull tests. In this method the resistance of grass covers against repetitive loads is described by an estimation of the fatigue limit. Relating the fatigue limit of a grass cover to hydraulic loads, enables an assessment of the erosion resistance of a grass cover at a specific location.","Grass covers; Wave overtopping; Erosion resistance; Dike cover","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","Civil Engineer Consultancy Project","53.242315, 5.491288"

The discontinuity-enriched finite element method (DE-FEM) and interface-enriched generalized finite element method (IGFEM) are promising computational approaches developed in recent years for solving problems containing discontinuities, which are capable of decoupling the mesh morphology from the geometry of discontinuities. Nonetheless, these formulations have only been developed for linear or quadratic polynomial interpolants. We introduce high-order discontinuity formulations aiming at improving the accuracy of the approximation by fixing the mesh size while increasing the polynomial degree of the interpolant, namely the p-version of DE-FEM/IGFEM (p-DE-FEM/p-IGFEM). In the proposed methods, hierarchical shape functions of the p-version of FEM (p-FEM) are employed, and high-order enrichment functions constructed with different polynomial bases are applied in elements intersected by discontinuities. Through convergence tests, we show that p-DE-FEM solves one-dimensional elasticity problems with exponential rates of convergence, and p-IGFEM solves two-dimensional static heat conduction problems with the same exponential rates of convergence as those of p-FEM with meshes that align to discontinuities. When the mesh is refined and the polynomial degree is fixed, p-IGFEM obtains optimal rates of O(p), with p denoting the polynomial degree used. We also show that high-order enrichment functions constructed with orthogonal polynomial bases lead to better-conditioned stiffness matrices.","discontinuities; FEM; DE-FEM; IGFEM; p-version of FEM; high-order FEM; enriched FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","","","","","",""

The compression reinforces the difference of certain beliefs, a fierce shared sense of coexistence as well as a multi-faith and Gibraltarian identity. Currently, they share a cemetery located at the junction of the airport and the city center, not just creating a religious blending atmosphere, but also being under the pressure coming from invasive city expansion.

(mentor); Chen, X. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","On a global scale, the present-day demand of coastal protections, port expansions and construction of artificial islands, rises. To be able to accommodate for all these environmental changes, complex dredging operations have to be performed. Depending on the type of soil and in-situ conditions, a suitable excavation and transportation method has to be chosen. From an economic point of view it is desired to make this process as efficient as possible. The only way in doing this, is to understand the physics of the rock cutting process and be able to predict the behavior of the rock formation during cutting. <br/><br/>This research focusses on the physics that come paired with the excavation of rock deposits under atmospheric conditions. The removal of rock results from the interaction between the cutting tool and intact rock, destructing the internal structure of the rock formation. A rock may either fail in a brittle tensile, brittle shear or ductile manner. Over the past decades various calculation models have been developed to predict the cutting forces in rock cutting. Most known prediction models assume one failure mechanism to be dominant, using a specific cutting tool geometry. For the sake of this research a sharp pickpoint is used. The elaborated, existing calculation models within this research using a sharp pickpoint as a cutting tool, all consider the rock cutting process to be a two-dimensional problem. To investigate if this hypothesis about the rock cutting process is correct, experimental research is conducted. A distinction is made between two different rock types, both varying in strength (e.g. sandstone and artificial rock). <br/><br/>Experimental research revealed that the measured forces greatly underestimate the results of the existing prediction models. The author states that this inaccuracy partially arises from the fact that, in practice, the excavation of rock is actually a three-dimensional problem, since visual observations clearly showed that chips broke out sideways. Based on the experimental measurements, two new calculation models were set up, incorporating this three-dimensional effect. The first model implemented fracture mechanics theory, focussing on the required local crack tip stresses to initiate a tensile crack. Due to several unknown empirical parameters, the tensile-dominated fracture model gave unsatisfactory results, underestimating the measured cutting forces. The second model was set up by focussing on the actual physics that were observed during cutting. Based on visual observations and individual chip investigation, three different failure mechanisms can be substantiated that occur during cutting: crushing, major shear failure and tensile failure. <br/><br/>By elaborating on the developed prediction model, it appears that the forces due to crushing dominate the total force spectrum. For a crushed zone to develop, penetration into the material is required. The author discovered that rock's resistance to obtain a certain penetration, needs to be accounted for when calculating the stresses within the crushed zone. By achieving the desired penetration, a large vertical force arises, indicating that frictional effects also need to be considered. This means that forces due to crushing are dependent on the hardness of the rock and frictional resistance between the cutting tool and rock's top interface. Based on production measurements and cutting groove analysis, the crushed zone dimensions were able to be determined, whereupon an expression for the pickpoint's indentation area was found. A surprising discovery was made during the analyzing phase of the force data. Regardless of the pre-set cutting configuration, a basic force level was observed during cutting, which is quite well-approximated by the crush force component, including frictional effects. Despite the formation of a crushed zone, chips failed in a cataclysmic manner. Individual chip investigation revealed that a certain fraction of shear and tensile failure is present along the failure plane. It appeared that the contribution due to tensile failure becomes more significant as the penetration depth of the pickpoint increases. This can be explained by the fact that a tensile crack has the ability to grow and propagate to the rock's top interface. The results of this research show that predictability of the forces increased significantly, compared to the existing two-dimensional calculation models. <br","rock cutting; modelling; three-dimensional; Sandstone; artificial rock; Linear rock cutting theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-10","","","","","",""

Understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying individual finger movements can lead to a higher number of degrees of freedom (DoF) when developing BCI-controlled hand prostheses. Our goal was to test the efficacy of separating the activity of two individual fingers during a pinch-and-hold motor task using EEG source localization. EEG data from three healthy participants performing the motor task using different fingers were collected and analyzed using two parametric and two non-parametric source localization methods. A statistical analysis was performed on the source space to test whether it is possible to distinguish between the two fingers. We were able to measure the cortical response to the perturbations on the channel level during the hold phase of the motor task. However, source power in the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices was low for all conditions. The most active sources were found in the frontal cortex over Brodmann area 8. A cluster-based permutation test performed on the source space results did not reveal differences between the two fingers on the cortical area. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0:05) source differences are reported in one case, however, the locations of the sources indicate this effect is irrelevant to the motor task.

The Paris agreement demands countries to change their main energy resources from oil, coal and gas to renewable resources such as wind. The Dutch government chose to use the space offshore for the development of wind farms. These developments require a durable collaboration between the various stakeholders in the North Sea. Tensions exist between the different stakeholders in the North Sea, and the projected developments are expected to pressure these relationships even further. The need for shared multi-use areas grows as the North Sea is used more and more intensely. This report presents a multidisciplinary design for an artificially enhanced fisheries system within an offshore wind farm (OWF). The goal of this design is to provide a nature inclusive solution to increasing pressure on the fishing industry by the growing offshore wind sector. The possible implementation of a fishing industry within OWFs was analysed. This resulted in a number of applicable solution spaces. A notable solution was the Fish-as-a-Service concept, which resolves several issues that currently hinder the development of multi-purpose OWFs. In this solution, a company would fulfil the role of managing the fisheries in OWFs without the need for wind farm clients to actively partake in the fishing industry. Five target species were selected that could be harvested from an artificial reef system within an OWF. These species were European lobster, Brown crab, Atlantic cod, European seabass and Cuttlefish. The selection of these species was made based on economic interest, ecological interest, the potential for non-intrusive fishing methods and previous successes in other studies and/or projects. These species formed the basis of further ecological and financial examinations. Based on the biological and technical criteria following from the stakeholder and biological analysis, the most suitable wind farm site where an artificially enhanced fishing area could be implemented was selected. It was concluded that the Borssele Wind Farm Zones 1 and 2 would be the most suitable sites. The bathymetry, soil conditions, seabed dynamics and metocean data were further analysed in order to create a design for the artificial reef. A range of possible reef concepts were developed, including loose rock revetment, placed block revetment, layer cakes, biohuts, block reefs, layered pipes, shipwrecks and decommissioned oil or gas platforms. These concepts were verified for their operability and whether they met the requirements for bio-enhanced fisheries. Three preliminary designs for an artificial reef system in the Borssele OWF were made based on these reef concepts and the circumstances at the site. Of these designs, the most desirable one includes block reefs, natural stones, layer cakes, decommissioned oil or gas platforms and shipwrecks in order to promote biodiversity and yield as much biomass as possible. An Ecopath with Ecosim model was designed using available literature studies. This model was used to predict the amount of biomass produced in an OWF with and without hard substrate. An immense biomass increase in the target species European lobster (2.157.265%) and Brown crab (857.281%) was predicted with the addition of hard substrate. additionally, target species Atlantic cod and cuttlefish showed an increase of 1897% and 175% respectively. Surprisingly, European seabass was predicted to decrease with 93%. The estimated biomass was included in a study in the strengths and weaknesses of the business opportunities based on the Fish-as-a-Service concept. Costs and revenues throughout the lifetime of the sustainable fishery were taken into account, resulting in a final investment advice. The PERTH method was used to account for the uncertainty of estimating the costs of such a project. A detailed cash flow analysis was carried out in order to present a clear view on the different financial scenarios. The cash flow analysis showed a final Net Present Value (NPV) at year 25 of values between 3000 and 6000 mln EUR. This shows the profitability of the proposed design, with an Internal Rate of Return after tax of 69,90%.","Sustainable fishery; fish-as-a-service; OWF; Widn Farm; Multi-purpose; Aquaculture and Marine Resource Management","en","student report","","","","","","End report of our multi disciplinary project ""Healthy Fish""","","","","","","","MDP305: Healthy Fish",""

Cases of particular interest are laminates under buckling conditions or laminates containing cut-outs, for which VAT laminates have the ability to decrease concentration factors and increase buckling loads, thus having the ability to create more efficient designs. With the aim of finding solutions with reduced computational cost, a semi-analytical analysis tool is developed which is able to determine the behaviour of VAT laminates with cut-outs. The method is based on finding the position of minimum energy using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Due to the discontinuous nature of laminates with a cut-out, the approximation functions are enriched with additional functions to capture the behaviour near this discontinuity. In order to determine the energy functional derivatives across the domain of the laminate, Gauss-Legendre Quadrature numerical integration rules are applied to both rectangular and circular sections and the resultant energies are obtained by subtracting the integration on the cut-out domain from the rectangular domain. The approach mixes a stress-based approach to determine the in-plane pre-buckling stresses, and a displacement-based formulation to determine the buckling modes and eigenvalues. Minimising the energies yields the coefficients for the enriched stress-state and enriched displacement field. The model is set-up for balanced and symmetric laminates, thus decoupling the out-of-plane and in-plane behaviours. These components are verified with existing models in the literature and FE solutions, determining the behaviour of pristine VAT laminates and isotropic plates with cut-outs. Upon successful verification, the components are combined to give the buckling behaviour. Furthermore, results from literature for a laminate including a square stiffening insert are used to verify the capabilities of the proposed model. These results have been extended further to circular stiffening insert to verify the capabilities of the proposed enriching trial functions. Finally, a VAT laminate design is analysed where the capabilities of the proposed model, the proposed trial functions and VAT laminate designs are illustrated. For this case, the pre-buckling stresses and subsequent buckling behaviour are analysed for a VAT laminate with a cut-out. The results are shown to be accurate in determining the axial load distribution and showed a decrease in stress concentrations surrounding the cut-out. This pre-buckling stress-state is used to determine the buckling behaviour and compared to the VAT laminate without cut-out.","variable stiffness; cut-outs; semi-analytical model; rayleigh-ritz","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In this Master thesis, an assessment of the normalised normally consolidated undrained shear strength is performed for a dike stability reinforcement project between Gorinchem and Waardenburg in the South west of the Netherlands on a problematic clay layer called the `Gorinchem Clay' throughout this thesis. The main goal is the conrmation of the current norms or towards a more optimised and less conservative assessment of the strength parameters and in doing so, discusses one of the most recurrent questions in geotechnical engineering: do some of the measurements from laboratory tests reveal true material behaviour or do the limitations of such laboratory tests produce this particular behaviour? This analysis was performed on Triaxial Compression, Direct Simple Shear and Triaxial Extension tests from which the SHANSEP parameters are derived as input for the available shear strength along a slip surface according to the methodology developed by Ladd (1991) and following the Critical State Soil Mechanics. The structure of this thesis is as follows: rst, a literature study is performed on the strength parameters assessment in chapter 1, the principles of the Critical State Soil Mechanics and the diculties encountered in the determination of the strength parameters from laboratory tests in chapter 2. The laboratory results are then exploited in chapters 4 to 5 according to the current guidelines and more extended methods in which the limitations of the Classical Critical State Soil Mechanics are shown. The next chapters focus on a more fundamental understanding of the considered material consisting of modelling the material behaviour in chapter 6 using a simplied academic constitutive model featuring non-associative elasto-plasticity with mixed volumetric and deviatoric hardening allowing for hardening or softening. The outcomes of this thesis show Critical State conditions as traditionally understood could not be reached reliably for undrained conditions in Triaxial Compression, Triaxial Extension and Direct Simple Shear. The tests showed to be particularly unreliable beyond 10% axial strain in Triaxial Compression and Extension, and beyond 15% shear strain in Direct Simple Shear. The diculties encountered in determining the Critical State friction angle and undrained shear strength were shown to be minimised by performing drained and undrained Triaxial compression tests on slightly over-consolidated soil samples. Additionally, the limitations of the Classical Critical State theory were highlighted and a more advanced constitutive model including a non-associative ow rule and deviatoric hardening was successfully used to predict the behaviour in Triaxial Compression for undrained conditions. The predictions for drained conditions and particularly undrained Triaxial Extension were however limited.","Undrained behaviour; Macro-stability; Critical State Soil Mechanics; dikes; organic silty clay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","Dijkversterking GoWa","51.823565, 5.057725"

In addition to an increase in tidal range, a dramatic increase in suspended sediment concentrations has been observed in the Ems (Germany) and Loire (France) estuaries, often referred to as a regime shift towards hyperturbid state. While it is generally accepted that the increase in tidal range is a consequence of deepening and narrowing, it is not generally true that deepening and narrowing leads to a dramatic increase in sediment concentrations. Whether deepening is a potential cause for the high sediment concentrations observed in the Loire, is still unclear. Although very little observations have been reported over the 20th century, literature clearly shows that sediment concentrations increased drastically over the years. The scarcity of data not only applied for the sediment concentrations over the years but also for bathymetry and hydrodynamics, resulting in uncertainty about the historical states of the estuary. To cope with the large range of uncertainty and variability in the reported observations and model parameters, an idealised model called iFlow has been used. The strength of the iFlow model for this research was twofold. Firstly, iFlow allowed to identify the essential physical processes driving the estuarine sediment dynamics. Secondly, iFlow is computationally efficient, allowing to perform extensive sensitivity studies. In this way, we could determine which processes play a role in the current state of the Loire estuary and how they are affected by deepening. Furthermore, by mapping the effects of the uncertainty on the different physical processes, robust conclusions could be drawn about the effects of deepening despite the given uncertainty. The effects of deepening on the physical processes has been assessed by only varying the depth in the model. Deepening generally resulted in enhanced sediment import or decreased sediment export. Hence, the transport capacity in the Loire became much more favourable for the import of sediment. In order to determine the robustness of these findings, an extensive sensitivity study was performed of 14.157 simulations (1287 conditions for 11 bottom profiles over time) to capture the influence of uncertainties in multiple input parameters. For the bottom profile representing the bathymetry in the year 1900, none of the conditions resulted in a hyperturbid state, whereas independent of the conditions, the likelihood to find a hyperturbid state always increased for increasing depth. From this we can conclude, that the observed regime shift towards high sediment concentrations would not have happened without the deepening of the Loire estuary.","Loire river-estuary; Hyperturbidity; Idealized modelling; iFlow; Sediment dynamics; Sensitivity Analysis; Proces Based modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","47.279608, -1.903788"

The maximal distance we were able to interpret barcodes from, based on a 4K image, was around 1 metre. Continuing the trend, we would need at least an 8K camera to detect from a distance of 1.5 metres. Detection however, is less difficult and is feasible from a distance of 1.5-2 metres.

Level-k phylogenetic networks are such networks, but with a at most k reticulations per biconnected component of the network. For level-1 networks there exists an algorithm, called TriLoNet (Trinet Level-one Network algorithm), that constructs these networks directly from sequence alignments which works by piecing together smaller level-1 networks on three taxa. Here, we introduce TriL2Net (Trinet Level-2 Network algorithm), an algorithm similar to TriLoNet that works for the larger class of level-2 networks. More specifically, TriL2Net constructs a level-2 phylogenetic network from a set of level-2 trinets. We show that TriL2Net performs better on sampled level-2 networks than TriLoNet performs om sampled level-1 networks. We hypothesize that this result is either due to the different ways the data is sampled, or the difference in heuristics used. Moreover, we applied TriL2Net to level-1 trinet sets derived from real sequence data involving recombination. When comparing the networks generated by TriL2Net from these data sets to the networks generated by TriLoNet from these same data sets, we found that TriL2Net’s networks are at least as consistent with the input as TriLoNet’s networks.

Over the years however, the extent of innovation related to the conventional 'tubular fuselage' configurations have somewhat reached a stalemate as the gains obtained have only been marginal. It is for this reason, there has off-late been a surge in research pertaining to unconventional aircraft design and configurations. The Flying V (FV) is one such alternative that was conceptualized by J. Benad at TU Berlin along with the Future Projects Office (FPO) at Airbus Operations GmbH in Hamburg. Results obtained from past studies show a 25% improvement in the lift to drag ratio of the FV as compared to the NASA Common Research Model (CRM), which was set as the basis of comparison for a fixed wing aircraft configuration. So far, aerodynamic studies have only focused on the cruise performance of the FV without any emphasis on its low speed behavior. Conventional aircrafts use high lift devices like flaps and slats to improve stability and increase the amount of lift its wings produce at lower speeds. The FV however, has no such high lift device and solely relies on the lift produced by its wing to achieve a speed that is low enough to land safely. For this reason, this thesis aims to investigate the influence of ground proximity on the lift, drag and pitching moments of the FV which in turn affect its take-off and landing characteristics. Compressible RANS equations were solved with the k-omega SST turbulence model using ANSYS Fluent on a 4.6\% scaled model of the FV. The ground was numerically realized by employing the moving ground boundary condition equal in velocity to the free stream. Results from these simulations have shown a 11% reduction in the drag polar of the FV when closest to the ground as compared to when in unbounded flow. Additionally, the proximity to the ground causes an increase in lift and this allows the FV to touch down at 19 degrees while the maximum rotation angle during take-off is predicted to be about 13 degrees for a positive climb gradient when also considering the One-Engine-Idle (OEI) scenario. This corresponds to a lift to drag ratio equal to 10 and a lift-off lift coefficient of 0.56 approximately. The effect of ride height on the longitudinal stability of the FV showed that favorable pitching moments were obtained for angles of attack between 0 degrees and 5 degrees and for angles greater than 17.5 degrees. A near wake analysis was also performed for different angles of attack and at different heights from the ground to investigate the flow phenomena over the FV and the evolution of the wake downstream. No significant span wise flow is seen when the angle of attack is 0 degrees and the flow appears to travel parallel to the stream-wise direction. Additionally, in case of very high angles of attack, the flow streamlines confirm the occurrence of a large vortex emanating from the leading edge kink of the wing. When in unbounded flow a secondary vortex located inboard is produced at 17 degrees. The diameter of the tip vortex is seen to be greater than the inboard secondary vortex for an angle of attack equal to 17 degrees. At greater angles of attack, the secondary vortex is seen to grow in diameter as the height reduces.","Ground Effect; Flying V; CFD; Compressible; RANS; longitudinal stability; Aerodynamics; SST; Turbulence modeling; flying wing; ANSYS; Aerospace; aircraft landing; aircraft takeoff; Numerical analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying V",""

(graduation committee); de Jonge, Krispijn (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Recently, there is a growing need to address the investment gap in renewable energy by attracting non-institutional investors that have investment preferences better suited for the energy transition. Crowdfinancing is a promising alternative, as it allows for increased innovation, more sustainable development and reduced community risks and is driven by a crowd of small investors that are less profit-driven than professional investors. However, current crowdfinancing models are limited by lack of trust, adverse selection, exclusive corporate governance and lack of liquidity. While extant research has identified these limitations and the potential of blockchain technology to solve some of them, there is a need to design the blockchain-based crowdfinancing mechanisms required and provide a business case for their implementation. The research objective of this practice-oriented design research is to provide a practical plan for the implementation of blockchain-based crowdfinancing for renewable energy projects by means of a design and business case for engineering and consultancy firms as the facilitators of the process in the Netherlands, with the purpose to give a boost to the energy transition.<br/>A foundation for the research was provided by making an analysis of the evolution and current state of the Dutch energy market organization based on three cornerstones: market roles, production and financing. This analysis showed a high degree of decentralization in terms of market roles and production from renewables that allowed the emergence of community driven energy cooperatives, while a dependence on centralized financial intermediaries is still present; risky and small projects do not have access to bank financing and existing crowdfinancing platforms charge high brokerage fees and provide no secondary markets. A pilot study based on the same cornerstones and consisting of interviews with relevant market parties was performed in order to supplement the analysis of the market for the formulation of design requirements for the crowdfinancing mechanisms. Qualitative desk research was done on existing smart contract applications that could be utilized to overcome the limitations of crowdfinancing and served as the building blocks for the conceptual designs. Qualitative desk research was also performed in order to quantify the costs and address the (legal) implications of implementing the mechanisms proposed.<br/>The result was a practical plan consisting of blockchain-based crowdfinancing mechanisms that reduce brokerage fees and facilitate the organic establishment of secondary markets by making use of existing public blockchain infrastructure, and a positive business case for consultancy and 10 engineering firms to facilitate the process. Smart contracts govern the crowdfinancing process autonomously for low and high risk projects, where with the latter crowdinvestors are given financial control by locking project funds in trustless escrow contracts, thereby allowing them to cut losses in failing projects and thus addressing the issues of lack of trust and exclusive corporate governance, while mitigating the effects of adverse selection. This practical plan provides a tool to further empower the crowd as the fuel for the energy transition, thereby increasing investments in renewables. However, social exclusion might result at first from the intrinsic complexity of blockchain technology and the degree to which a boost can be given to the transition remains unclear due to a lack of consensus on the effectiveness of crowdfinancing to increase support for the bigger projects. There is further research needed into a risk management-based approach for the design of escrow contracts that release funds according to a project planning, while the delegation of control rights to more capable third parties also requires more research. Additionally, the application of decentralized governance beyond financial control requires further examination as well.","Infrastructure; Renewable Energy; Financing; Crowdfunding; Crowdfinancing; Blockchain Technology; Distributed Ledger; Smart contracts; Decentralization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Such a drastic reduction can only be achieved by considering safety as early as in the design phase, when most impact can be made. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to enable the easy generation of different design concepts and evaluate them with regard to safety. Since most accidents currently occur in Heineken's warehouse loading areas, this is the area considered in this thesis. In order to evaluate the generated designs with respect to safety, safety has been quantified into a single value, the risk level. This risk level is the result of the possible consequence of an accident (the impact), the number of times an activity is expected to occur (the frequency) and the chance that this activity results in an accident (the probability). These values depend on the type of accident, or hazard, which is any unsafe condition or potential source of an undesirable event with potential for harm or damage. The hazards corresponding to the top three most occurring accidents have been identified and have been evaluated. For the generation and evaluation of design concepts, a parametric model has been developed. By changing parameters, designs with different operating processes, equipment types, layouts, and more, can quickly be generated and visualised for the designer. Also the movements that occur in the warehouse area can be simulated. The model counts the number of times a hazard occurs and determines the corresponding frequency score. The scores for the impact and probability are based on expert opinion. The risk level is subsequently calculated. Using the parametric model, the risk level resulting from the twelve most occurring hazards in the warehouse loading area of Heineken is evaluated for different scenarios. The findings show that the current method that is used to determine the frequency score is not suitable for activities that typically occur a lot, which is the case in the warehouse loading area. Therefore, an alternative method is proposed, which uses an exponential distribution to score the number of times that a hazard can occur. By analysing design choices regarding the type of picking process (directly from warehouse, using cross-docking or using pre-staging), the level of automation, the number of aisles, the distance between loading points and designing crossings on a different level, the preferred design choices are found.","Safety; Risk; Parametric Design; Parametric Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-02-05","","","","","",""

As these fuels area limited resource and have significant negative side effects, the way humanity uses these is unsustainable and other sources of energy have to be found. One of these sustainable energy sources is plant-derived biomass. However, biomass cannot be efficiently used in its natural form and needs to be converted to other products through processes such as pyrolysis and gasification. Pyrolysis will be the focus of this thesis, as fast pyrolysis of Miscanthus is studied for the BRISK 2 project at Process &amp; Energy (TU Delft). However, the current setup used for pyrolysis research does not provide a complete mass-closure of the experiments, with only 80% of the total mass accounted for in the char, tar and gaseous yields. In order to improve this closure, four different methods were developed and investigated during this thesis. All of the pyrolysis experiments were performed in a Pyroprobe 5200. The pyrolysis parameters were comparable to fast pyrolysis, with a high heating rate of 600°C/s, a low residence time of 10 s and a Final Pyrolysis Temperature between 600°C and 1000°C. The objective of the first adjustment was to improve the purge flow stability, reduce the amount of blockages in the system and increase the accuracy of the experiments. The flow meter, controlling the purge flow, was replaced with a mass-flow controller and a tube in the setup was simplified and shortened. No further blockages were observed and the total mass-closure improved on average by 7.85 wt% over the temperature range of 600-1000°C, with an increase at every temperature. The second considered element was the homogeneity of the biomass. Two biomass feedstocks were investigated, the first feedstock consisted of inhomogeneous pellets grinded down to a size less than 80μm, while the second type was homogenized biomass of a size of less than 200μm. Both biomass types performed comparably to each other and better than the previous data collected with the setup. At 600°C the inhomogeneous biomass performed better, while at 700°C the homogeneous biomass gave a higher yield. The last two experimental series both focused on gravimetrically measuring the tars collected in the condenser of the setup, which was not gravimetrically measured before. The first of these methods removed the condenser in favour of a direct capture in a quartz trap. This gave a maximum yield increase of 1.14 wt% at 700°C. However, concerns of contaminating the gas mixture with tars arose, therefore this method was not investigated at higher temperatures. In the second technique, the 2ml of isopropanol in the condenser was evaporated from a glass Petri dish, leaving the tars behind. This method was explored over a larger temperature range (600-1000°C), yet only provided a maximum increase of 1.5 wt% at 1000°C, while giving significant fluctuations between experiments. Thus proving that neither of these methods is a suitable way of gravimetrically measuring the condenser.","Biomass; Pyrolysis; Miscanthus; Pyroprobe","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Science and Technology","",""

The aim of this thesis is to develop a rescheduling framework for metro networks that mitigate the impact of disturbances on passengers whilst considering the dynamic variation of demand and its effect on train operations. To achieve this, the Simulation-Based Traffic Management for Metro Network (SBTM-MN) framework is developed. This comprises two models that interact iteratively, the Transport Simulation Model (TSM), and the Train Rescheduling Model (TRM). The TSM integrates a train simulation in the microscopic train simulation tool OpenTrack, with a passenger module constructed to keep track of passenger allocation and compute train dwell times according to the passenger exchange. The TRM modifies arrival and departure times of trains according to a base schedule and the corresponding passenger allocation provided by the TSM. A series of experiments are carried out on the SBTM-MN, and on each of its components, the TSM and the TRM. These experiments provide insights into the effect of passenger allocation on the rescheduling measure, the trade-off between passenger and operators perspective, and the impact of demand on the development of disturbances.

According to a state-of-the-art study two designs are presented: (1) A sandwich deck, commonly used in FRP bridges, and (2) a through deck, commonly used in railway bridges. Furthermore, the requirements and loadings for railway bridges are listed. The dynamic model for railway bridges is based on a mass-spring rigid body system with Rayleigh damping. This model is used to verify the finite element models. A material study is performed to determine the most suitable material properties for FRP railway bridges. Glass fibres and polyester resin are choses based on individual material properties, market prices and common use in civil engineering structures. Foam has no structural integrity but is used as permanent form work. The lay-up of fibres is based on the literature study and differ for flanges and webs. The lay-up for flanges is: <br/>[12.5% - 90° | 12.5% - ±45° | 62.5% - 0° | 12.5% - ±45°]s <br/>The lay-up for webs is: <br/><br/>[25% - 90° | 20% - ±45° | 35% - 0° | 20% - ±45°]s <br/><br/>The volume fraction of both laminates is 50%. These lay ups in combination with the conversion factors and safety factors result in a FRP material suitable for FRP railway bridges. The design study describes the sandwich and through design with the materials from the material study. Two finite element model are made using Sofistik. These finite element models are verified using analytical models. A static and dynamic analysis is performed on both designs. Based on the results from the static analysis the maximum deflection and maximum stresses of the Sandwich Design do not exceed the limits, and the maximum deflection and maximum stresses of the Through Design do exceed the limits. Based on the dynamic analysis both designs do exceed the limits. Furthermore, in consultation with a FRP manufacturer, the laminate thickness must be reduced to ensure both designs are manufacturable. Based on the results of the design study and the requirements presented in the literature study a new design is created. This design includes the following improvements: (1) reduction of the span by transferring the forces in transverse direction, (2) extra height of the design, (3) more webs, (4) extra supports, (5) reduction of the laminate thickness to 30 mm and (6) the use of pre-camber. This final design is transformed into a finite element model. A static and dynamic analysis is performed. Based on the results of the static analysis the maximum deflection and maximum stresses do not exceed the limits. The dynamic analysis results in maximum acceleration of 19.48 m/s2, which exceeds the limit and results in a unity check of 5.57. The final design doesn’t meet the requirements based on the results of the dynamic analysis. An important remark on the dynamic results is made in the discussion. The dynamic load model, consisting of point loads, is applied directly on the bridge deck, omitting the dynamic behaviour of the ballast bed. Taking into account the ballast bed in the dynamic analysis might result in a significant reduction of the maximum acceleration of the bridge deck due to the spreading and damping effect of the ballast bed. In conclusion, according to the results of the static analysis of the final design it is possible to apply a FRP deck in railway bridges. Improvement of the dynamic numerical model is needed before drawing conclusions on the dynamic behaviour of the final design.","FRP composites; Railway bridge; Sofistik; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Thus requiring periodic rehabilitation measures to maintain the condition of the underlying asset. Since damages on the asphalt road, impose economic setbacks and concern for the users, governmental authorities are looking for a proactive approach to detect and classify distresses in their ""early"" stages. As a reason, governmental authorities like the Province of Zuid-Holland (PZH) yearly inspect the road network, which was optimal until now, but as the traffic flows are increasing and weather conditions are worsening, a new approach is required to mitigate the need for a frequent, cost-effective and reliable inspection method. Modern data sources such as smartphones are the biggest data generators. Having an intriguing number of sensors and in-built features, governmental and private authorities are just starting to acknowledge the potential of such crowd-sourced data generators. In this research data-types like vibration and imagery were gathered and synthesized to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the 3 data-driven models. A 7-step methodology was implemented to build all the machine learning models. At first, vibration data was gathered to detect road anomalies and predict the International Roughness Index (IRI), by building a Random Forest decision tree. Secondly, a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) was constructed and utilized to classify pavement surface distresses. The last model, is a next step towards autonomously distinguishing the classified distress with its severity ranking.

A sheet steel formed e-bike frame was designed to fit the image and style of Mokumono, while improving the manufacturability of the frame. By changing the construction of the frame, the manufacturing process is streamlined and more appropriate for potential automation. By using laser brazing to bond the shells instead of laser welding, the post-processing costs have been greatly reduced. The brazing takes place at lower temperatures, which reduces the warping in the material and maintains the strength of the material around the joint. This lowers the overall production costs of a frame compared to the frames produced using the current production process.

CEO van Geenen possesses a passion and talent for entrepreneurship and an expertise in pastry-making, but little affinity for- nor experience with sustainability. With the upcoming laws and regulations, governments are pushing companies to move from a linear towards a circular economy. However, a lot of companies, especially those smaller and medium-sized enterprises, struggle with implementing sustainable innovations. Guided by the Revamped Double Diamond model, this project tries to find an answer to the research question being: “How should STRIK patisserie contribute to a Circular Economy, while at the same time creating additional economic value?”, while sliding through phases of discovering, defining, developing and delivering. In the first discovering &amp; defining phase, the project finds areas of opportunity for economic, environmental and social value creating using the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas (TLBMC). Within these steps, amongst others, the company ecosystem is determined, just as a carbon footprint analysis was conducted to understand which are the most impactful categories in terms of greenhouse gas emission. Moreover, a company analysis leads to a list of implementation criteria in terms of ‘must’, ‘should’, ‘could’, and ‘won’t’ criteria. The conclusions from the TLBMC and criteria were used to define the design challenge of: “How can we make STRIK’s food waste stream 100% circular while gaining economic and social benefits?”. In the developing &amp; delivering phase, ideas were generated and evaluated, leading to three selected concepts of 1) an educational web-page about food waste; 2) a new product line made from wasted parts ; and 3) a partnership for anaerobic processing of food waste. These concepts are turned into ‘minimum viable products’ for testing the key metrics of desirability and viability. From the results can be implied that there is a high desirability and viability for concept 2, while concept 3 can assure 100% circularity, concluding a recommended perseverance of concept 2 (new product line from wasted parts) as a first step and concept 3 (partnership for anaerobic processing) as a future step. The focus is on rapidly bringing concept 2 to the market, so further detailing is done on concept 2 only, looking into the product, packaging, price and promotion. In a final ‘present &amp; validate’ phase, the solutions for helping STRIK contribute to a circular economy are presented. The first and most important step towards circularity is making new products from wasted parts and promoting these in a qualitatively, tasteful and story-telling way. The validation phase concludes that, in addition to the earlier tested desirability and viability, that the solution hits the innovation sweet spot, as it is considered feasible, viable and desirable. The thesis ends with a ‘discussion, conclusion &amp; reflection’ chapter.","Circular economy; Food Waste; Circular Business Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Gathering accurate and reliable precipitation data is essential in developing countries, since it applied to a wide range of applications, from improving short term weather models to global climate change research. The most common way of acquiring rainfall measurements is the rain gauge. However, this traditional measurement equipment requires frequent visits from researchers, due to the clogging risks as well as the risk of being easily tampered with by unauthorized people. This makes it impractical and expensive to create a extensive network of these rain gauges, whilst the demand for the precipitating data remains high. A measurement equipment type which is more suitable for this remote and independent requirement for precipitation measurement in developing countries is GPS, since an aspect of GPS measurements is the possibility to use the equipment in relatively remote conditions, with little human interference necessary. In addition to this, due to the nature of GPS measurements, rain is expected to be an important component in GPS data, as a disruptive to the signal, a variable found in the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR). Considering the above, GPS seems like a good alternative to the traditional rain gauge for precipitationmeasurements. During this additional thesis, the question whether GPS can be used reliably for precipitation data, will be answered. During a measuring campaign in Uganda from September to November in 2018, GPS data was gathered near precipitation measurement locations from TWIGA’s School-2-School initiative. For the processing, graphs of the SNR and precipitation of the same days and locations were created and were visually inspected to see if a relationship or correlation was present. From these graphs this relationship between SNR and precipitation was not immediately clear. The nature of the SNR can be caused by a multitude of reasons and variables and unless the correlation is very strong between variables, this correlation will not be very clear from just a visual inspection of these SNR and precipitation graphs. To untangle these variables, correlationmatrices were used, where the variables can be looked at in pairs and instead of as quadruplets (or more). From the correlation matrix of the Ugandan data is is clear that correlation between precipitation and SNR is not significant, as it is similar to the correlation with a randomly generated variable. A slight correlation is present, however, with the GPS elevation angle. During processing, data from Cabauw (the Netherlands) was used as an extra data set to compensate for the small amount of rain in the Ugandan data. This processing followed the same procedure as was applied with the Ugandan data; visual inspection of the SNR and precipitation graphs and generating a correlationmatrix. In the Dutch data the relationship between the SNR and the precipitation was still small, however, larger than in the Ugandan data. Nonetheless, the correlation between the SNR and the elevation was very strong. In conclusion, from both the Ugandan and Dutch data, the correlation between precipitation and SNR is not strong enough, or in other words, using GPS data to approximate rainfall, is not achievable using the methods applied and resources used during this additional thesis.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Where Pressure Reducing Valves (PRVs) usually regulate pressure at a minimum level, we show that they can also be used to enhance leakage diagnosis. During night time, when user demands are low, the control inputs are iteratively updated according to some objective function that aims to maximise the sum of stochastic distances between residual PDFs, weighed with their corresponding likelihood, whereas the likelihood vector itself is updated in a Bayesian classification framework. Stochastic distances are calculated using a stochastic metric that quantifies the overlap between residual PDFs. The algorithm is applied to the Hanoi benchmark network for different intensities of parametric uncertainty.

While universities have focused on improving communication with the general public in the past decades, researchers may still find barriers to engage in public communication of science. One of these barriers is proactive media contact, as the scientific community may perceive it as outside of the researchers’ role and subject the “transgressor” to informal peer-based sanctions. By assessing a sample of TU Delft researchers’ attitude towards an online TU Delft non-profit storytelling platform for internal and external communication similar to the target one, response efficacy proved to be the primary variable to motivate TU Delft researchers to engage in co-creation of online storytelling. The findings further confirm existing theories that younger and more intrinsically motivated researchers seem more willing to engage in online storytelling compared to older and more extrinsically motivated peers. The study translated these guidelines into a gamified design based on graph force models that challenge researchers to create tags related to their story, and form connections with peers within the TU Delft. To access these functionalities, TU Delft researchers must register to the platform by submitting a story idea, e.g. related to their researcher or field of study, and be willing to co-create online storytelling if their story is chosen. The design targets different groups of users by balancing the experience through the Octalysis framework, and implementing social points, competitions among faculties and badges. According to an evaluation with the case owner and a gamification expert of the first iteration of the design, rewarding the submission of stories with a network, seem effective in engaging TU Delft researchers to submit story ideas proactively and enhance collaboration and innovation with the TU Delft.","Gamification; Collaboration; Storytelling; Technology Acceptance Model; Science Communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The effort to reduce global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions has caused a growing interest in the use of sustainable energy sources. One of the potentially sustainable energy sources considered as an alternative for the currently used fossil sources is biomass. Biomass is organic matter that originates from plants or animals which can be used as chemical energy carrier for fuels or for the production of chemical feed stock[Basu, 2010]. Gasification is a thermochemical process that converts materials like biomass into useful convenient gaseous fuels or chemical feedstock[Basu, 2010]. Gasification takes place at high temperature in the presence of a gaseous agent. Gasification is aimed at increasing the overall energy density of biomass by producing gaseous energy carriers with a higher energy density than the original biomass feed. Conventional gasifiers combust a fraction of the biomass or char in order to provide heat to the reduction reactions. This has two disadvantages. First, the flue gasses are mixed with the product. Secondly, the air that is used for partial biomass combustion mainly consists out of nitrogen. The nitrogen dilutes the gasification product significantly. The Indirectly Heated Bubbling Fluidized Bed Steam Reformer [IHBFBSR] set-up at the TU Delft is a novel indirectly heated gasifier or allothermal gasifier. The combustion of natural gas takes place in a separate combustion chamber inside the reactor chamber. Steam gasification can therefore be performed in the absolute absence of oxygen. A radiant tube facilitates heat transfer from the combustion to the reaction chamber. The radiant tubes are installed at the top and bottom of the IHBFBSR and work according to the heat from inside to outside principle. The aim of this study is to assess the performance of the IHBFBSR set-up at the TU Delft and compare its performance with other existing allothermal gasifiers. The main research question of this study is stated as: ""How does the Indirectly Heated Fluidized Bed Reactor perform in terms of product yield, product quality and energy efficiency and how does its performance compare to other indirectly heated gasifiers?"". In order to answer this question, both an equilibrium model and a kinetic model have been designed. Sub-optimal conditions for the IHBFBSR take place at a reactor temperature of 850 degrees C, which is the maximal controlable temperature of the reactor. At this temperature, the carbon limit is reached for an equivalent ratio of 0.23. The CGE at the carbon limit equals 69.7%. Optimal process conditions are where the particle size of the bed material is maximized without losing the fluidization behaviour of the bed. The maximum particle size equals 600 micron. The overall efficiency of the system can be increased by heat transfer between the inlet and outlet gasses of the burners and by the separation and combustion of tars and char to add heat to the process. This study shows that the pyrolysis step in the IHBFBSR is rate limited by internal heat transfer. In addition, the char oxidation reaction is limited by mass transfer of oxygen to the char particle.","Biomass; Gasification; Allothermal; Kinetic Modelling; IHBFBSR; Pyrolysis; Aspen Plus; Performance; Maarten Kwakkenbos","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-03","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These landscapes are read as both backdrop and auditorium; the ports are re-contextualised as the wings and aisles, and the Bay is the stage. The project first establishes comparisons between historical events that have occurred in the Bay alongside other theatrical experiments by artists, architects, and landscapes designers, based on visual and structural similarities. These include both grand events - military sieges, ostentatious construction contributions, as well as the everyday theatricality of fishing-trips, dolphin-tours, migrant patrols, and global trade. It compares the legislation that dictates movement across the Bay to the laws which dictate movement around a stage. The theatrical reading elevates these events as somehow equivalent and worthy of attention, disturbs pre-existing understandings, and recognizes the Bay as a unique theatrical setting. Three sub categories – staging, scripting, viewing – demonstrate precise modes of comparison, each corresponding to a set of spatial conditions, architectural operations, and design objectives. They also coincide to a range of materials, introducing comparisons between drawings and cartographies, scripts and instructions, photography and etchings. By definition the designer of a stage does not limit the acts that can or should take place on it, thus, this contribution is not about designing a play but rather defining the stage. Going beyond the conventional theater space, this contribution introduces a new scale and form of theatrical setting-the global. Theatrum Mundi, or the world as a stage, and in particular, the Bay as a Stage. The theatrical reading is undertaken in order to literally and figuratively draw attention away from the contentious Rock, relegating it to the status of backdrop, and move focus towards the neutral and shared Bay, elevating it to the status of stage. Historically the Rock has been the focus of the theater, in emotional, political, and scenographical terms, with a vocabulary that emphasizes its separation, security, and isolation. Discourse within Gibraltar tends likewise towards isolation and introversion, typified by their antagonistic relationship to the water and their preoccupation with the Rock. By shifting the focus from the Rock towards the Bay, and by providing a new vocabulary for how we speak about the shared Bay the contribution invites regional scale collaborations and initiatives by clarifying and reinforcing the theatricality of the Bay itself.","Gibraltar; Bay; Theatricality; Rock; Theater; Metaphor; Analogy; Allegory; Scripting; Staging; Viewing; Vantage point; Audience; Backdrop; Ships; Actors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","Beyond the Rock","36.1253178321, -5.39093676958"

Which explains why firms replicate and modify it while adopting project-based structures and strategies. PMOs in different organizations hold little similarities with each other. Staffing the PMO is an overhead cost to projects, and seeking to optimize resources organizations tend to allocate more functions to them. As a result, there is a broad range of activities a PMO can perform. This study found in literature 36 different functions associated with this structure. Agile and traditional project management methodologies have fundamental differences in both planning and operational organization. Agile argues that overhead costs, requirements elicitation, and planning processes result in overspending and delaying innovative product development. These differences conflict with previously established roles, functions, and, more problematically, the people that perform them. In this sense, the introduction of agile ways of working is a disruption of traditional practices in the organization. The change to agile methods has effects of various aspects of a firm’s organizational structure, including the PMO, a symbolic figure from traditional project management. Agile standards have different approaches to the use of a PMO, and it is not clear whether the PMO in agile has similar roles and responsibilities as the PMO in traditional methodologies. This study proposes to investigate the impact of the transition from traditional project management to agile on the PMO to address this gap. The main research question makes it explicit: “How do the roles of Project/Program/Portfolio Management Offices change with the introduction of Agile methodologies to a large number of teams?” This study adopted a descriptive exploratory approach to answering this question.<br/>The study observed the changes in the roles of the PMO before and after implementations of agile with four case studies. The research conducted semi-structured interviews and applied surveys with nine professionals in these different companies. The contribution to science of this study is twofold. First, it contributes to the description of the PMO, enriching the field towards a unified theory of project management. Second, it provides empirical evidence for the changes in roles of the PMO with the introduction of agile.<br/>This study found that there are wide disparities between the roles of the PMOs in different organizations. It also found that PMO performs different functions before and after the introduction of agile methods in a firm. It seems to be consistent that the PMOs are involved in the activities of monitoring, controlling, and standardizing project methodologies in both periods. A common theme across the participants' reports is that the PMOs participation got diminished or repurposed to a supporting and serving role with the introduction of agile. An explanation for this change is the shared responsibility the PMOs have with the agile teams on processes they were the sole or main responsible in traditional settings. Another common theme is the interfacing part the PMO plays, bridging traditional sectors and agile sectors of the firm. Participants in all firms believe the current state of the PMO is not final and expect it to continue to change.<br/>Disclaimer: This research was supported by Accenture B.V.","PMO; Agile; Case Stu; Exploratory research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The main challenge that response teams are facing when they develop deployment plans is the lack of appropriate information about indoor spaces. As a result, response teams may end up relying on inaccurate assumptions which can lead to dangerous situations.

To reach these goals, set by governmental organisations, change is required in all levels of society: individuals, municipalities, companies and other types of organisations. This master thesis focuses on the role of companies in the transition towards a circular economy. Companies often have limited insights in their circular performance. A current state analysis is needed to set realistic targets and keep track of the progress. Currently, there is a lack of workable tools that facilitate this analysis. For such a tool to contribute to the acceleration of the progress towards a circular economy, it is considered of great importance that it is easy in use and stimulates the user to action. This research developed a self-assessment rubric to create insights in the circular performance of an individual company. A case study was conducted for the Dutch plastics industry. The result was tested in cooperation with three companies and the results proved to generate relevant insights.","Circular Economy; Circularity assessment; Assessment rubrics; Plastics industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
