It describes an interconnection method to connect electronics onto the smart textiles that differs from any solutions existing in the market. Smart textiles are considered as the future of the clothes and are predicted to have a large potential market. However, there is no standard interconnection technique that is applicable to the wide variety of smart systems. Problems on the wearability, reliability, size, comfort and cost severely limit the development of smart textile. Thus related products are still in a preliminary stage. In this thesis, it is first explored the previous work in the field of smart textiles. User research and using context analysis helps to form the design requirements. A thorough exploration of the existing interconnection techniques and wirings help to form the first ideas to start. Then it is made into several rounds of ideations. Design decisions are made based on the design goal and the list of requirements. Practical tests are set up to evaluate and compare the different concepts as well. Finally, the work of detailing, user experience design, aesthetics, manufacturing is also carefully considered and elaborated for the chosen concept. The result of this study is a product with a highly-finished level. Elitac, the corporate company, should be able to start manufacturing after the electronics are finished. From the academic aspect, this new interconnection solution gives a promising direction for the development of smart textiles. It solves the most difficult part of this field, which is the integration of electronics into the textiles. In general, the result of this thesis should be helpful to the researchers, designers and companies in this field.","Smart textile; Modular system; Wearables; Interconnection tecniques","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-25","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Venygopal, Anirudh (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is usually the go-to reaction for water-based electrolysis processes. However, this reaction can impede the performance and large-scale implementation of such processes due to its sluggish kinetics and the lack of value of its product stream. In order to boost the feasibility of electrochemical processes, research is being conducted on alternative anodic reactions. Even though thermodynamically less favorable, the peroxide evolution reaction yields an added-value product. In this study, the industrial relevance of the anodic peroxide evolution reaction was investigated. The aim of this thesis was to assess the potential for industrial application of this reaction. To do so, the electrochemical parameters of influence and the mechanisms behind the latter were investigated.<br/>The evaluation of both economic and technical feasibility of the process was achieved by following three main threads. Firstly, a gross margin model was introduced. This model allowed to define performance targets of the electrolytic process based on viability requirements. Secondly, electrochemical experiments were carried out. Materials fit for large scale implementation were to be identified. Tin oxide- based materials (SnO2, Sn3O4, ITO and FTO) were investigated due to the stability of tin oxide in a large pH window. Carbon-based materials (CFP, PTFE-coated CFP and GDE) were investigated for their high current density responses and high peroxide yield. Once these materials were identified, systematic studies on electrolyte effects were carried out. Finally, product characterization methods were investigated in order to understand the role of ions such as HCO3 – and CO32– in the enhanced electrochemical production of peroxide. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Geene, P (mentor); Burger, M (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","With a global growing demand of energy, more offshore wind farms are installed, further away and in deeper waters. Nowadays, offshore wind turbines are mostly installed by jack-up installation vessels. Most existing jack-up vessels have legs that are becoming too short for these water depths while offshore wind turbines are increasing in size year after year. Since 2014, the turbine capacity of newly installed wind turbines has increased by 16% every year. Therefore, larger jack-up crane vessels are needed and installation by floating crane vessels is being considered. Heerema Marine Contractors aims to be one of the leaders in the offshore wind installation with her large crane vessels such as HLV Aegir, SSCV Thialf and SSCV Sleipnir. The challenge of floating installation of offshore wind turbines is that motions of the vessel are transferred to the rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) while low tolerances apply for the installation of an RNA. Vertical motions can be reduced by means of a heave compensation system. Such systems are available but come with certain drawbacks: they are difficult to retrofit to a vessel, use a large amount of energy and are rather expensive. A possible solution to these problems could be a novel concept called earth-fixed heave compensation. In this concept, the crane wire is connected to the seabed via a transmission on board of the vessel, transforming an upward motion of the vessel into a downward motion of the RNA and vice versa. At present, it is unclear if such a system is technically feasible. In this research, an analytical model of an earth-fixed heave compensation system is developed. The objective of the model is to gain insight in the influence of design parameters such as the transmission and stiffness of the system. The model is set up in three stages: Stage 1 comprising one degree of freedom for the transmission; Stage 2 comprising two additional degrees of freedom for the sheaves that connect the earth-fixed wire from the seabed to the transmission; Stage 3 comprising all other sheaves, crane reeving and payload are added, resulting in a sixteen degrees of freedom model. A first finding is that wire damping has a negligible influence on the results because natural frequencies of the system are found to lie outside the wave frequency range. However, the first natural frequency is close to the wave frequency range, resulting in a larger response amplitude for both transmission and vertical payload motion in the higher frequencies. Furthermore, it is shown that the inertia of the sheaves of the earth-fixed wire can be neglected for a range of transmission inertias and earth-fixed wire stiffnesses. On top of this, the model confirms that the inertia of the other sheaves can be modelled by means of an equivalent inertia block, to simplify the model for time-domain simulations. The losses in wire tension due to wire-sheave interaction were approximately 5% and it is shown that they can be modelled accurately by means of a sigmoid function. Frequency-domain simulations showed that the heading of the vessel, or wave direction, has a significant influence on the vertical RNA motions. On top of that, increasing peak periods generally result in larger vertical RNA motions. A time-domain simulation for typical North Sea environmental conditions, head waves and a fixed crane slew angle without the heave compensator is made to compare results with. These simulations have shown that it is in principle possible to reduce vertical RNA motions. For a given sea state, 80% motion reduction is achieved by tuning the transmission ratio of the system. It is shown that the location of the earth-fixed wire has an impact on the vessel and payload motions. When located on the starboard side of the vessel, rather than reducing the vertical payload motions that are induced by vessel roll, those motions of the vessel itself are actually increased. Further simulations show that the stiffness of the earth-fixed wire and the losses occurring due to wire-sheave interaction determine the performance for a large part. Although the overall performance of the system can be considered promising, additional research is needed to confirm whether earth-fixed heave compensation can be competitive relative to existing passive and active heave compensation systems with a performance of 80% to 95%. Also, it is recommended that the behavior of the system for different sea states is investigated. Sensitivity analyses already show that shorter wave periods result in a significant drop in performance. The vessel heading seems to have a limited influence on the performance of the heave compensator.","Heave Compensation; Offshore Technology; Wind Turbine; RNA Installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

These effects make delivering the dose to the target challenging. In this project the biological effects of breathing interplay for proton therapy treatments of lung tumors has been investigated. Interplay dose distributions of two patients were calculated based on two planning approaches: The 4-Dimensional Computed Tomography (4DCT) and Internal Target Volume (ITV) approach including multiple repaintings. With the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) and Lyman Kutcher Burman (LKB) models, probabilities of successfully controlling the tumor (TCP) and complication in the normal tissue (NTCP) are calculated. All dose distributions are scaled to adjust for fractionation and varying values of uncertain LQ model parameters. Results show that the TCP correlates with dose homogeneity, tumor size and dose. Up until about 9 fractions, fractionation increases the TCP and decreases the NTCP significantly, whereafter the benefit of more fractions becomes minimal. The 4DCT plan approach turned out to result in more favorable biological outcomes than the ITV plan approach. This project gives a basic idea of the biological effects of breathing interplay, for which the large uncertainties in the LQ model parameters must be further investigated.","Proton Therapy; Interplay; Cancer treatment; Radiation; Medical Physics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

For this purpose,the via points of the Gait2392 model are optimized to matchmuscle moment arms of the Rajagopal2015 model and otherexperimentally obtained muscle moment arms. The results showthat muscles that can be represented by straight lines, can beoptimized well. More complex muscles that contribute to multi-degree of freedom movements, are still improved, but to aless extent. The main benefit of the optimized model, is thatthe compatution time of human motion simulation is greatlyimproved, making it a viable option to pre-train neuromuscularcontrollers, which can be further fine-tuned with the morecomplex models. To further improve musculoskeletal models ingeneral, more data on muscle moment arms is needed, especiallyfor muscles that contribute to multiple joints and movements inmultiple planes of motion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A century-and-a-half later, we have succeeded to the degree that we are looking for a way to relax in our automobiles. The MEDIATOR project tackles the transitional period between conventional automobiles and fully autonomous vehicles. The challenge that arose with this transition is that the vehicle has to be designed for both driving and not driving. This graduation project tackles the very bit that most people will get to know: how to interact with the machine to divide the power of control? And how do we keep re-establishing that balance? The act of changing control between the human driver and the automation as a driver is to perform a Control Transfer Ritual. With little collected information, this project started with an intensive 45 days of gathering information about interaction between man and machine. The knowledge in fields of feedback, automation levels, input possibilities, legislation, and acceptance by all parties involved combined formed the basis upon which the Control Transfer Rituals were designed. The Control Transfer Rituals differ based on urgency of the situation, the target and original level of automation , and, in case of MEDIATOR, who instigated the transfer. This led to the development of a total of eleven distinctly different Control Transfer Rituals, and the exploration of Minimal Risk Manoeuvres. To validate the effectiveness and usability of these designed rituals, a simulator was developed. This simulator uses the C,MM,N prototype vehicle as a base and consists of a dashboard, with integrated controls, a virtual environment built in Unity, and a dummy Decision Logic, the computing unit of the MEDIATOR project. The prototype allows people to experience how travel will be in the not so distant future. Furthermore, the MEDIATOR project will be able to use it as a base for oncoming development, to ensure that your future travels will be ever more comfortable and safe.","Automated Vehicles; Control Transfer; CTR; Control Transfer Rituals; Rituals; Automotive; Automated; Vehicles; take-over request; Master thesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); van Erp, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Policymaking regarding Artificial Intelligence is threatened to lag behind, and the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security stated its desire to catch up. The longer we wait, the wider the ‘gap’ will become between regulation and market development. In order to keep AI technology beneficial, a human-centered design approach should be key not only in AI development, but also in policy development. Instead of focussing on ‘what is possible’, we need to empathize with stakeholders to unravel the latent needs that define the public values of today. Along with the unfamiliarity of AI technology and its unpredictable consequences, this calls for a transition towards an agile government. This transition represents a shift from ‘assuming’ to ‘learning by doing’, from ‘is it safe?’ to ‘is it safe to fail?’, and from 'reactive' to 'proactive' policymaking. This thesis proposes proactive policymaking as a creative, iterative and future-oriented exploration. AI experiments should be framed as a priority vehicle for organizational learning. Experiments are used to empathize and unravel its desirability early in the process. Policy Provotypes and Minimum Viable Policies are created as first feedback loops prior to current feasibility studies. An ‘Desirability panel’, covering the experiences of a representative group of society, reduces blind spots and offers transparency. It facilitates short-line communication and alignment. Potential policy interventions transcend theoretical discussion as the demonstrated experiments provide a context for detailed dialogue. Policymaking will be less affected by the media's magnifying glass as stakeholder inclusion is at the heart of policy development. This vision calls for the need of a Creative, Empathic, Transparent, Inclusive, Future-oriented, Iterative, Experience-driven and Demonstrative approach. Therefore I present the acronym: CERTIFIED. The CERTIFIED approach covers a theoretical framework for agile policymaking. In essence, it is about the ability to adapt quickly by providing a window for feedback by the public early-on in the process and embracing criticism as a valuable gift. An iterative design process led to (1) the creation of the CERTIFIED Manifesto for the ministry, that publicly declares the needed transition mindset, and (2) a practical toolkit to offer policymakers an actionable way to carry out the first steps. The toolkit resembles a low barrier to demystify the desirability of AI application scenarios with a representative group of society. This toolkit contains a Perspectives card deck and a set of 6 canvases. The card deck includes 15 stakeholder cards to empathize with their values, roles, concerns and power. The canvases guide the panel in the steps of Design Thinking and capture the insights from the dialogue. A final toolkit pilot with representative stakeholders of the Quadruple helix showed a cross-fertilization of knowledge and expertise resulting in the ability to identify their blind spots and to formulate a ‘Minimum Viable Policy’ and test set-up to validate their assumptions. This research concludes that if space is provided for proactive policy experimentation, this would give policymakers momentum to reflect on the long-term goals instead of the issues of the day. Thus, offering a way towards becoming an adaptive government.","Policy Development; CERTIFIED; regulatory framework; proactive; transition design; systemic design; Human-Centered Design; Manifesto; Toolkit; Agile","en","master thesis","","","","","","Introducing part of the research during INNOvember, a conference organized for and on behalf of the entire government: https://vimeo.com/476623859#t=870s","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Frecker, MI (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The manufacturing freedom of additive manufacturing, and design freedom of topology optimization have proven to be a fruitful combination in creating and manufacturing designs. While research into applications of metal additive manufacturing has advanced from rapid prototyping to end-use components, metal additive manufacturing of compliant mechanisms has only been researched to a limited amount. This is despite the fact that additive manufacturing provides opportunities to manufacture highly advanced, monolithic compliant mechanism considered impossible before. Important considerations regarding geometry during additive manufacturing of compliant mechanisms are what minimum length scale and angle between overhanging features and build plate (the overhang angle) need to be imposed on the design. These considerations determine whether a compliant mechanism is successfully built by additive manufacturing and can ensure that designs are self-supporting. Since these constraints are most relevant in fragile hinge regions of compliant mechanisms where support material removal is unwanted, self-supporting, cross-axis flexural pivots are manufactured using selective laser melting. It is found manufacturability in additive manufacturing does not necessarily guarantee a predictable stiffness and yield strength of these flexural pivots. That is why it is recommended to print self-supporting regions of compliant mechanisms with a minimum length scale 25% greater than prescribed by the manufacturing process used and an overhang angle of at least 5 degrees greater than the prescribed minimum overhang angle. Next, these recommendations are implemented in compliant mechanism design using topology optimization, at locations where these recommendations are most relevant. This is done by redesigning hinge regions of compliant mechanisms, using static condensation to reduce the order of the problem. While adding only 5% extra computation time, small regions of a design can be redesigned successfully. To use the potential of this method fully, an extension to this method is introduced, which allows to redesign domains in more detail. Multi-point constraints are used to couple the original and finer redesign mesh. For a finer mesh, more computation time is needed, but as the design space is enlarged, other, more optimal solutions are found. Next, constraints on overhang angle, minimum length scale and stress are implemented, since these constraints are proven to be meaningful in hinge regions by the experiments with the cross-axis flexural pivots. Implementation is done successfully, and it is seen compliant mechanisms can be designed at relatively low additional computational cost and with minimal loss of mechanism performance. Thus, using this approach, redesigned compliant mechanisms can be manufactured with locally self-supporting hinges and predictable kinematics and stress concentrations can be ensured.","Compliant mechanism; topology optimization; additive manufacturing; Metal Additive Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

(mentor); Akyildiz, A.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","b>Introduction:</b> Carotid atherosclerosis is characterized by the build-up of the so-called plaque tissue in the wall of the carotid artery. The rupture of carotid plaques can lead to acute manifestations, including ischemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The mechanism responsible for rupture is not yet unravelled, complicating the medical management of the disease. There are indications that plaque morphology plays a role in plaque rupture risk. Previous histopathological studies found that ruptured plaques and non-ruptured plaques tend to differ in their structural composition. These studies did not perform a detailed analysis of the local plaque features at the rupture sites, even though this might increase the insight in the rupture event. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the relation between local plaque composition and rupture in carotid plaques. <b>Methods:</b> Digitized histological sections of 21 ruptured carotid endarterectomy samples (obtained from fourteen different patients) were segmented for the following nine tissue structures: cholesterol crystals,plaque, calcium, necrotic core, fresh haemorrhage, foam cells, neovessels, macrophages and old haemorrhage. The rupture site on the sections was identified as a luminal disruption in the presence of red blood cells. The digitized sections were then divided into 8 bins (pie slices), resulting in a total of 168 bins (21 sections x eight bins). Of these observations, 23 contained rupture, whereas the other 145 were rupture-free. The plaque area in each bin was measured and the other tissue structure sizes were calculated relative to the plaque area in the bin. Spatial heatmaps demonstrated the location of the tissue structures relative to the rupture site. They were created for the three variables cholesterol crystals, calcium and macrophages, as these tissue structures were often recognized close to the rupture sites. Kendall Tau-b correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the relation between tissue structures in close proximity. The two-sided clustered Wilcoxon rank sum test (with clusters at the patient level) was used to investigate differences between the composition of ruptured and non-ruptured bins. Additionally, the association of tissue structures with rupture was tested by a generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression model (working correlation matrix:independence). Clusters were assigned at the patient level. A sensitivity analysis was carried out (using 2-,4- and 16-bins) to determine the effect of the bin size on the outcome of the statistical analyses. <b>Results:</b> Visual analysis demonstrated that ruptures tended to extend to (or start at) areas of calcification or cholesterol crystals and that the rupture sites could be markedly inflamed. The spatial heatmaps showed that areas of calcification were closer to the rupture sites than areas with cholesterol crystals. Moreover, the prevalence of macrophages near the rupture sites was lower when compared to the prevalence of calcium and cholesterol crystals. In ruptured bins, the strongest tissue structure correlation was found between calcium and cholesterol crystals (tau_b= -0.44, p ≤ 0.05). This correlation was less evident when ruptured and non-ruptured bins were analysed together (tau_b= -0.07, p &gt; 0.05). The clustered Wilcoxon rank sum tests howed that calcium (p=0.05) and fresh haemorrhage (p=2.17x10-11) tended to take on higher values in the ruptured bins, when compared to the non-ruptured bins. Lastly, with the GEE logistic regression model an association was found between rupture and the predictor variables calcium (p= 0.00094) and plaque (p=0.049).The odds ratio of rupture was 1.05 [1.02-1.07] for a plaque size increase of 0.34 mm2, if the other plaque characteristics in the bin were held fixed. The odds ratios of rupture belonging to plaque-bins that contained10% calcium and 50% calcium were 1.96 [1.60-2.40] and 3.01 [2.16-4.20], respectively, relative to plaque-bins with 0% calcium content and equal other plaque characteristics in the bin. The sensitivity analysis showed that the choice for an 8-bin approach was reasonable. <b>Conclusion.</b> The rupture sites of the carotid sections showed an enhanced calcium content. Moreover, the calcium content and the plaque size showed to be significantly associated with plaque rupture. The developmental progress of non-invasive imaging techniques, using magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, is promising for the characterization of carotid plaques in vivo. Understanding the relation between plaque composition and plaque rupture at a local level can contribute to rupture risk assessment and eventually to the medical management of atherosclerosis.","Atherosclerosis; Plaque Components; Rupture; Statistical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The increasing digitalization of business processes makes employees more productive, lowers costs for firms, reduces the environmental footprint of the companies, and improves the quality of services. While born-digital companies built their business process around digital opportunities by default, many large traditional companies are lagging behind in digitalization. This work aims to raise awareness of the opportunities of the digital world for the employees of large pre-digital era companies. This study was conducted at Nutricia, the subsidiary of Danone, focusing explicitly on the Deployment team, which was treated as a service provider. This work tackles the digitalization problem by developing a serious game to be played by the company's employees. To design this game, the first activity was a systematic literature review conducted to investigate the earlier applications of serious games for digitalization in supply chains. This leads to the identification of a significant research gap, as it was concluded that no serious game was developed with the purpose of initiating business process digitalization in companies. This project builds on the design science approach in the context of digitalization. An artifact was developed based on requirements collected as the first step to reach the design objective. The list of requirements was obtained based on further literature studies about digitalization and background on gaming. After the literature review, a case study was conducted on the Deployment department of Nutricia that defines additional requirements for the game design. Initially, additional knowledge was collected about the company's organization and supply chain, followed by a focused analysis of the Deployment department's business processes. Second, a survey was conducted to assess the awareness of employees amongst six planners and the team lead. The outcome confirms the need for a serious game at Nutricia as employees find digitalization beneficial; however, they lack ideas on how to continue with the digital transformation of their process. Thus, it specifies the game's design objective: the aim is to raise awareness for employees on the digitalization opportunities at the company, including how to do it and how to benefit from it. Furthermore, the results can also support the process selection and function as data input for the game design process. The most suitable business process was selected for the game in terms of showing players the digitalization opportunities. The final game design, called DigiGame, consists of two phases. Players puzzle the business process from given building blocks in the first phase and digitalize it in phase two using the available technologies. Besides completing daily tasks, participants need to select a step of the business process they want to digitalize. Then, the player is shown a hint regarding the applicable technology, which is guessed by the other player based on the description given by the initiator. The digital maturity of the process is represented by a heat map and an overall digitalization level indicator. The game is won when all technologies have been applied. Five game sessions took place, with altogether ten employees from the company. A game session consisted of a short introduction, the gameplay, and a debriefing session. After the completion of all sessions, a collaborative debriefing session took place to discuss further insights with the whole team. The game sessions were evaluated qualitatively based on transcripts. The prepared documents were coded, categorized, and networks were created with the Atlas.ti software. DigiGame, the developed artifact, provided a solution for an open business need at Nutricia, resulting in the primary practical contribution of this work. Employees became more aware of the advantages of a digital business process and already started thinking about implementation details after discussing a conceptional implementation plan. Moreover, the game session contributed to the organizational learning at Nutricia. Considering the theoretical contributions, the research confirmed the results of earlier work regarding the high potential of using serious games for raising awareness. Additionally, it was proven that a game could provide a digital mindset and introduce the opportunities of digital transformation in a business context to non-IT-focused employees, providing answers to open questions introduced by multiple previous works. Overall, it can be concluded that DigiGame successfully raised awareness on the digitalization opportunities at Nutricia for most players. The game was most effective for players who had experience with the analyzed process. Some players acquired a digital mindset during the game session and considered other business processes for digitalization options. While inexperienced players obtained little knowledge about digitalization opportunities, they stated that they had learned a lot about the process itself. Notably, no previous work revealed similar observations. Thus, it can be concluded that the game sessions contributed to the development of the participants in a diverse way. The main limitation of the game is that in the current form, it is applicable to Nutricia's process only; however, it was designed keeping in mind simple adaptability to alternative business processes. Future research is proposed in the direction of a more general game that can be adopted easier to multiple companies. Additionally, evaluating the game on a larger sample is also the subject of interest.","Digitalization; Digital transformation; Serious Game; Serious Gaming; Qualitative analysis; Atlas.ti","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Förster, Lukas (mentor); Lottermoser, Bernd (graduation committee); Guerrero, Dr. Rodrigo Serna (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The aim of this master thesis is to improve a raw materials certification scheme by checking and validating the application matrix and the coherent hazards developed for the Certification of Raw materials (CERA) project. The scope of the original application matrix included exploration, mining, physical processing, chemical processing, smelting and refining. The validation in this thesis was focussed on the iron ore value chain. This validation showed that important methods associated with these processes were missing in the application matrix. Two main sections that are absent are recycling and storage and transportation, which have been added to the application matrix including the main methods used within those two sections. The risks and hazards developed by CERA, associated with the application matrix’s processes and methods, are transformed to only hazards. Next to this, new hazards are suggested to make the hazards list more holistically applicable. After the addition of recycling to the application matrix, an analysis on the addition of recycling to the CERA Performance Standard (CPS) and to the CERA Chain of Custody Standard (CCS) was done. This analysis showed that adding recycling to the Performance Standard deals with few challenges due to it being an industrial activity with many similarities to methods used in processing and smelting. Therefore, with the additions that are proposed in the validation of the matrix and the hazards analysis, recycling can be easily added to the CPS. This is done by including collection centres, recycling facilities and scrap transport in the standard under the general term ‘recycling facilities’. Adding recycled material to the CCS can be done in different ways, this thesis proposes multiple options of which three are viable. First, three types of recyclable materials have been distinguished: Recyclables of which the origin is known (1); Recyclables of which the origin is unknown and no further information is available (2); Recyclables of which the origin is unknown but a due diligence can show that it has sufficient added value to the raw materials value chain with regard to responsibility and sustainability (3). In all cases, CERA should include the certification of recycled material of which the origin is known. The first viable option is to only certify type one with the original CCS certificate and exclude the other two types from the scope. This requires no extra certification or requirements by CERA. The second viable option for CERA would be to also certify type three within the original CCS certification standard, and add a ‘recycled label’ to materials of type two. The third viable option would be for CERA to develop a ‘CCS recycled’ certificate for materials of the third type mentioned, and add a ‘recycled label’ to materials of type two. CERA should decide which option is best according to their basic criteria and values. If CERA decides to select option one, CERA safeguards their integrity but the option is lacking holistic applicability. If option two is preferred, CERA increases their holistic applicability level, however, the integrity of CERA might be at stake. If CERA decides to select option three, holistic applicability is maximized and their integrity is safeguarded, however, the system of CERA is complicated due to different levels of certifying.","Certification; Sustainability; raw materials; Recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.cera-standard.org/ The CERA Standard for Certifying Raw materials","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","Certification of Raw Materials","51.46223,7.05730"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","An increase in the intelligence of autonomous driving functionalities demands detailed analysis of the behaviour of traffic participants. This level of analysis requires datasets that accurately describe the movement of all objects in a specific scene. Recent developments in small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs) and drones introduce an interesting approach to extract this type of data: applying object detection and tracking methods to imagery captured by sUAVs/drones to extract kinematic parameters of traffic participants.<br/>Analysing the behaviour of vehicles in urban traffic has been the topic of research for many years. However, vehicle detection and tracking pipelines used in the proposed approaches lack the required accuracy in estimating a vehicle's orientation and contours. Vehicle detection methods used in recent approaches detect vehicles as Axis-aligned Bounding Boxes (ABBs) that contain no information about a vehicle's orientation and contours. Alternatively, vehicles could be detected as Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs) that do contain this information. For low-altitude aerial imagery, however, the amount of publicly available data to train methods using OBB detections is scarce.<br/>To fill the gap in data availability, this thesis introduces the novel `Axis-aligned to Oriented Bounding Boxes' methodology (A2OBB). Based on a non-linear least squares approximation of the geometrical relationship between an ABB and an OBB, A2OBB finds a set of OBB parameters that fit optimally in all provided ABBs. As such, A2OBB can be applied (1) as an enhancement tool to convert existing ABB annotations to OBBs or (2) as an extension to existing detection networks that perform detections in ABB format. This thesis contributes by formulating the novel A2OBB methodology and by performing a detailed analysis on its OBB reconstruction performance. In four experiments, an analysis is performed investigating the impact of two assumptions made in the proposed methodology on the reconstruction performance. The results of the experiments illustrate a sensitivity to: (1) a change in perspective between the observed vehicle and the camera, (2) a mismatch between the perceived shape of vehicles and the assumed rectangular shape and (3) the error introduced by the detection network (in the application of extending ABB detection networks). To reduce the impact of the shape mismatch, a correction factor is introduced that significantly improves the reconstruction performance. As such, A2OBB can be used to reconstruct OBBs from a set of manually annotated ABBs with a length and width approximation accurate within 5% and 15% of their respective ground-truths and an optimal orientation with an average error below 2.5°. Overall, manually annotated ABBs are converted to OBBs with an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 85%. Detections resulting from an in-house out-of-the-box implementation of a YOLOv3 network are reconstructed with a length and width bias of 4.5% and 10% of their respective ground-truth and with an orientation error below 5° but above 2.5°. Overall, the reconstructed OBBs for these detected ABBs have an IoU of 77%. <br/>Note that the orientations resulting from A2OBB’s reconstructions comprise one of four possible solutions. A subsequent step is required to find the correct version.","Traffic Behaviour Prediction; Oriented Object Detection; Annotation Enhancement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Extractive distillation with organic solvents as entrainers is one of the most commonly used separation techniques for azeotropic mixtures in the chemical industry. To reduce the large energy requirements, and the secondary pollution problems, both of which are associated with the use of organic solvents, the search for alternative entrainers has received much attention. Recently, deep eutectic solvents that are known as green and non-volatile components have been considered as entrainers for extractive distillation processes. However, research focuses mainly on vapour-liquid equilibrium measurements, and an economic comparison with the conventional organic solvents has not been done yet. This work investigates extractive distillation with deep eutectic solvents where a conceptual process design is carried out for the separation of ethanol and water, as well as isopropanol and water with the aid of Aspen Plus as process simulator. In order to fulfil the research aim of exploring whether deep eutectic solvents reduce both cost and overall energy consumption, first, a database for the investigated deep eutectic solvents is created. Based on the effect of the deep eutectic solvents on the vapour-liquid equilibrium, choline chloride:urea (1:2) and choline chloride:triethylene glycol (1:3) are chosen for the ethanol system and isopropanol system, respectively. Subsequently, different entrainer recycle alternatives are investigated, and a sensitivity analysis of the design variables is performed. For both systems, it is found that a series of two evaporators are the most economical entrainer regeneration option. Last, a consistent comparison of the final processes with the process using the conventional organic solvents and ionic liquids is carried out. The results show that the considered deep eutectic solvents are not only beneficial in terms characteristics such as biodegradability, toxicity and selectivity, but also regarding specific energy requirements and the total annual costs. The process using conventional organic solvents is improved by at least 20.1% from an energetical perspective and by a minimum of 16.6% from an economic perspective for both systems. The replacement of ionic liquids by deep eutectic solvents also results in an energy reduction of a minimum of 6%. The additional use of heat integration further improves the final processes by 8 to 10% with respect to specific energy requirements in steam and therefore reduces the carbon footprint. Finally, it is concluded that the extractive distillation using deep eutectic solvents outperforms the process using conventional organic solvents and ionic liquids in both separations; ethanol and water, and isopropanol and water.","Deep Eutectic Solvents; Extractive Distillation; Conceptual process design; Economic assessment; Energy Reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

It utilises a qualitative research approach, combining a literature review with case studies. EPR instruments are analysed using an institutional framework, consisting of several theories and concepts from (new) institutional economics. The instruments’ levels of circularity are assessed by analysing incentivised R-strategies, following the 9R model. Additionally, three EPR schemes in the Netherlands are described and studied using the institutional framework. By combining the results of these analyses, three barriers and five opportunities for heightening circularity of EPR schemes are distinguished. This thesis shows that EPR’s role in facilitating a transition could be more significant if it could overcome its high costs and inabilities to incentivise eco-design and realise higher R-strategies than recycling. By circumventing identified barriers and seizing opportunities, EPR can take a significant role in the transition to a CE.","Extended Producer Responsibility; EPR; Circular Economy; Circular Economic Transition; Circularity; Institutional Economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Due to high hydrodynamic loading, structures can enter the plastic regime, resulting possibly in structural failure. The understanding of the principles related to this structural failure due to waves is a key concept in this research. Due to a gap in existing literature, a simple approximation for the influence of plasticity on fluid-structure interaction is the first required step towards a better comprehension of structural failure of ship and offshore structures due to hydrodynamic loading. The choice is made to analyse a pendulum because of its ability to show clear and easy to interpret results, due to its few degrees of freedom. In an experiment, three different double pendulums are subjected to breaking waves created by dispersive focusing at three different locations in front of the pendulum. The top hinge of the pendulum is a normal hinge and the bottom hinge is a friction hinge that approximates plastic behaviour in a mechanical manner. The energy dissipated in the friction hinge, modelling plastic energy, and the energy transferred from the wave to the structure, called `total absorbed energy', decrease with increasing frictional torque. This means that when a structure allows for more plastic deformation, the energy that will be absorbed in total by the pendulum is larger. The energy transferred to the double pendulum shows more variability for the wave focused furthest away from the pendulum. A reduced-order model is constructed that can help explain the behaviour of the different pendulums.","Fluid-structure interaction; Plasticity; Breaking wave impact; Experimental investigation; Reduced-order model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Optimizing supply chain management in hospitals can lead to a significant reduction in costs. One of the supply chain processes that can be optimized is the sterilization of reusable instruments used during surgical procedures. This process takes place at the Central Sterile Supply Department (CSSD) and consists of two main steps, `washing and disinfection' and `sterilization'. These steps are executed by batch processing machines, with a setup time prior to each step. The setup at each stage is executed manually. The machines of a CSSD are renewed every 10 years, which provides a opportunity to assess all capacity planning decisions. In this thesis, the aim is to determine the required resources of the CSSD, while minimizing the total costs and guarantying the availability of instruments for scheduled surgeries. Costs include: acquiring machines, machine batch costs, machine maintenance costs, and staff costs depending on the number of opening hours. This thesis contributes to current research by proposing a framework for the capacity planning decisions at a CSSD, by extending existing models by taking specific characteristics of the CSSD into account, and considering a new objective function, namely minimizing the total costs. Capacity planning decisions are considered on three hierarchical levels. First, the strategic level involves long-term decisions, where the number and type of required machines have to be determined. Second, on a tactical level, the amount of opening time has to be determined. Third, on an operational level, the instrument sets have to be scheduled within batches and machines. The sterilization process is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem (MILP). The problem is described as a multi-stage hybrid flow shop with additional constraints to represent the specific characteristics of the CSSD. This model takes into account capacity planning decisions on all three levels. The MILP formulation is proven to be NP-hard. The demand for sterilized instruments is determined from historical data from the Leiden University Medical Center. To evaluate the model, three instances with a timespan of a week are created. Preliminary results showed that the multi-stage flow shop is difficult to solve for real-life instances. Hence, a decomposition, based on the three hierarchical levels, is proposed. The decomposition leads to three levels of optimization models. The strategic model takes into account the scheduling of instruments per day, while the tactical model schedules per day parts, and the operational models determine a specific point in time. The proposed models are individually tested on their performance. The results from the strategic model are used as input for the tactical model. Results show that the strategic model underestimated the required amount of opening time, as it does not take into account the spread of release times. Furthermore, the computational results show that the tactical and operational models are difficult to solve for real-life instances. Hence, a heuristic approach is proposed by forming a chain of the models. The best results were obtained by setting a minimum amount of opening time for the strategic model and using the resulting machines as input for the tactical model. The results show that the instrument sets are equally spread over the week. To conclude, the results of this thesis contribute to quantifying the required resources for a sterilization process within a hospital. However, to obtain more practical results, future research is required. Suggestions for future research include: taking uncertainties within the process into account, the application of metaheuristics, and the required number of employees.","CSSD; Resources; Decomposition heuristic; Cost minimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Therefore, a novel, cheap and safe aqueous SSRFB design is introduced based on iron- and manganese hydroxide materials. This design was subsequently tested in the lab through which it was concluded that it is not possible to effectively make a SSRFB based on FeOOH and Mn(OH)2 semi-solid electrode (“SSE”) suspensions. Systematic proof is provided on how this can be attributed to the specific combination of the active materials in the highly alkaline environment, but that in itself, both the tested SSRFB configuration and SSE suspensions are functional. On the one hand, a complex chemical system of the active species consisting of multiple thermodynamic equilibria had the consequence that the open circuit voltage (“OCV”) had a very low value of 0.2 V instead of the expected 0.63 V. On the other hand, it was shown that both the FeOOH and the Mn(OH)2 SSE suspension could be separately cycled versus respectively a solid zinc and copper electrode and that a cheap microfiltration membrane suffices in the design of a SSRFB (on the condition that ionic active species are not apparent in the system). In sum, this research demonstrates that the SSRFB by its very nature is a suitable battery technology in which cheap and safe materials can be used for large-scale energy storage. However, that the combination and optimization of the right active materials in the right environment proves to be fundamental for proper operation and is in fact a complex balance between electric and ionic conductivity, colloidal stability, viscosity and (electro)chemical stability.","semi-solid redox flow battery; semi-solid electrode suspensions; iron hydroxide; manganese hydroxide; semi solid redox flow battery; aqueous semi-solid redox flow battery; aqueous semi-solid electrode suspensions; large-scale battery storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (graduation committee); Klijn, F. (graduation committee); te Nijenhuis, Anouk (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Rivers provide many of our day-to-day needs. They allow, for instance, the production of drinking water and the movement of goods via inland waterways. However, river systems experience disturbances, such as droughts and pollution plumes. These disturbances can impair the functioning of river systems and their ability to provide the desired functions and services. Since some of these disturbances have very little impact while other cause many problems, it is important to determine how a river system handles different disturbances. Resilience is often used to indicate and assess the behaviour of systems with regard to disturbances. Using the concept of resilience with regard to river systems can help determine how well river systems handle disturbances. In order to determine how resilient a river system is, a method to assess the resilience of river systems is needed. Research into the resilience of river systems has only been done with regard to flood resilience. This resilience does not consider other disturbances, such as droughts, and therefore does not represent the full resilience of the system. Furthermore, this research often resulted in suggestions and pointers to create and improve resilience, but not in a clear method to help assess it. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a method to assess the resilience of river systems. In order to create this method several questions need to answered. First, a clear definition of resilience of river systems is needed. For this it should first be determined what resilience is. This is done using a literature study. The first part of this literature study focussed on general and field-specific definitions of resilience. This resulted in the definition of resilience of river systems as used in this study: the resilience of a river system is the ability of the system to continue functioning during a disturbance. Where continuation of functioning is defined as the continued achievement of the goal of a certain function, such as the continued production of crops for the function of agriculture, even if this only occurs to a smaller extent, and the continued shipping of goods for the function of shipping. The disturbances considered are short-term disturbances, such as droughts and pollution plumes. After the determination of the definition of resilience of river systems several remaining questions need to be answered. The impact of disturbances on the different river system functions has to be determined and visualised. Next, the impact of these disturbances has to be classified. Finally, the resilience of river systems should be assessed using the classification for the impact of these disturbances. The second part of the literature study, focussing on the assessment of resilience, is used to help determine, visualise and classify the impact of disturbances. The development of the final method is an iterative process between application to a case study and the amendment of the method based on this application. Using the results of the literature study, a first design of the resilience assessment approach, the method for the assessment of resilience of river systems, was made. This approach consists of four steps with several sub steps. In the first step a system overview is created. This step is based on the ideas of flood resilience theory. It states how a system overview should be created, what external factors, characteristics and functions should be included and how to categorise them. The second step consists of the creation of disturbance-impact graphs for the different functions and disturbances. These graphs, based on the idea of stressor-response graphs of system robustness analyses, are used to visualise the impact of the disturbances. The third step gives an assessment of the resilience of a function based on the disturbance-impact graphs and a resilience classification with associated scoring system, which is based on the ideas of a current impact classification used for droughts. The fourth and final step consists of the assessment of the resilience of the entire river system based on the assessment of the individual functions. The approach was applied to a case study, the Meuse river system, to test it. This case study focussed on low discharges caused by droughts. The approach was applied to the whole system, thus to all its characteristics (water quality, water quantity, vegetation and fauna and sediment) and all its functions (shipping, electricity, industry, drinking water production, agriculture, flood protection and recreation), to create a system overview (the first step of the approach). The application focussed specifically on the functions shipping and drinking water production. This application was used to check the content and applicability of the sub steps of the first step of the approach, using the system overview, and to check the content, applicability and order of the sub steps of the second step of the approach, using the functions shipping and drinking water production. The application of the system overview led to a clear distinction between external factors, characteristics and functions, which has been adopted in step 1. Furthermore, the application to the specific functions resulted in a clearer definition of system boundaries and a clearer link between the external factors and the disturbance. Finally, the application led to an additional sub step. This sub step consists of a check to determine whether the chosen disturbance is actually relevant for that specific function. The application of the approach showed that both shipping and drinking water production of the Meuse river system appear to be very resilient with regard to low discharges due to droughts. This is likely due to fact that both functions have already been adapted to this disturbance. For shipping this is likely largely due to the fact that the water level in the Julianakanaal is managed to ensure continued shipping possibilities during discharge fluctuations. Pumping facilities have been constructed in order to maintain water levels even when very small discharges occur. The large resilience of the drinking water production by Waterleiding Maatschappij Limburg is likely largely due to the fact that the intake point is located in the Lateraalkanaal. The water level of this canal is managed using weir and sluices for shipping and drinking water production. Only the first two steps of the approach have been tested using the case study. The final version of these steps, as found in this report, can be used in practice. The tested steps have shown to be applicable to the tested functions and it assumed that these steps are also applicable to the other functions. The third and fourth step should be tested before they are used in practice. Especially step 3a (the assignment of the different levels of the resilience classification to the disturbance-impact graphs) might require additional adaptation.","Resilience; Rivers; Assessment; Assessment method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This analysis shows that supersonic aircraft will be unlikely to meet the subsonic airport noise regulations. The reason for this is that optimisation for supersonic flight inevitably results in changes that produce more noise compared to subsonic aircraft. The sonic boom noise level of future supersonic transport aircraft can be greatly reduced compared to the levels of Concorde by optimising the aircraft’s shape. However, this will result in increased drag, fuel burn and weight.

The availability of lunar regolith will allow to manufacture such in space habitats and reduce the cost of space missions. However, the Moon has specific environmental characteristics that are different compared to terrestrial habitats: meteoroids impacts, high cosmic radiation level and high temperature gradient, etc. <br/><br/>Functionally graded materials (FGM) are high-performance composite materials, featuring such advantages as localized tailoring of material properties, improved interfacial boundary compatibility, and enhanced thermomechanical behaviour. Much of the current in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) manufacturing research explores additive manufacturing (AM) of as-received regolith, with some consideration given to metal alloys extracted in-situ. This study combines these two aspects by investigating the feasibility of in-situ manufactured metallic-regolith FGMs. <br/><br/>In this study three regolith simulant powders were first characterized based on their similarity with the actual lunar regolith and then assessed further for their AM processability. Digital Light Processing (DLP), Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) and laser scanning, were selected due to their compatibility with metallic-ceramic processing in a space environment. The chosen AM techniques were first assessed on their capability to effectively consolidate regolith alone, before progressing to AM of regolith directly onto metallic substrates. <br/><br/>The powder characterisation proved that all three simulants have composition and particle size distribution close to the ones of the actual lunar regolith. Powders are composed of plagioclase, pyroxene and iron titanium oxide. Dense regolith samples were successfully shaped with DLP and subsequently consolidated with Spark Plasma Sintering at 1050 °C under 80 MPa with crushed lunar regolith simulant. Optimized processing conditions based on the sintering temperature, initial powder particle size and different compositions in the lunar regolith powders were identified. The reduction of the particle size proved to be the most significant factor to obtain a good densification. <br/><br/>Additive manufacturing was then studied as a potential technique to manufacture functionally graded materials combining the properties of the lunar regolith and metals (Ti6Al4V and 316L). The combination of lunar regolith and Ti6Al4V was found as the most promising. The hardness profile showed a gradual transition between the two layers and the interface was found to be strong and without any cracking or delamination. Furthermore, interesting segregation effects at the interface regions were observed and investigated in this work.<br/><br/>Additionally, results from this study indicate that laser-based additive manufacturing techniques could be a feasible method for application of FGM coatings, which presents a topic for further study focused on wear, corrosion and thermal resistant in-situ resource coatings.<br/><br/>While the current study showed that it is feasible to AM FGMs from lunar regolith, further developments of a fully optimized method have the potential to produce tailored, high-performance materials in an off-earth manufacturing setting, for the production of aerospace, robotic, or architectural components.<br","Lunar regolith; additive manufacturing; functionally graded materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this globalized and industrialized food system cannot be sustained in the next eras, because of its high contribution to biodiversity loss, the emission of greenhouse gasses and the fast decrease of soil health. System change is needed to move our food system to one that can feed the world population without compromising our future generations. Short food supply chains (SFSCs) could contribute to this system change as they increase consumer awareness, promise a better price for the farmer and as such create room for more sustainable farming approaches. To increase the amount of short food chains in the Netherlands, this thesis project focuses on equipping SFSC entrepreneurs to overcome one or more of the main barriers they face when creating such a chain. A literature study, interviews and observations uncover that the most important challenges are faced in the phase of scaling-up. The one-on-one contact between food producer and consumer is no longer viable in this phase due to the rising amount of customers. Meanwhile, consumer research shows that this direct contact with the producer is crucial in meeting the specific consumer needs that are fulfilled when buying in a SFSC. In conclusion, the challenge of creating a customer experience in which the consumer feels close to its food- and producer, whilst having indirect consumer-producer contact, is defined as this projects’ design focus. To find a tangible solution to this challenge a case study with De Nieuwe Melkboer is set up. This Dutch soy milk initiative has just launched its first product and is facing the abovementioned challenge. A creative and collaborative approach has led to a design solution for De Nieuwe Melkboer: every purchase counts - a customer experience to create awareness by involving consumers in the impact of their food choices. Instead of selling a bottle of milk, a bottle of positive impact is sold as the front of the label only states ‘deze aankoop telt’ – this purchase matters; it counts. An online service is created in which the consumer can decide to what positive impact project their purchase should contribute. Offering this choice will create a feeling of inclusion and build understanding the impact that growing and processing soy has on our planet and society. The consumer will be notified once the positive impact is realized and thus stays included and gets a tangible image of the impact that his food choices have. To share the insights of this research with SFSC entrepreneurs a handout has been created. It provides an overview of consumer wishes when buying in a short food chain and includes three questions that SFSC entrepreneurs should ask themselves to better respond to consumer needs. All in all, it is one step forward in better equipping short food chain entrepreneurs to take on the challenge of scaling up their initiative.","Short food supply chain; Consumer awareness; Consumer involvement; Food literacy; Food System; Sustainable food","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In an underwater environment, this becomes difficult, as electromagnetic waves dampen out fast. As a solution often acoustic waves are used to perform localization. Because of the complexity of underwater acoustic propagation, an acoustic propagation model is used of which the predicted output for different candidate locations is compared to the measurements. Methods to localize low-frequency sound sources with widely spaced receivers have been thoroughly studied in literature. More recently, also for high-frequency sources and receivers with a line-array structure successful localization has been demonstrated. In this thesis, the typical methods used to achieve this are gathered and typical challenges of these methods are identified. Based on these challenges, a new method is proposed, in an attempt to reduce the effects caused by these challenges and thus improve the localization performance. Also, Gibbs sampling is used to perform Bayesian inversion on the localization problem and simultaneously estimate environmental parameters. The results show that a high-frequency acoustic source at a range of 1500-2000m in an ocean environment with a depth of ∼ 200 meters can be localized by using the proposed method, including an accurately estimated tilt of the receiver array.","ocean; localization; model-based; acoustic; acoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These sources can be unpredictable with regard to energy production and therefore energy storage has become a major concern. A promising technique, Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS), converts excess energy into hydrogen and stores it underground, after which, by reversing the process, the stored energy can be used when the imbalance between supply and demand is great. Hydrogen storage in salt caverns is particularly attractive because of their high sealing capacity, low amount of cushion required, the inert nature of rock salt and high possible injection and withdrawal rates. For energy storage purposes, these salt caverns are exposed to different cyclic loading conditions during operation, resulting in variations in stress in and around the cavern. Investigation of the mechanical response of rock salt under cyclic loading conditions is essential for the safety assessment and usability of the cavern. The response of the system to varying loading conditions can be mainly divided into two groups, either time-dependent or stress-dependent. The main focus of this thesis is to record the stress-dependent behaviour of rock salt under varying loading conditions. More specifically, it focuses on nonlinearity that occurs due to viscoplasticity. This phenomenon can be described as the rate dependent<br/>behaviour of a material that occurs when a material exceeds a certain stress level, after which irreversible deformation occurs. This thesis describes the development of a 2D FEM (finite element method) simulator on an unstructured grid that captures the mechanical response. To model the stress-dependent behaviour, the viscoplastic model proposed by Desai is used. This model is<br/>based on the non-associated flow rule and takes into account material dilatancy and compressibility. In addition, the model allows for hardening, the tensile strength of rock salt and variation in yield behaviour with pressure variation. Sonar data from cavern EPE S43 is utilised to test the simulator. This case showed that irreversible deformation occurs as a result of the stress-dependent behaviour of rock salt. For this specific cavern, the total working volume of the cavern decreased roughly by 0.0003% over three operating cycles, indicating that viscoplastic deformation itself does not pose significant risks to the cyclic storage of hydrogen in salt caverns.","Hydrogen storage; Rock Salt; Underground hydrogen storage; Mechanical behaviour; numerical simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The production of heavy oil from reservoirs requires much more effort than the production of lighter oils. This is due to the fact that this heavy oil has a significantly higher viscosity; namely, typically a factor 10 to 10000 more viscous than water. This higher viscosity makes the transport through pipes less economically viable due to the enormous pressure drop in the pipe. An interesting way to reduce this pressure drop is by creating core annular flow, which is a two phase flow where the less viscous fluid forms an annulus around the viscous fluid. This significantly reduces the pressure drop in comparison to single phase oil flow. This research focuses on determining the water hold-up in lab experiments of core-annular flow in a horizontal pipe. With the water hold-up and the water cut also the so-called hold-up ratio is known, which is a measure for the oil-water slip. The experiments were conducted for a constant oil flow rate of 0.35 l/s in horizontal pipe with 21 mm diameter. Different water cuts (10 to 20%) and oil/water viscosity ratios (600, 3000) were measured. To determine the water hold-up, the area of the pipe which is occupied by water (or oil) is required. In order to do this the flow is visualised with a high speed camera. Due to the difference in refractive index of the different media that the light has to travel through to eventually reach the lens of the camera, some optical distortion is encountered, which has to be corrected for. The correction procedure was done through a ray tracing analysis which produced a calibration curve that could deduce the actual position of the oil-water interface from the recorded movie. From the temporal and spatial movement of the oil-water interface the waves on this surface were analysed: wave length, wave frequency, wave speed. This was done through applying an autocorrelation function to the interface data. Besides the flow visualisation (to determine the water hold-up and wave characteristics), a pressure transducer was used to measure the pressure drop over a one metre long section of the pipe. The flow visualisation proved that for low water cuts (10%) the hold-up ratio is significantly higher than that for the higher water cuts (15% and 20%). This means that there is relatively more water accumulation and therefore more oil-water slip when the water cut is reduced. The waves on the interface become longer and the frequency becomes lower with an increasing water cut resulting in an almost constant wave speed. To see the effect of a lower viscosity the temperature of the oil was increased from 20 C to 40 C (which decreases the oil-water dynamic viscosity ratio from 3000 to 600). This did not have a noticeable effect on the water hold-up. However, the wave length decreased and the frequency increased which still resulted in a similar wave speed. The results from the experiment have been compared to CFD simulations carried out by PhD candidate Haoyu Li. Interestingly the CFD simulation gives a pressure drop which is roughly 30% lower than the values measured during the experiment. The measured water hold-up fraction is 0.257, whereas the CFD simulation gives 0.255; however, the oil/water interface determined by the simulation is not in agreement with the experimentally recorded interface. The wave frequency given by the CFD simulation is half that which is recorded during the experiment, while the wave length given by the CFD simulation is twice that which is recorded during the experiment. These differences between the CFD simulation and the experiment still lead to an almost equal wave speed.","Core annular flow; Hold-up fraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

Our bodies are predetermined by our DNA and co-shaped by our environment. This leads to most of the world's population having a discrepancy in leg length either from birth or developed during their life time. It is completely natural and goes unnoticed, as changes are incremental and people get used to it. On the contrary, when undergoing total hip replacement surgery and waking up with one leg longer than the other, the change is almost instantaneous and immediately noticeable. Current surgical solutions do not address this issue in a practical manner within the operating theatre, leading to surgical teams developing their own methods and procedures to evaluate the change in patient's leg length.<br/>  <br/>Introducing new workflows to medical professionals often entails neglecting the protocols they spent years practicing. This thesis identified this bottleneck and instead of introducing new methods and procedures, it was decided to build on existing ones.

NanoSat laser communication terminal (LCT) promises 1 Gbps data downlink capabilities. However, LEO to ground free space optical data transmission requires precision attitude knowledge under agile ground target tracking conditions. Under such stringent operational conditions, the calibration of gyro-stellar misalignment and scale factors is a well-established practice for traditional satellites. Nevertheless, the impact of such non-idealities in the context of MEMS gyro-stellar based NanoSat precision pose estimation is unclear. Furthermore, the gyro-stellar calibration performance that can be achieved with NanoSat ADCS system requires further investigation. Under agile operational conditions, slew rate induced star tracker drop-out is common for NanoSats, which limits the operational envelope of agile precision tracking missions. To increase our understanding of attitude knowledge estimation capability of today's NanoSats, this thesis work is extended at Hyperion Technologies. In collaboration with Hyperion Technologies, gyro-stellar sensors are characterised; and CubeCAT LCT is used to laydown the reference payload and mission requirements of an agile precision terrestrial target tracking NanoSat mission. Based on state steady noise PSD properties, and attitude knowledge requirements set by the LCT, gyro-stellar configurations are selected, and characterised. A rigid body attitude simulator is developed, considering the characterised sensor suite, to generate representative nominal and non-ideal sensor outputs under four different mission phases: 1.) Inertial pointing with no angular rate, 2.) Non-harmonic sinusoidal manoeuvres 3.) Agile precision ground target tracking and 4.) Inertial target tracking with non-zero angular rate. Reaction-wheel time delay and torque limits are evaluated to analyse the feasibility of attitude pointing requirements under agile target tracking conditions. Due to favourable properties of robustness to large initialisation errors, fast convergence, and preservation of attitude quaternion unity norm constraint; UnScented QUaternion Estimator (USQUE) variant of UKF based filter is synthesised for attitude estimation. The USQUE filter is further extended to facilitate the calibration of gyro-stellar misalignment and scale factors. It is demonstrated that the presence of gyro-stellar misalignment and scale factor, and star tracker occultation under agile slew rates significantly deteriorates the attitude estimation performance of USQUE based attitude estimator. Star tracker misalignments and dropouts are observed to have a significantly larger impact on the attitude knowledge estimation performance, when compared against MEMS rate-gyro scale factor and misalignment. Degraded MEMS rate gyro sensors are observed to have little impact on the attitude knowledge estimation performance of 6/7 state USQUE filter. However, it has a considerable impact on the convergence performance of star tracker misalignment calibration. More persistent calibration manoeuvres are observed to improve the star tracker misalignment parameter estimation performance. Gyro misalignment and scale factor calibration objectives were not met. A root-cause analysis showed that the signal distortions introduced by such non-idealities are below the gyro-stellar noise floor. Calibration filter synthesised has the potential to improve autonomy, reduce commissioning and ground calibration times, and enhance NanoSat pose estimation performance.","ADCS; AOCS; Agile spacecraft; Attitude Estimation; Calibration; CubeSat; Gyroscope; Laser Communication Terminal; MEMS devices; Misalignment; NanoSat; Navigation; Pose estimation; Scale factor; Sensor fusion; Star tracker; Target tracking; UKF; USQUE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-18","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","iADCS-400",""

In particular, the continuously increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is a major concern among the scientific community. This paved the way for an intense research of CO2 emissions mitigating technologies. Those ones including carbon capture, storage and utilisation are seen as part of the solution for this global problem. In this framework, Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF), a startup company located in Delft (The Netherlands) set the ambitious goal of developing a micro process plant producing methanol from ambient air and sunlight only. Part of the process involves direct capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (direct air capture) with the use of a pure tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) absorbent. ZEF sets itself aside from the rest of the industry developing an absorber which collects CO2 with no support structure by continuously flowing TEPA inside open channels. Previous research shows how this approach brings limitations connected to slowly diffusing CO2 molecules in the absorbent liquid film in proximity of the gas-liquid interface. In this framework, circulation of TEPA particles from the gas-liquid interface into the bulk of the flowing absorbent is seen as a viable solution to improve the process. This thesis focuses on investigating this hypothesis by inducing mixing on the liquid side. That is done by building two experimental setups investigating both passive and active mixing. Experimental results show that active mixing can be used to improve the rate of CO2 absorption, while passive mixing does not bring significant advantages. Results from the passive mixing experiments are further investigated by modelling the fluid dynamics of the process through a Direct Numerical Simulation of the particular Stokes’ flow in the engineered absorption channel. The process is characterised with the definition of a theoretical framework describing mass transfer in the liquid side. Following an analogy with ice formation on top of a frozen lake, this theory, also known as the ”Ice-Sheet” theory, shines some light on the way this diffusion limitations are happening at a molecular level. In particular, a highly viscous, heavily loaded layer of sorbent on the gas-liquid interface is believed to be the cause for observed CO2 diffusion limitations. This theory is backed-up by defining its mathematical equivalent in the form of a mass transfer model. Comparing the results of the model with experimental results, a very good agreement is observed. That is believed to add credibility to the proposed theory. Moreover, that is also found to be in line with the latest knowledge available in literature about CO2 absorption in TEPA films. Finally, the experimental results and the developed models are used to engineer a new iteration of ZEF’s absorber on a cost reduction basis.","Direct air capture; Chemical absorption; Tetraethylenepentamine; Stokes flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-18","","","","","",""

Open fractures, one of the Bellwether procedures, are treated in only 42% of the health facilities in low- and middle income countries. Worldwide, external fixation is one of the most important treatment methods for open fractures, providing immobilization to the fracture while retaining soft tissue integrity. In LMICs however, is the treatment of open fractures with an external fixator not self-evident. Due to a lack of equipment and incomplete donations, a clear need is indicated for application of a standardized low-cost external fixator system for LMICs. The goal of this thesis is to develop a universal fixator clamp for application in low - and middle income countries, providing fixation to both lower- as upper extremity open fractures. In collaboration with Global Surgery Amsterdam and the Amsterdam University Medical Centre, the design of a predecessor external fixator clamp is improved. The design of this clamp consists of three sloths: 4mm, 5mm, and 8mm. As a consequence, this reduces the number of components needed to perform external fixation. Included factors in this iterative design process are the identification of needs, serving as input for the prototype development of the universal clamp. Based on the defined needs the product requirements are defined, giving prioritization to cost-effectiveness. These requirements served as input for the next phase of the design process. The conceptualization of the refined universal clamp is guided by three subproblems: stability enhancement, weight reduction, and increasing functionality. A material analysis demonstrates aluminium 6061 is the most suitable for this application. Next, the theoretical mechanical behavior of the developed clamp concept is analyzed using two use cases. The final clamp concept is manufactured and compared in six mechanical tests with a state-of-the-art external fixator clamp, the Hoffmann 3, to evaluate the performance. Slippage and rotational tests are performed at three different tightening torques for all three diameters. The universal clamp performs significantly less on all six mechanical tests and as a consequence provides less stability to open fractures in comparison with the Hoffmann 3 clamp. Therefore, further development of the universal fixator is necessary to be successfully adopted as a Lifebox-idea to improve open and neglected fracture treatment in LMICs.","External fixation; Open fractures; Medical Devices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-18","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This type of connection is known for its large normal force capacity and a rotation limit only based on the geometry of the connection. For the case of underground constructions, large normal forces are often present at the wall-to-floor connections. Considering the risk of uneven settlements, such connections may also demand sufficient rotation capacity. This research is aimed at deriving the limit state of the connection and the surrounding concrete structure. A test program is carried out to support the research, where full scale experiments are performed at the Stevin II laboratory of the Delft University of Technology. The goal is to prove the functioning of this type of hinged connection in a system before it is implemented in practice. Different analytical contact models are investigated and implemented aiding in quantifying the performance of the connection. A finite element model is used to verify the analytical models and to obtain the stress distribution in the connection. Two different bearing types are investigated in its ability to aid the sliding in the connection: a bituminous and a PTFE-stainless steel interface. Both the PTFE-stainless steel and the bituminous interface are adequate to allow sliding with low rotational resistance. Significantly lower bending moments are obtained during testing compared to a conventional monolithic connection. From the testing project it is found that the capacity of the cylindrical hinge for the given reinforcement design is significant when loaded in the normal direction. The concave concrete element can fail in a splitting failure mode when loaded to the normal force limit. The bituminous interface shows the ability to spread contact stresses and allow for reduced cracking under large normal force loads. Large loads in shear, in combination with low levels of normal force is a point of attention to prevent shear cracks, irrespective of the type of bearing. It is found that the hinge functions fine with favourable frictional behaviour for large shear forces indicating the ability to cope with these forces when a sufficient reinforcement design is implemented.","concrete; sliding; hinge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-18","","","","","",""

These applications can only be realised if nanoparticles can be specifically arranged and patterned on a substrate. This thesis considers a direct write method that uses an aerodynamic focusing nozzle to deposit these particles. A major challenge arises when the nanoparticles are decreased in size. This research studies the control of the deposition resolution of small sized nanoparticles (≤10 nm) in an aerosol flow. A FEM model was developed to describe the particle’s path. These models were made for a converging and converging sheath gas nozzle. Due to the small particle sizes considered, it was found that only the Stokes (drag) force needs to be accounted for during modelling. The effect of different nozzle exit throat, working distance, angle and flow rate configurations are studied. Nozzle designs were evaluated using three performance criteria, namely the contraction factor, focusing ratio and line width. These describe the contraction of the particles within the nozzle system, the focusing after the nozzle system and the width of the line, respectively.<br/>It was found that smaller angles, longer converging sections and higher velocities resulted in smaller line widths. Also, the contraction factor hardly depends on the particle size. Smaller nozzle exit throats have significantly higher focusing ratios for particles smaller than 10 nm. The working distance does not effect the contraction factor directly, indicating capabilities of deposition on non-flat surfaces. The converging nozzles can only deposit ≤10 nm particles if the nozzle exits are sufficiently small. This can cause clogging. The focusing ratios, in these nozzles, never exceeds the value of one, indicating always a larger line width than the nozzle exit diameter. <br/>In the sheath gas nozzle system, high sheath gas ratios are essential for increasing the contraction factor and particle velocity. This prevents clogging. Introducing the sheath gas earlier in the nozzle system is more effective than at the end. The best modelled contraction factor, focusing ratio and line width achieved, using 10 nm particles, with a converging nozzle are 1.0, 0.4 and 874 microns, respectively. This nozzle has a nozzle exit throat of 400 microns and an angle of 10 degrees. However, a modelled contraction factor of 9.3, focusing ratio of 3.8 and line width of 104 microns are achieved using a converging sheath gas nozzle with a nozzle throat of 400 microns and an angle of 5 degrees. Narrower line widths are expected if the throat diameters are reduced.<br/>For the experiments, a setup was used in which nanoparticles are generated using a spark ablation method. During these experiments it was seen that the maximum flow rate is mainly dependent on the nozzle exit throat of the aerosol channel. The line widths, during experimenting, were found to be wider due to inaccuracies in the stage and the differences in settings between the model and setup.","Aerodynamic focusing; Deposition resolution; Nanoparticles; Aerosol deposition; Direct writing; FEM modelling; Nozzle systems; Sheath gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-18","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); van der Zwan, Pieter (graduation committee); Song, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In 2010, an estimated 15 million infants were born prematurely, which makes up 10% of all childbirths that year. Just in the Netherlands there were 11,530 preterm births in 2018. Since these children should be spending additional months inside of the uterus, they are delicate and need to grow until near regular gestational age inside of an incubator in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which provides these children with clean, humid, and warm air. One important part of the care of these infants is keeping track of their development, in order to adjust nourishment, as well as spot possible complications early. A regular part of these measurements is the head circumference (HC) measurement. This measurement is performed by two nurses, one holding the infant still while another winds a tape measure around the delicate head, in order to take the measurement. Unfortunately, this process causes the infant to stress, which is correlated to an increased chance in reduced neurological development of the infant. Therefore, Vectory3, a company specialized in 3D scanning for healthcare, commissioned a project to create an alternative way to take this measurement, which would cause the infant less stress than the current method. During this project, this alternative has been conceived and developed into a functional prototype: MONITOR3D. MONITOR3D makes use of 3 hybrid photogrammetry cameras in order to take a contactless 3D capture of the infant’s head, allowing NICU staff to measure the 3D model after acquisition, instead of measuring the child directly. MONITOR3D’s cameras are housed in an unobtrusive shell which is placed on top of the incubator hood, staying outside of the hygienic zone of the child during use. Though the hardware for MONITOR3D is already in a functional state, providing higher accuracy than the current tape measure-based measurements, the software still consists of unmodified open-source software, for which a simple but relatively time consuming (compared to tape measuring) workflow has been developed. The current prototype of MONITOR3D is thus not ready to be used by regular in a NICU setting. However, it can possibly be used for research purposes in its current state. Future developments should focus mainly on the software part of the product, automating as many of the mesh processing steps as possible, in order to make the device usable in a live NICU environment as alternative to the current tape measure.","Scanner; 3d scanning; anthropology; preterm; Infant; Stress; vectory3; medical; Incubator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bricker, J.D. (graduation committee); Glassmeier, F. (graduation committee); Caires, Sofia (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Extra-Tropical Cyclones (ETCs) are major storm system ruling and influencing the atmospheric structure at mid-latitudes. These events are usually characterized by strong winds and heavy precipitation and cause considerable storm surges with threatening wave systems for coastal regions. The possibility to simulate these storms or to increase the amount of significant data available is crucial to optimize risk assessment and risk management for construction projects and territorial plans which might get damaged by events of this kind. The project addresses the possibility to learn the distribution of cyclones atmospheric fields of pressure, wind and precipitation in the North Atlantic by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The ETCs tracks are extracted from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset in the domain with boundaries 0°-90°N, 70°W-20°E and period going from 1st January 1979 to 1st January 2020. A GAN tries to learn the distribution of a training set based on a game theoretic scenario where two network competes against each other, the generator and the discriminator. The former is trained to generate new examples which are plausible and similar to the real ones by having as input a vector of random Gaussian values. The random vectors domain is called latent space. The latter learns to distinguish whether an example is coming from the dataset distribution or not. The competition set by the game scenario makes the network improve until the counterfeits are indistinguishable form the original. The generative models trained on the ETCs dataset are validated to understand if they are able to generate new samples of fields presenting similar atmospheric characteristics to those of the original dataset. To train the GAN two different loss function are considered, the Wasserstein distance and the Cramèr distance. The Cramèr Gan (CGAN) shows better performance in representing the distribution of the atmospheric fields, generating images that on average look similar to the original ones. The Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) behaviour shows poor performance in representing the precipitation in general, but it is able to similarly reproduce the values distribution for what concerns pressure and wind. The images generated by the WGAN have many differences compared to the original ones and are very blurry with particular data structures that looks like artefacts built by the network. The atmospheric structure of the images generated by the CGAN is investigated by considering 4 cyclones as case study and comparing the frames of their tracks to those of synthetic tracks generated by linear interpolation. The linear interpolation is performed between the random vectors generating the most similar images to the initial and final snapshot of the original track. The interpolated images show interesting features in the similarity with the original track, which suggest that the network has learned a representation of the ETCs fields that is promising for further investigation.","Extra Tropical Cyclones; Generative Adversarial Network; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://figshare.com/s/e3316a3a486b291bc874 At this link the evolution of the interpolated and original tracks for the cyclone case study can be found","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

DTC is a company within the Damen Group that offers a unique service for shipyards; a variety of material and service packages to make local building possible. Project management is one of these services. Although their approach is unique, are the faced challenges not uncommon; similar issues are reported in shipbuilding literature. However, due to their method is documentation flow essential for good performances of DTC-projects. In shipbuilding projects project information is stored in project documents. Documentation is a term that includes both information storage and retrieval systems. Documentation quality concerns quality of the documents and the retrieval systems. The challenges faced at DTC can be described by documentation quality. This study aims to improve the documentation sharing strategy, and so project execution, of DTC-projects. In line with this aim, the central research question is: In what manner can project execution at DTC be improved, by providing insight into the effect of the quality of shared project documentation on project success? From the literature, it is found that project success requires process integration and process integration demands process understanding. Documentation flow modelling is seen as an attractive tool to obtain process understanding, that can lead in the direction of process integration. Out of four models, the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is chosen to model documentation flow. Subsequently, a DSM-based discrete-event Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyse the documentation flow of a DTC-project. Documentation flow is studied by analysing the effects of flow interruptions. Rework is an example of a flow interruption. Based on the literature, multiple causes of document-flow related rework, document quality attributes, are simulated. Documentation quality attributes are ranked on 7 criteria: mean, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, standard deviation, the likelihood for the unacceptable outcome and schedule risk. These criteria rank the impact of the documentation quality attributes in the following order, where the highest impact is ranked highest: 1. Mistakes in documentation 2. Input changes in the documentation 3. Poor communication of the documentation 4. Delayed documentation - wait for documentation 5. Delayed documentation - use assumptions to start tasks early A detailed analysis is carried out to identify activities that have a large impact on total project outcome, when rework occurs. From the detailed analysis it is concluded that: 1. Rework on the below-listed activities has the most impact on project duration. - Detailed engineering tasks, specifically: a. Ship construction drawings b. Mechanical diagrams - Block outfitting, specifically a. Equipment b. Hot work - Zone outfitting, specifically: a. Equipment b. Hot work c. Remaining outfitting tasks 2. A balance exists for waiting on delayed documentation and using assumptions to start activities early. - Projects that have a forecasted overrun that exceeds 11% should use assumptions to start activities early. - Projects that have not a forecasted overrun that exceeds 11\% should force activities to wait on delayed documentation and prioritise activities that can continue. To end, this thesis underlines the importance of documentation quality in shipbuilding projects. Conclusions identify areas for improvement for DTC-projects. At the same time, the outcome serves as a guideline for project managers.","Project Management; Shipbuilding; Documentation flow; DSM; Monte Carlo Simulation; Modular model; Engineer-to-order projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Identifying the density of crowds at these events relies on expensive physical infrastructure to work well or have limited accuracy. We propose amethod that addresses the gap of not relying on physical infrastructure while incorporating new data features that may help improve accuracy. In addition, Emotion Estimation may prove to be useful for an outlier detection system, such as stampedes. The gap addressed for Emotion Estimation is determining the distribution of emotions shown through facial expressions in social media images at city events. To fill the gap, we propose a new density estimation method and analyze the distribution of emotions at events under normal circumstances. The proposed density estimation method does not rely on physical infrastructure. It estimates the density of crowds using social media images, the images’ location, direction, the number of people in the image, and the image angle of view. We also propose a method to extract the images’ location using Structure fromMotion and Generalized Procrustes Analysis. We analyzed the location estimation through an experiment using manually gathered data. Density estimation was analyzed through an experiment using crowd simulation. Emotion estimation was done through social media images gathered at Kingsday and Sail in the Netherlands originally gathered by Gong et al. [15]. The results show that the location estimation method correctly determines 5% of images that are taken at the event area and 100% of images that are not taken at the event area. We found 5/7 results to be within 100 meters of their true location, according to our findings. For our density estimation technique, the proposed method outperformed other methods that do not rely on physical infrastructure for crowd densities of 0.1-0.3 (People/m2) and social media activity of 0.01-0.03 (images/person). For our emotion estimation, we found that 25% of faces in social media images taken at the examined events were neutral, 70% were happy, and 5% were one of the following expressions: sad, surprised, and fear. No angry facial expressions were found. Our research provides new approaches to calculate the location of social media images and estimate crowd density, which outperformed existing methods. Besides, we provide insights into emotions displayed in social media images taken at city events.","Crowd management measures; Locations; Events; City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The industry of kitchens and kitchen appliances needs new innovative models of practice to reduce its environmental footprint. As kitchen appliance manufacturer, ATAG Benelux is investing in innovation to create more sustainable and circular business propositions. In a circular economy products and materials have to ‘loop’ back into the system after they lost value, but ATAG’s current system is linear, bringing the appliances to the customer and not returning them. The aim of this thesis is to explore how ATAG can use design to contribute to a circular economy. It is a collaboration between ATAG Benelux and Delft University of Technology. This thesis focuses on the user, their behavior, and their attitudes towards Product Service Systems (PSS's) and Refurbishment as they play a big role in business models. As a case study, the combi-steam oven is used to explore PSS's. The user’s attitude towards refurbishment and circular PSS’s is explored through in-depth interviews. The results reveal several challenges in acceptance for different types of ownership of ovens and show that for the target group of ATAG a system of buy-back is most suitable. The context of retaining value for refurbishment was researched through literature, interviews, and creative sessions. This shows different directions for design to benefit the refurbishment process. The recommended circular business proposition is for ATAG to take back appliances after a use cycle. ATAG Benelux can refurbish its products to save materials and resources. For refurbishment it is important that products retain their value as long as possible. The final design consists of return incentives for users and the Care Assistant. This human centered design stimulates product care, which is a type of sustainable use and handling. The design will influence the user’s behavior in a sustainable way to retain more value, enable efficient refurbishment and a second life cycle. The product care is needed to have a longer product life, or to take back an appliance that is in a better state (than it would be if product care had not been stimulated). With a buy-back system, users are stimulated to return the appliances, rather than let the appliance end up in recycling or worse.","Kitchen appliance; Circular Economy; Sustainability; Refurbishment; product care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Automated vehicles (AV) are expected to change our future way of transportation and bring many positive effects, such as better road/vehicle safety, reduced environmental costs but also increased on-board productivity. The commonly adopted approach to capture the effect of increased on-board productivity is to reduce the ‘penalty’ associated with travel time. This implies that people will show less aversion to longer travel times (i.e. congestion), prioritise arriving close to the preferred arrival time and thus, increase the peak congestion. However, a distinction should be made between the type of performed activity, since this could likely affect the departure time preferences and thus can have an impact on the congestion pattern. Previous work has shown that travellers with fully automated vehicles in which home activities could better be performed, preferred to depart earlier, and conversely travellers with automated vehicles in which work activities could better be performed, preferred depart later. In addition, the results suggested that automated vehicles could likely increase severe congestion in the future. However, these insights have been obtained with the use of a theoretical single link setting. Up to this point differentiation between activities has not yet been investigated for real-life road networks in which route choice can be incorporated. Therefore this research aims to investigate network effects of activity based departure time choice with fully automated vehicles. It uses the extended α-β-γ scheduling preferences by B. Pudāne and implemented these within a traffic simulation model. This model was assigned to a case study network of the ‘Haaglanden’ region. Results showed that travellers which use AVs to engage in home activities, increase congestion more to the beginning of the morning peak. Vice versa, travellers which use AVs to engage in work activities move congestion more to the end of the morning peak. Travellers which use AVs for both home and work activities would increase congestion in the middle. Considering route choice, a shift in vehicle-kilomtres (VKM) could be observed from the main road network to the underlying road network with the introduction of AVs. This has a negative impact regarding traffic safety, noise and air pollution. Although one might argue that future AVs will have increased safety levels and a more eco-friendly way of driving. Lastly, it was observed that with mixed traffic situations, non-AV users were ‘forced’ to shift their departure times out of the peak moments, move to less congested periods. Conversely, AV users were less affected by these longer travel times and prioritised their preferred arrival times. It is recommended that further research is conducted to include the dynamic modelling element of blocking back. In addition, the extended α-β-γ model parameter values should be assessed to arrive at more substantiated values. Moreover, it suggested to further investigate the impact of differentiation towards road capacities for AVs. Furthermore, this study did not investigate heterogeneity among travellers’ preferences, nor did it take into account endogeneity through which people may assign themselves to a certain type of activity. It is suggest to take these aspects into account in further research. This study assumed full automation, whereas it would be interesting to investigate the effects with lower automation as well. Lastly, an important extension of this research would be to also capture the effect of value of travel time differentiation with respect to route choice, as this study did not differentiate in probabilities to choose a specific route per vehicle type.","Automated vehicles; Transport modelling; Departure time choice; Network effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The drought of 2018 was so severe that the disruption caused economic losses. As the topic of drought disruption is new, little strategies have been developed to reduce the economic loss due drought disruption. One concept has gained growing attention in the literature for potentially reduces such losses - namely, Synchromodal transport. Synchromodal transport - also called Synchromodality - consists of allowing freight forwards to select a transport modality until the last moment, instead of planning far before as is done now. In our paper we research to what extent Synchromodal transport can increase the resilience of the Dutch freight transport system during drought disruptions. Our rational for this research is the absence of insights for policy makers on how to reduce economic losses during drought disruption. Our research developed a Discrete Event Simulation to measure the performance of Road, Rail and IWT during droughts. We further developed a resilience Framework which identified five resilience metrics. We embedded the results of the simulation model within these metrics to evaluate the impact of Synchromodal transport for different penetration rates. Our results show that Synchromodal transport is able to avoid drought disruptions but only at penetration rates above 55\% - which is seen as high. However, even when disruptions were still present, synchromodal transport helped reduced the damages done by big margins during the disruptions - event at low penetration rates. This suggests that any effort to adopt synchromodality can be useful against drought disruptions.","Drought Disruption; Resilience; Synchromodality; Simulation; Inland Waterways","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In recent years, patient specific instrumentation (PSI) has shown to be a promising application of 3D printing in orthopedic surgery. By aiding the surgeon with accurate placement of instruments such as saws or drills, surgeries can be performed faster, and require less surgeon experience. While most of these devices interface directly with the bone, invasiveness can be greatly decreased by applying the device to the outside of the body. Such an external device also allows for guidance with respect to bones that are too small to place a device on directly, for example the carpal bones in the wrist. In this thesis, an external PSI is designed to aid surgeons in accurately drilling a tunnel through the scaphoid; one of the carpal bones. The main challenge addressed in this thesis is how to rigidly attach a guide to the largely soft and elastic exterior of the hand. This was overcome by ensuring that the guide only contacts the hand at locations where the bone lies directly under the skin. Exact constraint design was applied to determine a minimal set of such contact locations that fully constrain the relevant anatomy. A 3D printed prototype was made for 6 participants and measurements were done to determine the positioning accuracy as well as the stiffness of the connection between the guide and the body. The results show that external PSI is a promising technology for application to wrist surgery, but may not be applicable to other parts of the body due to a limited number of suitable contact locations.","Exact constraint design; modified Brunelli procedure; patient specific instrumentation; surgical guide; wrist surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

One of the last islands will be Buiteneiland. The location and orientation of Buiteneiland is been agreed when IJburg was designed. The area of interest of this study is the land-water transition at the east side of the island. The IJmeer's morphology is storm driven and the prevailing waves in this low energy environment, have limited reshaping capacity. Therefore, the land-water transition needs to consist of erosion protection. At the same time, the east side of the island will contribute to the 'Boog om de Oost', a provincial arch that connects the province of Utrecht with North-Holland via outer dike reed fields. For the Engineering Office, this was the reason to ask for an approach to deal with a hybrid solution, that combines a nature-based foreshore with an erosion protection for the east side of Buiteneiland. Figure 2.a and Figure 2.b shows two possible land-water transitions, a traditional dike and a nature-based hybrid solution. This composed the research question for this study: What is a safe and nature-based hybrid solution for the case study: east side of Buiteneiland, IJburg?. Design of alternatives for the nature-based hybrid solutions is done according to the method of de Vries et al. [2016]. This Building with Nature method is developed for nature-based type of projects. The Building with Nature method contains the five clear steps that have been worked through iteratively. The most suited nature-based hybrid solution for the east side of Buiteneiland seemed the Hard Arch variant (see: Figure 3) When implementing a nature-based hybrid solution, components and concepts of this solution can be extracted and implemented individually. New build or restored land-water transitions at least consists of a vegetated foreshore. The dike of the Basic Concept (is a dike without a foreshore or vegetation), covered by grass requires a crest height of 2.27 m. The hybrid solution as the Hard Arch variant, the grass covered dike only requires a crest height of 1.61 m, while offering the same protection level. The costs estimate for the found hybrid solution is a factor 5.5 higher than for the Basic Concept. However, the hybrid solution does have a lot of extra benefits next to safety. A lot of natural capital is added to the IJmeer and for the citizens of Amsterdam, in terms of vegetation above and below the water surface. Furthermore, social value and inspirational values are added to the Markermeer, where other new islands or shore restorations can be inspired by this nature-based hybrid solution. Thus, this nature-based hybrid solution is more expansive, but a solution like this maximizes the benefits for local communities, nature and economy. Overall, the use of a nature-based hybrid solution is a way of combining the development of new nature and ecosystems with coastal protection providing safety and prosperity for local community.","Hybrid solution; Nature-based; Buiteneiland; IJburg; Bank design; Reed; Wave Attenuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.36525732300581, 5.016769501252783"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","When humans make inferences that go beyond limited, noisy, or ambiguous input data, background knowledge is necessary to make generalizations. Such inferences are important for designing intelligent artificial agents. Bayesian inference, a statistical method commonly used as a cognitive model of the brain, formalizes the integration of background knowledge, i.e. ""priors"", and sensory evidence. I research the effect of priors on sense of agency (SoA) in an artificial agent. In humans, SoA is the subjective experience of control over actions and their consequence. In robotics, developing an agent with SoA is a popular challenge and the first step towards the artificial self. <br/><br/>This thesis designs an artificial agent where the same prior knowledge improves SoA in unambiguous environments and induces incorrect, illusory SoA in noisy, ambiguous environments. First, I provide a comprehensive overview on the role of priors in Bayesian inference and the computational principles of a SoA. Second, I define the ``point mass moving rubber hand illusion (mRHI)"", a simulation for an artificial agent that simplifies the human mRHI experiment. Third, I use two parameter estimators, ordinary least-squares (OLS) and expectation-maximization (EM), to calculate SoA in the point mass mRHI. <br/><br/>I found that SoA requires a prior belief about the causal relationship between outcome and action. In the point mass mRHI, the agent has to identify which of the three point masses it can control with its force input. The agent has the prior knowledge that there is a causal relationship between its actions and the states of one point mass. Though with OLS the agent has correct and incorrect SoA, some of the results not comparable to the results from human mRHI experiment. A likely cause is that this simplest reproduction of the mRHI models SoA as a binary variable and does not use Bayesian inference. The (partially) Bayesian parameter estimator EM calculates SoA as a (continuous) posterior probability and finds results similar to the human mRHI experiment. Comparing an OLS algorithm without prior to the EM algorithm, I found that in unambiguous environments the Bayesian prior improves the agent's general SoA and SoA over time but does not improve the SoA for the point mass that the agent does control. In the ambiguous environments, the prior generally motivates the agent towards a SoA over the incorrect mass. However, in a noisy but slightly less ambiguous environment, the prior improves the agent's SoA. In short, the prior improves a SoA when the agent needs to make inferences that go beyond the data but can also induce an incorrect SoA in a noisy and ambiguous environment.<br","sense of agency; Rubber Hand Illusion; priors; expectation maximization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","High performance continuous fiber-reinforced composites are becoming increasingly important in the aerospace industry. In these structures, internal damage is often created and propagated throughout the lifetime, having a negative impact on the structural properties. In order to allow for condition-based maintenance, there is a need for reliable prognostics to predict future damage states. Therefore, a model-based machine learning approach is developed in this thesis to perform prognostics of the remaining useful life (RUL) and remaining useful properties (RUP) of cross-ply composites to end-of-early-fatigue-life (EOEFL). In-situ transverse matrix crack density and dynamic stiffness data are available, as well as offline delamination ratio and damage induced stiffness degradation data. To account for the multicausality and non-linearity in stiffness degradation, the evolution of cracks and delaminations is modeled using separate phenomenological relations that are pre-trained with high variance using non-linear least squares (NLS) on a separate training set. These damage properties are then combined into a normalized stiffness prediction using NLS pre-trained phenomenological relations that express the induced stiffness degradation for each of the aforementioned properties. A particle filter (PF) trains the model parameters, initialized in a high variance uniform distribution, for the phenomenological models in real-time (i.e. online). This is done with the in-situ crack density and normalized stiffness measurements of the testing specimen only. A random walk on the model parameters, which declines towards EOEFL with a given rate of convergence, is added to allow for continuous adaptivity. By propagating each particle to future states beyond the online time step in the PF, the prognostics are obtained. This encompasses the RUP and RUL to EOEFL using a weighted sum of the particles. After applying this methodology to the case study data, it is concluded that the potential of PF to offer adaptivity required for RUP prognostics of composites is identified, definitely for damage properties showing early characteristic behavior. However, reliable RUL estimation to EOEFL with the methodology set out in this thesis remains difficult. Especially the stiffness degradation model and the failure criterion for EOEFL generate difficulties. Therefore, a promising recommendation would be to combine similar phenomenological relations to end-of-life for crack and delamination growth with an alternative stiffness model. A feasible approach would be to train a surrogate model on synthetic data generated with finite element modeling simulations. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is done on three PF hyperparameters: sample size, threshold effective sample size, and rate of convergence. The first shows that a minimum sample size can be distinguished after which no improvement occurs when the sample size increases. The second indicates a 'sweet spot' that balances the sample impoverishment and weight degeneracy drawbacks. The latter makes it plausible that a moderate rate of convergence is preferable.","Online; Prognostics; Composites; Fatigue; Particle Filter; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); remaining useful life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This research is conducted at and with the help of Liander. Liander is one of three energy distribution system operators in the Netherlands. The following research question is answered: “To what extend do the benefits of PVEs that are deployed in citizen to government context apply to the use of PVE within a company environment?”. This is done by doing exploratory research within Liander and conducting a PVE survey for their asset management department about the architectural life cycle of a compact secondary substation. Previous use cases are explored to identify the benefits and drawbacks of PVE. Agency theory is used to make a comparison between the government-citizen environment and the company environment. This comparison and the principal-agent relation is used to make predictions on the results of the survey to see if the survey produces valid data. Two of the four benefits found in previous cases translated to a company environment and the drawback translates to a lesser extent. The PVE survey used in this thesis became more complex and much more on an operational level compared to previous PVE surveys. This resulted in a smaller group of relevant participants, which directly impacted the benefits. Employees see potential to use PVE in different ways that would benefit efficiency or the flow of information. These implementations vary a lot, but for all of them the current PVE tooling is unsuitable. PVE tooling could be adapted to suit this new type of use and to increase the ease of use for companies. Further research on the exact adaptations of the PVE tooling would be needed to implement this. Future research on the use of PVE in a business environment could focus on more strategic subjects. As an example, general strategic direction could be the subject of the PVE between a company board and the company shareholders. These subjects would more closely match previous PVE cases and would help provide context for the results of this thesis.","PVE; Agency theory; Participatory Value Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, these sources are intermittent. Therefore Electrical Energy Storage (EES) systems are needed in the near future to assure a reliable electricity supply. These systems should also be able to deliver power in longer periods of time with low generation from wind and solar energy sources. An example of such an EES system is the GreenBattery, developed by AquaBattery. This is a flow battery that stores the electricity by splitting salt water in an acid and a base. Because the main component of the GreenBattery is salt water, this battery is safe in use, as it cannot catch fire or explode. Furthermore, this makes the battery environmentally benign and cost competitive with other EES systems. The main focus of this thesis is to make a concept design of a GreenBattery that can be placed on a water like a lake. This concept is evaluated in a case study regarding the energy storage lake of the Delta21 project. This battery could provide a reliable backup electricity source for e.g. the Port of Rotterdam or stabilise the electricity output of renewable sources. Therefore, the main research question of this thesis is: ‘How can AquaBattery’s GreenBattery be realised on the energy storage lake of the Delta21 project, providing long term storage?’ To answer this question, first the design basis is explored. Based on this, concepts are generated using a morphological chart method and the most feasible concept is chosen using a multi-criteria analysis. This chosen concept is worked out in more detail, after which its technical and economic feasibility is investigated. The most feasible concept turned out to be a floating concept. This concept uses floating rigid tanks to store the different liquids present in the GreenBattery. The power unit, where the electricity conversion takes place, is placed on top of these tanks. Furthermore, the feasibility of integrating a solar photovoltaic system on the floating tanks is investigated, because of the large area available for multiuse on such an island. The resulting dimensions of the floating tanks is 98 by 98 by 3 m (length, width, draft). Four of these tanks can be coupled together to form one floating island. Such an island can store about 560 - 800 MWh of energy, depending on the required storage duration and about 3.2 MWp of solar panels can be placed on top of the tanks. In total, about 300 of such islands can be placed on the energy storage lake of the Delta21 project. Such an island is technically feasible, because the natural periods are larger than the expected wave periods. Therefore, the motions and forces of the island will be minimal. Furthermore, in terms of costs, the floating GreenBattery is cost competitive with other EES systems and therefore will be economically feasible as well.","Energy storage; Floating structure; GreenBattery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Since the majority of these sites use scour protections which have a substantial impact on the surroundings, the Dutch government increasingly stimulates and requires ecological enhancement of such structures in order to restore the natural habitat and maintain the marine ecosystem of the North Sea. Oyster enhancement has been one of the methods used for the ecological enhancement of offshore wind farm scour protections. However, studies report that a successful structure for the harbouring of an oyster population is yet to be developed. Existing structures were found to be unstable or unable to provide a suitable habitat for the oysters (Bouma, Belze, et al., 2013; Stokes et al., 2012). The study at hand aims to develop a successful design for oyster broodstock structures for nature enhancement in offshore wind farms. It was conducted for Van Oord as part of project Ecoscour. To establish design criteria for the oyster broodstock structures, oyster habitats and the Borssele V site were analysed and a brainstorm session with partners from project Ecoscour was set up. The final criteria concerned: ecology; structural integrity; commissioning &amp; construction; and monitoring. The design criteria were used to develop several viable structure designs. In order to rapidly assess the strength and stability of potential designs, a Python-based open source tool was built named Econstruct. With this tool, geometries can easily be evaluated under various influences, accounting for the effect of marine fouling. This could be used for quick investigations of loads, stability and structural integrity. The Econstruct tool was validated and analysed for sensitivity for the input parameters, of which the input radius and current velocity had the highest influence on stability. Using the environmental input parameters that hold for the Borssele V wind farm, a terraced design was proposed. After consultation with the manufacturer of the structure, D &amp; M engineers, this proposal was altered to account for manufacturing limitations. The definitive design was evaluated using the Econstruct tool and found to be stable. It was then manufactured, and ultimately placed in Borssele V in October 2020. Several recommendations are made for future research and the design of ecological enhancement structures for offshore wind farms. Most importantly, the Econstruct open source tool can be used in the future for the design of structures for other ecological enhancement projects such as coral reef restorations.","Oyster broodstock structure; Nature-inclusive; Offshore Wind Farm; Object-Oriented Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

These dangerous conditions typically occur due to a variety of flow phenomena, one of which is shock—boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs), which commonly occur in the vicinity of a vehicle’s control flaps and involve the dynamic coupling of the adverse pressure of a shock and the subsonic nature of a viscous boundary layer. To properly understand SBLIs, it is important to understand how they amplify or decay upstream disturbances, which may offer deeper insight into how they operate. To this aim, the goal of this work is to observe and quantify how sinusoidal roughness strips introduce perturbations into a compression ramp SBLI system. This is achieved through experiments of various ramps and roughness strips on a flat plate with the Hypersonic Test Facility Delft (HTFD), wherein the Reynolds number, compression ramp angle, and sinusoidal strip wavelength (distance between peaks) are modified to directly observe the influence each has on the SBLI system. This work employs three measurement techniques: schlieren visualization, quantitative infrared thermography (QIRT), and oil flow visualization. This thesis quantifies and evaluates relationships between Reynolds number, ramp angle, and sinusoidal strip wavelength to surface heat flux and shear layer behavior, in addition to comparing how laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow conditions influence SBLI behavior.","Hypersonics; SWBLI; SBLI; shock--boundary-layer interactions; compression ramp; sinusoidal; high-speed; Schlieren; QIRT; Oil flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It is necessary to protect the success of the project, the budget, the project timeline and the reputation of an organisation. Alongside the tools and techniques which exist to support risk management, it is also a process which depends on people’s opinions, decisions and how they follow procedures. This study sought to identify the perspectives which exist amongst a group of managers from a main contractor organisation with respect to what is important to risk management. First, a literature study was performed to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) of risk management. Next, Q methodology was used to collect data from 15 managers, five from each of the three different functional teams within the same construction project. The managers were asked to sort the CSFs, from least to most important, according to their opinion on what is important to project risk management. Finally, after the Q sort activity, each manager was interviewed and asked to motivate their choices. The main result of this research was the three perspectives discovered through the Q study. These perspectives are known as Experience and Belief, Procedures and Leaders and Culture and Communication. The names reflect the CSFs which the perspective judged to be most important. The perspectives contained six, five and three respondents respectively and there was one respondent who did not belong to any of the perspectives. On average, across all respondents, “project organisation risk culture” was ranked as the most important and “regular training to enhance risk management skills” was ranked as the least important. It was found to be borderline significant that four of the managers from the design team belonged to the perspective Procedures and Leaders. The results of the research were used to make recommendations to the organisation to improve their risk management.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Sediment nourishments have become an increasingly attractive alternative to deal with continuous bed degradation problems in the river system. When supplied to the river, sediment nourishments induce a sediment wave that propagates through the system causing changes in bed level and bed surface texture. In the present study we use a one-dimensional numerical model to analyse how the propagation of these sediment waves varies under different conditions. We find that the propagation of the sediment wave tends to be predominantly dispersive for large spatial variations of the flow, which is the dominant case when the height of the wave is large in comparison to the flow depth, or when the sediment is dispersed over a large enough reach to lead to a backwater effect. In artificial sediment nourishments the height of the sediment wave is usually limited to prevent creating an additional obstacle to navigation, and it is then that the temporal variations in the flow, due to high discharge events for example, determine the propagation of the wave. We study the morphodynamic response in a mixed-size sediment river system to a sediment nourishment, and identify the physical mechanisms that impact the propagation of mixed-sized sediment waves. In order to prevent it from being easily flushed downstream, the grain size distribution of the nourished sediment is typically selected to be coarser than the river bed. This reduces sediment mobility and enhances sediment deposition over the nourished reach, which in turn causes a deficit in sediment supply to the downstream reach and leads to the formation of a degradational wave. The propagation celerity of the degradational wave is found to be significantly faster than that of the sediment wave, which means that the effects of the nourishments in a river system can be observed significantly further downstream than from where the front of the sediment wave is found. We find that the celerities of both the sediment wave and the degradational wave are predominantly affected by the adjustments in surface grain size in the system. These adjustments migrate in the river system as a fining wave, which both accelerates the sediment wave, and decelerates the degradational wave. We learn that higher content of the finer fractions in the nourished sediment accelerate the evolution of the wave and lead to a predominantly translational behaviour. It also affects the magnitude of the incision depth, the closer the composition of the nourished sediment is to that of the bed surface, the less severe the scour. And even though it does not affect the propagation celerity of the degradational wave, it does impact how far downstream the wave travels, affecting a larger river reach the coarser the grain size composition of the sediment wave is. Finally, we analyse the results from a nourishment pilot project carried out in the Bovenrijn from 2016-2019. We find that the propagation of the sediment wave associated with the nourishment is only observed during high discharge events. The wave is predominantly dispersive, and only during a prolonged extreme discharge event did the wave show slight translational behaviour. We observe that lateral sorting mechanisms caused the tracer sediment to have a different trajectory from the sediment wave, which highlights the limitations of using a one-dimensional model. We also observe that the changes in bed level are related to the changes in surface grain size, with sediment deposition over the nourished reach and bed degradation just downstream.","River morphodynamics; Sediment nourishments; Adjustment waves; Bed degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This system is designed to alarm a caregiver in a nursing home to prevent bed­ falls among institutionalized elderly. For the input of this algorithm, features are derived from four force sensing resistor sensors and six piezoelectric sensors mounted on a device which is placed under the mattress at chest level. The classifier is based on data containing 98 bed exits of two different people on two different mattresses. The best results were obtained for the feature which uses the standard deviation of the force sensing resistor sensors of the last 10 seconds. The classifier was evaluated using a test set which contained a total of 645 time frames of 5 seconds of 23 cases where someone leaves the bed and 622 time frames where there is no bed exit. 10 windows with bed exits were classified correctly out of 23. Moreover, the system has a false alarm rate of 3.9%, meaning that in 24 time windows a bed exit is predicted while there is no actual bed exit. The accuracy with which the model classifies a bed exit or no bed exit correctly 5 seconds beforehand is 94.3%. Thereafter, it was researched whether adding an extra sensor plate would be helpful to improve the bed exit prediction. The extra plate should be placed on the side of the bed if the preferred side for getting up is known, or at the hip level if the side is unknown. This is of added value to define the bed status of the client as this plate, in contradiction to the sensor plate at chest level, still measures pressure when someone sits up straight.","Prediction Model; Machine Learning; Decision Tree Model; Bed Exit; Bed Falls","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-17","","","","","",""

A strategy that has helped to get closer to this goal is the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Adoption of BIM-related technologies is mostly limited to architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) actors, who handover the collection of design and construction data for the client but retrieving data from BIM models for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) activities is not as common as desired but it offers great potential to perform and support activities such as Assessment and Monitoring, Documentation, Emergency Management, Energy and Space Management, and Maintenance of Service Information. Processes, standards, and formats for integrating information about Operations and Maintenance in the design phase have been conceptually developed with a technical dimension approach toward activities, information, and solutions. Given that BIM is a socio-technical system, solutions must also consider a social perspective. For this reason, Activity Theory is used to analyse maintenance activities, their origin, elements related, and processes involved in their performance and, more specifically, their definition. The established theoretical lens considers information as the main product to deliver instead of a by-product of the models’ deliverables. Thus, it was determined, through a literature review, exploratory interviews, semi-structured interviews and the aforementioned analysis, that the integration of O&amp;M personnel is not only usually late along the information lifecycle of an asset’s life, but that the required attributes that provide the necessary information to asset managers to perform their tasks are not even considered early enough in the project, commonly when it is already handed over. Integration of these actors along the already established processes is encouraged to ensure the information will not only be produced and transferred as required, but it will also be useful for other purposes that are included in the documentation of the project.","BIM; information; activity theory; handover","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The motivation that arises from that need is the development and the evolution of modelling methods to study these effects. Deep understanding of any problem in fine scale is crucial, especially when it extends to much coarser scales.<br/>In this work the finite volume method (FVM) is used for mechanical modelling of deformation in elastic media. The momentum balance equation is solved as the governing equation for mechanics, assuming linear elasticity for the stress tensor. Here, displacement is mapped onto a vertex-centred grid in three dimensions (3D). A set of eight trilinear basis functions are used to locally interpolate the value of displacement within each grid cube. In the finite volume method, the discretized form of the equations are obtained by integrating the governing equation over control volume surfaces, since in 3D the control volume is a cube. Hence, discretized forms are obtained by considering 24 surfaces, which form between a displacement node and its neighbouring displacement cells. This required extensive derivation. The implementation of the numerical model was carried out by writing a code in MATLAB. Several numerical test cases are presented to demonstrate the capability of this model. In the first place, the consistency of the model is checked through comparison with synthetic analytical solutions, which are compared to the numerical solutions. Furthermore, the simple test case of uniaxial compression, has been carried out with this model, but also compared to the results with a 2D FVM model and a 3D finite element (3D FEM) one. In another test case, ground plain strain subsidence is studied in a real hydrocarbon field with a heterogeneous map for elasticity parameters. It is shown that 3D FVM is in close agreement with 3D FEM in predicting the subsidence due to field depletion. Last but not least, displacement and stresses, in a faulted reservoir in which fluids are injected, are modelled and the results are shown to coincide with a robust analytical solutions for the system. Finally, the aim of this work is to shed some more light on the finite volume method for mechanics and bring it closer to the audience of science.","Finite Volume Methods; Finite element method; Mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the framework, Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) of the demonstrators CityAirbus and Vahana was evaluated according to ISO 2631-1. The UAM evaluation showed that, during hover flight, the interaction of the rotor blade wake with the airframe introduces the most dominant perceived vibration. As well, low frequency beating vibration was identified in all translational axes due to different rotational speeds of the individual decoupled rotors.

In this paper, a novel solution is proposed, by tuning resonant frequency and exciting higher order modes to cover the intended frequency range 500 - 5k Hz. A flexure mechanism is designed, where the scanner contains a cantilever as resonator, and a cut-leafspring as hinge guiding to achieve 1 DoF resonant scan. Resonant frequency is tuned by clamping different positions of the cantilever by two surfaces with large radius of curvature, and sliding could be enabled by DLC coating. Concept and detailed design are evaluated by finite element modelling and a prototype is built. The test results show a good match with the simulation. The intended frequency range could be covered and the reflected beam could achieve a scanning angle of 1mrad. Unwanted motions of mirror are verified and limited within requirement with large margins, and hence could be negligible for operation.","Optomechatronics; Flexures; Scanning Mirror; Frequency Tunable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-17","","","","","",""

Both control loops on the spinal as well as cortical level are likely to play a role in this regulation. However, the cortical mechanisms involved with the online adaptive control of joint stiffness remain largely unresolved. This study aimed at identifying cortical areas associated with the process of joint stiffness modulation using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG was recorded in twelve healthy right-handed individuals performing an active posture control task while receiving continuous random force perturbations applied using a robotic manipulator. To provoke a change in the neuromuscular control strategy, i.e. adaptation of joint stiffness, external viscous loads were applied or removed between tasks or instantaneously within tasks. Linear time-invariant system identification techniques were used to estimate joint stiffness between tasks. Cortical oscillatory dynamics were analysed for eight clusters of independent components, which were found using independent component analysis (ICA) and a subsequent dipole source localization method. Power spectral analysis of the time-invariant trials revealed significant enhancement of theta and beta oscillations in the left sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) and suppression of delta rhythms in the supplementary motor area (SMA) when external damping was present. Analysis of event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) in the time-variant trials revealed delta and theta band enhancement in the SMA and sensorimotor cortex following immediately after external damping removal, as well as broadband enhancement in the prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)). Moreover, we found more pronounced modulations in cortical activity with an unexpected decrease in external damping as compared to an increase in viscous loads. These results suggest that multiple cortical areas are likely to be involved in modulating joint stiffness when stability is at risk being the sensorimotor cortex, SMA and prefrontal cortex, whereas adaptive processes in response to increased stability margins might be regulated on a subcortical level.","Electroencephalography (EEG); Joint stiffness modulation; Independent Component analysis (ICA); Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-17","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The computational approach enabled the investigation of the structure’s deformation and determination of the influence of parameters, which define the metamaterial’s geometry, before commencing prototyping and experiments. Geometry, which resulted frommultiple iterations necessary to match the heart’s shape and deformation patterns, was parametrized and simulated in each configuration to create a database.

At the subsequent stage the structure was optimized, with the aim of matching the deformation of a healthy myocardium, which concluded the project. Obtained sections of the design space allowed for qualitative as well as quantitative description of the device’s capabilities. It was established that most of the behaviour in all directions, longitudinal, radial and rotational, is determined by position of the main active element within the structure as well as its size and the size of vertical elements encompassing the myocardium.

Adequate pathogen removal is, however, needed if treated water is reused. This research evaluates the fate of Escherichia coli, enterococci and Campylobacter in a field scale biofilter in Rotterdam. This biofilter is part of the Urban Waterbuffer Spangen that combines biofiltration with Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) to provide irrigation water for Sparta’s sports field. Microbiological water quality was analysed to assess the removal capacity of the biofilter. To identify factors causing adverse treatment performance, system construction, and operation were investigated, water flows in the biofilter were assessed, and hydraulic conductivity was measured. Lastly, model simulations were used to investigate how short-circuiting and event frequency and duration affect microbiological outflow concentrations. Results showed leaching of enterococci and Campylobacter and minimal retention of Escherichia coli. Leaching is likely caused by secondary contamination with bird faeces and multiple design and operational choices lead to low microbial retention. Coarse filter media results in high hydraulic conductivity, and consequently, short hydraulic retention times. Electrical conductivity measurements revealed short-circuiting pathways between the inlet and outlet. Lastly, uneven distribution of feed water presumably reduced the effective reactor volume. It is recommended to upgrade biofilter design by incorporating small particles in the filter media and maximizing the distance between the inlet and outlet. Additionally, reintroduce a ponding zone and rearranging event frequency and duration to lower microbial outflow loads is advised. Model simulations suggest that short, frequent events are beneficial to control microbial loads. However, further work to clarify microbial decay rates is recommended. To conclude, results imply that the biofilter is currently unable to improve the microbiological water quality but can become a treatment barrier if design and operation are upgraded to tackle encountered problems.","Biofilter; Urban Waterbuffer; E. coli; enterococci; Campylobacter; Stormwater treatment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ton, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In order to stop climate change, it is inevitable to transition to more environmental-friendly ways of transportation, such as cycling. An important criterion for selecting the bicycle as a modality is the distance to the destination. An increase in travel distance coincides with a decrease in modal share of bicycles compared to alternative modalities. Literature does not explain why cycling is preferred for certain distances and not for others, except for some practical reasons. This thesis investigates the built environment in relation to cycling distance. Literature indicates the built environment as being important for destination choice, mode choice and route choice. Moreover, literature also indicates a relationship between cycling distance and these decision choices. As urbanization of the built environment increases, more destinations are within reach and this tends to reduce travel distance. At the same time, network friction reduces due to increasing network density. Finally, preferences to cycle through or avoid certain characteristics of the built environment may result in detours, which increase travel distance. People’s decisions on travel destination, transportation mode and route appear to be crucial for choosing the bicycle as mode of transport. Humans make these decisions simultaneously, but in this thesis, it is assumed that it is done in the order: destination, mode, and route. By making this assumption, it is possible to say that (a) destination choice is connected to Euclidean distance, (b) mode choice is connected to network friction, and (c) route choice is connected to behavioural detour. The 7D’s framework of Ewing &amp; Cevero (2010) has been used to quantify the built environment. It will turn out that only the first three D’s (Design, Density and Diversity) are influencing cycling distance. The choices for destination, mode and route choice are also influenced by the following elements: network density, cycle paths, green environments, smooth surface, built environment density and the mixture of functions in the built environment. This research has been conducted with bicycle trip data within the municipalities of Amsterdam, Amstelveen, Diemen and Ouder-Amstel. Those municipalities offer a fitting case study, since the ‘Greater Amsterdam’ has a varied built environment and has a need to reduce car traffic significantly. In this thesis, the relation of the elements with cycling distance are statistically tested with a multiple linear regression analysis. In order to do so, elements have to been quantified and combined with the bicycle trips. Explanatory models are developed to explain cycling distance, Euclidean distance, and detour distance with the elements of the built environment. The models constructed in this thesis show that the elements green environments, waterbodies, smooth surface material, and cycle paths have a positive increasing impact on cycling distance, while network density and built environment have a negative decreasing impact. No clear impact on travel distance is found for the element mixture of functions. This thesis also show that the built environment is more important for determining the Euclidean distance than its importance detour distance. The results from this thesis confirm the relationship between built environment and cycling distance. To be specific, the results show that the built environment density is most important for Euclidean distance and therefore destination choice. Green environments and waterbodies are incentive elements of the built environment to overcome the distance added by the network friction. The two elements can also affect the cycling distance due to the choice of behavioural detour. This shows that bicycle use for longer distances can be stimulated by adding more green and potential waterbodies in the built environment.","Cycling; Built Environment; Distance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

Long-term prognosis is excellent and therefore the new treatment should focus on minimizing long-term side effects and treatment burden. This research proposes cancer treatment using nanoparticles (NPs) for a combination of heat therapy and brachytherapy. For the NP design, superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) will be used. Because of their biocompatibility and good magnetic properties, they are suitable candidates for heating using an alternating magnetic field. To make the NPs applicable for brachytherapy, the NPs are doped with holmium (Ho), a lanthanide with high magnetic moment and radioisotope Ho-166. Furthermore, SPIONs and Ho change the relaxivity of water<br/>protons and therefore they can be used as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. This makes it possible to image the NPs during the treatment and enables thermal planning and dose-rate calculations delivered to the cancer tissue to be performed. The incorporation of Ho inside the iron-oxide structure is expected to change the magnetic properties of the NPs. The success of using Ho as contrast agent and for brachytherapy purposes have been proven in several researches. However, the influence of Ho on the heating performance of these SPIONs is unknown. This research will characterize the magnetic properties of undoped and Ho-doped SPIONs and compare them, in order to examine the heating possibilities of Ho-doped NPs. For the synthesis of the NPs a spark discharge generator was used. Spark ablation is a synthesis<br/>method able to yield narrow size distribution of different metallic particles and alloys. However, since spark ablation is relatively new, the synthetic methodology itself had to be developed. Therefore, this research was divided into two parts: 1) the synthesis of NPs using spark ablation and 2) the characterization of Ho-doped iron NPs and the comparison with undoped SPIONs. Since the first part focused on the spark ablation synthesis, the influence of the generator settings on the primary particle size was investigated using DLS and TEM. The VS-Particle generator was able to produce 4 nm Fe-Fe and Ho-Fe NPs, a size that is smaller than expected. The generator settings did not influence the primary particle size and therefore, the settings of the generator were chosen to maximize the yield. The initial set-up had low yield and therefore, the influence of micro-bubbler, electrode configuration and bubbling column were examined and changed to improve the yield. A bronze sintered filter with pore size 0.4-20 ��, solid iron electrodes and 60 mL bubbling column volume appeared to be the most optimal. During the second part of this research, 4 nm Ho-doped iron oxide NPs and un-doped iron oxides were produced. They were characterized using TEM, DLS, XRD, ICP, SEM-EDX, Mössbauer spectroscopy, SQUID and NMR. As a result of low concentrations obtained, no good qualification of the produced particles could be obtained. All particles showed superparamagnetic behavior and influenced the relaxivity times of water protons. To what extend the relaxivity was changed upon doping remains unfortunately unclear, because the composition of the NPs is unknown. It can be concluded that the used set-up was not able to produce reproducible NPs and therefore no reliable characterization could be done on the Ho doped particles. Future research should focus on a more controllable synthesis method to be able to examine the possibilities of Ho for heating purposes.","Nanoparticles; holmium; Heating Properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

Combining balancing with optimal controllability therefore requires an integral design approach. In this thesis, the controllability of multiple balancing principles are compared. Based on these findings a design for a balanced rotatable link will be presented, which aims to combine dynamic balancing with optimal controllability. Experimental verification of the balanced design showed a reduction of 99.3% in reaction forces and 97.8% in reaction moments compared to the unbalanced mechanism.

In recent research of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) it was stated that the sea level will rise more than expected due to climate change . This could influence the flood risk in coastal areas including the Netherlands. In this thesis the influences of the sea level rise on the flood risk for dijkring 14 will be evaluated. Dijkring 14 is located in the coastal area of the Netherlands and contains Rotterdam, the Hague and parts of Utrecht and Amsterdam. It has 3.500.000 inhabitants, consists of an area of 224.000 acres and has the largest potential economic damages. The average elevation of the dijkring is one meter below NAP. The coastal area is protected by hydraulic structures and dunes which are both subjected to an increase of probability of failure due to sea level rise. In this thesis it is assessed if the protection of the coastal area by means of dunes is possible in case of an extreme sea level rise future scenario. With an hydrodynamic flood simulation future flood events dominated by extreme sea level rise are simulated. The hydrodynamic flood simulation is executed by Delft3D Flow FM. In D-Flow FM the unsteady shallow water equations are solved based on the Navier Stokes equations. It solves in 2 dimensions with an average water depth per grid cell. This results in accurate water flow over land. The hydrodynamic flood simulation is verified by comparing the result of the current scenario with the the widely accepted VNK2 model. The validation is executed based on a visual comparison, a inundation depth comparison and a comparison of the estimated damages. This assessment was done for three different breach locations and resulted in a reliable hydrodynamic flood simulation. To estimate the damages that occur during a flood event that is simulated by the hydrodynamic simulation, the Global Flood Risk Tool was used. This tool combined the inundation depth, the land use map and the damage curves and created a damage map. This map represented the estimated damage per area which resulted in a total estimated damage per flood event. Flood risk is determined by a combination of estimated damages and probability of failure. With the hydrodynamic simulation and the Global Flood Risk Tool, damages were estimated for three breach locations and five different future extreme sea level rise flood scenarios. This resulted in a damage estimation for sea level rise scenarios up to two meter rise. The probability of failure is estimated by means of the height that is needed to decrease the probability of failure by a factor ten. Economic optimisation was used to determine the economically optimal probability of failure for each of the scenarios. With the economic optimisation, the cost and benefits of the investments needed to increase the the probability of failure are calculated. These optimal probability of failures were compared to the minimal required probabilities of the 'waterwet' of the Netherlands to determine if the investment is economically acceptable. For two of the three locations it became clear that investing in strengthening the dunes of the coastal area of dijkring 14 is economically acceptable. The third location resulted in a slightly smaller optimal probability of failure. When estimating for the whole coastal area of dijkring 14, it becomes clear the defending the dijkring against flood risk by use of the dunes is possible in future extreme sea level rise scenarios.","Flood Risk; economic optimisation; D-Flow FM; Flood simulation; Hydrodynamic model; Coastal flooding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

One of the possible approaches for improving the connection between the implanted biomaterial and the bone tissue being formed is the incorporation of bioactive agents onto the surface of the biomaterial to promote bone and blood vessel formation. This work investigated the effects of strontium (Sr), a known osteogenic and angiogenic agent, incorporated in surfaces of 3D printed titanium implants on the behaviour of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), to determine its potential role in improving osseointegration by promoting an early development of a well vascularized bone. Methods: 3D printed titanium implants were subjected to plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in electrolytes with and without Sr addition. The effects of Sr incorporated on the surfaces were subsequently tested in vitro by assessing the morphology, proliferation, wound healing ability and angiogenic potential of HUVECs. In addition, a coculture model with conditioned medium from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) was included for investigations of the angiogenic potential. Results: The characterization of the PEO-treated titanium implants confirmed comparable topography and distinct chemical composition of samples treated in electrolytes without (PT) and with Sr (PT-Sr). Despite the good initial attachment, HUVECs showed a tendency to gradually leave both PT and PT-Sr implants. No improvement in proliferation of HUVECs seeded on PT-Sr implants was observed, yielding comparable results with the PT implants. The ions released from the PT and PT-Sr surfaces did not instigate faster wound healing ability of HUVECs and the direct contact of cells with the surfaces did not elicit paracrine signalling which would contribute to faster closure of the wound. The coculture model revealed higher angiogenic potential of HUVECs seeded on the PT and PT-Sr surfaces when cultured in the presence of conditioned media obtained from MSCs, implying the importance of interactions among these cell types for achieving successful bone repair. Discussion and conclusions: Comparison of the obtained data and evidence found in the literature implied that the 3D printed and PEO-treated implants could not support thriving of endothelial cells, most probably due to the topography and associated roughness of the surfaces given by the method employed for the 3D printing of these implants. However, with consideration to the physical and chemical complexity of the implants, further tests will have to be conducted to validate these assumptions.","Strontium; Implants; Osseointegration; Angiogenesis; HUVECs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-16","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the current built environment, the three main glass elements are glass window blocks, (structural) float glass and (structural) glass bricks. Float glass is the most used type of glass element and it is evolving from a skin material to a structural material. Glass hollow blocks became popular in the 1930s, but have lost their appeal due to little structural capacity and outdated aesthetics. A new and upcoming technique is the usage of cast glass bricks, which provides high structural performance without the use of substructures. The 21st century is unmistakably characterized by climate change and the effort being put into the battle against it. It is the duty of engineers to design in a sustainable way. ‘Sustainable’ can be interpreted in many ways; the focus within this paper lies on the usage of recycled materials, the recyclability of the final product and the energy usage during the lifespan of the façade (linked to thermal performance). When looking at the material itself, glass is a very recyclable material. This is widely done for glass bottles. However, the recyclability of float glass is very limited. Windowpanes and structural glass panes both consists of several layers of glass, combined with a PVB interlayer. Mostly, these combined panes are themselves processed further into insulated glass units, or IGUs. This end product consists of many different materials, that are hard to separate and for this reason, IGUs are seldom recycled at this moment. Additionally, not only the end product is rarely recycled, little recycled material is used for the production of float glass. The tolerances for using waste cullet in the production of float glass is very limited. Since the lifecycle cannot easily be changed for float glass, it is interesting to look into cast glass. The production technique is different from the production of float glass. Glass is melted into a mould, rather than spread along a bath of tin. The latest research shows the possibilities of using glass cullet and thus casting waste glass. One opportunity that arises from this, is the development of waste glass bricks. One main problem of cast glass bricks is its thermal performance. Due to the lack of cavities, as present in IGUs or hollow glass bricks the thermal performance is not optimal, especially with the increasing need for high-performing facades to meet sustainability demands. There are several strategies to improve the thermal performance of glass structures. The most simple solution for reducing the thermal transmittance is the introduction of air pockets or cavities. Air is a relatively good insulator, especially in small confined geometries. Convection reduces the thermal resistance of air and the bigger the air pocket, the more convection can occur. Not only air can provide insulation, this can also be done with other materials. Inert gasses, like argon and krypton, have a lower thermal conductivity than glass, but are more costly and would require a more complex production process to fill the cavity and to ensure complete sealing. Translucent solutions can be achieved with materials like aerogel and glass fibres. Light transmittance is still present, but the result is not transparent. If transparency or translucency is completely ignored, traditional insulation materials, like rock wool and polystyrene, could increase the thermal resistance too. Improvements can also be made with either reducing the amount of as long-wave, infrared energy going through the glass utilizing coatings or by reducing the conductivity of the glass itself by changing the molecular build-up. The glass recipe influences the thermal conductivity. This thesis focuses on the thermal performance of cast glass bricks and in specifically the investigation of the impact of cavities on the thermal performance and the development of a relevant production method for cavity cast glass bricks. Air cavities can be added on either system-level or element-level. On a system-level, the design of a singular brick does not change, but the typology in which it is used does. Cavity walls with either a double brick wall or with an additional float glass wall will improve the thermal performance but will utilize a lot more material. When changing the geometry of the brick itself, one or more cavities can be introduced to improve the performance. Since smaller cavities have a relatively better performance, multiple small cavities will automatically perform better than a singular larger cavity. Several designs are drawn, varying from a single or double cavity to an arrangement of glass shards, providing lots of encapsulated air pockets. Thermal bridges within a design influence the overall thermal performance. The heat will choose the path with the least resistance, which is via the glass. It is possible to lengthen the path that the heat must undertake, by introducing multiple air chambers and increasing the overall thickness of the brick. This increased thickness will also aid the structural performance. Creating multiple air pockets is directly linked to many glass-air transitions and thus a more complex geometry and production process. Producing such a brick with current standard manufacturing techniques would require glue. Glueing is not very environmentally friendly. The glue is not easily (if not impossible) to remove and therefore the final product is not recyclable. With experimental research, the potential of tack fusing glass is highlighted. This ‘tack fusing’ is done at a temperature below the actual fusing temperature, where the glass still creates a permanent bond, without relaxation and shape loss. This temperature lies around the dilatometric softening point of the specific glass type. The potential of the tack fusing method is explored employing shear tests of fused specimens. Three types of specimens are tested: two different series of tack fused specimens at 650˚C (1hr, 3hr dwell at top temperature) and one series of glued samples (DELO 4468) to be used as a reference. DELO4468 is a high-performance glue, which is mostly used for its high strength. Nine design concepts are drawn, based on a solid brick of 200x200x100 mm. Seven element-based designs are limited within these boundaries since increased thickness (even with only glass) would lead to higher thermal performance. Two system-level alternatives are not in-depth researched but are still examined as reference. These two alternatives cannot be kept within these boundaries and are thus at increased depth of the finished wall. All nine designs are scored in a multi-criteria analysis. The main focus is the thermal performance and therefore the thermal transmittance of each design needs to be analysed. This is for eight out of nine designs done with TRISCO, a steady-state 3D thermal analysis software. The last design, a fused shard brick, consisting of a random arrangement of random-shaped shards and is not easily modelled in 3D software. For this reason, it is not analysed in TRISCO but analysed through an experimental analysis. This experiment replicates a situation in which one side of the brick is warmer than the other while measuring the temperatures and heat fluxes. With these measurements, the thermal transmittance can be estimated. The last part of this thesis is the multi-criteria analysis, or MCA, in which all alternatives are scored against several criteria. One of these criteria is the thermal performance, others are sustainability, producibility, aesthetical potential and transparency. The sustainability is scored against several checks, related to the recyclability and the required temperature for production. The producibility and the aesthetical potential is scored utilizing a small expert survey. Both criteria are subjective of nature, but by including the opinion of several experts, the outcome is inter-subjective. The transparency is scored regarding the number of refractive surfaces (because with each air-glass transition visibility is lost due to reflections) and the percentage of non-transparent materials in the cross-section. The result of this thesis is not a single design, but insights in the potential of each concept. All designs are not ready for direct application but would require further structural verification and thermal optimisation, depending on the governing thermal requirements. There is not one perfect solution since each façade has different performance requirements, but the results do provide insights for an improvement from the current technologies.","Structural glass; Glass; Cast glass; TRISCO; tack fusing; Recycling; sustainability; Thermal Performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Orthopaedic implant loosening is one of the main causes of revision surgeries, leading to increases in the costs of patient care and patient dissatisfaction. Better osseointegration could lead to higher success rates of primary interventions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can undergo osteogenic differentiation on the implant surfaces, promoting the implant osseointegration. Alternatively, they can commit to other differentiation paths (e.g., fibroblasts) and thus hinder the osseointegration and functionality of the implant. It is therefore fundamental to promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSC at the surface of the implant to ensure enhanced osseointegration and thus its long term success. Among the available strategies that promote osteogenic differentiation, nano and micro-scale physical patterns have proved effective but the underlying mechanisms that induce these cellular changes are not yet understood. Cellular adhesion to the surface is believed to be the key process regulating mechanotransduction (i.e., extrinsic cell signalling) and subsequently, the mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation. Nevertheless, no quantitative systematic study has been performed in order to establish the relationship between the cell adhesion and the differentiation behaviour. Furthermore, the available cellular adhesion studies are only qualitative or semi-quantitative in nature. In this work, novel fluid force microscopy (FFM) technique has been employed to characterize the adhesion properties induced by a set of osteogenic and a set of non-osteogenic submicron patterns. Methods: Two sets of substrates consisting of arrays of submicron pillars with known osteogenic potential were manufactured by means of two photon polymerization. Preosteoblast mouse cells were cultured on the patterns and on a flat control surface. The adhesion properties (i.e., the force and work of adhesion) were measured by FFM after 4 and 24 hours of cell culture. The cellular behaviour picture was completed by assessing the Young’s modulus of the living cells attached on the patterns and on the control surface. Likewise, the topographical and mechanical mapping was performed by using atomic force microscopy system. Results: In this study, the adhesion of preosteoblast cells was successfully quantified on two types of submicron pattern with known osteogenic potential, and compared to cellular adhesion data on a flat control. Therefore, the fluid force microscopy (FFM) was applied for the first time. The trend indicated that cells seeded on the osteogenic substrate adhered stronger (mean force of adhesion = 159 ± 74 nN) than cells on the non-osteogenic substrate (mean force of adhesion = 108 ± 104 nN) after 24h of incubation. Moreover, the cells adopted different morphologies and spatial distribution of the Young’s modulus depending on the culture substrate.","submicron pillars; atomic force microscopy; fluid force microscopy; preosteoblast cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-16","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Bioelectronics","",""

The focus of this thesis project lies on transferring a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) from its original orbit to a safe, stable and easily accessible location with respect to the Earth using low-thrust engines. It has been decided to aim for a final state in a heliocentric orbit, but in the vicinity of the Earth. By means of a selection process in which a constrained set of NEA’s were assessed for the required velocity impulse to transfer them to the Earth, the choice was made to use the asteroid 2006 RH120 for this research study. A stability analysis was performed, where fictional objects were placed in states that differed in two different Kepler elements with respect to the state of the Earth. These objects were subsequently propagated for 100 years and their behaviour during this time frame was analysed. It was found that by adding at least 0.03 to the eccentricity of the state of the Earth would result in a safe, stable and easily accessible orbit with respect to the Earth. The final phase of this study was to design the actual transfer trajectory from the asteroid’s initial orbit to this suitable state. A preliminary analytical analysis using the hodographic method was performed to obtain the most optimal combination of the departure date and time of flight, as well as creating a good initial guess for the upcoming numerical analysis. This was performed using Sims-Flanagan’s method, of which the originally implemented software in Tudat was modified to enable the inclusion of perturbing forces working on the asteroid throughout its trajectory, for increased realism. The results obtained by Sims-Flanagan’s method using several of the analysed initial guesses were around 1000 m/s for the required total velocity impulse and 1.75 N for the maximum thrust force. Due to the complexity of the problem, the use of Sims-Flanagan’s method and despite tuning of the algorithm, a small mismatch halfway the trajectory persisted, which caused the asteroid to not reach the exact most desired final state. It is therefore recommended to perform a better tuning of the algorithm to obtain a zero mismatch, with which the desired final state will be reached.","Asteroid Capture; Low-thrust trajectories; Stability Analysis; Optimisation; Sims-Flanagan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In this paper, we present AvoidBench, a benchmarking suite capable of evaluating the performance of vision-based obstacle avoidance algorithms for multi-rotors in simulation. Utilising a set of performance metrics, AvoidBench assigns performance scores to obstacle avoidance algorithms by subjecting them to a series of tasks. Using both Airsim and Unreal engine under the hood, we are able to provide high-fidelity visuals and dynamics, leading to a relatively small gap between simulation and reality. AvoidBench comes included with a simple, but powerful C++ and Python API which provides functionality for procedural environment generation, custom benchmark design, and an easy-to-use framework for users to implement their own vision-based obstacle avoidance methods.

To cope with the effects of land subsidence, detailed information on which mechanisms are causing subsidence and its variation over time and space are needed. Subsidence studies predominantly focus on grass and agricultural areas with organic soils above the groundwater level. In this study, subsidence is also evaluated for dikes and the urban environment. It is attempted to model subsidence behaviour of four different projects, grass plots within the Krimpenerwaard polder, locations along the N3 Dordrecht, an embankment constructed for the A5 Badhoevedorp and locations along the Markermeerdikes, and to verify these model results with subsidence measurements available. Existing one-dimensional models for different subsidence components are used in the evaluations. For grass and agricultural areas it is found that subsidence behaviour could be modelled and the results lie within the range of uncertainty of the subsidence measurements used. However, the equations used are often empirical and do not include all relevant inﬂuencing factors and couplings. Compression by degradation of organic material as a response to drainage of organic soil is the main subsidence component in these areas. Anaerobic degradation of organic material is also included in the modelling approach, a component that is often neglected in other subsidence studies. Two infrastructure related projects provided insight to subsidence components in the urban environment. Compression by loading is the main subsidence component relevant in this area type, and thus settlement models are suitable to approximate the subsidence behaviour. However, a slight underestimation of creep shows that the existence of a small additional subsidence component for a situation with soft soil layers pushed below the water table could not be excluded. Unravelling subsidence behaviour from dikes showed to be more complicated, where an interplay between different components is relevant. Based on the evaluation in this study compression by loading and compression by an oxidation or shrinkage component are indicated the main subsidence components. Many uncertainties and assumptions used in this evaluation inﬂuenced the results. For all area types disentangling subsidence into contributions of separate components based on a total measured subsidence signal causes large uncertainties, as modelled subsidence contributions for individual components could not be veriﬁed.","Land subsidence; Modelling; Settlement; Oxidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

However, in the early phases of automation, penetration rate of these vehicles will be very low. This would lead to a mixed traffic situation where AVs will coexist and interact with other human driven vehicles (HDVs). This one to one interaction might lead to change in driving behavior of HDVs when they interact with AVs. Thus it is crucial to understand the behavioral adaptation of HDVs due to their interaction with AVs. A field test was conducted to gain insights about such behavioral adaptation focusing on gap acceptance, car following, and overtaking behavior. Furthermore, learning effet over multiple interactions with AVs, effect of positive and negative information, stress during interaction and trust in AVs were also studies. This research concludes following findings. First, significantly lower critical gaps were accepted during interaction with AVs. Second, significantly lower headways were found at the end of overtaking during interaction with AVs. Third, higher trust was reported in AV scenarios. Fourth, positive information leaded to even closer interactions with AVs in comparison to HDVs. These findings indicate the potential exploitation of AV technology by HDV-drivers.","Automated vehicles; behavioural adaptation; mixed traffic; car following; overtaking; gap acceptance; critical gap; trust; self driving; human driven vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","SAMEN",""

With the perpetual increase in number of road vehicles, comes the inevitable problems of traffic and pollution. Various intelligent traffic technologies and strategies have been proposed and implemented over the years to overcome the road traffic problems.  Platooning is identified as one of the ways to tackle transportation related problems efficiently. Even though platooning has been tested and implemented in highways, not much attention has been given to controlling the platoons at urban roads. When vehicles in the platoon are connected and automated, it helps them to understand the environment better and communicate efficiently for better performance. Platoons at the vicinity of signalized intersections need to accelerate and decelerate in a nonlinear manner which leads to higher energy consumption and longer travel time. Most of the previous research approaches focused on optimizing only the energy consumption or travel time of the platoons. However, studies show that the recommended driving advice from the controllers is not tracked by the drivers completely. The current research focuses on optimal trajectory planning of the electric vehicle platoons at signalized intersections. This is done by designing an energy efficient longitudinal controller for the platoons using optimal control method. The goal of this thesis is split between planning and tracking the trajectory. Thus the optimal speed profile is planned by the high level controller (i.e the optimal controller) and tracked using a battery electric vehicle model controlled by a low level controller (i.e a PID controller). The performance of the controlled platoon was verified using different scenarios and was found to perform positively under respective control objectives and constraints. The designed controlled and automated platoon by the optimal controller was able to achieve energy consumption and cost saving up to 67% when compared with intelligent driver model (IDM) platoon for a specific scenario. This research is a collaboration between the Research Institute of Highways (RIOH) in China and Rijkswaterstaat, Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management in The Netherlands, to overcome the common traffic problems on road. The research was carried out at the ITS-Edulab, a Dutch traffic and transport laboratory for students. It is a cooperation between Rijkswaterstaat and the Transport &amp; Planning group of the Delft University of Technology.","Platooning; Electric Vehicles; Energy consumption; Nonlinear Optimisation; Optimal Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Stecca, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The need for proper fast charging infrastructures is one of the key challenges for the wide adoption of elec- trical vehicles (EV). The high pulsating demand of fast charging stations (FCS) together with high demand tariffs can cause monthly DSO demand charges to account for a significant fraction of a station’s electric bill. Therefore, weakening the business case for stations located in these high tariff regions. To tackle this issue, demand charge management (DCM) can be applied to suppress peak power demands at FCSs using battery energy storage systems (BESS). This enables the reduction of cost while retaining the station’s fast charging capabilities. However, the implementation of such systems remains a large investment and the proper BESS sizing in fast charging applications is not well studied. This thesis proposes a multi-objective approach for optimal BESS sizing at FCSs considering demand charges and station performance. A BESS assisted FCS model is formulated to analyse the performance of a station’s design based on power flow, charging delays and the expected BESS lifetime. Furthermore, based on a worst-case demand scenario, a multi-objective optimization framework is formulated using the genetic algorithm NSGA-II to obtain the optimal BESS and grid-tie sizing for an existing FCS. Lastly, with demand data measured at four FCSs in the Netherlands, a set of numerical case studies has been conducted in the Mosaik and Pymoo environments to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed formulation. These case studies provide new insights on the demand charge reduction and optimal sizing regarding dif- ferent station characteristics, BESS prices, and demand tariffs. These insights show how the FCS utilization rate and installed capacity can effect the optimal BESS sizing and how different demand tariffs or BESS cost can result in different optimal power to energy (P/E) ratios, and thus affecting the performance of a BESS.","Battery energy storage system (BESS); demand charge management; Electrical Vehicles; fast charging stations; genetic algorithm; Multi-Objective Optimiation; NSGA II","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Brachytherapy has become a common treatment for this disease. In this form of radiotherapy, sealed radiation sources are placed through a implant catheters inside the prostate. This treatment affects the tumor cells locally and reduces damage to healthy tissues. However, accessing all relevant areas is met by difficulties. Innovating brachytherapy instruments can overcome these challenges. These new instruments need to be tested in a lab environment before patient testing is allowed. Phantom models provide a good validation model for testing new medical instruments. The goal of this study is to design and develop a cancerous prostate phantom model which can be used to test newly developed instruments for brachytherapy. <br/>A material study was conducted to find the best mechanically tissue-mimicking materials. The effects of different concentrations, varying volumes, coolant additive and dimethyl-sulfoxide additive on the Young's modulus of poly-vinyl alcohol was tested. Unconfined compression tests were performed after each freeze-thaw cycle for a total of 7 cycles. These results showed that poly-vinyl alcohol can form material which, based on its Young's modulus, can mimic prostate tissue and adipose tissue. An increase in poly-vinyl alcohol concentration, volume, coolant additive, dimethyl-sulfoxide additive and the number of freeze-thaw cycles were each found to increase the Young's modulus of the material. <br/>Three cancerous prostate phantom models were made of poly-vinyl material with each a different stiffness value achieved by varying the poly-vinyl alcohol concentrations. A low Young's modulus for model 1, medium for model 2 and high for model 3. The poly-vinyl alcohol was solved in a mixture of distilled water:DMSO (10:90 ratio) to produce a transparent material. Each model included a prostate, urethra and surrounding adipose tissue. The models were surrounded by a transparent casing which included an opening and template for needle insertion at the front. A pubic bone was added to model 2 and 3 to simulate prostate blockage by this tissue. Model 1 and 2 did not achieve the transparency that was required. The transparency was found to be sufficient in model 3. <br/>A needle insertion experiment was conducted to validate the prostate phantom models. An 18Gauge brachytherapy needle was inserted 13, 10 and 20 times in model 1, 2 and 3 respectively with a velocity of 5 mm/s. Mean peak forces, describing the force upon puncture of the prostate material, for model 1 (0.57 N) and 2 (3.54 N) were lower than multiple peak forces found in literature. The median peak force of model 3 (6.17 N) came close to the peak force found during in patients with prostate cancer (6.28 N) in the study of Podder et al. (2006). Higher Young's moduli values produced higher peak forces. The insertion force in the adipose tissue of the models was lower than the results found in literature. <br/>This study has shown that poly-vinyl alcohol can function as an easily controlled tissue mimicking material. The material study created an overview of the effects of concentration, volume, coolant, DMSO and freeze-thaw cycles on the Young's modulus of poly-vinyl alcohol. An easy to manufacture cancerous prostate phantom model was made of poly-vinyl alcohol and DMSO. Model 3 developed in this project can function as a test model for newly developed instruments meant for brachytherapy.","Phantom; Prostate cancer; Medical instrument; PVA; brachytherapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The approach includes experimental and numerical investigations for fatigue and corrosion damage. In the experimental part, specimens with and without marine growth have been designed, manufactured, and subjected to a series of experiments to determine the transmission characteristics of ultrasound waves through marine growth and its interaction with damage. Fatigue crack signals were simulated on the specimens using Hus-Nelson source. For the investigated compositions, the signal amplitude drop due to the presence of marine growth. Accelerated corrosion experiments were conducted to reproduce corrosion-induced acoustic emissions. Corrosion-induced signals were successfully detected and localized. Active ultrasound experiments were conducted using guided waves. These waves were successfully excited and measured in the test sample with naturally-cultured marine growth. The investigation suggests that guided waves can have a high potential for identification of fatigue cracks in the mooring chains. These experiments were complemented with numerical simulation of the setup. For the sake of computational efficiency and accuracy, a higher-order spectral finite element method was used.

The literature study is performed to gain insight into the unique behavioural aspects of PCSPs, and to find where the current issues arise regarding the already-present prediction models.

This FE-model has the possibility to include the non-linearity of all materials. In order to verify the correctness of the full behaviour of this model, it has been compared to experiments from literature. Additionally, a simple linear analytical model is developed, with the goal to make PCSPs easy-to-use in practice, so that people without knowledge about the background-calculations are still able to make use of these floors. This analytical model is compared to the linear version of the FE-model. On top of this, the Reinbouw project from Lievense | WSP is used to analyse what the bottlenecks are in their current design of a fully prefabricated structure. Based on these bottlenecks, a calculation is done to find the required resistances of the PCSPs to ensure a structurally verified structure. Both the linear prediction model and the Reinbouw project are combined at the end, where an advice is given on the PCSP-design in the Reinbouw project.

The main selling points for a fluid bearing is the high load capacity and reduced vibrations. However, the bearing's lifetime is not infinite and can be improved. The performance and lifetime of bearings can be improved by altering the bearing surface, called texturing. Texturing of the surface can increase the load capacity, reduce friction, and have other beneficial attributes towards the bearing performance. Current research proves that smart fluids can increase the performance and lifetime of seals and bearings even further [1-5]. In this thesis, the concept of creating dynamic texturing with the use of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid, a smart fluid, as lubrication is researched. The fluid in combination with a magnetic field changes the fluid rheological property, resulting in a dynamic texture made out of particles. These particles form chains in the presence of a magnetic field which results in sedimentation acting as a texture. Hence an extra design variable to adjust performance is added to the bearing system with the use of the MR fluid and magnets. The aim of the thesis is to demonstrate the self-healing of the dynamic textures, demonstrate the influences of parameters as rotational speed, changes of the rotational speed, magnetic field strength, and particle mass percentage.

In The Netherlands, the Proton therapy centers currently take a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 compared to photons to deliver an iso-effective treatment. However, initial clinical evidence indicates a variable proton RBE in brain patients with the linear energy transfer (LET) as an important physical parameter. The LET significantly increases at the end of the radiation field, and contributes to an increased probability to develop brain lesions. With the introduction of radiation response models, the first goal of this thesis is to evaluate the impact of the RBE/LET effect in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans. Furthermore, the main goal is to reduce the RBE/LET effect in treatment planning.<br/><br/>We incorporated the probability of lesions origin (POLO) model published in literature to determine the RBE model-based normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for three glioma patients treated with IMPT at HollandPTC, The Netherlands. The dose and LET distributions were computed using a Monte Carlo system. For the investigation of the RBE/LET effect in treatment planning, we modified several beam settings of the clinical IMPT plan, including the beam angle, beam energy, and robustness. Furthermore, we combined treatment modalities to reduce the NTCP.<br/><br/>We compared the results of the clinically used IMPT plan with the results obtained by the modified IMPT plans. The local redistribution of LETd leads to a decrease in NTCP up to the point when the LETd becomes uniform. The robustness did not reveal deviations in terms of the NTCP. By choosing appropriate beam angles that result in a smeared out<br/>LETd distribution, the NTCP does not improve for small deep located tumors, improves relatively modest by 11.6% for elongated tumors, and significantly improves by 37.0% for large, superficially located tumors. The inclusion of partial transmission beams lowers the NTCP by 30-50% relative to the clinical IMPT plan while limiting the relative increase in mean brain dose by 5-16%. When comparing the IMPT plan with the photon plan used for plan comparison, the VMAT plan always results in the lowest NTCP and provides a relative improvement in NTCP by 60-75%. Meanwhile, the mean brain dose significantly increases by 50-80% compared to the clinical IMPT plan. Intermediate NTCP-Dmean(brain minus CTV) values are achieved when combining protons with the photons or by including proton transmission beams.<br/><br/>In general, we can conclude that the inclusion of partial proton transmission beams is more promising than choosing appropriate beam angles to lower the RBE/LETd effect. However, further optimization of transmission beams is required. Moreover, an improvement in NTCP is always at the cost of the mean dose to healthy tissue. On top, our results support further investigation to combine different modalities, like protons and photon fractionation.","Proton Therapy; Radiotherapy; Radiobiology; Relative Biological Effectiveness; Linear Energy Transfer; Cancer; IMPT; Radiation induced brain lesions; Glioma","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","",""

However, the problem is that often experimental data are polluted with noise. This causes symbolic regressors to capture the noise but not the underlying physics. In this work, we leverage the noise reduction properties of non-parametric machine learning, to improve symbolic regression methods. This combination allows for numerically robust differentiation and significantly increases the noise tolerance of common symbolic regressors. A new strategy is exemplified by combining Gaussian processes and the symbolic regression toolbox SINDy for finding governing equations from data. The method balances the quality of the fit and parsimony to avoid overfitting. The method is tested on well-known dynamical systems with varying properties.

What is financialization, why does it occur, and is it problematic? It can be described as the financial sector increasing in size and importance relative to the real economy (including, for example, in terms of business practice and policy making) because of, amongst other reasons, redirected investments. When real economic growth slowed down, attention shifted to financial growth, often expressed in profit. According to several studies, this has led to rising inequality and economic instability. Its occurrence appears to be related to an emphasis on (Neoclassical) profit maximization. In recent times, this is expressed as shareholder value maximization, which became the goal of business activity. The emphasis is arguably unjustified, because theoretical assumptions on which the goal depends, including the presence of the Neoclassical perfectly competitive market, no longer hold in current real-world conditions (they appear more oligopolistic). Perhaps therefore, the prescription of profit maximization is no longer valid. Is the solution to try and return to perfect competition? Considering the aforementioned consequences, maybe it is time to visit other ideas too. The purpose of this thesis is to find elements of an economic model and especially a business model, that would provide a different economic goal. Ideally, a goal that, through our economic activities, would enable individuals to develop themselves and to participate in a stable economic system. Based on theoretical and empirical research, the thesis presents several building blocks for an alternative business model, relating to three realms of human existence: cultural-scientific, practical-economic and legal-political.1 From Aristotelian literature2 follows that eudaimonia would be the human goal (rather than Benthamite-utilitarian utility maximization).The cultural-scientific sphere would encompass what is referred to, by for example Wilken (1982) as, the Geistesleben. There would be freedom of thought, which contributes to development of, what Aristotle calls, virtues, which are essential towards eudaimonia. Financial literacy (Houghton Budd, 2017) might be instrumental. It would mean everyone would understand accounting and (also practice) bookkeeping in particular. An analogy with a mirror demonstrates that accounting shows what is happening. It is neutral yet it allows people to see what is going on, and thereby hold each other accountable. The practical-economic sphere would be devoted to fulfilling the material needs of people. It is important to note that this would not include limitless wants (which means the consumer is not insatiable). The underlying idea for economic activity would be the implementation of the ‘just price’3. A just price ensures that the costs of production are covered, but also, and this is an elaboration, the intellectual or spiritual input. The just price would be paid for the product of labour, and the input of the Geist of the producer. Labour would not be traded in a market because then remuneration might fall below that what is needed. Undeniably, the fact that there would be no labour market has huge implications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The absence of an infrastructure for alternative fuels in the current port environment is one of the barriers towards implementation of these high potential fuels. The goal of this thesis project was to create an optimization model which can provide more insight into the initial sizing, phased growth and corresponding cost of an infrastructure needed for maritime transport using different forms of alternative fuels. The corresponding main research question is: ""How do the port refueling infrastructures of sodium borohydrate, liquid hydrogen and gaseous hydrogen compare to each other with respect to costs and supply chain set-up in terms of where, when, and at what sizes to build up the production, storage, distribution and refueling facilities?"" To answer this research question a single-objective multi-period mathematical optimisation model (Mixed Integer Programming) has been created for the port refueling environment. The most important model innovations are the inclusion of a maritime refueling convention and the possibility to model less conventional alternative fuels such as sodium borohydrate (NaBH4). Furthermore, input for the model has been gathered from several sources. Next, some parameters of the model have been varied to research their effect on the total alternative fuel infrastructure. As a result it has been found that the gaseous hydrogen infrastructure is the cheapest with respect to facility capital costs and facility operating costs, but was the most expensive when looking at transportation of the fuel within the port. The liquefied hydrogen was the cheapest with respect to fuel transportation, but scored average on facility capital cost. Furthermore it is the most expensive infrastructure with respect to facility operating cost. The NaBH4-infrastructure is the most expensive infrastructure when looking at the facility capital cost, but scores average on facility operating cost and transportation cost. Overall the gaseous hydrogen infrastructure was the cheapest infrastructure, followed by liquefied hydrogen. The NaBH4-infrastructure turned out to be the most expensive with the current input. The input parameters for NaBH4 are still very uncertain at this stage as the production of this fuel on a large scale is still at a low Technology Readiness Level and there is still unfamiliarity with large scale storage and transport of the substance. A reduction in the corresponding cost parameters would lead to the NaBH4-infrastructure becoming more competitive with a liquefied hydrogen infrastructure. The input used in the model should thus be further researched to reduce the corresponding uncertainties. While the current model focuses on optimising the infrastructure from a cost perspective, it must be taken into account that other factors also influence the favouring of certain alternative fuels, such as safety, policy, public acceptance and the preference for certain fuels from the perspective of the maritime users. In future research the expansion of the model towards a multi-objective model should be evaluated.","supply chain; infrastructure; mathematical optimisation; Port; alternative fuels; NaBH4; Hydrogen; Maritime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

While studying the properties of this lithology, the existence of cave systems at great depths was highlighted, since their presence can lead to drilling related problems, as well as change the flow direction of fluids in the subsurface. The possibility of predicting their orien- tations, dimensions and mechanical stability in the subsurface would therefore be of great help in the hydrocarbon business, which is why in this study, thanks to data provided by a Lidar laser scanner, a dimensional analysis of caves’ conduits related to their position within the karst system is performed. The origin of caves can be hypogenic or epigenic and they can present different patterns of distribution of conduits. When deformation events cause the generation of orthogonal sets of joints in the rock layers and fractures intersect with each other and with bedding planes, the fluid flow in the subsurface becomes channelized into these features. The combination of this and speleogenetic processes leads to the development of maze caves, whose conduits’ dimensions vary within a system as a consequence of differences of continuity and connectivity along a fracture network. Variations in the shapes of caves’ conduits can be observed as well, depending on the supply of sediment and the position relative to the water table during dissolution. Mechanical deformation of karst systems can be simulated by using the linear elastic deformation mathematical model. In this way it is possible to study the influence that mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio have on the mechanical stability of caves in the subsurface.","Caves; maze caves; Carbonate Reservoirs; Speleogenesis; mechanical deformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the World Health Organization, ninety-three percent of all deaths due to the disease occurred in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This large percentage is directly correlated to the lack of diagnostic tools in those developing countries. Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is a critical aspect of efforts to control the disease. Microscopic examination of a blood smear remains the clinical gold standard for malaria diagnosis. However, this examination is subjective and requires a highly experienced and skilled microscopist. Next to that, it is a labor-intensive procedure that is very time-consuming. Automated hematology analyzers that are currently available are of high cost and therefore only suitable for laboratories and not for a local doctor’s practice. The objective of this research was to provide the design of a compact and affordable compliant XY positioning stage that can be integrated into a microscope to be used for automated malaria diagnosis in developing countries without the involvement of a laboratory. The challenge imposed with this objective is that compliant stages can only reach small strokes due to the inherent imperfection of flexures. Achieving long-stroke results in high stresses and cross-axis coupling between the two motion axes which is undesired. This challenge is solved by implementing a constraint-based method that results in a design with parallel kinematics and modular structure that exhibits high geometric decoupling. A demonstrator of the precision stage is 3D-printed out of PLA and used for performance evaluation measurements. The demonstrator managed to achieve the set requirements for blood smear analysis. Therefore, it can be concluded that the stage was designed successfully and it can be implemented for automated malaria diagnosis to help Africa control the disease.","Compliant mechanism; XY positioning stage; Long-stroke; Compact design; Malaria diagnosis; Microscope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Forward dynamics simulation can be valuable in the development process. It can reduce the need for intermediate prototypes and tests. Currently, there are 3D simulations of healthy walking and kinematic models of common prosthesis like the 3R60. However, they have not yet been combined. Such a model could function as a baseline for newly developed prostheses. It would also open possibilities for researchers to modify the prosthesis design by analyzing different scenarios in simulations. In this paper an existing 3D neuromuscular model of a healthy human is adjusted so that it represents a trans-femoral amputee with a 3R60. The model is simulated walking with an average velocity of 0.9 m/s and 1.2 m/s. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing gait differences between the healthy and amputee model to findings from literature. The simulated amputee gait agrees well with literature, especially for a velocity of 1.2m/s. When walking 0.9 m/s the model oscillates in the coronal plane, suggesting it has difficulty maintaining balance. Furthermore, a case study was done on fall prevention using a control<br/>moment gyroscope embedded in the prosthetic shank. The control moment gyroscope increases the ability to flex and extend the prosthetic knee, which can help with fall prevention. With the added control moment gyroscope the gait at 1.2 m/s became more symmetric. A fall was prevented after a trip using a control moment gyroscope, however, this simulation is numerically too sensitive to draw conclusions.","control moment gyroscope; fall prevention; gait simulation; neuromuscular model; trans-femoral amputee","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/nathantim/amputee_gait_simulation GitHub repository","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","For a long time, scientists believed that it is not possible to achieve a better microscopic resolution than half the wavelength of light (~ 200 nm). During the last decades, various super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques have been developed, offering high-resolution imaging beyond the diffraction limit. It has been established as one of the major tools currently available for the study and analysis of biological tissues. The observation of, previously limited and unclear, cellular structures has demonstrated the great promise of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy in exemplifying biological processes at the cellular level. Inherently, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is based upon acquiring a sequence of diffraction-limited images, consisting of localizations of sparsely distributed emitting fluorophores. Next, precise and accurate estimates of the spatial coordinates of the fluorophores, placed on the structures of interest, are made. Subsequently, all recovered emitter positions from each frame are combined, and a super-resolution image is generated. One of the most crucial questions in SMLM concerns the precision with which the location of a single molecule can be determined. The Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) is used to quantify the estimation performance in terms of localization precision. Recently, several modulation enhanced methods have shown resolution improvement by combining structured patterned illumination with SMLM techniques, such as MINFLUX and SIMFLUX. However, the analysis of images by SMLM and these modulation enhanced methods requires sparse activation regions to prevent overlap between active emitters. Recently, several methods have been developed with the ability to analyze higher density data, allowing partial overlap between emitters. In this work, we propose a maximum likelihood-based, modulation enhanced SMLM method able to localize multiple active emitters within a single region of interest (ROI), which we refer to as Multi- SIMFLUX. The mathematical framework of the algorithm is comprehensively built up throughout this work. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated, and validated under a wide range of realistic imaging conditions. This involves various active-emitter densities, different emitter- and background intensities, numerous emitter configurations, a multitude of ROI-sizes and point spread function widths. As theoretically expected, our approach significantly outperforms conventional 2DGaussian SMLM with a twofold improvement factor in terms of localization precision for various emitter densities and intensities. At higher active emitter imaging densities, the extension from a single to a multi-emitter approach showed a clear improvement in recall fraction.","Localization Microscopy; Multi-emitter; modulation enhanced","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The world is faced with two concurrent trends. The first is the growing demand for air travel in the long term. The second is the need to cut aircraft emissions due to environmental goals and ambitions set by authorities. Fully-electric aircraft are currently infeasible due to the limited battery specific energy and power. Hybrid-electric propulsion (HEP) technology offers an intermediate solution. HEP can work in tandem with new aircraft designs, which potentially leads to further reductions in fuel and energy consumption. This study aims to quantify those reductions. A parallel HEP aircraft mission simulation framework 'MASS' has been developed at Netherlands Aerospace Centre. Earlier studies with MASS have pointed out that HEP retrofit aircraft have the potential to reduce fuel consumption. The expectation is that even more fuel can be saved by varying the HEP parameters and airframe geometry together. Hence, this study focuses on extending MASS to incorporate new aircraft designs. The extension is made in Matlab and involves adding the capability to calculate aircraft level aerodynamics and weight based on the geometry. A tool called 'OpenVSP' is used to generate the aircraft geometry. Then, the aircraft drag polar is constructed using a combination of the aerodynamic solver 'VSPAero' and handbook methods. Maximum deviation between predicted and actual drag for the relevant lift coefficients is 7.3%. The weight is calculated using Class-II estimation methods. Two separate sets of formulae are used: One is meant for the tube-and-wing (TAW) configuration whereas the other is dedicated to blended wing-body (BWB). The predicted operational empty mass deviates less than 1% from the reference for TAW aircraft, and 2.3% for BWB. HEP-related research is currently focused on large passenger aircraft. In this study an A320neo aircraft is used as reference aircraft, which is parallel HEP retrofitted. It is subjected to hybrid-electric powertrain and geometry variations in order to quantify the potential fuel burn reductions. During the variation studies, the same mission of 800 nm and 150 pax is simulated. The selected powertrain design variables are the engine core scaling and the power split. The latter is the electric power provided by the batteries to the engine, divided by the total amount of power. The idea of using the power split is to support the downscaled engine core during high thrust phases, which would otherwise not have enough power. A design of experiments is conducted prior to the unconstrained optimization for minimal fuel burn. The optimization is performed directly using Matlab function 'fmincon'. The powertrain optimum shows a 3.1% fuel burn reduction. The geometry variation is done in two ways: one involves planform changes and the other a configuration change to BWB. The optimization with powertrain and planform variables is done via a surrogate model obtained using an artificial neural network. The optimum shows a 16.9% reduction in fuel burn, where the planform contributes more to the reduction than the powertrain. For the BWB fuel burn quantification the same process is applied. The powertrain optimization shows a 3% fuel burn reduction with respect to its non-HEP variant. A 13.8% fuel reduction is obtained with powertrain and planform variations. Again, the planform is a larger determinant of fuel burn reduction than the powertrain. Compared with the non-HEP A320neo, a maximum of 19.9% fuel burn reduction can be achieved.","hybrid electric propulsion; conceptual aircraft design; Modeling and optimisation; parallel hybrid electric; parameteric design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

The AWE research group of the TU Delft was one of the first to demonstrate the functioning of such a system. The spin-off Kitepower later on continued the technological development of this concept towards a commercial product. The system uses a leading edge inflatable (LEI) wing that operates by alternating between a traction phase and a retraction phase. Throughout these phases, the wing experiences a wide range of flow conditions with frequently changing incoming flow velocity, angle of attack and sideslip angle. As the wing is made of a flexible membrane, the shape of the wing is not fixed and will change under the aerodynamic loads applied to it. Therefore, the aerodynamic optimisation of such a wing forms a complex Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problem. However, this thesis will only focus on the aerodynamic analysis of the LEI V3A wing developed by Kitepower. The analysis is done through the use of steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with a rigid wing geometry. Similar work that was done previously used a simplified wing geometry, which omitted the chordwise struts and only considered a limited range of flow conditions. In this study, these struts have been included in the geometry and their impact on the aerodynamic performance is assessed. In addition to this, the aerodynamic performance of the LEI wing under sideslip conditions is analysed. A hybrid meshing approach has been adopted to generate the computational domain. Simulations have been performed using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver with transition model. Comparison of the force coefficient curves showed that the impact of the struts on the total aerodynamic performance is minimal. Throughout the whole range of flow conditions considered, the force coefficient curves showed similar trends and absolute values. Locally, there are differences in the flow fields, predominantly in the tip region on the pressure side of the wing. The change in aerodynamic performance as a function of the sideslip angle was concluded to be strong. An increase in the sideslip angle led to a drop in the lift coefficient and an increase in the drag coefficient. Averaged values of the force coefficients were in line with inputs of several numerical models. Comparison of the results to available experimental data showed agreement for a limited range of flow conditions. The differences between the results of the present study and available experimental data are believed to be caused by the experimental data processing methods, in-flight deformation of the wing and steering actuation.","RANS; LEI; Airborne Wind Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, previous algorithms are unsuitable for nano quadcopters, as they rely on heavy sensors, require too large computational resources, or only solve simple scenarios without obstacles. In this work, we propose a novel bug algorithm named `Sniffy Bug', that allows a swarm of gas-seeking nano quadcopters to localize a gas source in an unknown, cluttered and GPS-denied environment. Sniffy Bug is capable of efficient GSL with extremely little sensory input and computational resources, operating within the strict resource constraints of a nano quadcopter. The algorithm foresees in the avoidance of obstacles and other swarm members, while pursuing desired waypoints. The waypoints are set for exploration, and, when a single swarm member has sensed the gas, by a particle swarm optimization-based procedure. We evolve all the parameters of the bug (and PSO) algorithm, with a novel automated end-to-end simulation and benchmark platform, AutoGDM. This platform enables fully automated end-to-end environment generation and gas dispersion modelling (GDM), not only allowing for learning in simulation but also providing the first GSL benchmark. We show that evolved Sniffy Bug outperforms manually selected parameters in challenging, cluttered environments in the real world. To this end, we show that a lightweight and mapless bug algorithm can be evolved to complete a complex task, and enable the first fully autonomous swarm of collaborative gas-seeking nano quadcopters.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","Best Graduate Faculteit L&R 2021","","2021-05-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Unlike traditional wet-adhesives, dry adhesives are bioinspired solid polymers that owe their adhesion to hierarchical structures. Gecko’s are the most recognizable living creatures relying on this concept to climb walls. A close look at the gecko’s fingers reveals a hierarchical system of micro-and nanoscale filaments. These ensure excellent adaptability and contact to (rough) surfaces and the formation of a large amount of close-range van der Waals surface interactions. The reversible nature of these bonds allows for reversible and repeatable adhesion. This hierarchical system has been identified as the main reason for dry adhesion and has been object of intense research to manufacture man-made solid adhesives. Despite the many efforts, there are some unclear aspects resulting from contradictory scientific reports and a strong focus on a particular polymer chemistry used to make the hierarchical structures. This has left the effects of the material choice on dry adhesion largely neglected. In this research project, we aimed to shed some light on the role of different polymer architecture features on dry adhesion. Most available research has focused on the use of commercial siloxane elastomers that offer almost no control on the polymer synthesis. Instead, we opted to use thermoplastic polyurethane chemistry due to the large versatility this chemistry offers in terms of modification of relevant polymer architecture features. In the absence of available works on thermoplastics a new manufacturing process of such hierarchical structures had to be developed relying on heating, pressure and vacuum to respectively melt the polymer, overcome the high viscosity and impede oxidation. We studied the effects of the polymer architecture and properties on adhesion using a single micropillar architecture and varying the chemical composition (polyol length, aromatic content, hard/soft block ratio), the testing temperature and the pull-off speed. As to the polymer architecture, the best results were found with a short polyol and the lowest hard block fraction that still guaranteed structural integrity. Next to that, it was found that having aromatic rings in the hard segments was crucial, likely due to its beneficial effect on nanophase separation. With those compositions, values exceeding those of state-of-the-art dry adhesives were found, with a maximum of 440 kPa at the Tg and high retraction speeds. Furthermore, we show that while existing models are valid for thermoplastic polyurethanes well below their Tg, once they exhibit viscoelastic behaviour, the loss factor is a much more reliable indicator of performance than the reported stiffness. The effect of the surface energy was also evident but minimal compared to the mechanical properties of the polymers.","dry adhesion; polyurethanes; micropillar; viscoelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, once the beam increases in size such that it is characterized as a deep beam or even falls outside the range of the typical deep beam, less knowledge is available. A case study of the Itaipu lock walls is used to compare three different calculation methods for shear loading (sectional method, strut &amp; tie method, and a linear and nonlinear finite element model) to each other. The calculation methods are applied to the large concrete lock walls in order to determine which of these methods can best be used for shear calculations on structural elements that fall out of the range of these so-called ‘regular’ sized beams.  The effect of increasing thickness is studied and it can be concluded that the combination of a certain crack width and the aggregate interlock mechanism, and thus the grain size of the concrete mixture, play an important role in the shear capacity of beams.  The existing norms and guidelines, such as the Eurocode and the American Concrete Institute codes, have been proven to be inadequate for shear calculations on structural elements that surpass the definition of a deep beam in size, such as the Itaipu lock walls. The sectional calculation, which is based on these norms and guidelines is however still used as a rough reference calculation in this research. The first calculation, which is the sectional calculation, resulted in two alternative designs next to the original lock wall design by Witteveen+Bos: total wall thickness original design: 33m, total wall thickness alternative design 1 (i): 17m and total wall thickness alternative design 2 (ii): 29m. The Strut &amp; Tie calculation is then performed for the original Witteveen+Bos design, resulting in a reinforcement plan based on the normal forces in the ties. The third calculation type consisted of three linear models (of the original design and the two alternative designs) and one nonlinear model of the original Witteveen+Bos design. The stress trajectories of the linear models illustrated that the wall is predominantly stressed in compression, as a result of the large self-weight of the wall. Only the lower part of the wall and the lock floor connected to this wall are stressed in tension. The nonlinear model was therefore reinforced only in the lock floor and the lower part of the wall connected to the lock floor.  Because the linear finite element approach does not include material behavior beyond the elastic stage, this approach is not sufficient and does not provide the necessary required insight for a shear resistance calculation. The nonlinear finite element model has proven to be the most accurate and adequate calculation method. The downside is that this method will take longer and requires more background information about the materials used, the connection between structural elements and the type of subsoil. The Strut &amp; Tie approach, is a good first design step. However, for a thorough tradeoff between wall thickness, the complex connection between the floor and the wall, and the amount of reinforcement necessary to prevent cracking, the nonlinear finite element method gives the most accurate estimate.  From the calculation results, the conclusion is drawn that the current wall design by Witteveen+Bos is an overly conservative design. Decreasing the current total wall thickness and increasing the amount of reinforcement in the lock floor and the lower part of the wall connected to the lock floor, will also result in a design that is able to resist the shear loading.","Shear force; deep beam; DIANA FEA; strut and tie model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","","-25.40720, -54.59480"

However this design brings several complications the engineer has to account for: creep; backlash; complex assembly and more importantly the limited stiffness of the belt. This limited stiffness results in belt stretch and induced vibrations, which ultimately reduces the final accuracy of the manufactured product. In order to compensate, the accelerations are limited, which is a very important factor for fast manufacturing. High speed and fast positioning is hard to achieve with the current belt-driven design used in for example 3D printers and CO2 laser cutting machines. For that reason a different motor type is considered: direct-drive technology. These motors cost minimally 700 euros per meter stroke when outsourced.<br/>In this thesis presentation the design and optimization of a low-cost direct-drive motor intended for low-duty CNC machines is presented. The motor is able to achieve up to 10 [m/s^2] acceleration and a speed of 1 [m/s], with an accuracy of a human hair. This should help boost the effectiveness of low-duty CNC machinery. Smart design choices, and low-cost components further reduce the total cost down to under 100 euros per meter stroke.","linea motor; optimization; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-14","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

This thesis set out to model the industry and conclude on effective sustainability increasing measures. It was identified that the creation of one carpet tile (0.25 square meters) causes a global warming equivalent of 4.9 kilograms CO2-equivalent units and requires up to 78 megajoule of energy. With the current material composition of a carpet tile, no fully sustainable supply chain can be achieved. The recycling of these materials is simply too costly and too difficult. This makes for the downcycling of end-of-lifecycle (EOL) carpets into building insulation material the most effective form of disposal, only achieving a 31% reduction in environmental effects at best. This is a far cry from the envisioned full circularity by the carpet industry. In order to achieve a fully sustainable carpet industry, a shift in problem ownership is required. Currently, the consumer and government are paying for the inability of the carpet industry to produce a carpet that is (fully) recyclable. Once a carpet is sold, the costs of disposal are the responsibility by whoever buys the carpet, and the environmental costs affect welfare and are thus a governmental problem. This study advices a product-service system, where through leasing contracts and deposit systems, the carpet manufacturer remains the owner of a carpet at its EOL. Through this system, the carpet manufacturer is incentivized to produce a carpet that is more easily recyclable, or to establish a market and create demand for the EOL product. This study set out to discover how the current generation of carpets can be diverted from landfills and be used to establish a sustainable industry. It can be concluded that recycling cannot be achieved, and downcycling needs further exploration as it requires the establishment of a new market. Thus, it is concluded that the current generation of carpets is unfit to create any sort of sustainable supply chain, and efforts are best invested in the establishment of a new type of carpet which is more easily recyclable.","Product-service industry; Sustainabilty; Circular Economics; Reverse logistics; Carpet tiles; Carpet industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Baha, S.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Participatory Design (PD) has been used as a medium to democratize the design practice and include in the process the people intended to use the outcomes. When working for social change and justice, the practice intends to maintain its democratic nature by giving voice and agency to the most vulnerable in society. However, when engaging in complex societal problems PD can perpetuate systemic oppression and reproduce in the design process the same harmful mechanisms that are intended to be changed. For this reason, it is crucial for the PD practice to engage in matters of power dynamics so more socially just processes can be developed. Acknowledging this urgency, this research project has the aim of proposing an alternative understanding for a decolonial PD process that accounts for more power balanced and socially just dynamics between designers and members of marginalized communities. To accomplish the alternative understanding, the project was performed in three main phases. The first phase (research for design) is formed of a literature review and interviews with design practitioners familiar with participatory processes with oppressed communities. With these activities it was understood that the PD practice can reproduce systemic oppression in three different levels (individual, communal and systemic) because the role of the designer entails advantages in decision making, project ownership and process control among others. To overcome these oppressive practices, the work of the philosopher Paulo Freire was studied to find analogies between his pedagogy for liberation and the PD practice. In this study, it was learned that to create more horizontal relationships, it is necessary to create the space for a co-learning process based on dialogue between the designer and the members of a community. The second phase of the project (research through design) started by proposing a detailed structure for a process inspired by the research for design to be carried out with the community. However, earlier in the initiation of the phase, it was realized that in order to decolonize the PD process also the PD designer inside the process needs to be decolonized and that the structure could be propose if and only if it was developed together with the community of Afrikaanderwijk. Accordingly, the second phase of this research was based on non-structured explorations in the neighborhood allowing different moments of engagement between the designer and the community based on horizontal relationships and dialogue. In this phase was found that a decolonization of the designer and the design process entails a constant re-evaluation of the designer’s role that can move in a spectrum from facilitator to participant in the context. Other statements about the alternative understanding of PD processes were drawn including the need to see the process as a collaboration instead of just participation and to intend the project as something bigger than just what design is able to frame. The last phase of this project intended to make the insights of the research practical and useful for other designers. In this way, the final findings were translated into a series of reflective questions to challenge assumptions and biases in the initiation of a PD process.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Participatory Design; Power dynamics; Decolonization; Participation; Social justice; Decolonial design; Reflection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Offshore solar power installations can be increased in size and efficiency compared to land based installations due to the availability of space and the cooling effect of water. To increase survivability in large waves, very large floating solar platforms can be made flexible. However, a flexible structure is susceptible to wrinkling due to combinations of mooring loads, wave dynamics and the flexibility of the platform. Wrinkling is a limit state which is not commonly researched in maritime engineering, since generally structures are designed to be as stiff as possible. Wrinkling can lead to the global collapse of a very large flexible solar platform and should therefore be minimised. Very large floating platforms have an impact on the environment due to the shadow underneath. This problem can be diminished by adding holes to the platform. Furthermore, holes can be functional as manholes for maintenance of the bottom of the platform. Scientific research on the wrinkling behaviour of membranes has pointed out that wrinkling behaviour depends on the geometry of the membrane, which can for example be changed by adding holes to the membrane. The aim of this thesis is to set up a design and analysis framework for wrinkled membranes with permeability. In order to define this framework, (i) reliable computational indicators are developed; (ii) the influence of permeability on membrane wrinkling is investigated and; (iii) the framework is verified on a fictive case of an integrated stiff solar panel on a membrane. The first objective in this thesis is to find reliable computational indicators to assess the wrinkling behaviour of a membrane. Current concepts of offshore solar platforms are flexible membranes including mooring systems based on concentrated tension loads. To study the wrinkling behaviour of a (subregion) of such a flexible floating solar platform, in this study, it is modelled as a rectangular membrane subjected to uniaxial tension; following the available literature on the wrinkling problem. Numerical analysis of the wrinkling behaviour is first done by non-linear post-buckling calculations. However, it appeared that the results of this calculation are highly dependent on the initial deformation which is used. An alternative method which does not depend on user defined input was found in studying the second principal stress field: when negative second principal stress is present in the membrane, wrinkling can occur. When no negative second principal stress is present in the membrane, wrinkling will not occur. Furthermore, the distribution and the area of the negative second principal stresses region are indicators for the wrinkle distribution and amplitude. For a robust assessment of the susceptibility of a membrane to wrinkling, a study of the negative second principal stress field should thus be preferred over a post-buckling analysis. The second goal of this thesis is to research the influence of permeability on membrane wrinkling. The effect of holes on the wrinkling behaviour is researched by studying their influence on the second principal stress field. The aim is to find wrinkle free configurations and study the mechanisms which minimise wrinkling behaviour. Therefore, the size, location and shape of holes are varied systematically in membranes of different sizes. It was found that holes should be chosen so that when the membrane is strained, they deform in a way so that they bring tension in the regions of the membrane which are subjected to negative second principal stress in the non-permeable configuration. Furthermore, holes should be chosen such that the loadpaths in the membrane are not interrupted. The framework to research and design wrinkle free very large flexible solar platforms by adding permeability is verified and has proven to be effective by applying it on the configuration consisting of a stiff solarpanel mounted on a flexible membrane. In this configuration, the framework has led to holes by which the wrinkling region is localised. From the three parts of this thesis, it is concluded that a research framework for wrinkling of membranes with permeability was found in the analysis of the second principal stresses and the driving mechanisms were investigated and verified. To further develop this framework, research on the effect of stiffening the membrane and minimising wrinkling under load conditions other than tension are recommended.","Wrinkling; Very Large Floating Platforms; Offshore Solar Platforms; Flexible","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The successful integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in human environments is highly dependent on their ability to navigate safely and timely through dense traffic conditions. Such conditions involve a diverse range of human behaviors, ranging from cooperative (willing to yield) to non-cooperative human drivers (unwilling to yield) that need to be identified without any explicit inter-vehicle communication. In order to maneuver through such conditions, AVs must not only compute a collision-free trajectory but also account for the effects of its actions on the surrounding agents to negotiate the navigation maneuver safely. Existing motion planning techniques fail in these environments because they suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: suffer from ”the curse of dimensionality” due to the high number of agents (e.g., optimization-based methods); do not account for the interaction effects among the agents; do not provide any collision avoidance or trajectory feasibility guarantees (e.g., learning-based methods). In this paper, we propose a novel navigation framework combining the strengths of learning-based with optimization-based algorithms. More specifically, we employ a Soft Actor-Critic agent to learn a continuous guidance policy that provides global guidance to an optimization-based planner generating feasible and collision- free trajectories. We evaluate our method in a highly inter- active simulation environment where we compare our method with two baseline approaches, a learning-based method and an optimization-based method, and present performance results demonstrating our method significantly reduces the number of collisions and increase the success rate with fewer number of deadlocks. We also show that that our method is able to generalise and applicable to other traffic scenarios (e.g., an unprotected left turn).","Safe Navigation; Motion Planning; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Optimal Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Schreier, S. (graduation committee); Vrijdag, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Ventilation events are the result of masses of air being transported from the water surface along the hull, through the propeller plane. Previous research in literature has shown that ventilation induces large and sudden variations of the load on the propeller. The response of the propulsion system had not been documented before. This is a problem with practical and theoretical relevance as both operators and designers of ships and propulsion systems cannot predict the response of these systems to these significant and sudden variations of the propeller-load. The problem can manifest itself in different ways. A first example lies in a possible loss of propulsion and the damages that could incur. A second example lies in the possible installation of too much engine power to respond to unpredictable load-variations such as those incurred by ventilation events. Increased understanding of the relation between wave properties, -height and -frequency, and the response of a marine Diesel engine, -speed and -torque, subjected to wave-induced ventilation, is the goal of this thesis and leads to the main research question: How does a marine Diesel engine respond to off-design loads, and in particular to frequently varying loads resulting from propeller ventilation? It focuses on the response of the prime-mover to variations of the propeller-load imposed by ventilation events. The scope of this thesis covers a monohull coaster with a medium-speed marine Diesel engine moving forward in head seas. A model is proposed based on the description of immersion by Journée and Massie (2001) [19]. It consists of three sub-models that describe vessel-motion, the propeller and the prime-mover. The vessel-motion is described with a combination of potential-flow based methods and viscous theory. A quasi-static approach is proposed to describe the influence of ventilation on propeller-functioning. The prime-mover is modelled with a closed-cylinder process and an idealised first-order turbo-charger model that applies the exhaust-flow temperature of the closed-cylinder process to describe the charge-pressure. Three limits to this model lie in the application of vessel-motion data in a limited, positive domain, the application of 1st quadrant propeller data and the propeller envelope. This model uses input consisting of waves and the engine speed setpoint. The output consists of the rotational speed and produced torque of the prime-mover subjected to ventilation. Verification showed responses comparable to, and in the range and time frame of experimental results by Koushan (2007) [21]. Validation efforts lie beyond the scope of this thesis. Experiments by means of simulations have been performed for two engine speed setpoints and different wave-types describing head seas: Regular waves characterised by low frequencies, -characterised by high frequencies and -characterised by different wave amplitudes. A final experiment subjected the model to an adverse long-crested wave-spectrum for ocean waves. The research at hand found that the propeller immersion-ratio couples imposed waves and vessel-motions, to the inception of ventilation events. The quasi-static approach to model the influence of ventilation on propeller-functioning provided a reasonable estimate in verification, although further validation efforts are still required. The main research question led to the answer that: Frequently varying loads resulting from propeller ventilation can induce a significant shift in the operational point in the propellers open-water diagram and engines PV diagram and increase of the variations of engine speed and -torque. The final chapter also provides a number of pointers for a further validation effort, possible improvements to the proposed method and advice regarding further research.","Marine; propeller; ventilation; Diesel engine; Vessel motions; immersion; Two-phase flow; thrust loss; response; Turbocharger; Quasi Static; simulations; potential flow theory; Froude scaling; Viscous drag; Combustion Simulation; Heat and Mass Transfer; RAO; Wave modeling; Linear wave theory; fourier analysis; EEDI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

While efficient low thrust propulsion systems exist, Earth escape using low thrust only leads to significant incident radiation doses when crossing the Van Allen belts. As such, this report aims to present the design of a dual thrust cubesat, i.e. one which employs both high thrust and low thrust propulsion systems, such that the transfer time and the number of van Allen belt crossings is within requirements, while a final orbit aroundMars remains attainable. In doing so, this report explores the theory behind low thrust trajectory optimization, and attempts to combine this with a general optimization scheme including both high thrust phases as well as the optimization of the spacecraft system design. Implementation of such a scheme has not been shown to be useful: issues in finding a good initial guess prevent convergence in many cases, and the proposed plan to alleviate the encountered issues requires an iterative approach between system design and trajectory design. As such, the proposed scheme has not been found to have any benefit over using existing trajectory design tools in an iterative way. A design approach is presented using the pykep trajectory optimizer developed at the European Space Agency (ESA). Iteration between this tool, high thrust calculations, and system design budget calculations allows for optimizing towards a feasible design that meets the requirements, starting from an arbitrary initial guess. When a list of commercial off the shelf (COTS) components is available following the CubeSat standard, it is possible to quickly generate a feasible design without significant prior work. This report presents a full COTS design for a cubesat capable of reaching Mars independently from a common piggyback launch orbit. The design in question is a 12 unit cubesat with a dry mass of 11.4 kg and a wet mass of 14.8 kg. Launched into a geostationary transfer orbit, it can reach escape velocity though 9 Van Allen belt passes, and reachMars in less than 5 years. Due to the constrained scope of the design, further work is needed to verify that the momentumdumping budget, link budget, and thermal budget are indeed sufficient. It is further recommended to improve on the work in this thesis, by finding an alternative integrated optimization scheme, or by including and automating more features within pykep. Lastly, recommendations are given for integration, testing, and launch of the proposed spacecraft design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As willbe discussed in this report, not consideringgender and sex in design can result in productsor services that unintentionally exclude part ofa target group. Considering gender and sexin the design process can help to identify newopportunities and make a product work betterfor a wider range of users. The aim of thisproject was to increase students’ awarenessof the role of gender and sex in design, andto offer them guidance on how to approachconsideration of gender and sex in their work.This thesis explored the influence of genderbias in design, the context of the first semester,existing tools to educate about gender bias, andthe perspective of the design students on thetopic. This was done through literature review,semi-structured interviews, desk research,creative sessions, and concept testing.Gender bias is the term used to describeassumptions and prejudices on the basis ofgender and sex.Sex refers to biological characteristics such asheight, weight, and physiology. Gender impliessociocultural attitudes and behaviours thatshape women’s and men’s behaviour, products,technologies, environments and knowledge.(Schiebinger, Klinge, Sánchez de Madariaga,Paik, Schraudner, &amp; Stefanick, 2011-2018).When products exclude users based ondifferences in gender or sex, these productsrepresent a gender bias. As a result of different(ideas about) bodies, roles and obligations,women and men often lead different lives andhave different experiences. When a designeraims to design for women and men, therefore,both should be involved in research and testing.Through the collection and analysis of examplesof gender biased designs it was found thatthey can be summarised in three categories.In most examples, gender biased design wascaused by the use of standards that were notrepresentative for all users. In some cases, itwas caused by the associations of the designerwith what is male or female, that were reflectedin the final product. Lastly, gender biased designwas caused by not considering the differencein behaviour between women or men in thetarget group. The three themes can serve as aguide on how to analyse gender biased designand can be used to identify what to look out forwhen aiming to design in a gender considerateway.The result of this project is the “becomeaverage” advertising campaign, that consists ofprovocative posters that criticize gender biases,and a website that gives more information. Theposters are distributed throughout the facultyto attract the attention of design students. Theposters guide students to the webside via aQR code. On the website, more informationabout the campaign can be found, as well asan introduction to the topic of gender bias indesign, and advice for gender consideratedesign.

Therefore, the main goals of this study are (1) to better understand the potential impacts of CAVs on traffic efficiency and traffic safety in highway work zones under different circumstances, and (2) to make a well formulated estimation of how current communication in work zones will need to be changed in the future. Two highway work zones were simulated in VISSIM. Three different types of CAVs (cautious, normal &amp; all knowing) were implemented, each at 5 different penetration rate levels (0-100% with steps of 25%) in combination with conventional human operated vehicles to assess the traffic efficiency and safety effects. The traffic demand was kept constant at a theoretical F/C-ratio of 1. Based on first observations two communication strategies were added to the networks aimed at CAVs. These were (1) an early merge strategy and (2) an increased headway strategy. It was concluded that cautious CAVs have a negative effect on traffic efficiency and safety. The magnitude of these effects increased as the penetration rate increases. As CAVs became more aggressive, the traffic efficiency was increased. The traffic safety was deteriorated however, as a result of short time headways. The two communication strategies showed great potential to relieve the congestion in cautious CAV scenarios and to increase safety when entering the work zone.","Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs); Simulation; Traffic safety; Traffic efficiency; I2V","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Indoor air contamination is a big problem for our urbanized societies, as it causes chronic diseases and SBS symptoms (headache, dizziness, irritation, etc…) to the buildings occupants. Active botanical biofiltration has been proved in the last decades as a valuable option to reduce indoor air contamination. It can target a big range of pollutants, increase the thermal comfort and improve the indoors spatial quality, in a low maintenance and low energy requiring way. Currently, several portable active botanical biofilters can be found in the market. All the products follow the main principle of the technology: plant combined with an airflow; and differ from each other with other features such as air monitoring, water tank or app interface. Given the described situation, a research process is carried out about the active botanical biofiltration (literature research), the functionalities and aesthetics desired by the user (questionnaires and interviews) and the possibilities around powering the device with solar energy (literature research). After synthesizing this research, the design requirements that the product should follow are: Product targeted to Western Europeans, living in big cities and older than 30 years old; Product to include the functionalities: airflow generated by one fan; solar powered; water tank with water level indicator; upgradeable system and not including monitoring functionalities; Product to look like a normal potted plant but doing something extra; minimalistic, subtle, neutral, timeless, functional and natural; Product to use white ceramic and wood as main materials. After showing the process of research and synthesis, the final result of the product is shown in detail (digital design and functional prototype) together with the steps that lead to that final shape (prototyping, iterations, user testing, etc…). As a last step in the process, the prototype is used to carry out a design evaluation regarding the user experience and product’s performance in improving air quality (for CO2, VOCs, T and %H). With respect to the results performed, it seems that the device is able to increase the relative humidity (from 50% to 55% in the tests), but no big effects were noticed in contaminants removal. However, a big part of the obtained results are inconsistent, which points to the need of repeating the tests in a more controllable environment. On the other hand, the user experience test results are positive, as the users felt a positive effect in their perception over the space the product was being used, and the aesthetic style is appropriate according to the user’s opinions. Besides, two areas were recommended to be improved: making the integration of the solar panels in a more subtle way, and accompanying the device with clear and reliable performance results about the product in real life scenarios.<br","active botanical biofiltration; Air quality; Solar power; Air purifier; Nature Based Solutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The increase of the digital world means an increase in data and software. Developing more software unfortunately also means a higher probability of vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by adversaries. Adversaries taking advantage of users and software vulnerabilities, by stealing data to cause harm, steal money, etc. This makes the digital world a dangerous environment.<br/>To ensure software has a minimal number of vulnerabilities, companies invest in software tools and experts to check their software for vulnerabilities. One such company is ING, the largest bank of The Netherlands. At ING they use Fortify, a static analyzer. The problem with this tool is that it gives many false positives. Therefore, pentesters and developers have to manually check all the warnings given by Fortify, which takes a lot of time and slows down the whole software development process. In this study, we propose to use supervised machine learning techniques to predict true vulnerabilities from static analyzer warnings. Using ING's data from Fortify, two highly imbalanced datasets with code metrics are created on class and method level. Various classifiers and sampling techniques are compared to determine which techniques perform the best. Next to that, we also compared the performance at different levels of granularity. Finally, we also investigate whether a dataset with different types of vulnerabilities performs better than a dataset consisting of only one vulnerability type. From our study, it is clear that Bagging in combination with ClassBalancer gives the best f-measure (0.618) for the class-level dataset, which is slightly good. Random Forest with SMOTE gives the best f-measure (0.412) for the method-level dataset, which we consider weak. Depending on the type of vulnerability, the performance can benefit from a dataset per vulnerability type. Overall, the performance found in this study shows slightly promising results when using Fortify in combination with supervised machine learning, especially compared to only using Fortify.","Static Analysis; Supervised Learning; Fortify; software vulnerability detection; Classification; Code Metrics; Vulnerability Types; Granularity; Closed Source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

With increasing salinity of surface waters in coastal regions, salt removal has also become an issue in the production of drinking water. When advanced oxidation processes are combined they are capable to remove OMPs to a large extent, but without the removal of salts. Dense membranes like reverse osmosis (RO) or flat-sheet nanofiltration (NF) membranes – which require an extensive pretreatment – can sufficiently remove OMPs and salts, but only at low permeabilities and by producing a saline waste stream. Hollow fiber NF membranes seem very promising in this respect as they have higher permeabilities, lower energy consumptions and can be applied directly. In this study, the removal of salts and OMPs from synthetic surface water and real lake water from the Valkenburgse Meer (VM) by the polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coated dNF40 membrane was studied in order to make it suitable for dune infiltration water. This type of membrane is fabricated by depositing polycations and polyanions alternately on a porous support medium, also known as the layer by layer (LbL) technique, which enables control of the membrane’s surface charge and permeability. Hollow fiber NF membranes have the ability to separate ions or solutes with smaller sizes and hydraulic radii than the pore size of the membrane due to electrostatic repulsion. The membrane is negatively charged at neutral pH.<br/><br/>The dNF40 membrane showed ion retentions of up to 27% for Cl-, 98% for SO42-, 87% for Mg2+, 76% for Ca2+ and 17% for Na+ in once-through configuration with a hydraulic permeability of 5.8 Lm-2h-1 and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of ~200 Da. However, lower ion retention values were observed for filtration of real lake water, except for SO42-. Retentions were unaffected by cross-flow velocity, but increased with increasing permeate flux. Moreover, the ion retentions reduced considerably when the system recovery increased to 75%. In addition to the salt retentions, the retention of a mix of 20 distinctively different pharmaceuticals, both positively charged, negatively charged and neutral OMPs with molecular weights between 119 and 748 gmol−1, was investigated. An average retention as high as 79% and 89% was reached for SW (no natural organic matter (NOM)) and VM water (11.6 mgL-1 of NOM), respectively. As expected, the negatively charged pharmaceuticals were retained best as a result of electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged membrane, followed by the positively charged compounds, of which repulsion is probably promoted by underlying polycation layers in the membrane structure. Neutral compounds were retained less.<br/><br/>The dNF40 membrane showed to be resistant to fouling, while no extensive pretreatment was applied, making it suitable for direct treatment of surface water. Furthermore, OMPs were largely removed, hardness was partially reduced and NOM was almost completely removed, but insufficient NaCl was retained to meet dune infiltration water standards. Therefore, an additional step becomes necessary in the pretreatment of surface water. Four suggestions were provided.","direct nanofiltration; layer by layer; salt removal; organic micropollutant removal; surface water; hollow fiber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Collaboration between couriers can benefit both companies and their customers, as it has the potential to reduce cost and reduce the number of couriers stopping at the same location. Furthermore, autonomous driving is gradually picking up traction opening up another possibility for cost reduction. The ability to use autonomous vehicles (AVs) for parcel delivery removes some restrictions and limitations that apply to human drivers (e.g. limited working hours, reduced focus due to sleep deprivation). Unfortunately, full self-driving on all roads and for all vehicles is still a tale of the future. It is therefore beneficial to be able to optimize routing using a mixed fleet or a fleet of vehicles that can drive autonomously but also with a driver (dual-mode vehicles). The work presented in this thesis addresses the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) through dynamic fleet management, attempting to optimally utilize the available vehicles based on the current requirements/demand. These demands change over time as customer requests, e.g parcel pickup/delivery, are continuously added requiring recalculation of the optimal strategy. Although PDP has been described in literature in many forms, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work treats mode changes as a separate entity. Our work aims to fill this gap by using dual-mode fleets and combining the corresponding vehicle mode based route restrictions (in the form of AV zones) and explicit mode changes into a single dynamic problem. To that end a unified model for the extended PDP is introduced, in which a fleet consists of vehicles which can change modes (manual vs autonomous driving) along the way and where autonomous driving is only permitted within specific parts of the road network: AV zones. By also including collaboration in the form of request transfers a formal model is proposed for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers and Autonomous Vehicle Zones (PDPT-AVZ). To explore the impact of using dual-mode fleets and illustrate the possibilities of the PDPT-AVZ model an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) based algorithm is introduced, including a novel Shift Request heuristic. Through experiments utilizing a network representing the city of Delft, Netherlands, varying AV zones and simulating requests by generating demand, a significant reduction in scenario cost is found for dual-mode vehicles compared to regular vehicles. Moreover, the impact on the solution cost of some AV zone characteristics is explored. Both the relative coverage of the AV zone, with respect to the full road network, and the topology of the network in terms of the number of connected regions within the network, are shown to have a significant impact on the overall result when using the ALNS algorithm. Similarly the impact of the level of dynamism is explored, showing that more efficient solutions in terms of overall cost are obtained when all requests are available at the start of the planning horizon.","Optimization; Algorithm; Transportation; Collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","i-Cave",""

The next step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing is to increase the number of so-called spin qubits on the processor. However, this poses several challenges, one of which being how to implement single-qubit gates in multi-qubit systems, with high fidelity. This work focused on two aspects. The first one was to identify the physical phenomena and limitations that hinder the realisation of high fidelity single-qubit gates in multi-qubit environments. The second objective was to investigate, implement and optimise methods in order to minimise the impact of these perturbing phenomena. The identified perturbing effects include unwanted driving between a pulse and the neighbouring qubits, as well as frequency shifts induced by drive-spin coupling and non-ideal pulse in experimental setups. Crosstalk was addressed using pulse shaping (i.e. amplitude or phase modulation of the driving pulse to tailor its spectral characteristics and reduce the energy transmitted at unwanted frequencies). The performance of shapes taken from both NMR and signal processing literature was investigated, for various pulse parameters, through an extensive grid search. In addition, a frequency correction algorithm was devised: off-resonant drive frequencies are selected so that the shifted qubits are resonantly driven. It currently accounts for two phenomena: the AC Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts. The algorithm furthermore tracks the changes caused by the time-dependent characteristics of the shaped pulses. The proposed frequency correction algorithm was shown to almost entirely negate the effects of the considered shifts, leading to unitary fidelity improvements by up to 55%. In addition, pulse shaping was demonstrated to noticeably improve the fidelity of simultaneous single-qubit rotations compared to unshaped driving. Rotations with fidelities as high as 99.98% were obtained for pi/2 rotations on two-qubits systems. Moreover, shapes whose Fourier transform is narrow and sharp, associated with low Rabi frequencies, were demonstrated to generally provide the highest fidelities of the tested configurations. Lastly, the trends and guidelines highlighted by these results were shown to scale to systems with larger numbers of qubits. The correction techniques investigated in this work have proven promising for the implementation of high fidelity single-qubit gates in multi-qubit systems. In particular, the guidelines for selecting a well-performing pulse shape should also be useful for the design of optimised driving schemes, regardless of the number of qubits involved. Additionally, the proposed frequency shift correction algorithm is expected to be able to handle arbitrary shifts, and so to be easily adaptable to use in experiments.","Quantum computing; Spin Qubits; High fidelity; Single-qubit gate; Pulse shaping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Scheduling for the operating department is currently done manually, using standard values for duration that vary with procedure type. This implies that no patient characteristics nor historical data are used to personalise predicted surgical duration. Furthermore, schedules are not updated when procedures are delayed. A relevant step towards dynamic scheduling is the realisation of real-time analysis of surgical workflow, based on intraoperatively acquired data. As of yet, the amount research performed into the use of automatically generated online data for duration prediction is limited. This research project involves an analysis of the usability and characteristics of interventional X-ray data, for predicting the total duration of coronary angiograms intraoperatively. A random forest classification algorithm is used to analyse each acquisition within the dataset and classify the total duration of the corresponding procedure as being below 10 minutes, 10 to 20 minutes, 20 to 30 minutes or 30 minutes and over. An additional 22 features were generated to add data from prior acquisitions of the same patient. Recursive feature elimination was used to determine the optimal feature set, to be used in the final model. Based on out-of-bag validation, the overall accuracy of the classification model was found to be 92.8\%. Considering an average procedure duration of 11 minutes, the interventional X-ray data shows exceptional capabilities of classifying both standard and delayed procedures. Further analysis with respect to procedure time shows that some Class 1 acquisitions are overestimated as Class 2 acquisitions, but that overestimation of procedure duration rarely occurs for the other three phases. This implies that a prediction made beyond 10 minutes into the procedure can be perceived as the absolute minimum duration class of the procedure. Additionally, Class 3 and Class 4 predictions are found to always correspond to the minimum procedure time, independent of procedural progress. Class 2 and Class 3 acquisitions are underestimated up until 10 minutes and 20 minutes into the procedure, respectively. Class 4 acquisitions are correctly classified at a relatively earlier point with respect to progress and are never incorrect beyond 20 minutes. Given the fact that overestimation does not occur beyond 10 minutes, nor when Class 3 or Class 4 is predicted, the first prediction of a new duration class is concluded to be a reliable reference point. Further investigation has shown that most Class 3 and Class 4 detection occur within the first five minutes of a procedure. Therefore, the model is successful at predicting a total duration of 20 minutes or more at an early stage of the procedure. This could significantly benefit the hospital in terms of procedure planning and knowing when to request the next patient. For a deeper understanding of the model's potential, individual procedures were analysed to gain insight into its additional value in terms of procedure scheduling. In terms of prediction features, the acquisition frequency, longitudinal position of the operating table, cumulative procedure duration, patient age and cumulative cine acquisition time were found to be the most important. The implementation of these features in further research on CAG phases is recommended. Movement of the operating table seems to be particularly informative for workflow analysis. In terms of clinical application, further optimisation is required in order to enable accurate prediction for the duration of shorter procedures. Nevertheless, the model provides an accurate tool for the real-time monitoring of procedural workflow and detecting significant delay, which proves that the usability of the data goes far beyond machine maintenance and service only.","Catheterization laboratory; Coronary angiogram; Random forest classification; Interventional X-ray system; Surgical duration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-14","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The PWM schemes used to generate the voltage signals for the machine consist of high frequency trapezoidal signals, when not filtered. These high frequency signals when directly applied to the machine terminal can excite the parasitic capacitances between the stator winding and the stator iron and rotor iron. This leads to current flowing through these stray capacitances which leads to bearing current and also ground leakage current. The high voltage spikes can also have devastating effects on the stator winding insulation, which may lead to degradation of winding insulation over time. The bearing current damages the ball bearings over time, the phenomenon is called fluting. The ground leakage current can interfere with the ground protection system and also potentially interfere with the neighboring devices.The Space Vector Modulation method can be used to implement Space Vector PWM and Discontinuous Space Vector PWM schemes, which are very popularly used nowadays. It has also be proved that since these PWM techniques make use of the zero voltage vector, the Common-Mode voltage peak values can be as high as half of the DC voltage supplied. Thus, by selectively avoiding the zero voltage vectors and replacing them with appropriate active voltage vectors the Common-Mode voltage peaks can be clamped to as low as 1/6 of the DC bus voltage. To further reduce the high order harmonics a simple LCR filter with the star point of the filter connected to the DC bus mid point has been applied in between the inverter and the motor terminals. The filter produces different harmonic performance when combined with different PWM techniques. To further reduce any of the ohmic loss encountered in the filter, especially due to the damping resistor, active damping method has been applied. In active damping method, the passive damping resistor is virtually added in the current loop of the controller to emulate the damping effect of the resistor. The active damping has been implemented using two different resistor combination, one in series and the other in parallel with the capacitor.","Permanent Magnet Machine; pulse width modulation; filter; Active damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Therefore, this method is ideal to be applied to steels that are used in the automotive industry. The material is initially annealed at a high temperature to form austenite. Then it is quenched to a temperature below the martensite start temperature to form a controlled fraction of martensite. Second annealing follows, at a lower temperature than the first one, that stabilises the austenitic phase at room temperature. It has been found that the austenite grain size at the end of the first annealing (prior austenite grain size) has a significant impact on the processing method, the final microstructure and consequently on the final properties of the material. In this thesis, phase-field modelling was employed to investigate the role of prior austenite grain size on the quenching and partitioning process. Simulations of the processing were performed for three different prior austenite grain sizes (6, 25 and 67 μm). Microstructures consisting of about 10.5% austenite and 89.5% martensite were created by simulating the first quenching of the Q&amp;P process. Then, the evolution of the microstructure and carbon distribution were investigated for partitioning at 400 ◦C for times up to 4000 s, and quenching to room temperature. The results gave insights into the effect of the prior austenite grain size on the morphology of the microstructure and the kinetics of carbon during partitioning. It was found that a finer microstructure was derived with decreasing PAGS. Moreover, partitioning becomes more efficient because of the shorter distance that carbon has to diffuse, and the even spatial distribution of austenite. Finally, wide grain size distributions of the austenite that is present during partitioning can lead to significant variations in the carbon content among the austenite grains of the final microstructure, especially for short partitioning times. This affects the efficiency of the partitioning process and has an impact on the mechanical stability of the austenite in the final microstructure and consequently on the TRIP phenomenon.","quenching and partitioning; Phase-Field Modeling; Steel; Prior Austenite Grain Size","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

To meet the high demands of urban life resources need to be efficiently used and resource recovery from generated “waste” streams should become a “new normal”. Water and wastewater can provide an alternative and environmentally viable source of resources supporting the resilience of natural systems under water stress. There are many resources that can be recovered via the water path, such as water itself, energy and components such as nutrients and metals. However, the urban water system is an assembly of complex and interconnected processes which have to be taken into account in order to create an overall sustainable value. Managing the entire water-energy-nutrient nexus for the built environment requires a full system analysis of the life cycle energy consumption, water consumption, global warming potential and freshwater eutrophication potential of the municipal water and sanitation services. This work is an assessment of the environmental impacts of various urban water systems which aim to the water conservation and resource recovery. Each alternative system was assessed under four main planning scenarios applied at a dwelling level$\colon$ greywater treatment and reuse, rainwater harvesting and use, usage of water-efficient appliances, food waste valorisation via the sewer system. The scenarios were investigated from two different perspectives (eight scenarios in total), all based on the principles of water fit-for-purpose and resource recovery. In the first perspective the four scenarios limited the interventions at a dwelling level, while in the second one additional techniques for phosphorus and nitrogen recovery were applied at a centralised wastewater and sludge management level. The comparative results revealed that the usage of water efficient devices (low-flush toilets, water efficient shower heads, waterless washing machines, waterless dishwashers) at a household level, coupled with centralised wastewater treatment with simultaneous recovery of struvite and biogas, and sludge waste drying to produce biofuels promotes a robust and resource efficient urban water system. This strategy was estimated to offset 79% of the overall embodied energy consumption, 72% of life cycle carbon footprint, 22% of life cycle freshwater eutrophication potential and 56% of embodied water consumption. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the energy requirements for water heating in showers, dishwashers and washing machines and the carbon intensity of the national electricity mix were the most important parameters for determining the comparative life cycle global warming potential results.","Life cycle assessment (LCA); water conservation; resource recovery; urban water system; global warming; freshwater eutrophication; energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To develop the considered methodology and to demonstrate its practical application the following steps were taken: A SysML design model is built, consisting of both functional and physical architectures, based on a hypothetical simplified spacecraft subsystem. Thereby an assessment is made to what detail a system needs to be modeled and which characteristics it should at least comprise to provide a sufficient basis for a risk model, as a choice of a certain risk assessment methodology may influence the extent to which a system must be modeled, while certain system design model characteristics influence the selection of the appropriate risk assessment methods to be implemented. To determine how risk analysis can be performed in SysML for a given hypothetical design problem, various risk assessment methods were considered for the sake of risk assessment methodology development, based on specific criteria. After it became clear how the implementation of both qualitative and quantitative parts of risk assessment had to be realized in SysML, the actual risk analysis was initiated; the design model was extended by a reliability model.

Right afterwards, IBM decided to use this power to revolutionize the healthcare system. AI doctors would change everyone’s lives. Sadly, Watson did not revolutionize healthcare. It did not prove to be as useful in reality as was anticipated. How could this happen? In short, IBM started with a very specific use case, then invented a super high-tech solution for it, and then started wondering how it could actually be useful. This example actually illustrates the problem that CrossGuard has. Luckily, CrossGuard’s problem is multiple orders of magnitude smaller than it was for IBM. CrossGuard is a company that has developed a protective glove for so-called Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA), or medieval sword fighting. The glove is called the ProGauntlet. It has been designed to withstand high-impact blows from steel swords repeatedly, to protect the users’ hands from virtually any type of impact during HEMA.<br/>Not only do they protect very well, they also let the user move their hands naturally, without restricting the freedom of movement. It is the ultimate HEMA glove, but as the HEMA market is relatively small, CrossGuard wants to make the ProGauntlet useful for other purposes, too. Therefore the aim of this project has been to find the next market for the ProGauntlet. This is where IBM’s example comes in. Just like Watson, the ProGauntlet is a technological solution that is looking for a problem to solve. The initial aim of this project was precisely this: finding another market for the ProGauntlet. The research method consisted of a product analysis, literature research and user research, mainly in the form of interviews. The most promising markets were researched in-depth: ice hockey, field hockey, lacrosse, kendo, Filipino Martial Arts (FMA) and motorcycle riding. Of these, the only people that would benefit from the ProGauntlet (besides HEMA) is a certain niche of the FMA. This group consists of about only 500 people, so this is a nice addition to the total market for the ProGauntlet, but it definitely isn’t a sustainable market for CrossGuard. Since there is no viable future market for the ProGauntlet, the main focus of this project has become to determine the most interesting market in which to introduce a redesigned protective glove. Based on the research, this appears to be field hockey. <br/>Therefore, a strategy for entering the field hockey market is proposed. The most important quality of a field hockey glove should be that it does not restrain the user in any way. The suggested positioning for the field hockey market is therefore: unrestrained protection. A great advantage of this positioning is that it could also work for the ProGauntlet and simultaneously opens a clear path to future innovations for CrossGuard. Real-world implications Partially due to this research, CrossGuard has started developing a glove for field hockey.","Glove; Protection; Exoskeleton; Hockey; Martial arts; Branding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","","52.012510, 4.375255"

The high agility and maneuverability of FWMAV's are very favorable attributes, making them more applicable in cluttered spaces. A tailless FWMAV called the Delfly Nimble has been developed at the Delft University of Technology. Due to the inherent instability of the tailless design an active controller is required to ensure safe and stable flight of the drone. In previous research, models have been developed for the longitudinal dynamics of the Delfly Nimble. In this paper, a grey-box state-space model of the lateral body dynamics in hover conditions is identified using system identification techniques. The parameters which needed to be estimated were stability and control derivatives, and they were obtained with a least-squares approach. Free-flight experiments were performed to generate the identification and validation data. A doublet train was used in the identification experiments, with the gains of the controller adjusted in such a way that maximum excitation was acquired. The identified model has been validated with various maneuvers. These included doublets, 112-maneuvers, maneuvers using coupled inputs, and maneuvers with sideways flight. The resulting model is able to predict the state derivatives of most maneuver accurately, reaching accuracies of over 90% for maneuvers close to hover. Moreover, in closed-loop configuration it is able to simulate the state response accurately, with accuracies of over 85% for maneuvers close to hover, and remains stable, making it applicable for controller design and stability analysis. Finally, based on the model the inherent instability of the lateral body dynamics was also confirmed, for there are eigenvalues with positive real parts.","grey-box modeling; FWMAV; free flight data; closed-loop identification; system identification; lateral body dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

On the other hand, considering the percentage of cases in the western world, one can say it is worrisome. Anyone can have kidney stones, which may be easily passed out of the kidney through the urine. It only becomes a cause for concern when the stones grow beyond a certain size. They can cause flank and abdominal pains, fever, painful urination, etc., and can subsequently result in kidney failure if the patient has only one kidney present. In that case, a kidney stone patient may require the attention of a nephrologist. Advancement in technology has provided conventional techniques such as ureteroscopy (URS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) and shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) for treating kidney stones. One may wonder what exactly these stones are. They are nothing extraordinary but rather made of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals which are formed from a supersaturated urine. CaOx crystal which is a product of crystallization occurs in two forms, calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD). Crystallization is a very simple and effective purification and phase separation process used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. This process is usually influenced by many factors such as concentration, temperature, mixing, impurities, etc. The presence of oxalate in urine is a major contributor to the formation of kidney stones. High concentration of oxalate combines with calcium to form CaOx. On the other hand, injury to the kidney tubular epithelial cells results in the expression of Hyaluronic acid (HA). HA has since been considered as a binding agent which causes the retention of kidney stones. Furthermore, some scientists are of the idea that HA may also influence the formation of kidney stones. A novel method was developed to study the nucleation kinetics of CaOx in artificial urine under the influence of varying oxalate and HA concentrations. The method involved crystallizing CaOx (COM, COD) in emulsions (micro-droplets) that were generated by and stored in a microfluidic device. Incorporating polarized lightmicroscopy also allowed COM and COD to be detected at the same time. The cumulative probability distribution as a function of induction time for COM and COD was determined and fitted to the Weibull model. The induction time is the average time at which the first crystal is detected in the droplets. As was expected, higher oxalate concentration shortened the induction time for both COM and COD. Surprisingly, increasing HA concentration induced the formation of COM whiles inhibiting the formation of COD. In general, the frequency of COD was always less than that of COM. In conclusion, the idea that HA played a role in the formation of kidney stones was confirmed. This was the most important part of the research.","kidney stones; hyaluronic acid; Microfluidics; crystallization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","kidney stone project","52.0126341,4.3555860."

To increase realism additional data- sources are used in model development and calibration.

The calibrated model is applied to the sub-domains to identify important hydrological differences. To further support operational decision making the correlation between the ENSO-Index and the local climate is investigated, which is not found to be significant. The research shows that the developed FLEX-Topo model is suited to function in a data scarce- and low data quality environment. The model is able to reproduce the natural flow regime to a high degree. Appropriate model realism can be assumed and sensible sub-basin hydrology investigation is achieved.

However, there is no consensus on which eHMI concept is most suitable for intent communication. In nature, animals have evolved the ability to communicate intent via visual signals. Inspired by intent communication in nature, this paper investigated three novel and potentially intuitive eHMI designs that rely on posture, gesture, or colouration, respectively. In an online crowdsourcing study, 1523 participants viewed videos featuring a yielding or non-yielding AV with one of the three bio-inspired eHMIs, as well as a green/red lightbar eHMI, a walk/don’t walk text-based eHMI, and a baseline condition (i.e., no eHMI). Participants were asked to press and hold a key when they felt safe to cross and to answer rating questions. Together, these measures were used to determine the intuitiveness of the tested eHMIs. Results showed that the lightbar eHMI and text-based eHMI were more intuitive than the three bio-inspired eHMIs, which, in turn, were more intuitive than the baseline condition. An exception was the bio-inspired colouration eHMI, which attained a higher performance score than the other eHMIs when communicating ‘non-yielding’ before driving away from a standstill. Further research is necessary to examine whether these observations hold in more complex traffic situations and other eHMI designs. Additionally, we recommend combining features from different eHMIs, such as the full-body communication of the bio-inspired colouration eHMI with the colours of the lightbar eHMI.","Automated Vehicles; External Human-Machine Interface; Bio-inspired; Intent communication; Crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

We explore two possible solutions to this problem: relativistic extensions of MOND, and FEM simulations of the apparent matter distribution in clusters, utilising the non-linear AQUAL formulation to analyse non spherically symmetric systems. We consider Covariant Emergent Gravity, and we show that the theory is inconsistent with the original formulation of Emergent Gravity. Moreover, we show that either the theory is incompatible with observations, or it presents grave theoretical difficulties. We then suggest that a covariant formulation of EG can be obtained through a Generalised Einstein Aether (GEA) theory, which is capable of retrieving the MOND PDE, and is, at the same time, consistent with observational constraints. Regarding the FEM simulations of the apparent matter distribution in galaxy clusters, we construct a sample of 15 clusters from the catalogs of Reiprich and Abell for the baryonic mass distribution present in galaxy clusters. We choose FEM for its ability to treat the combination of continuous and discrete mass distributions without the need for smoothing. This is necessary, as in MOND we cannot apply the principle of superposition or the weak lensing formalism. We then utilise the FeniCS software package to study the properties of these clusters. We simulate each cluster with elements up to degree 3, thanks to a speedup by a factor of ∼ 100 obtained by the use of local mesh refinement for the serial case. In addition, we run the code in parallel on a single-threaded 8-core CPU, achieving near optimal weak scaling for the regime of interest. For the mass distribution in the galaxy clusters, we analyse the distribution of baryons, Phantom Dark Matter (PDM) and apparent mass both close to the core and around each galaxy. We find that the PDM tends to clump around the galaxies, regardless of the gas to galaxy mass ratio. Moreover, we show that both the apparent mass and the PDM can exhibit negative masses as predicted by Milgrom. Our observations on the density of PDM around the galaxies match recent observations of small scale weak lensing. In addition, our results for negative mass distributions provide an opportunity to test a prediction of MOND that can never be replicated in the dark-matter paradigm, and shed light on the properties of non-spherically symmetric mass distributions, that have, up to now, not been studied in the literature for the fully non-linear case.","Emergent Gravity; Modified Gravity; Einstein Aether Theory; Dark Matter; Modified Newtonian Dynamics; Covariant Emergent Gravity","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double MSc: Applied Physics - Computer Engineering","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

A focus direction within the NC4I group at DCSC, Delft University of Technology, is the development of new imaging modalities and the design and implementation of smarter algorithms for improved detection of parasitic diseases. The first part of my research exploits hyperspectral imagery (HI) as new potential imaging modality of thin blood smears that could highly improve on preparation time, labor intensiveness and use of materials. HI retrieves both spatial and spectral information of the observed objects simultaneously, thus providing the ability to discriminate near similar constituents within the blood smear. In doing so, it enables the possibility of label-free detection. In this thesis, the development and building of such a system is addressed and carried out. In the context of malaria, it is shown that HI is promising and lays a profound foundation for further exploration. The design and evaluation of improved generalizing neural networks characterize the essence of the second and larger part of the research. Several group-equivariant networks are evaluated and compared with conventional convolutional networks which shows that efficient and redefined integration of weights can help build smarter and more robust classifiers for the detection of parasites. In group-equivariant networks, re-interpreting the way feature maps are connected to one another manifests in the development of convolutional stages that equivary under an increased amount of transformations besides merely translations. It is shown that enlarging the heuristic of that transformation group (the extra amount of transformations the operations are equivariant under) significantly contributes to better performance without necessarily increasing the size or changing the architecture of the networks. Compared to the aforementioned baseline (conventional convolutional stages), the best network (being equivariant under 16 equidistant rotations and mirror reflections) improves approximately 2-fold on all relevant performance metrics, among which are accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and the F1-score which are common measures in the classification of malaria. The networks were tested on the Rajaraman database. Furthermore, the pre-trained models are used as classifiers for a different database extracted from the microscope build by AiDx medical. At least for this specific database, it is shown that the more realistic transformations the pre-trained networks equivary under, the more robust they are.","hyperspectral Imaging; Malaria Diagnosis; Neural Networks; Geometric Deep Learning; Microscopy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Researchers have endeavoured to seek for morphing solutions that are simple, predictable, tailorable and with promising shape adjustment. Instead of the traditional structural design against buckling failure, a novel concept now embraces this built-in instability by utilising the nonlinear buckling response of slender elements to produce selective stiffness modification which redistributes the load in the structural system. To enable desired buckling configurations with specific stiffness, three buckling-driven mechanisms are presented in this thesis by restraining the out-of-plane buckling deformation with point, area and maximum displacement constraints. Numerical investigation of the proposed mechanisms is first conducted on a composite plate to analyse the effect on the onset of buckling and postbuckling stiffness modification. The laminate with buckling-oriented mechanisms implemented is then integrated into a thin-walled rectangular composite wing box as a shear web to evaluate its functionality in a structural system. The proposed mechanisms offer effective control of the configurations and augmentation on the attainable range of shear centre relocation and torsional stiffness variation of the wing box. To explore the feasibility in morphing application, the interaction between buckling-induced twist and the aerodynamic load distribution is studied with a simplified aeroelastic wing model. Served as proof of concept, the work of the thesis demonstrates the potential to realise complicated morphing tasks through employing precisely-controlled buckling behaviours in structural components.","Buckling; FEM; Morphing Structures; Composite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Friston, have resulted in a concept called the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The FEP is a brain theory unifying action, perception and learning. An important observation is that autonomous robots have to perform similar tasks to the human brain. Therefore, these developments are very interesting from a control engineering perspective. A lot of research is going on in the direction of Active Inference (AI), which includes the perception and action parts of the FEP used for filtering and control on physical systems. However, a research gap exists for the theory describing the complex mathematical backbone of perception and learning, called Dynamic Expectation Maximization (DEM). DEM is a parameter estimation algorithm that can be used to perform filtering as well as system identification. This thesis is part of the research aiming to evaluate the performance of DEM as a filtering as well as system identification technique. To be more specific, this thesis considers the filtering part. In general, a filter is meant to derive the states of a system using a system model and sensor measurements. The system model is often not perfect, resulting in process noise, and the sensors provide noisy data, resulting in measurement noise. Many existing filtering techniques, including the conventional Kalman filter, assume these noises to be white. However, the process noise contains unmodelled system dynamics that introduce correlation. Therefore, by definition, the process noise is not white, but coloured. The main advantage of using the DEM filter is the ability to extract information from the correlation in the measurements and the noises to construct a better state estimate. Simulation results in previous work indicated the potential of DEM as a filter. The next step is to prove the usefulness of the DEM filter on a physical system. In order to do so, this thesis describes the design of an experimental setup with a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) used to evaluate the performance of the DEM filter. The recorded flight data is used to analyze the process and measurement noises. Furthermore, the DEM filter is compared with the conventional Kalman filter. It turns out that for a relatively big subspace of DEM tuning parameters, the DEM filter is able to outperform the Kalman filter, which proves the potential of this filtering algorithm in a practical robotics setting.","DEM filter; Free Energy Principle; Brain-inspired; LTI state-space model; Coloured noise; Robotics; Quadrotor state estimation; Parrot AR.Drone 2.0","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","As climate change takes hold, extreme weather events increasingly pressure the performance of the railway infrastructure. A first insight has been obtained into the impacts of climate change for the train system and the railway network, but there are almost no studies on the impact of our changing climate on railway stations. This study therefore aims to provide insight into the risks of climate change-induced hazards for railway stations in The Netherlands and the associated effects on the functionality of the station for passengers. Scenarios of climate change show that the Netherlands will experience increasingly intense rainfall, dryer, hotter summers and warmer, wetter winters. This poses a number of risks to the operation, reliability, availability and safety of train stations in a country with the busiest and densest rail network of the European Union. In this study, a method was created to study the risks of climate extremes for train stations on the basis of thirteen identified threats, and risk matrices were developed to support ProRail in defining their attitude towards climate risks. Results show that Dutch railway stations are vulnerable to climate change and demonstrate that there are many aspects of climate change at stations that require attention. The most important nodes in the station network, and stations that have a relatively high number of boarding and disembarking passengers per day, are at a higher risk than the national average. The results of this study show that this could have implications for a relatively high number of travellers in terms of their safety and contentment, and it could have socio-economic consequences for both ProRail and NS, as well as for the accessibility of The Netherlands. The local applicability of the risk assessment methodology was tested in five case studies on stations with very different characteristics, sizes and locations. The case studies have demonstrated that many of the identified risks appear to be relevant and appropriate on a local scale as well, but that risk is situation-specific. Furthermore, the case studies provide strategic long-term quantitative insights on adaptation strategies for all stations in the Netherlands, projecting the cases onto comparative situations.","Climate Change; Risk Assessment; Railway Station; Climate Adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the Waal bed degradation occurs, which is mainly induced by a large number of river regulations measures done in the past. Rijkswaterstaat develops possible measures and new techniques to stop riverbed erosion and/or mitigate the negative effects. One of the possible new techniques to reduce riverbed erosion locally is groyne field nourishments. The objective for this research is to deepen insights how groyne field nourishments provide enough sediment to the river such that bed degradation locally does not develop further. The following research question is formulated for this: How can groyne field nourishments act as small feeder nourishment that release sediment slowly to the main channel? To answer the research question a literature study is done and a XBeach model is set-up. The literature study is done to obtain knowledge about the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes in a groyne field in case of emerged and submerged groynes. From this literature study it appears that the effect of navigation on the morphology in a groyne field is dominant over the effect of the river discharge when the groynes are emerged: net sediment is transported from the groyne field to the main channel mainly by suction. When the flow conditions increase and the groyne get submerged, the effect of navigation on the morphology in the groyne field decreases rapidly and the net sediment transport is from the main channel to the groyne field induced by the river discharge, mainly the large-scale eddies. Extra literature study is done to possible relevant coastal and river processes to get knowledge of the effects of waves and currents on the behaviour of nourishments in a groyne field since very limited research has been done before on groyne field nourishments. It appears that especially dune erosion and river bank erosion by waves and currents can be used to explain how nourishments erode by the primary and secondary ship wave system. After the literature study a XBeach model is set-up of for a series of emerged groynes on a straight section in the Waal. The model is calibrated and validated with data from Rijkswaterstaat and literature. In this model three possible nourishments with the same volume are applied at different locations in the groyne field: 1) one upstream in the groyne field; 2) One downstream in the groyne field; 3) And one in the middle of the groyne field. From this research it can be concluded that groyne field nourishment at all three locations can work as small feeder nourishment that release sediment slowly to the main channel in the case of emerged groynes for about 200 days per year. The nourishment placed in the centre of the groyne field appears to be the most effective nourishment, since 1) the waves and currents induced by navigation attack the nourishment along all its edges, 2) the centre nourishment causes in almost the whole groyne field an increase of sediment transport to the main channel and 3) the flow pattern in the groyne field is changed favourably for the sediment transport of already suspended sediment to the main channel. This research should be seen as first indication if nourishment could work at all. It is advised to research the material of the nourishment and to simulate the groyne field nourishments for a longer period, such that more flow conditions and more ship passage are included, to get a more complete picture of how groyne field nourishments act as small feeder nourishments. Furthermore a practical test with a centre nourishment is recommended to collected data of the hydro- and morphodynamics in a groyne field with nourishment.","Groyne field; nourishment; bed degradation; Waal; navigation; ship waves; primary waves; secondary waves; return current; supply flow; suction; river discharge; large-scale horizontal eddies; unidirectional flow; river bank erosion; dune erosion,; avalanching,; negative feedback process; sediment transport; XBeach; numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Kerry, T.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","During the production of steel, a dust waste stream is created that contains a significant amount of zinc which makes it difficult to treat and to recycle. Various furnaces have been developed that can deal with those dusts like rotary hearth furnaces and the DK process but none are fully optimal yet. HIsarna, a furnace in development by Tata steel, is able to treat those zinc bearing dust by separating zinc from iron whilst being an ironmaking furnace. Basic oxygen furnace (BOF) dust, blast furnace (BF) dust and historical oxy chalk sludge (HOKS) have been the dusts under investigation for recycling in HIsarna. BF dust is a source of zinc and carbon whilst both BOF dust and HOKS contain a large share of iron. Microgranulates have been made from BOF dust and HOKS with different additions of BF dust which provides carbon that can be used for reduction reactions. With the help of thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and a horizontal furnace for isothermal experiments at 1000°C and 1300°C, the best two microgranulates (one HOKS/BF dust, one BOF dust/BF dust) were chosen that could completely reduce all zinc and iron oxides in a nitrogen atmosphere. Because HIsarna has a reducing atmosphere, this thesis focuses on answering the question how the self reduction behaviour of zinc in the microgranulates compares to the reduction behaviour in an atmosphere of 50% CO and 50% CO2. It appears that during isothermal experiments at 1000°C, the zinc separates more efficiently in nitrogen than in the 50/50 atmosphere. However this was not seen at 1300°C. At this temperature, the zinc concentration in the BOF dust microgranulates decreased in similar ways in both atmospheres while the zinc in the HOKS microgranulates reduced much faster in this reducing atmosphere. Besides isothermal experiments, a vertical TGA furnace was used for a non-isothermal experiment up to 1500°C at a large enough scale to analyse the samples after treatment. However, not much difference in zinc reduction ability was found between the different atmospheres. The dust from those experiments was collected and showed to contain zinc and lead present in elemental form, oxides and carbonates as well as potassium chloride. The results show to be promising for the recycling of dusts in HIsarna.","Steelmaking dust; Zinc; Recycling; HIsarna; High temperature; CO CO2; Self reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Material Science and Engineering","Reclamet",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This thesis captures the calibration of a FX hybrid model: The FX Black-Scholes Hull-White model. The main focus is on the calibration of the parameters in the Hull-White process: The mean reversion and the volatility parameter. The latter is commonly calibrated as a time-dependent parameter, whilst the mean reversion parameter is not. This thesis covers the calibration of the mean reversion as a time-dependent parameter. A known method from the Literature is researched, where we calibrate the mean reversion independently from the volatility parameter to the ratio of two swaptions with the same expiry but different tenor. In our research this method is extended to the negative interest rate environment by assuming that the swap rate follows a shifted lognormal distribution instead of a lognormal distribution. We show that a specific set of swaptions can be chosen, so that the calibration problem is simplified. This choice leads to sequential calibration of convex optimization problems. Numerical results of calibration to artificial and market data are presented, where we compare our method to picking the mean reversion parameter arbitrarily. The findings suggest that the choice of mean reversion parameter affects the calibration procedure. Therefore, we argue that a calibration method for the mean reversion would be appropriate. Besides the focus on the Hull-White process, the calibration of the volatility parameter in the FX Black-Scholes process of the hybrid model is investigated. For the calibration of the FX volatility parameter ATM options on FX rates are used. Numerical results of calibration to artificial and market data are shown. A typical problem of calibration in the industry is discussed: Precision for late maturities. The results in this thesis suggest that this problem could be solved. For research on homogeneity constraints on the time-dependent parameters, the performance of delta-hedging is investigated. The delta-hedging is performed in a simple Black-Scholes world with time-dependent volatility. We show that given a fixed amount hedges beforehand and interest rate zero, there exists an optimal distribution of time points that will lead to equal variance on the profit and loss for every volatility function that has equal implied volatility from t0 to maturity T. Using this strategy, the homogeneity of the volatility parameter has no impact on the performance of delta-hedging. Therefore, in this thesis no homogeneity constraints are used for the calibration of the time-dependent parameters.","Hull-White model; Hybrid models; Calibration; swaption; Black-Scholes Hull-White; Hull-White; Foreign Exchange market; FX; delta hedging; hedging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

A wind farm layout optimisation problem under uncertainty corresponds to optimisation under uncertainty (OUU), which is computationally expensive. It is, therefore, proposed to solve this issue by applying surrogate modelling. The thesis considers and compares two different surrogate models, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Kriging, on two different applications. First, the surrogate model is built for the wind farm power model to emulate the medium-fidelity model that requires to evaluate the wake effect in every wind speed and wind direction. Another application of the surrogate model is for the uncertainty quantification (UQ). As the computational expensive Monte Carlo method is traditionally used to propagate the uncertain variables, the use of surrogate models can further reduce the number of uncertain samples to obtain the statistic output response. <br/>Once the statistic of annual energy production (AEP) of the wind farm can be computed efficiently, the optimisation under uncertainty problem is performed with the genetic algorithms. The computational time of optimisation under uncertainty is reduced by using the surrogate UQ model, and a layout that may be more robust to the inter-year variation is found as indicated by a higher P90 value of AEP.","Wind farm layout optimisation; Uncertainty Quantification; Surrogate modelling; Polynomial Chaos Expansion; Kriging; Genetic algorithm; Offshore wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

Couples can gain time and conserve kinetic energy with a well performed exchange. However, the exchange is a difficult operation. With few studies done to find out what makes a good relay exchange, the exchange is rather based on experience than on knowledge. Former studies investigated the kinetic energy efficiency and the straight time with and without exchanging to find positive and negative influencing factors. To study the influence of skating velocity on relay efficiency, both the Dutch National short track team and RTC North participated in a test setup. Two inertial measurement units, worn in a waist belt during the relay training exercises, provided acceleration data during the relay exchange. The acceleration data from both the pushed and pushing skater were studied to find out what the influence of the skating velocity is on the performance of the exchange. Horizontal accelerations of the pushing and pushed skater were transferred into total horizontal forces with the difference between these total horizontal forces (DF) deemed as an efficiency value for the relay push. A weak positive correlation is found between: DF and the skating velocity of the pushed skater and the deceleration of the pushing skater and the skating velocity of the pushed skater. Camera images revealed the accelerations of the pushed skater to be a combination of the exchange push and the first stride, with no distinction visible between them in the corresponding acceleration data. The influence of the first stride is unknown, making the acceleration data difficult to interpret.","Short track; relay exchange; relay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

People with dementia are not the only ones affected. As the demand for care is high, families and caregivers experience physical, emotional, and sometimes financial stress. Up to date, there is no cure for dementia and its progression. The current research nowadays focuses mainly on strategies for preventing dementia and improving people with dementia’s quality of life and those around them. Active Cues (now ‘Tover’) is an organization based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, that aims to create moments of happiness in residential care. They do so with the ToverTafel, an interactive set of projections that stimulates each of the company’s target groups, with games designed specifically for them. The starting point of this project was to enrich Active Cues’ current design process to keep designing for People with Dementia. In the first phases of the project, dementia and the needs of each of the individuals involved (Professional Caregivers, Informal Caregivers, and People with dementia) were researched through literature and generative techniques. It was found that people with dementia are fond of references to their past and that informal caregivers have access to it to a certain extent. Meanwhile, family members who act as informal caregivers go through dementia grief, have deep bonds with the PwD, know their preferences, and develop effective ways of engaging with them. Active Cues’ way of working was also explored. In their design process, professional caregivers are the representatives of PwD living in nursing houses . They support Active Cues by helping understand what happens during their design iterations and bringing suggestions for new games and their improvements. However, professional caregivers are not always aware of people with dementia history and background, nor do they have time to access it to transmit this knowledge to Active Cues. The generative techniques’ interviews show that informal caregivers are potentially rich sources of valuable insights, and they are not part of Active Cues’ design process. Integrating informal caregivers’ input in Active Cues creative design process was proposed to gain contextual knowledge about people with dementia. Based on the generative techniques’ insights, a number of requirements were identified for both the informal caregiver and Active Cues. The project focused only on the informal caregiver’s requirements: promoting reflection, being pertinent in the informal caregiver’s journey, and being light-hearted. After experimenting with digital prototypes and performing co-creation sessions with informal caregivers, a concept called Remi was designed. Remi is a digital journaling service that aims to provide informal caregivers space to decompress, reflect on one’s feelings, connect with others by journaling and sharing stories with Active Cues to generate valuable insights for their creative process. The concept was tested through storyboard sessions and an interaction test supported by semi-structured interviews. It was found that informal caregivers were willing to share personal stories with an organization such as Active Cues. They mentioned it would feel gratifying to know they are contributing to the big goal of improving the quality of life of people living with dementia.","Dementia; People with Dementia; Caregiver; Informal Caregiver; Professional Caregiver; Co-creation; Generative research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Overmars, E.F.J.

Swimming techniques have been analysed for decades to increase and optimize performance in order to win medals in the biggest competitions. The arms and the hands play a major role in the forward propulsion generated by a swimmer, especially in front crawl swimming. They have been widely investigated for steady motion, from the elbow position to the hand orientation and configuration. However, it is argued that the arm velocity is continuously varying during a front crawl stroke and that this unsteadiness can enhance propulsion. For this reason, investigating the effect of unsteady motion on the propulsive forces generated by the hand is of great interest. The objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the effect of acceleration on the propulsion drag of a hand in human swimming, and how this effect evolves with finger spreading. To do so, experiments on four full-scale 3D printed hands with attached forearm and different finger spreading are performed. The experiments take place in a 2 x 2 m open glass tank filled with water. The hands, mounted on a robot arm and fully submerged, are accelerated towards a constant target velocity along a linear path. The acceleration and the velocity are varied resulting in a Reynolds number of 2 x 104 ≤ &#x1d445;&#x1d452; ≤ 6 x 104 based on the hand palm. The drag force exerting on the hand is measured as a function of time and three phases are distinguished: (i) the acceleration phase during which the drag reaches a maximum, (ii) the transition phase where the drag gradually decreases to reach a constant value during (iii) the steady phase. In parallel, two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) is performed in a plan crossing the fingers. A significant effect of acceleration was found performing experiments for four different accelerations. Higher accelerations generate stronger and more concentrated vortices behind the hand, resulting in a larger amount of circulation close to the hand. Consequently, a 25% increase is found in the drag force at the end of the acceleration when the latter is multiplied by four. No significant effect of finger spreading on the drag force during the acceleration was found. However, surprisingly, an enhancement of the drag force of 5% to 10% was measured during the transition phase and the steady phase for the closed hand compared to the hands with finger spreading. PIV showed larger amount of circulation close to the hand without finger spreading.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

One of the actions for a sustainable future is starting an energy transition for the reduction of greenhouse gases. For realising this transition, local energy cooperatives are initiated. Within these local energy cooperatives, a collective of citizens is willing to generate and distribute renewable energy. For the development of these projects, a collaboration with the municipality is needed. However, there are barriers within this collaboration that withholds the collaboration to become sustainable. These barriers are defined as: (1) the attitude of the municipality, (2) the group dynamics and group composition of the local energy cooperative, and (3) the ignorance of the two parties. The objective of this research is understanding and designing a process for both municipalities and local energy cooperatives which facilitates their collaboration. Therefore, the main research question is: How can municipalities and local energy cooperatives improve their collaboration to facilitate the energy transition? For answering this question, a literature study is executed regarding the concept of local energy cooperatives, collaboration, governance arrangements, intermediaries, and theoretical perspectives on transition. Insights from these subjects together form the theoretical framework for the rest of the research. A concept of design thinking, the Double Diamond method, is used for the development of the design. This method consists of four stages: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. The method is divided into two diamonds, these diamonds are based on the concepts of divergent and convergent thinking.

The growing media sector is looking for sustainable alternative raw materials, but at the same time the global population needs to be provided of food. The aim of this research is to contribute to the use of more sustainable materials in the European growing media sector, considering all the business constraints. There is looked at what developments and analytical tools can contribute to decision-making in the growing media sector in its transition to a sustainable sector. A system analysis on the basis of a multi-level perspective and a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis have been carried out. An expert panel was asked to indicate their preferences for the selection criteria. The results of the system analysis show that the following developments are important in the transition to a sustainable growing media sector; Circular economy, Data-driven horticulture, Microbial horticulture and Increasing legislation. In the MCDA, four groups of alternatives have been defined: (1) white peat, perlite and woodfibre. (2) Accretio, mineral wool, foam and black peat. (3) Bark. (4) (standardized) Compost and the coir materials. The scenarios show that in the future the results will be very robust. However, the importance of peat will decrease and other materials will score better. The growing demand for growing media requires to focus on the low scores of the MCDA and the utilisation of current and future developments in order to make all raw materials attractive for use in the substrate sector. In addition, the sector will have to cooperate with all those involved in order to operate more sustainably. This will minimise the importance of peat and ensure that the sector can continue to provide the global food demand in a sustainable manner.","MCDA; Multi-level perspective; Sustainability performance; Growing Media; Eco-innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Classical location decision-making overemphasize the role of economic factors while the energy related factors are often neglected. This research supports the energy transition by means of rethinking the location decision-making problem concerning Energy-Intensive Industries (EIIs). The main objective is to determine how the suitability of sites of industry clusters in Europe will change because of the energy transition. Two industry clusters in Europe are selected and used as test cases for analysis. To offer understanding of the suitability of cluster locations to a changing energy medium, a procedure to conduct analysis is developed and applied. The necessity to develop the analysis procedure is motivated by the lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for the analysis of industrial location problems in the context of energy transitions. The outcomes of the so-called factor analysis procedure enable to reason on the suitability of the sites of the clusters to the envisioned future renewable environment. To ensure validity of data and of findings, insight emerging from the literature and assumptions made by the author, are triangulated with the opinion of stakeholders and experts in the field. The research concludes that the energy transition will have a severe impact on the suitability of sites of the investigated EII clusters in Europe. The rationale being that, state-of-the-art sites are not suitable to a fully transitioned word. Exploring the future points to necessary changes that the sites have to undergo in order to suit a transitioned word. The findings emerging from the analysis, are meant for investors and traders that are interested in siting and industry modernization. Ideally, the methodology developed to study EIIs can be extended to other industrial sectors. I will be necessary to analyze the novel decision space and evaluate the factors at play on the novel location problem under investigation. Future research efforts should internalize the dynamics that govern the location decision of EII clusters described in research and use them to better understand the effects of possible failures of intervention.","energy intensive industry cluster; Location decision-making; energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Sustainable development is the key solution to mitigate the impact of the 21st century’s major challenges such as the depletion of our natural resources, emissions that accelerate climate change together with the large waste generation. One of the largest contributor to the aforementioned issues is the existing building stock, in particular the office sector. Upgrading the sustainability performance of the existing building stock is not only in the interest of regulators or society. Real estate professionals are interested in the sustainability performance of their property, portfolio or occupied property. Due to the complexity, it is not feasible for market participants to verify the sustainability performance of a property. As a consequence, voluntary certification schemes have emerged to provide an objective evaluation. However, at the same time, appraisers are paradoxically expected to provide an objective estimation/opinion on the potential added value of sustainability while their duty according to governances is to derive the market value by analysing available data. The inability of current valuation practices for incorporating a thorough sustainability assessment resulted in decision-makers to focus solely on energy-related costs and justify their investment decisions based on energy-related benefits. For this reason, many investment decisions are believed to be profitable for users instead of owners. However, previous research has shown that property owners of sustainable offices might achieve positive effects in relation to an enhanced image, corporate social responsibility, less risky profile for investors and improved marketability. In the effort to shed light on these far-reaching tentacles of sustainability, this thesis sets forth the base for developing an indicator-based sustainability assessment framework for the appraisal of offices. The proposed framework integrates sustainability and the value it holds for various stakeholders by conceptualizing the relationship between sustainability indicators and different value systems as well as the economic parameters that are adjustable by an appraiser in the income capitalization method. In this way, an appraiser is able to provide an objective estimation of the possible added value of sustainability. Starting from an extensive literature review of different certification schemes, a pre-selection of sustainability indicators was made. Through conducting 8 semi-structured interviews with sustainability experts, the first selection of indicators could be determined together with their goals, measurement and criteria. It is remarkable that according to the participants, actively monitoring the consumption and other management-related indicators are defining the sustainability performance of an office as well, next to the physical characteristics. The online survey was distributed among sustainability experts with a questionnaire designed with the constant sum method and were requested to allocate points over the indicators as well as the categories to determine the relevance. Ultimately, the selection resulted in a set of 34 indicators. Combining the findings from the interviews, data from the survey and the literature review resulted in a framework which was discussed in an expert interview with an appraiser. The findings of the expert interview indicate that there is still a huge gap between practice and theory. The nature of the current valuation techniques hampers the integration of sustainability by focussing mainly on the rental agreement. In order to integrate sustainability aspects into the appraisal, a shift from only looking at the rental agreement to looking at the current use and the fitness for use would be needed. Future research could focus on validating and expanding the linkage between the sustainability indicators and the economic adjustable parameters and reducing the subjectivity of input for the indicators.","sustainability indicators; sustainable property appraisal; added value; framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

These changes to a standard system behaviour are known as anomalies and the effort to detect and identify these anomalies is known as anomaly detection. A standard way of performing such task is by learning a model of the normal system behaviour and then raising a flag when the observed behaviour is not inline with the model. Timed Automata (TA) are a commonly used modelling technique for anomaly detection. One of their advantages come from the fact that such models are highly interpretable. This research project proposes a new method for discretizing data based on motif discovery which is then used to learn a model. Using such discretization routine, an investigation of the effect on model interpretability of the learned TA is reported.","timed automata","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pharma is an industry with a lot of regulations and barriers, so consultancies that solve challenges in this industry need to be prepared for it.This project is born with the aim of improving the Business Design value proposition of Opinno, regarding its process, management or approach. Since the challenge is really broad, this project will first focus on defining a direction informed by the appropriate research. Based on literature, analysis of Opinno Business Design practices and interviews with Opinno consultants &amp; external experts in the fields of Pharma &amp; Business Design, this project focused on tackling two issues to improve the value proposition of the department.Firstly, misalignment was found in terms of Business Design, and a Business Design definition was created in the form of a Playbook. Content was created from literature, trends and current practices inside Opinno.Secondly, the core of the project focused on knowledge management. Research showed that the best practices and knowledge generated during projects were not stored and transferred in a structured way and some of it was lost. A process to capture, store and access knowledge was designed to solve this issue. Its backbone, a digital platform, was designed, prototyped and tested. This platform uses AI to provide all the existing resources when a consultant types the challenge; knowledge related to the industry, clients, processes or contact people will be displayed so consultants can use it during the proposal creation or project execution.This set of solutions will help Opinno to keep the knowledge once an employee leaves, save time, improve projects and proposals and support their journey towards Pharma verticalization. In the end, it will create a reference site where employees can go when they feel lost with the methodology or they have industry knowledge gaps when executing projects.","Business Design; knowledge management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It is estimated that plastics in the marine environment weigh more than 150 million metric tons and by 2050 could even outweigh the mass of fish in the ocean. Over half of the world population (55%) nowadays lives in urban areas and consumes large amounts of materials and turns them into waste, including plastics. Thus, it necessary to understand the plastic mass balance of a city. The goal of this thesis is to assess plastic flows and stocks for an urban area, using the well-established method of Material Flow Analysis (MFA). By using MFA, material flows through society can be assessed in a systematic way. This research answers the following research question: “How can the plastic mass balance of an urban area be modelled using Material Flow Analysis?” This is done by developing a generic framework, which includes eight consumption sectors, three distinguishable littering processes and two subsystems (surface water system and soil). A bottom-up approach is applied and the municipality of Leiden in the Netherlands is used as a case study. The surface water system is analysed as a subsystem, which stores plastics but also transports them through physical forces, like water flow outside of the system. Crowd-sourced data is analysed and its usage for urban MFA assessed. The analysis shows that the biggest plastic flows are packaging flows (4 146 t), plastics in building waste (1 342 t) and plastics in End-of-life transportation systems (570 t). The highest plastic stocks are in buildings (86 080 t), transportation (14 020 t) and electronics devices (10 326 t). It is concluded that the crowd-sourced data set Litterati includes for 2019 for the case of Leiden to little data points in order to represent the plastic litter quantity in the system accurately. This thesis adds to MFA theory by investigating the surface water system and its connection to the environment through physical forces like water flow and wind.","MFA; Plastic; Material Flow Analysis; Leiden; Water system; Stock Accounting; GIS; Framework; STAN; bottom up approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The different components of flow regime like topography, geology, and climatic variation contribute to different ecological processes. These ecosystems provide a wide range of direct and indirect benefits to a human being. The ecosystem services such as hydropower, irrigation, drinking water supply, fisheries, breeding ground for aquatic wild life, sanctuary reserves form the lifeline of many stakeholders. All the water management decisions are based on certain hydrological informations. However, the hydrological information these decisions are based on are not precise and is a simplified version of the actual system. Anthropogenic effects of human intervention on natural flow regime significantly disturbs the natural characteristics of the hydrological flow. Hydrological alterations of river flow regime while benefitting human development in many ways have damaged the delivery of ecosystem services. Growth in human population, decline in resources, ever changing climatic conditions, led to an increase in demand of the resources.The situation is further complicated by multitude of water users and stakeholders with conflicting interests this requires the accurate assessment of the river flow regime taking into account the anthropogenic effects of human intervention in the riverine ecosystem. Reservoir construction is one of the major human intervention to the riverine ecosystem. Construction of reservoirs are usually associated with substantial impacts on river hydrology and surrounding ecosystem. As a result, dams have been constructed to meet the needs of irrigation and energy. These constructions affect the connectivity of the river and eventually changes the entire ecosystem. Topography based hydrological models simulates the response of the catchment due to the different hydrological response units(HRUs). These HRUs are natural and doesn’t take into account anthropogenic factors into account. Therefore, the present study aims to understand the effects of the integration of reservoirs into a Flex-Topo model to assess the model performance.","Reservoirs operation; Flex_Topo; Hydrological modeling","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

UTES uses stable subsurface temperatures store and extract energy. This study covers two types of UTES systems: aquifer thermal energy systems (ATES) and borehole heat exchangers (BHE). UTES systems in the Netherlands have seen a significant growth over the past years (Bloemendal, 2018) and are expected to contribute up to 20% of the heating and cooling demand of buildings by 2050 (Naber et al., 2016). As more UTES systems are installed, the risk of unwanted interaction between different system increases. However, ATES-BHE interaction is largely unknown. <br/>The objective of this study is to gather more insight in the interaction of ATES system on the efficiency of BHE systems. A numerical model is used to simulate an ATES well near a BHE system using SEAWAT (Langevin et al., 2008). The model is used to run different simulations, from which the efficiency of a BHE system is computed under different circumstances over a five year period. Four conclusions are drawn from the results. First, groundwater and temperature interference from ATES systems affect the efficiency of a BHE system differently. Simulations show that the effect of groundwater flow induced by an ATES system always has a positive effect on the efficiency of a BHE system. The effect of temperature interference is dependent on the temperature of the ATES well. Groundwater was also found to interfere at larger distances between both systems compared to temperature. Second, the degree of interference is related to the distance between the ATES and BHE system. For distances smaller than 0.5 times the thermal radius of the ATES system, interference from temperature was found to be dominant in the simulations. For distances larger than 0.5 times the thermal radius of the ATES system, groundwater interference was found to be the dominant factor. The third conclusion is that the depth placement of the ATES well screen has little to no effect on the amount of interference on the BHE system. Fourth, it is important to realize that no energy is spontaneously generated or lost as BHE efficiencies increase or decrease respectively. Energy is simply exchanged between the ATES and BHE system through the subsurface. Whether that is disadvantageous depends on the energy demands of both systems. Most energy demands are imbalanced, meaning either cooling or heating demand is larger than the other. It is recommended to consider UTES system installations from a holistic point of view.","Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES); Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE); Numerical model; interference; Groundwater flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Variations of this minimally invasive instrument, accompanied by guidewires, are manipulated through the vasculature towards the target of the intervention. The human vascular anatomy can however present complex pathways towards a target, for example a distal tumor. Interventions are challenged by limited 2D imaging, and a limited degree of motion and control of the instruments. This thesis therefore focuses on developing a novel endovascular microcatheter with a steerable tip, a project commissioned by Mencius Medical BV. It elaborates on the theoretical substantiation of the designed distal steering mechanism, that is developed based on an existing patent. It covers part of the design process and documents the development from patent to working prototype. The design process commences with observations in the operating theatre and specialist interviews, allowing for thorough understanding of the clinical need. Based on this need, the catheter tip is designed with a unique mechanism, enabling controlled tip deflection while inside vascular environment. A user-centered approach enabled fast and efficient convergence of design choices. The concept is evaluated on its technical feasibility, producibility, and functionality. A thorough mechanical and computational (FEA) analysis evaluates the material choice and feasibility of the design by simulating the system’s behavior in context of use. This analysis confirms a theoretical proof of principle. A user test with various prototypes in pre-clinical environment provides the first step towards practical proof of principle. A recommendation is done for further in-vivo validation for final proof of concept. The device potentially allows the interventionalist to take the entire route through the vascular roadmap with one device, eliminating a trial and error process and the need for exchanging multiple instruments during the procedure. Consequently, operation time, radiation, frustration, vessel trauma, and equipment waste are minimized. Lastly, it might increase the accessibility of more distally located tumors, which is groundbreaking for tumor treatment and interventional radiology in general.","steerable; microcatheter; medical device; endovascular; prototyping; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-07","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

One of the countries facing water challenges related to cotton cultivation is India. India experiences a monsoon weather pattern causing large amount of rain from June to October and no rain during the other months. One of the challenges India’s small holder cot- ton farmers face is the lack of water after the monsoon. A solution to this problem could be the construction of (small) reservoir structures and renovation of currently present structures. One of the main questions arising here is ‘how can a hydrological model estimate new reservoir locations for small holder cotton farmers and what is the potential of these new structures and current structures in Maharashtra India with Ghatanji block and Hinganghat block as case study areas?’. Estimating potential reservoir locations as well as determining which current reservoir structures have the potential to be renewed could increase the water availability for small holder cotton farmers in Maharashtra, India.<br/>Four focus areas are chosen, these areas are Yavatmal, Nagpur, Wardha and Amravati. Within these fo- cus areas, Ghatanji block and Hinganghat block are used as case study areas for developing and validating different models used for analysing current and suitable potential locations.Remote data based tools used to locate, validate and analyse the potential of current and potential suitable structures are QSWAT (hydrological model), Google Earth Engine (land cover analysis), Python coding, Zoom.Earth (locating current structures), socio-hydrological model (yield and benefit analysis).<br/>Out of the initial 692 potential locations, 315 locations in Ghatanji block and 349 locations in Hinganghat block are classified as suitable potential reservoir locations. A location was marked suitable if a minimum size (200m3) reservoir on this position has the ability to fill up completely at least once a year for an average monsoon season. Additionally, the structure was positioned in a location with more than 30% crop coverage and less than 25% urban coverage. Out of a total of 2212 current structures, 840 locations in Hinganghat and 970 locations in Ghatanji have a high potential of collecting water if renovated and in use. This high potential is a result of small distance to the nearest stream and suitable land cover on the position of the reservoir. Existing structures were classified as suitable if they adhere the same prerequisites as stated above regarding the coverage and for the additional requirement that a structure should be located less than 200 meters from the nearest stream point.<br/>The results of this investigation show that a hydrological model can estimate new potential reservoir locations and that the use of a hydrological model is beneficial for locating these potential locations when com- pared to current or recently constructed locations. The benefit of using a hydrological model is that it can identify the surface runoff paths of water during and after a precipitation event. Furthermore, can remote data based tools help in identifying the suitability of both potential as well as current structures.","Hydrological model; QSWAT; Google Earth Engine; Cotton; Small-holder farmers; Remote sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/Jente77/Hydrological_model Github with all codes","","","","","","","Water Efficiency in Sustainable Cotton-based Production Systems in Maharashtra, India","79.520558, 21.088583"

(mentor); van de Water, W. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The interfacial tension is a fundamental property of liquid-liquid systems and governs the mixing potential of two immiscible fluids. For two fluids to form a stable mixture, their interfacial tension needs to be very low. Applications of systems with a low interfacial tension find a plethora of applications: for example, in the food industry, for generating oil-water emulsions, or in the pharmaceutical industry, where characterising the mixture is important for the drug delivery. Despite the numerous industrial applications, characterising low interfacial tension remains a challenge. Traditional direct force measurement techniques, such as the Wilhelmy Plate method, have difficulties resolving the small forces involved. Other conventional drop distortion techniques, such as spinning drop tensiometry, require long calibration time and can have error margins up to 60%. This thesis investigates the potential of utilising the optical tweezers for studying low interfacial tensions and developed a method to do so. In this set-up, a highly focused laser beam holds a micron-sized sphere: similar to a pair of tweezers. As light refracts through the bead, momentum is transfered and thus exerts a force. The light refraction is also used for position detection, allowing for a spatial resolution of 0.1-2 nm. As a micro-sphere, which is hold by the optical tweezers, is pushed against an interface, the forces exerted on the bead are probed allowing for the interfacial tension to be determined. Combining the excellent spatial resolution of the optical tweezers with fitting a minimal surface model, the set-up has the potential to measure the interfacial tension over a range of decades. We have researched the dodecane-water interface, where we added glycerol to the aqueous phase to match the index of refraction. The interfacial tension was lowered by adding Span-80 or the combination of Span-80 and SDS. We have been able to conduct several measurements on interfaces with estimated values of O(-6) - O(-3) N/m. We find that the system is highly dependent on the different in index of refraction between the two fluids as well as the curvature of the interface. However, discrepancies between literature values and measurements arise due to the altering of the fluid properties and interfacial dimensions. We conclude that the use of optical tweezers to measure low interfacial tension is promising, however its speed and accuracy are reduced due to the strong requirement to match the index of refraction.","interfacial tension; optical tweezers; tensiometry; Brownian motion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

(mentor); Smit, I.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In a future where most of our transit system consists of autonomous vehicle, the question is raised how we as humans interact and communicate with them, and they with us. This project explores these interactions in the current time to uncover how humans interact and negotiate in traffic. More specifically how pedestrians do so. From the analysis it came forward that such interactions are mainly based on implicit communications – messages sent through behavioural cues that are not necessarily meant as a message. This contradicts the belief that humans use mostly explicit communications such as eye contact and gestures to communicate with fellow traffic participants. The disappearance of the driver might thus not have as much of an impact of the effectivity with which we humans can communicate with autonomous vehicles. However, many research currently study how more explicit communication tools, such as external human machine interfaces (eHMI) on the vehicle can help the pedestrian in making their decision to cross. These studies do find that there is a slight benefit to these eHMI systems, however they are not as significant as one might hope. eHMI systems also present several concerns including their visibility from afar, ambiguity and one sided communication. Especially that last concern is one that is central in this project. The process follows the guidelines of the Vision in Product design process, which explores current day interactions and context to then formulate a vision for the future. Based on this future and the gained insights a design statement is formulated that contains the goal to be fulfilled by the final design. The goal defined in this project is as follows: designing a cross walk that prioritises pedestrian transit while maintaining an efficient interaction between autonomous vehicle and the pedestrian. The final design proposal presents a cross walk that uses animations that come to life through lights integrated in the floor tiles. The cross walk is unique in its design as it extends onto the side walk to allow pedestrians to consciously show their intention to cross towards the autonomous vehicle. The cross walk is able to register the pedestrian. Since the cross walk registers the pedestrian early on, it can send a signal to the autonomous vehicle to slow down to give the pedestrian the right of way. The pedestrian receives feedback that shows them how safe it is for them to cross through the use of these animations. A series of animations have been designed and evaluated and based on the results a final set of animations has been designed. These animations will communicate that is either safe or not safe for the pedestrian to cross. As such, the pedestrian is able to actively communicate with the autonomous vehicle and receives personal feedback, instead of being told what to do by the autonomous vehicle what to do. Bringing both their different communication bubbles together and translating them through the cross walk so both understand what the other will do.","Autonomous Vehicles; ViP; Interaction Design; Infrastructure; Pedestrian; Smart City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The negative ecological impact normally associated with closure dams is partially mitigated by including a tidal power station in the structure. Water can move through the tidal power station resulting in a reduced tidal stroke at the created lake. This tidal stroke plays an important role in maintaining the desired water- and nature quality within the lake. By including pumping capacity in the tidal power station the tidal stroke can be maintained as sea level rises with respect to the mean water level in the artificial lake. The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of a dam including a tidal power station with pumping capacity given the uncertainty of sea level rise. To this end a few locations worldwide with high flood risk were selected for further analysis. A hydro energetic cost model was developed to simulate a tidal power station with pumping capacity. An optimization model was developed to generate optimal designs for power stations at all locations under evaluation. The economic feasibility of the dam with tidal power station including pumping capacity was assessed through a series of business cases, using the results from the two models. The solution was compared to the business case of other flood protection measures. The analysis showed that the concept has potential mainly as a long term solution, when a strong reduction of the tide at the created lake is allowed, and when a large amount of sea level rise is expected during the lifetime of the structure.","Tidal power station; Tidal energy; Turbines; Pumps; Flood Defence; Optimisation; Sea level rise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The AMA poses an interesting case study with high ambitions for a circular economy in relation to organic and biobased resources, yet a comprehensive regional strategy for circular and sustainable FW waste treatment remains uncomposed, while effective FW prevention does not emerge. Especially with regard to techniques that obtain more high-value, circular products as aimed for by the Dutch government. Only few studies investigate these high-value techniques, and more importantly lack to demonstrate the role of governance in the socio-technical transition that is required, and the impact it has on the main actors in the current system, as it requires a change from a systems perspective. Therefore, this research applies a two-dimensional nexus governance approach specific to the context of three high-value valorisation techniques in the AMA that use fermentation technologies for fatty acids production (i.e. Chaincraft for feed additives, Amsterdam Green Campus for food additives, and the FABULOUS-project for bioplastics). It investigates how these technologies could contribute to more circular and sustainable FW valorisation.

One of the main challenges is boundary layer flame flashback (BLF) as a key operability issue for low NO<sub>x</sub> premixed combustion of hydrogen-enriched fuels; thus design of tools to predict flashback propensity is of interest. Extensive research has already been done, and the result is three main BLF models, promise to predict the initiation of boundary layer flame flashback accurately. The first model was developed in the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and was applied to an axial-dump burner operating at elevated pressure and temperature conditions with fuel mixtures of H<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. The second model was developed at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and was based on the flashback experimental data of 100% H<sub>2</sub> fuel (similar geometry with UCI) at elevated pressure and temperature conditions. Finally, the most recent BLF model was developed at TU Delft based upon the 'generalized' Stratford's turbulent boundary layer separation criterion, which is a further development of the model initially developed in TU Munich (TUM) for atmospheric confined H<sub>2</sub> flames in a horizontal channel burner. In this thesis, the performance of the state-of-the-art BLF models is evaluated in a number of academic burners operating with H<sub>2</sub>-rich and pure H<sub>2</sub> fuels at atmospheric and elevated operating conditions. While the TU Delft model showed good agreement with 100% H<sub>2</sub> flashback experiments under atmospheric conditions and simple geometries, further modifications are proposed to perform under conditions relevant for gas turbines (increased pressure and temperature). A new turbulent flame speed correlation to capture the effect of pressure on flashback propensity is applied to the model and validated in high-pressure academic burners. Furthermore, the TU Delft model is validated for a lab-scale size of a gas turbine burner geometry, operating at atmospheric conditions and tested in the TU Delft laboratory. This validation shows that it is essential to review the outcome of the boundary layer flashback model at different locations in the boundary layer, and with minor modifications, the model can capture the test results adequately. The sensitivity of the TU Delft model on different fuel compositions is also investigated. Proper selection of the turbulent flame speed correlation is found to improve the model's performance for fuel mixtures less rich in H<sub>2</sub>.<br","boundary layer flashback; hydrogen combustion; Computational Fluid dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-04","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

To clear the confusion, the need for a scalable benchmarking suite to determine the field's progress became apparent, leading to the first contribution of this work, a scalable benchmarking suite for schema matching tasks. In the meantime, we realized that the literature lacked a scalable holistic schema matching system, leading to our second contribution. By considering the knowledge gained from our proposed benchmark, we developed a system that can incorporate any algorithm and data source while running the schema matching jobs in parallel across multiple machines in a scalable fashion. Furthermore, we decided to give a leading role to the users of such a system. The reason behind that is that it became apparent in the benchmark that no algorithm is perfect in every situation, and in mission-critical applications, we cannot afford any mistakes. Thus, the users would have to approve the proposed matches, and we focused on making this task scalable, fast, and straightforward.","Schema Matching; Scalability; Data Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

The atherosclerotic plaque is characterized as anisotropic, soft tissue and a potential plaque rupture could result in life-threatening clinical events, such as ischemic attack or stroke. The plaque rupture mechanism is still poorly understood due to the lack of real-time, in-vivo observations. Aiming to predict and describe the plaque damage behavior, numerical damage models have been implemented. This study focused on developing a theoretical and computational framework of Strain Energy Density Function (SEDF) with energy limiter damage model with atherosclerotic plaque-mimicking tissue-engineered applications. The generated damage model was implemented in Neo-Hookean and Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) SEDF via material user subroutines (UMAT codes) in finite element software. The computational models simulated 8 different experimental ruptured cases based on idealized and realistic geometrical models. In the material characterization process an iterative optimization algorithm was developed. The findings demonstrated that the case-specific computational models with SEDF with energy limiter damage model reproduced the plaque-mimicking rupture as they fitted the experimental crack initiation and propagation patterns. The results revealed that the anisotropic HGO material model generated the highest amount of Cauchy stresses and strain energy density. In addition, the geometrical configuration sensitivity of the damage model was emphasized as all cracks initiated from the inclusion and the results between idealized and realistic geometrical models deviated. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of various energy limiters in matrix and fibers components via the SEDF and resulted in a matrix-dominated damage model. The SEDF with energy limiter model could be further optimized by developing a fully automated damage model and validated with clinical applications.","Atherosclerosis; Plaque; Computational; Numerical; Strain Energy Density Function; Energy Limiter; Damage; UMAT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Health budgets were reduced, and since the beginning of the crisis, 1.5 million additional people in Europe have had an unmet need for healthcare (A. Reeves, McKee, &amp; Stuckler, 2015). A key challenge is both to achieve and to maintain the quality of healthcare, including new technologies within constrained budgets (Godman et al., 2016). This puts facilities such as hospitals in a difficult position. They are required to balance the contradictory and competing demands of efficiency and specialization, low operating costs and high-end amenities, minimized capital costs and optimum clinical quality (Clough et al., 2011). Innovation is a key concept in healthcare, because innovation engineering and management allow for more efficient development of better concepts of medical devices (Lamé, Yannou, &amp; Cluzel, 2018). This is essential for sustainable healthcare systems in the future (Ellner et al., 2015). In this light, there has been an increased interest in the Living Lab concept (Bergvall-Kåreborn, Eriksson, Ståhlbröst, &amp; Svensson, 2009). In a Living Lab, multiple relevant stakeholders work together in a real life setting. Despite the growing recognition and use of Living Labs throughout society, literature on this phenomenon remains scarce (Dell’Era &amp; Landoni, 2014). The Living Lab method is relatively new, and Living Lab participants are rarely entrepreneurs. The result tends to be an unclear Living Lab structure with little focus on management. A consequence is that the overall structure, activities and vision are not always clear. Due to these unclarities, management might take more time than necessary. Creating structure in Living Lab collaborations can save participants lots of time and frustration. It is crucial however, to maintain the free and open way of collaborating, which is characteristic for Living Labs. The key in finding the sweet spot between working like a community and a bureaucracy might be systematically tracking of involved Living Lab stakeholders. Much of the Living Lab structure and organization will be dependent on local circumstances. And that is both the strength and the curse of the Living Lab. But, being able to systematically track your stakeholders, their responsibilities and contributions by the means of a protocol could save many Living Labs a lot of time and unpleasant surprises.","Living Labs; Medical device design; Collaboration in healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Huge savings in ecological footprint, production and maintenance costs can be achieved by replacing batteries for vibration energy harvesters. Most of the time, newly developed energy harvesters are tested in a lab environment on an electrodynamic shaker. The problem is that the standard lab experiments in the form of a sinusoidal or Gaussian noise signal excitation are not representative for the real world applications. In a classification of ambient vibrations it was observed that most vibrations found in the real world consist of a series of dominant frequencies, shocks and noise. It was also seen that among real world vibrations, there is a lot of variation in the power distribution among the classes. In the aim to bring the vibration energy harvester performance tests closer to the real world applications, an experimental benchmarking of energy harvester performance has been conducted. An energy harvester is designed and applied in the real world on the engine of two different cars. Successively, three different lab experiments are performed on an electrodynamic shaker, each experiment with its own type of vibration control. It is found that only taking the FFT data of a real world vibration is not sufficient. Using a sinusoidal excitation matching a single amplitude and frequency, or even a noise excitation matching the entire power spectrum, results in an under or overestimation of 50% compared to the real world performance. Therefore, to accurately predict the performance of an energy harvester in the real world, simulation or experimental testing need to be performed on the actual or a replication of the intended real world vibration.","Vibration energy harvesting; Electrodynamic shaker control; Real world vibrations; Vibration Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

This technique is determined for Dutch commercial inland waterway ships (CEMT classes) and set up to be applied by bridge engineers to determine the required bridge pier strength. Many collision events on bridge piers have occurred in history where some led to a major failure of the bridge deck due to insufficient strength of the bridge pier. The accuracy of the Dutch guideline on calculating these impact forces (ROK 1.4) is questioned, mainly regarding the generalisation of the guideline to different ship types. Therefore, an investigation on this topic has been initiated to provide more accuracy in the estimations on bridge pier impact forces in the event of ship collisions. A dynamic nonlinear finite element model has been created using ABAQUS/Explicit to simulate the ship-bridge pier collision event. The bridge pier is assumed to be rigid and fixed, while the ship structure is assumed to dissipate all initial kinetic energy through plastic deformation (crushing of the structure). Material properties have been obtained from a test database and include rate effects. It has been concluded that the numerical calculation model is verified as stable, and results are in agreement with existing calculation methods. Numerical simulations have been performed on one class IV and two class V ship's bow structures. A relationship between initial kinetic energy levels and maximum impact force has been developed based on the results of the numerical calculations. With the established expression, the estimated impact force can be calculated for the event of a ship collision, given an initial kinetic energy level involved in the collision event. Maximum impact force values have been presented for different ship classes using this expression. For ships smaller than a medium-sized ship (CEMT IV), the impact force values are higher than is found in the current Dutch guideline. However, lower impact forces are estimated for ships larger than this medium-sized ship. This difference mainly originate from the relatively stiff response of the frontal part of the analysed ship's bows, compared to the ship's bow structure that led to the current Dutch guideline. With the proposed impact force expression, the maximum impact force on bridge piers in the event of ship collisions could be estimated with increased accuracy.","Collisions; Bridge pier; Structural crashworthiness; Nonlinear finite element analysis; Inland waterway ships; Ship structure; Abaqus; Dynamic Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An infrastructure-independent option is to leverage the data from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to determine position. An advantage of this approach is that these sensors are already available to many people as they are often integrated into the modern smartphone, a ubiquitous device in the developed world. Creating an indoor localization solution that works on this device could, therefore, lead to widespread adoption. This has been recognized by the research community, with methods already being tested on the device. An interesting combination worth considering is that of smartphone-based indoor localization with the emerging market of wearable technology. This new technology has the potential to provide additional information that could improve indoor localization. One option is to detect activity that is not easily<br/>detectable from smartphones alone. Within this thesis, a proof of concept is designed with the goal of finding a way in which activity recognition from wearable tech can help smartphone-based indoor localization. The implementation within this thesis relies only on the IMU data of a smartwatch and smartphone, and map information of the indoor environment.<br/>The system consists of two subsystems placed in series, where the output of the first subsystem, the Step and Heading System (SHS), is the input of the second subsystem, the Particle Filter with spatial context. The SHS uses IMU data from the smartphone to determine if a step is taken, what its length is, and in what direction it was taken. The Particle Filter with spatial context uses the resulting SHS trajectory to generate a position estimate in an indoor environment. It uses spatial constraints, such as walls, to limit the estimate. The IMU data of a smartwatch is used to detect interaction with doors. These interactions in combination with known door locations allows the particle filter to calibrate the position estimates to door locations. In order to evaluate performance, experiments were performed in an indoor environment of which map information was available. During the experiment six different paths were walked, while interacting with doors in the environment. Smartphone and smartwatch IMU data were recorded. Door interactions were also recorded manually for reference. Results from the experiments show that, although false positives in detection can have a detrimental effect on<br/>the position estimate, activity recognition can improve position estimates for a smartphone-based system using the implemented design.","indoor localization; particle filter; step and heading system; smartphone; IMU sensor fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The second one extracts the energy characteristics of the aircraft using ADS-B data, and later trains the GMM which is used for anomaly detection. Also, go-arounds are detected in the data using fuzzy logic with four S-functions to model the dynamics of a go-around. After identifying these events, indicators are constructed by aggregating the results to monitor safety performance. These models are applied to the ADS-B data from 2018 of the Schiphol Airport area in Amsterdam. Thus, it is possible to derive insights for runways and months, and it is possible to combine these indicators with extra variables such as meteorological data.","anomalous safety event; safety monitoring; ADS-B; Schiphol Airport; data mining; Anomaly Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/albiboni Repository link Code and dashboard","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Croon, G.C.H.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is increasing, much like the performance of these aircraft. A tailsitter is a type of UAV which is capable of performing vertical take-offs and landings (VTOL) and long endurance flights. During hover, the yaw control is limited due to the dynamics of these tailsitters. The generally used quaternion feedback for the attitude does not compensate for this as it describes a singular rotation. Tilt-twist is a solution to the problem as it splits the tilt (pitch and roll) from the twist (yaw). The axis of the yaw rotation is body fixed. When hovering with a pitch and/or roll angle the twist axis will be aligned with the body z-axis, instead of the desired gravitational force vector (for position control). Previous tilt-twist methods used a PID controller. This paper describes an improvement over previous tilt-twist approaches, the dynamic tilt-twist in combination with INDI. The INDI controller is designed for nonlinear systems. The dynamic tilt-twist compensates for the problem with the normal tilt-twist as test results will demonstrate. Tests are performed in a simulation and a real life test with the NederDrone hybrid tailsitter is done.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-26","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Unlike many traditional stiff position-controlled robots, the care robot is operating in a shared environment with humans that is often unpredictable and unknown. Especially when dealing with tasks that involve contact with the environment, modulation of compliance is a key component to successfully execute autonomous manipulation tasks. Using Learning from Demonstrating (LfD) techniques, the teleoperator must have a system that allows intuitive demonstration of compliance to the robot. Current state-of-the-art systems are either not teleoperated, only allow limited modulation of the stiffness matrix or, are too complex and cumbersome for practical applications. This research tries to overcome these limitations and proposes a teleoperated stiffness commanding method that allows complete modulation of stiffness matrix in 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF). The system uses the same haptic device (Geomagic Touch) as used for controlling robot manipulator, hence does not require specialized equipment. Through wiggling the stylus of the haptic device, stiffness is commanded to the robot and directly fed back to the operator through haptic and visual feedback. The system is illustrated in a simulated task where a task appropriate stiffness profile is demonstrated along a kinematic trajectory. Additionally, the performance and acceptance of the system is evaluated through a simulated user study. It shows how varying the commanded DoF, orientation, and size of the stiffness commands significantly influences the performance through the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix.","Teleoperation; Stiffness Command Interface; Haptic Interface; variable stiffness; Human-Robot Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This will require all ships to reduce their emissions, especially container vessels which are producing the most emissions. One way of reducing emissions, with existing technology, is to switch to alternative fuels. Making this switch is risky as there are many economic and regulatory uncertainties, which the ship has to survive over its lifetime. This makes it difficult to see which alternative fuel is a better option or not. There is no existing study which makes a comparison between alternative fuels which also takes future uncertainty into account. The aim of this study is to develop an approach to assess alternative fuel types for robust ultra large container vessels, while taking economic and regulatory uncertainty into account. For this purpose, Robust Decision Making was chosen as the most suitable method. A method which has been used in different areas, but will be implemented for the first time for a subject relating to ship design. Implementing this method required the development of a parametric design tool for ultra large container vessels. Results show that liquefied natural gas is the most robust option amongst the considered alternative fuels. It would have a good economic performance, while reducing emissions. Non-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia, would practically eliminate emissions but do not perform well financially.","Robust decision making; Ultra Large Container Vessel; Uncertainty; Ship Design; Parametric Design; Emissions; Alternative fuels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Energy usage will have to become more efficient and generated by an increasing amount of sustainable resources. Hard-to-abate industries will require incentives to decarbonize their processes. Research shows that consumer-facing companies (CFCs) are willing to and can incentivize upstream production to decarbonize processes. Literature research concludes that steel, ammonia, methanol and refineries are highly dependent on hydrogen to be decarbonized. Demand sectors of these heavy industries are analyzed to identify potential demand for hydrogen-based products, and whether their value proposition towards consumers increases using hydrogen-based products. Some case studies on CFCs using heavy industry’s products do confirm this. A table with scores per industry is provided to show the relative degree of downstream capability and willingness to decarbonize upstream production. The research shows that the steel sector will be the most applicable industry to be incentivized from a CFC’s perspective, followed by ammonia and to less extent methanol and refineries. CFC initiated decarbonization mechanisms are qualitatively sorted and discussed for applicability on hydrogen-based transition. The mechanisms holding the highest potential to initiate upstream decarbonization are discussed regarding applicability for the steel industry. Business model innovation, industry &amp; sector level collaboration, performance standards and industry &amp; market standards are considered to have the highest potential among CFC mechanisms to reduce risks in transitioning upstream industries.","Heavy industry; hard-to-abate; consumer-facing companies; hydrogen; decarbonization mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Compared to photon therapy it allows more precise targeting of tumours and sparing of surrounding healthy tissue. Besides patient treatment, research on proton therapy topics is being done to gain more knowledge on and keep improving the technique. Since the 1950s almost 100 proton therapy facilities are operating clinically worldwide. One of those facilities is HollandPTC, a proton therapy center located in Delft, The Netherlands. The ProBeam Varian cyclotron serves two treatment gantries, an eye treatment room, and a research experimental room. The experimental room is dedicated to research topics in the proton therapy field and is equipped with a fixed horizontal beam line that can be used for physics experiments and also for radiobiological experiments. In order to perform those types of research the beam needs to be fully characterized in terms of dose, shape, size and energy, this is the purpose of this work. The second goal was to commence with a setup for creating homogeneous fields by means of passive scattering and determine the optimal distances required between the elements of the setup. The single pencil beam characterization has been done by performing a large variety of experiments, making use of setups with different types of detectors. The experiments include beam spot, beam envelope, beam current, and depth-dose distribution measurements, and have been performed for nominal beam energies between 70 and 240MeV. For the passively scattered field a dual ring setup has been implemented. Spread-out Bragg peaks have been created with a ridge filter. An energy of 150 MeV was used, as the scattering elements have been designed for this energy specifically. The single pencil beam characterization resulted in beam spot sizes at the isocenter varying from 3.54 mm for 240 MeV, up to 5.47 mm for 70 MeV, with an asymmetry of 1.7% at most. The beam envelope measurements showed that the beam spot size just after the exit window is 2-3 mm and diverges up to 12 mm at 2 m from the exit window. The beam current measurements gave the transmission efficiency of the system, ranging from 0.04% for a 70 MeV beam up to 5.6% for 240 MeV, increasing exponentially. The depth-dose measurements provided the difference between the nominal beam energy and the beam energy at the isocenter. The difference becomes smaller as the nominal beam energy increases and is 2.4% for a 70 MeV nominal beam and 0.3% for a 230 MeV nominal beam. With the dual ring setup fields of up to 25 cm in diameter have been formed with a uniformity of at least 97%. The ridge filter created a spread-out Bragg peak of 2.8 cm with a uniformity of 98% and also gave good results for other beam energies (100-200MeV). It can be concluded that the goals of the project have been reached as the beam has been characterized in terms of shape, current, and energy. Also some preliminary work for the passive field has been accomplished. The work on the dual ring setup can be further expanded by placing the ridge filter and a collimator in the setup, after which the field can be characterized in terms of dose. The results obtained from the single pencil beam characterization allowed for the first physics experiments to start at the experimental room of HollandPTC during the last year.","Proton Therapy; Radiotherapy; Proton beam; Passive field; Pencil beam; Particle Therapy; Cancer; Radiobiology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","","51.99069400054972,4.383651842489914"

This research offers insights about adaptive delta management for the Rhine-Meuse estuary from three perspectives: a physical, a socio-political and a integrated perspective. In the physical perspective, the effect of pump capacity on the water system of the Rhine-Meuse estuary is quantified; one of the adaptation options against sea level rise. To assess the adaptation potential of pumps, the case study Delta21 is used; a plan to construct an artificial lake with an area of 35 km2 next to the Maasvlakte 2 in combination with a pump capacity of 10 000 m3/s. The Rhine-Meuse estuary is divided into four sub-areas depending on the<br/>dominant hydrodynamic process: storm surge dominant area, flood storage dominant area, discharge dominant area and transition area. For each sub-area, the effects of Delta21 are computed on 1) water flows, 2) hydraulic loads and 3) failure probabilities. Delta21 succeeds in lowering the hydraulic loads and corresponding failure probabilities. At the same time, reductions are disproportionately over the Rhine-Meuse estuary leading to low reductions in some sub-areas. In the socio-political perspective, the focus is on decision-making and learning processes in management in delta management. The Rhine-Meuse estuary is characterized by a network structure, which means that knowledge and decisions do not belong to one single actor, but those decisions come about during interactions between various groups of actors. Not only the decisions need to be adaptive to cope with uncertain circumstances, but the learning process itself must also become adaptive. To achieve this aim, a conceptual mode is developed. Two case studies are used; the Delta Program and Knowledge Program Sea Level Rise. A longitudinal analysis of the Delta Program resulted in different narratives over time and various learning types. Subsequently, the Knowledge Program Sea Level Rise is analyzed with semi-structured interviews, process-tracing and the conceptual model. Observations and challenges are translated into a roadmap of learning activities. Moreover, the DEALTa learning handbook is developed, to support actors in designing learning activities. The physical and socio-political perspective are united in the integrated perspective. On the level of technical studies, insights are shared about the relation between both aspects and how the integration can be improved in the future.","Adaptive Delta Management; Hydraulic Engineering; Science Communication; Rhine-Meuse Delta; Social learning; Fragility curves; Decision making; SOBEK; Flood Risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","51.7958812, 4.6779351"

Due to the change in contact between the wheels and the rails as the train negotiates a turnout, severe impact loading occurs in two-directions: vertically and laterally. These cause negative environmental impacts in terms of ground vibrations. Therefore, understanding the ground response due to a railway turnout qualitatively and quantitatively is essential for soil surface in the vicinity. This thesis focuses on qualitatively and quantitatively describing the ground response through a dual load model setup through semi-analytical approach. A two-dimensional load on an Euler Bernoulli beam which is placed on a three-dimensional half-space is considered to describe the ground response. Followed by which, a load spectrum defining the interaction between the wheels and the rails is considered and the ground response is analysed. Measurements from the vicinity of a turnout is also analysed in order to compare the performance of the model to that of the real-life scenario. It is further concluded that qualitatively the ground response caused due to impact like loading that occurs at a crossing, and the presence of lateral loading is able to be explained by the model. Quantitatively, to analyse the response recommendations are to be followed to acquire the accurate load spectrum along with considering the complex track geometry for the lateral loading.","Semi analytical; railway vibrations; ground vibrations; railway turnout","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""
