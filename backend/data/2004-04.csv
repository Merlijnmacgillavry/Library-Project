Therefore for this MSc research project, the following research question has been answered: How should geometric transactions be processed in a distributed GIS using OpenGIS Web Feature Services? To answer this question literature has been studied and a case study has been done to develope a Web Feature Service (WFS). With this service, the abilities of WFS to process geometric transactions have been analyzed. For editing the cadastral data, one could think of a notary who drafts a new boundary, because a parcel haz to be split. This principle has been used in the case study. Both a WFS and a client have been implemented. The WFS is composed of an Oracle Spatial 9i database, with GeoServer (an Open Source WFS) configured on top of it as web feature server. GeoServer has been installed in Tomcat (a Java servlet container) to provide internet access. Because the tested existing WFS-clients were either not fully compliant with the specification, nor transational or it would have cost too much time to adapt them for the case study service, a client needed to be developed in this research. The developed client uses Scalable Vector Graphics (VGS) in a standard web-browser for visualization and editing of features graphically. Java Server Pages (JSP) have been used to implement functionality to compose and send the transaction request. This way, functionality of the cient is divided between a browser and a Java web server.Interoperability tests with other than the developed client showed that not all currently available clients that claim to be WFS-compliant, work correctly. However, the tests also showed the power of interoperable services, since a generic client - not having any knowledige of the data source - could retrieve features from the data source, because a WFS was configured on top of it. The case study showed that, in general, the WFS-specificiation provides sufficient operations to make sure that geometric transacations can be sent from client to server and can e processed successfully. Using general web technologies as HTTP, XML and GML, geographic features can be retrieved, created, modified and deleted. However, WFS misses operations to deal well with constraints and other application logic and misses some useful operations to deal with complicated data sets and transactions. The main conclusion is that, although EFS is not advanced to strongly support transactions on complicated (e.g. withc topology or other spatila constraints) data sets in a generic way, WFSs are suitable and powerful interoperable GIS web services to edit geographic data over large networks as the internet.","web feature services; opengis; cadastral data","en","master thesis","Delft University of Technology, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Geo-Database Management Center","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","GIS technology","","","",""

(mentor); Van Meel, J.J. (mentor); Van der Sluijs, B. (mentor)","2004","When a client initiates a building project, he is confronted with the complexity of today’s building industry. Whether this client is a single person or a large organization, a confrontation with the industry’s complex methods and proceedings is unavoidable. Perhaps the difficulty consists of specific questions about the design, never thought of before by the client? Or it is the lack of financial control or the control over the architectural design? Due recent political and economical developments, most clients tend to focus their demands and wishes in terms of operability, flexibility and (future) economic value. Means of evaluation are often directed at the finished product, which is the eventually the finished building itself. What about the means of evaluation during the development of the project? Hardly existing, these means of evaluation of the design and construction process are severely limited. To facilitate the client, but also the process manager, additional research and aid on this issue is a warm welcome. The main focus of this research is put on the design process, because most important decisions considering the operability, financial cost and flexibility of the building are made during this process. After a study of theory and examples, it appears that communication is one of the most important thrusts in this process. However, communication within the design process remains intuitive and informal. The main question of this research is to find out if a formalization of communication can help the client and process manager to recognize, avoid or at least help to solve problems during the design process. To answer this question a three-part puzzle must be solved. It is the ability to understand the design process, to track possible problems and if necessary find ways to solve them. The puzzle is solved piece by piece. First, a model as a description of reality must be created, in order to describe the design process in its basic terms. Secondly, a script is developed to allow its operator to ask specific questions in order to determine if there is a problem. The script continues in order to determine the threat to either client or the project as a whole. It also allows the operator to strip the problem to its basic character, which can be described in terms of language problems, consistency of information, social behavior or sudden changes. Thirdly, possible steering options are to be identified and described. These tools can be used to create a solution if a problem exists. Finally, specific combinations of these tools are described as tactics. These tactics are basic approaches in solving the most common and characteristic problems. The combination of these scripts, tools and tactics is called the toolbox. The combination of the model and toolbox functions as the intended formalization. To acquire information to first create a model and consequently a toolbox, today’s practice and professional literature are studied. To study practice, the case study method and ethnographic research are used to identify situations. These situations indicate a problem or conflict, which may occur during a meeting between participants. Of course, these situations may also stretch beyond one or more meetings. Two practice cases where studied, as well as one literature case. The first case was the renovation of the tower of the main building on the campus of the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The second case was the development of a medical training facility and school, called the OZW building. This project was a joint approach of the VU University and the Hoge School Holland and multiple smaller organizations. The literature case covered the development of the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain. Based on these case studies and further literature study, a model of the design process was created. This model consisted of underlying processes such as the knowledge gap and the continuous translation of hard, quantified data (such as spatial demands) to softer, variable information (such as architectural drawings) and backwards. Additional underlying processes consisted of a graphical description of a meeting (a triangle shaped balance between information, communication and participants) and a situation (a triangle shaped balance between language problems, social behavior, information inconsistency and sudden changes as an external influence). These underlying processes where compared to the expected level of communication and the total level of development of the design. Doing so, a graphical description of the total design process could be drawn. An additional typology of explaining the possible cause was also created. By turning conclusions from case and literature study around into questions, the development of several scripts could take place. The scripts consist of a situation analysis and a threat analysis. Consequently, social, organizational and administrational tools were created. The deployment of the tools can be done along a communicational network structure (by describing communication as a network of nodes). Social tools consisted of a set of options, allowing to create a certain atmosphere and/or work environment. The organizational tools are intended to help the operator to choose means of communication properly. Administrational tools are intended to structure streams of information, as well as to archive information considering the development of the design. Eventually, eight tactical approaches were formulated. Each addressed one of the problem characteristics possible within the design process. Two examples are the shadow document and the resolution format to prevent and solve language problems. Another example is the tactic of the freeze cycle, intended to solve or prevent problems information inconsistency. Conclusively, formalization can be created. With the model and toolbox, the client and process manager can hopefully better understand means of communication within the design process. However, a short handout cannot be made. The subject is still too complex to explain in just a few pages of text. Some amount of study by the client is required. Testing and evaluating the toolbox in a practice environment could however not be done within the current time span. Furthermore, due the social character of this subject, further research should be a joint approach by both management and social studies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

Om de mogelijkheden te bepalen deze extra sterkte wel mee te nemen, zijn twee experimenten uitgevoerd. Door middel van deze paper wordt de samenhang tussen de huidige ontwerpregels, de liggertheorie en de daaropvolgende experimenten geschetst. Wrijvingsproeven van steenzetting op filter De wrijvingsproeven vormen het eerste gedeelte van dit rapport. Deze rapportage bespreekt de uitvoering en resultaatverwerking van de experimenten waarbij een steenzetting onder verschillende omstandigheden over een granulaire filterlaag werd voortbewogen. Omdat de grootte van de wrijving van grote invloed is op de ontwikkeling van de voor liggervorming benodigde normaalkracht is het erg belangrijk te weten welke waarde er voor de wrijvingscoefficient te verwachten is. Liggeronderzoek Omdat de golfbelasting over een voldoende kleine afstand in lengterichting van de dijk constant te beschouwen is, kan de klemming tussen de stenen in rekening gebracht worden door in hoogterichting van het talud de belasting van een buigligger te beschouwen. Het door Peters opgestelde model voor deze liggerwerking is met laboratoriumproeven getest. De sterkte van de ligger wordt voor een groot deel bepaald door de normaalkracht die in het vlak van de zetting aanwezig is. Omdat deze voorspanning nogal onvoorspelbaar is, is bij deze experimenten op kunstmatige wijze met een vijzel normaaldrukkracht aangebracht. Het tweede gedeelte van deze rapportage gaat over de uitvoering en resultaatcontrole van de liggerproeven en vormt een aanzet voor de uitgebreide analyse van de meetdata.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2004","Groynes are dam-like structures in a river, which are constructed at an angle to the direction of the flow. Their purpose is to maintain the navigable depth during low water conditions and to divert the flow from critical zones during high water conditions. The spaces between the groynes, the groyne fields, are areas of shallow flow. Groynes have an impact of the hydrodynamic and morphologic conditions of the river. They cause specific turbulent structures in the groyne field. The morphological impact of groynes are bed level changes, such as scour holes near the groyne tips and deposition ridges in the groyne field. In flume experiments, which have been carried out at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics at the TU Delft, these flow conditions and bed level changes were studied for various test cases. In this thesis a numerical simulation of an emerged case of the laboratory experiment is performed. Here, the exchange processes between the main channel and the groyne field are of special interest. The simulation was done using the Delft3D-FLOW system. The add-on Horizontal Large Eddy Simulation (HLES) models the small-scale turbulences on a sub-grid scale. For the morphological computations the module Online-sediment was used, which calculates the sediment concentration, the sediment transport, and the bed level changes simultaneously with the flow. The model was calibrated against data from the experiment. The results of the hydrodynamic computations show the typical turbulent structures in emerged groyne fields, that have also been observed in previous experiments and described by several authors. However, a comparison with the experimental results could only be made at the locations, where the velocity was measured. With a sensitivity analysis, the influence of some input parameters on the computed flow field was studied. For this analysis some physical parameters were modified and the influence of the use of a high-pass filter for the velocity signals was investigated. The results of the morphological computation showed a qualitative accordance with the measured bed levels. Yet, the suspended sand settles too quickly at the entrance of the groyne field instead of entering it. Furthermore, the scour holes are less pronounced than in the experiment, while the erosion of the main channel is computed to be stronger than in the experiment. Another sensitivity analysis was carried out for the morphological computations. In conclusion, it can be stated, that Delft3D-FLOW computes the morphological pattern qualitatively well. When analysing the details, though, some major differences with the observations occur. Especially the sediment transport into the groyne field is not reproduced realistically at the moment.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

During storms and increased hydraulic conditions these dunes will erode. The section of these dunes that is sensitive to erosion processes is called the erosion zone and has a width of approximately 100 meters. For any building policy in this erosion zone at least two aspects are important: the economic potential and the chances of damage. The building policy should therefore be a compromise between two ambitions: exploiting potential and averting risk. Four key questions for this building policy are discussed in this investigation: What structures should be allowed at which locations in the erosion zone at this time and why? How should we deal with the future effects of sea level rise on the erosion zone? How should we deal with the responsibility of damage? How should the present development be handled in the near future? 1. For the stakeholders in the erosion zone it was investigated what (market) potential is available and what risk is related to it. To be able to decide on investments, a valuation method is suggested that takes both aspects into account. This makes it possible to investigate what risk is acceptable (the maximum acceptable chance of destruction, Pfacc) for each investment and what areas in the erosion are therefore suitable. 2. The influence of sea level rise and the increase of risk can be included in the valuation of the different investments. Two aspects are important in this respect: the planning timeframe of the building policy and the expected increase of the chances of damage. 3. The value of benefits and costs of any investment remains unchanged when the responsibility for these benefits and costs are varied amongst different stakeholders. However, differences in responsibility can result in different building policies as new possibilities to distribute the costs can give an individual investor the opportunity to invest in areas with different chances of damage. The influence of this aspect was investigated by using three different scenarios concerning the responsibility of damage. 4. The present chances of destruction were investigated for investments in Noordwijk aan Zee and Katwijk aan Zee. No problems are identified here, as the maximum acceptable chances of destruction will not be exceeded during the planning timeframe of the building policy. In case problems do occur a number of risk-decreasing methods are available. The methods and insight used in this investigation can be valuable for future decision makers and can be used for all areas in the erosion zone.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

However, coasts are dynamic systems characterized by variability in shoreline position and profile shape, which sometimes conflicts with human interests as is the case at Cancach in Mexico. In addition to hard coastal structures, beach nourishment is often used as a measure against erosion. After placement, the fill sediments are distributed across and along the shore by the action of waves and currents. This morphological behaviour consists of longshore spreading-out of the fill sediments and of cross-shore equilibration, i.e. the transformation of the construction profile to the dynamic equilibrium profile. However, this morphological behaviour is difficult to predict, complicating beach nourishment assessment and inducing the need to develop better modelling and design methods. Various modelling and design methods for beach nourishment are available, covering different aspects of the morphological behaviour. In this thesis the cross-shore modelling of the beach fill equilibration has been considered. The planned beach fill at Cancach (Mexico) has been used as a case study. Three possible borrow areas with varying sediment properties have been considered. Various design methods based on equilibrium models have been compared with process-based numerical modelling with the software package Unibest-TC (WL | Delft Hydraulics), leading to conclusions regarding the suitability of these design methods for beach fill equilibration. Furthermore, recommendations regarding the time scale of the beach fill equilibration and the final profile shape of the Cancach fill are made.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

However, the placing density of the Tetrapods has to be larger than in a normal single layer application. The recently developed Xbloc? is applied in a single layer. Both in case of the single layer Tetrapods, as well as the single layer Xbloc (see also KLABBERS ET AL [2003]) the porosity of the top layer is more than in case of a normal riprap structure. The porosity of the Xbloc is about 50%, and the porosity of the normal riprap structure is about 40%. For Xbloc, the roughness, porosity as well as the geometry of the pores differs from a standard riprap slope. In the model tests of the Xbloc, the visual impression of the slope seemed smoother than in case of a Tetrapods layer. It is expected that the overtopping quantities over single layer Tetrapods or over Xbloc armour may deviate from well known overtopping formulae. Van Der Meer makes a distinction between breaking and non-breaking wave conditions. The model tests showed that the overtopping volume increases with the increase of wave height, decrease of freeboard. The overtopping also showed an increase with the decrease of the wave steepness. Klabbers ET AL [2003] found that wave overtopping in case of Xbloc increases with both wave height and wave length. The wave steepness could therefore not be considered as governing parameter for wave overtopping. It was however found that, the asymmetry of the incoming waves; quantified in shallow water by the Ursell parameter had a significant effect on the wave overtopping. Therefore, a new type of overtopping formula has been developed which includes the Ursell parameter. The performed overtopping tests in this work confirmed the use of this equation for the Xbloc unit. After comparing the test results with the Van Der Meer formula and the Xbloc formula, it seemed that the Xbloc formula showed a better fit with the test results, as can be seen in the following figures. Thus for single layer Tetrapod units and Xbloc units, the Xbloc overtopping formula is more suitable to use than the Van Der Meer formula.","","","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
