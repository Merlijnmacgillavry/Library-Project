(mentor); Van der Horst, A.Q.C. (mentor); Bouwmeester-van den Bos, W.J. (mentor); Koenders, E.A.B. (mentor); Schlangen, E. (mentor); De Vries, J. (mentor)","2011","In the Netherlands blast furnace slag (BFS) cement is commonly used. Concretes with this type of cement are known for good durability properties. Where concrete is designed to crack in order to let the incorporated steel reinforcement take over tensile stresses, it is mainly for durability reasons that non-designed cracking of concrete is undesired. Percolated cracks may lead to leakage problems or ingress of chemicals, which can cause deterioration of the concrete matrix or reinforcement corrosion. When material deformations are restrained, stresses are induced, possibly leading to cracking. Deformations in the early age are of most interest, with general properties of the concrete material still being developed. For the early age this is mainly caused by temperature and autogenous deformations, due to cement hydration. Importance of autogenous shrinkage has been recognized for high performance concretes, having relatively low water to cement ratios. It is becoming known that autogenous shrinkage is higher for materials containing BFS. As of late striking results have been found for magnitudes of autogenous shrinkage for common normal strength concretes with water to binder ratios > 0.4. This thesis gives an overview on the topic of autogenous deformation for normal strength concretes from practice, containing BFS. First, results from previous research have been verified, followed by an indication of practical relevance of the topic. Main focus is on the influence of different material constituents, by changing the proportions or type of material. Experiments are conducted on concrete and cement paste. Magnitude of autogenous shrinkage is related to total shrinkage and compared to prediction models known in practice. Combined with results on general properties an indication is given for the possibility of cracking due to autogenous shrinkage. Experiments on concrete regard influence of the water to cement ratio, aggregate type and addition of polypropylene fibres. Measurements start after one day and run for 197 days. Up to five specimens are used per test, which are either kept in autogenous conditions or are exposed to drying from 3, 7 or 28 days. For experiments on cement paste a relatively new device is used, called the Mini-TSTM. Recommendations are given for on-going development, but tests show promising results. It is possible to measure either free deformation or induced stress in case of restrained deformation. Cement pastes are used to determine influence of cement and filler type and content. Furthermore information is given on shrinkage development starting from the moment of initial set. Results on free deformation and self-induced stress under autogenous conditions are compared and show a reduced tensile strength when deformations are restrained. Results for tests on concrete show an ongoing shrinkage. From tests on cement pastes an expansion is found on the first 2~3 days. Combination of both results estimates the magnitude of tensile stress inducing shrinkage. Development of shrinkage for cement paste with BFS shows to be substantially different from that of ordinary portland cement paste, it is mainly steeper and of higher magnitude. The type of cement seems to be the main factor influencing the magnitude of autogenous shrinkage. Measured total shrinkage relates well to the values from prediction models used in practice, but for the use of BFS cement (CEM III/B) subdivision into autogenous and drying shrinkage does quite differ. Autogenous shrinkage is found to be half of the total shrinkage. At 28 days the magnitude of autogenous shrinkage approximates the maximum strain at break. The main recommendation is to not neglect autogenous shrinkage when BFS cement is used, even for normal strength concretes commonly used in practice.","concrete; blast furnace slag; autogenous shrinkage; drying shrinkage; Mini-TSTM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Traditional content creation for computer games is a costly process. In particular, current techniques for authoring destructible behaviour are labour intensive and often limited to a single object basis. We aim to create an intuitive approach which allows designers to visually define destructible behaviour for objects in a reusable manner, which can then be applied in real-time. First we present a short introduction into the way that destruction has been done in games for many years. To better understand the physical processes that are being replicated, we present some information on how destruction works in the real world, and the high level approaches that have developed to simulate these processes. Using criteria gathered from industry professionals, we survey previous research work and determine their usability in a game development context. The approach which suits these criteria best is then selected as the basis for the approach presented in this work. By examining commercial solutions the shortcomings of existing technologies are determined to establish a solution direction. To separate destructible behaviour from particular objects, we introduce the concept of destructible materials: where the material of an object usually defines the way an object looks, a destructible material will determine how it breaks. Destructible materials provide a reusable definition and intuitive way of designing and tweaking destructible behaviour of objects, which can then be applied in real-time. Using a prototype implementation we show the viability of the presented approach and how it extends previous research with reusability, making it more designer friendly and allowing the same destructible behaviour to be easily applied to different objects. While the prototype can only apply this destructible behaviour in real-time for simple cases, it still takes us a step in the right direction.","Procedural; Destruction; Crack; Fracture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","This thesis discusses the design of a new steerable tip for a laparoscopic instrument. A new tip design is required since current steerable tip designs have problems with the bending stiffness and the lifespan of the cables. Underaction is a main cause of the low tip stiffness. Since one of the design requirements is that the tip needs to be able to rotate in two perpendicular planes, the tip has two rotational degrees of freedom (DOF). The simplest way to fully actuate the tip and to rotate each DOF over 90 degrees in a clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CCW) direction is by using two cables for each DOF, resulting in a total of four cables in the tip. A limiting factor of the lifespan of the tip is the fatigue of the cables. The fatigue is the result of the cables being forced to make a sharp bend during a rotation of the tip. To reduce the fatigue of the cables, the cables therefore need to be guided and to make a bend as large as possible in a g5 mm tip. As a prove of concept, two prototypes have been produced. From these prototypes it can be concluded that each DOF in the tip is able to rotate up to an angle of 90 degrees in CW and CCW direction. It can also be concluded that the tip is fully actuated. The bending stiffness of the tip therefore only depends on the stiffness of the cables and the rigid bodies of the tip. Since the cables and rigid bodies will be produced from steel, the bending stiffness of the tip will be high. Considering the cables to have a diameter of 0.5 mm, the cables will be guided over a guiding with a radius of 3.48 mm. Compared to the EndoWrist, where the radius of the pulley with similar cables would be 2 mm, the radius is almost 1.75 as large. The result is that the lifespan of the cables in the new design will be superior.","laparoscoy; steerable instrument; stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Person, F.E.O.K. (mentor); Gort-Duurkoop, I.A. (mentor)","2011","Draka Interfoam is a company specialized in the development, production and processing of polyether foams. The company focuses on bedding, mattresses, furniture, converting and healthcare industry. Draka Interfoam is supplier to local and international clients in these industries and over the years has accomplished to build a well-established B2B brand known for its quality. Draka Interfoam has acquired a patented technology to commercialize within Europe. This technology is performed by making several incisions in the foam with water jet machines and expanding the foam to create holes in the material. Draka Interfoam wants to introduce this technology in the mattress market. The project focuses on the branding and value proposition of the Harmonica technology. The research phase explores the consumer market and describes the information collected and synthesized from the external context. The point of view of experts in the industry is explored to get acquainted with the market. Trends and developments happening in the industry are identified and competing products are observed in the market. This phase describes the customer-based brand equity of brands in the market. A consumer inquiry shows that 22% of the consumers still recognize DrakaCel. DrakaCel is an obsolete mattress consumer brand Draka Interfoam owns that disappeared in the late nineties. In the course of this project this brand is considered for brand rejuvenation. Most of consumers did not remember what the brand used to stand for. Next, a product evaluation of the Harmonica product range is presented. The Harmonica mattress was compared to the Pantera mattress (a full-core foam mattress developed by Draka Interfoam) in a consumer study to indicate the benefits over the full-core technology. Consumers judged the comfort of both mattresses quite positive. On a scale from one to ten, the Pantera scored an average of 7.7; the Harmonica scored a 6.9 average. The Harmonica technology was primarily experienced as soft. Fifty percent indicated they would consider buying the Harmonica technology. Consumers wanted to pay between 200 and 500 Euros for a mattress, which is significantly lower than the price set by the company. Recommendations to Draka Interfoam regarding product engineering are to develop a broader product range that vary in softness/hardness in order to appeal to a broader audience and to verify the claims of ventilation and pressure distribution with certified performance tests. Also a recommendation is to possibly make the technology more visual to the consumer. The product requirements valued by the consumer are researched in order to define a Unique Selling Point of the Harmonica. In general, consumers find the specifications of low weight, climate control, adjustability to the body, and pressure release attractive. The study shows the older consumer has higher demands on a mattress and is less inclined to accept experiential and symbolic benefits for this product. The younger consumers find the key selling points of the Harmonica technology, such as lightweight and climate control, more attractive. The design phase develops two different branding strategies for the Harmonica technology. The brand name Breezzzlight is suggested by the company. One option is to use Breezzzlight as a product brand (comparable to the Pantera brand). Another option is to use Breezzzlight as a product name and use DrakaCel as the corporate brand for the mattress market. Each strategy implies a different marketing program; for which the image, competitive environment and market segment is determined. DrakaCel is positioned in the high-end consumer market with a slightly grey biased target group; Breezzlight is positioned in the top of the mid-end segment with a mainstream target group. Subsequently, it is verified why Draka Interfoam has been unable to turn this innovation into a profitable product and business. Results show that despite of the product being considered a “good” option; the product does not offer a Unique Value Proposition for the customer. The perceived value of the product is lower than the price. The analysis suggests Draka Interfoam has to either consider a downward price adjustment or an increase in customer value. A differential advantage should be considered for the Harmonica technology. A scenario-guided design tool is used to create concepts that describe business strategies for the Draka Interfoam and the Harmonica technology. The scenarios are created based on either an increment in value and offer or a descent in cost and price. Also Draka Interfoam position in the value chain is considered to create future strategies. The strategic advice to Draka Interfoam is to commercialize the Harmonica as a private label to (high- and mid-end) mattress retailers (i.e. bed specialty stores). The technology should be branded with the ingredient brand Breezzzlight and the the private label of the retail store. The value proposition is enabling a high-end (patented) innovation to retailers for an affordable price. A recommendation to Draka Interfoam is to verify the claim of ventilation with a certified authority (e.g. TNO), as this claim is very important for the strategy. The obsolete brand DrakaCel should not be considered at this point for a quick short-term introduction, the brand should be revived with a strong concept supported by marketing.","branding; commercialization; mattresses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); van der Duin, P.A. (mentor); De Bruijne, M.L.C. (mentor); Testers, P.A.J.A. (mentor)","2011","The aim of this research is to translate the possibilities of Contextual Innovation Management into recommendations which Stedin Meetbedrijf can use to develop innovative services. The main research question is: How can Contextual Innovation Management be applied for the service innovation process of Stedin Meetbedrijf? Contextual Innovation Management (Ortt and van der Duin, 2008) is a contingency theory that describes that organisations should tailor their innovation approach to the context. The context is described in terms of so-called ‘contingency factors’. Contingency factors are factors in the context of the organisation that have an effect on the organisation in general and on (its) innovation management approach in particular (van der Duin et al., 2011). Contingency factors influence the organisational structure for innovation. Contingency factors consist of different levels. Levels are possible outcomes the contingency factors can have. RESEARCH In the past years, the innovation process of Stedin Meetbedrijf has been focused on (radical) product innovation. However, nowadays competition in the measurement segment is more and more on additional services on top of the smart meter (see paragraph 3.1). The goal of this research is to explore the applicability of Contextual Innovation Management for the management of service innovation within Stedin Meetbedrijf. The main research question can be divided in five sub questions: 1. What does the service innovation process of Stedin Meetbedrijf look like? 2. What relevant aspects of service innovation management can be derived from literature? 3. How can a Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation be developed? 4. How does the Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation look like? 5. What are the implications of the Contextual Innovation Management framework for the innovation process of Stedin Meetbedrijf? The questions have been answered with the research approach developed in chapter 2. The research approach consists of steps that all answer a research question. During the research a Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation is developed. The framework matches suitable innovation processes to ideas for innovative services, based on contingency factors. The research will apply this framework to the case of Stedin Meetbedrijf. DEVELOPMENT OF THE FRAMEWORK The framework is developed by selecting the relevant contingency factors for service innovation and defining suitable innovation processes in a figure that can be developed based on these contingency factors. It was decided to define two contingency factors and two levels, because this delivers a clear, workable framework. Employees involved with innovation at Stedin Meetbedrijf had to select the contingency factors, because this way the framework is applicable for Stedin Meetbedrijf. These employees can be considered as the experts on innovation within the organisation (internal experts). Experts on innovation with different backgrounds (external experts) had to define the suitable innovation processes, because of their knowledge on innovation. RESULTS The research presents the implications of Contextual Innovation Management for the innovation process of Stedin Meetbedrijf. Results of the research indicate that Contextual Innovation Management can be applicable for the service innovation process of Stedin Meetbedrijf. A Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation is created and applied to Stedin Meetbedrijf. The framework consists of four quadrants that might need different innovation processes. Quadrants have the same characteristics (combinations of levels). Quadrants are numbered clockwise, starting with the first quadrant in the lower left corner. - Quadrant 1 consists of the ideas for service innovations that are incremental and market pull - Quadrant 2 consists of the ideas for service innovations that are radical and market pull - Quadrant 3 consists of the ideas for service innovations that are radical and technology push - Quadrant 4 consists of the ideas for service innovations that are incremental and technology push The Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation consists of two axes that represent contingency factors that are relevant for service innovation. The relevant contingency factors for service innovation are: - Driving force: market pull and technology push - Degree of newness: incremental and radical These contingency factors form the basis for the Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation. The circles and oval represent innovation processes that are suitable for the area they cover. The list of innovation processes used in this research can be found in paragraph 6.2 and consists of the current innovation process of Stedin Meetbedrijf; the innovation process that was used for one of the current services of Stedin Meetbedrijf (e-DataPortal) and 5 processes that are currently deployed at other business units (BU’s) of the ENECO Holding. EXPLANATION OF RESULTS This section will explain the results. It will per quadrant elaborate on the predominantly mentioned processes. Quadrant 1 (Incremental-market pull) The predominantly mentioned innovation process for quadrant 1 is the ‘market pull’ process. This seems plausible, because innovations in this quadrant are incremental, market pull innovations. Because the innovations are incremental, little “ground-breaking” knowledge is needed. This knowledge can be achieved from the market via market research. The market pull innovation process is significantly more mentioned by experts. Quadrant 2 (Radical-market pull) The predominantly mentioned innovation process for quadrant 2 is the ‘lead user’ process. This seems plausible, because innovations in this quadrant are (more) radical, market pull innovations. Lead users are users that are more involved in new technologies and services and are ahead of the mainstream user. Therefore it seems plausible to develop radical innovation with and for lead users. Quadrant 3 (Radical-technology push) and 4 (Incremental-technology push) The predominantly mentioned innovation process for quadrant 3 and 4 is the ‘technology push’ innovation process. Innovations in these quadrants are technology pushed innovations. Therefore it seems plausible to develop technology pushed ideas with an innovation process that is focused on technology. RECOMMENDATIONS STEDIN MEETBEDRIJF From interviews with internal experts can be defined that Stedin Meetbedrijf develops services in 3 of the 4 quadrants of the framework. The Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation prescribes that these services can best be developed with different innovation processes. Contextual Innovation Management can therefore be a valuable method for addressing service innovation within Stedin Meetbedrijf. Contextual Innovation Management delivers two main recommendations for Stedin Meetbedrijf: (1) Stedin Meetbedrijf has to adapt changes in the current innovation process (2) It shows the innovation processes that can be used to develop the current ideas for innovative services (1) Adaptation of the innovation process Stedin Meetbedrijf has a formalized innovation process that consists of five steps. The innovation process is formalized in the Quality Management System of the organisation (Kwaliteits Management Systeem (KMS)). These steps are described in paragraph 3.2. Here only the changes to these steps will be presented: - Opportunity identification - Feasibility study - Development of the product - Supplier/ Product selection - Order retrieval These steps consist of activities that have to be performed to develop an idea of an innovative service/product. These steps are used as basis for the innovation processes that were used throughout the research. The ‘market pull’; ‘lead user’ and ‘technology push’ innovation processes have to be incorporated in the current innovation process. Employees then can use the framework to find the suitable innovation process for the idea at hand and perform the activities that belong to this innovation process. To incorporate the Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation in the innovation process, Stedin Meetbedrijf has to adopt changes to the steps in the innovation process. In comparison with the current innovation process: - technological developments have to be analysed - market research is explicitly mentioned before the commercial analysis - the demands of the lead user have to be added to the list of sources in the opportunity identification step. Furthermore, the feedback on the performance of the service has to be done in cooperation with the lead user, after the lead user has tested the service for a period . (2) Innovation processes to develop current ideas for innovative services The implications of Contextual Innovation Management for the current ideas for innovative services of Stedin Meetbedrijf can be deduced from figure 2. - The ‘Dashboard of the e-DataPortal’ and the ‘e-DataPortal Plus’ are located in quadrant 1 and according to this research can be developed with the market pull innovation process. - The ‘e-DataBroker’ is located in quadrant 2 and can be developed in cooperation with a lead user. Also the co-creation innovation process, supplier innovation and market pull innovation process are found suitable. - Only the innovation process for the ‘REST-server’ cannot directly be deduced from the research, because it is located on the border of quadrant 3 and 4. This leaves Stedin Meetbedrijf with at least two options. It can (1) analyze which of the two processes is most suitable or (2) try to develop a process that is a combination of the two innovation processes. This research will recommend the first option, so the innovation processes that are formalized in the KMS can be used. FURTHER RESEARCH Next to the results, this research also indicates different options for further research. Further research can focus on Contextual Innovation Management for Stedin Meetbedrijf and on Contextual Innovation Management for service innovation in general. Based on limitations of the Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation a new approach for research into Contextual Innovation Management is developed (appendix D). The first recommendation to Stedin Meetbedrijf is to conduct a research that uses the new approach to validate results of this research. Another interesting option for further research for Stedin Meetbedrijf would be to vary the contingency factors of the framework. Further research on Contextual Innovation Management in general can also focus on the choice for the number of contingency factors. Currently two contingency factors are considered, because this delivers a useful framework. It might be an option to see if and how more contingency factors can be incorporated. Future research can also concern the development of the Contextual Innovation Management framework for service innovation by positioning the innovation processes in the framework according to the ideas instead of the quadrants. This way the positioning of the innovation processes is unconnected to the quadrants.","case study; contextual innovation management; contingency theory; service innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","","",""

It has several advantages over OFDM, such as flexibility of operation and excellent localization in frequency. The Channel Equalization for WPM is new and an unexplored research area. It is also different from equalization for OFDM because WPM symbols overlap in time. This thesis work presents a channel equalizer for WPM systems. The algorithm proposed is a pre-detection channel equalizer, which performs time-domain equalization. The equalizer applies the principle of peak distortion criterion where the maximum inter-symbol interference caused by the channel is minimized. The operation of the equalizer is tested under different realistic channels with different taps and characteristics. Furthermore, investigations to understand the impact of the wavelet family, length of the wavelet filters, and the number of equalizer taps on the performance of the equalizer are carried out. Results of the simulation studies illustrate notable performance gains including better Bit Error Rate (BER) performance and lower Inter symbol interference (ISI). Moreover, the different components of interference such as ISI(Inter Symbol Interference), ICI(Inter Carrier Interference) and ISCI(Inter Symbol Carrier Interference) are mathematically analyzed.","WPM; Channel Equalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Telecommunications","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this study the term smart grid is specified toward online diagnostics. It is investigated which online diagnostics techniques fit well within smart grids and whether existing technologies can be used in a smarter way. Smart grids and online diagnostics Since 2005, the term smart grids is widely used in literature. To assess what smart grid means from a component perspective, five values have been identi- fied that describe smart grids: secure, reliable, safe, economic and efficient. If these values are translated into operational characteristics, it is concluded that asset management and reliability are very important for the future power grid. Interviews with three companies show that online monitoring is an appropriate tool to realize a smart grid. However, the costs of online diagnostics should be reduced and the interpretation of measurements should be done by expert systems to make online diagnostics more attractive. Thereafter, smart grid is analyzed from an outside-in approach by investi- gating the need for data and listing available technologies to provide those data. The most frequently occurring failure modes of components in the transmission grid are listed to assess what technologies are required to fulfill the need for online diagnostics. Partial discharge activity can be measured to assess the aging state and operational conditions of transformers, gas insulated switchgear (GIS) and ca- bles. In addition, for high voltage direct current (HVDC) cables, space charge accumulation measurements can be used for the same purpose. Different on- line measurement techniques are listed and compared. Ultra High Frequency, acoustic and optical partial discharge detection are listed. Furthermore, combi- nations of these methods and the experimental 2-D electromagnetic partial dis- charge detection are investigated. For space charge measurements, the pulsed electroacoustic method is explained. Smart use of existing technologies Besides the development of new online diagnostic techniques, it is attractive to make smart use of existing technologies that are already installed in the grid. Fiber optics that are integrated in an increasing number of cables are used for hotspot monitoring, but can be used in a smarter way. Using distributed tem- perature measurements the space charge accumulation as a result of interfacial polarization in the insulation of an HVDC cable, can be determined. From the space charge distribution the electric field enhancement is calculated. If this analysis is applied to weak parts in a cable, the load can be dynamically controlled and condition-based asset management can be applied. A model is developed that determines the space charge distribution due to a temperature gradient in the cable insulation. Consequently, the electric field enhancement is derived from the space charge distribution. The model is validated afterwards, using measurement data from a pulsed electroacoustic space charge measurement setup. A comparison between the measurements and the model reveals that the model is only valid below the electric field threshold for space charge injection. Above this threshold, a more complex model is required. If the cable is operated below the threshold, the model covers the basic requirements for a temperature-based space charge measurement system.","online monitoring; diagnostics; insulation aging; smart grid; space charge; XLPE; fiber optic temperature measurements; HVDC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","High Voltage Technology and Management","",""

(mentor); Anderiesen, H. (mentor)","2011","This thesis describes the design process of a service, Pearls in North, for elderly who live in Humanitas. The goal of the project was to design a product or a service that makes elderly physically more active so they feel good, stay healthy and independent. When people become older they tend to become more passive. Especially when people move from their independent lifestyle to elderly homes. This behavior is a significant problem because it worsens the physical decline and makes them more dependent on the care system than they would be if they were more active. Being passive is both the cause and the consequence of physical decline. The challenge is to break this negative spiral and motivate them to start being active. The main focus for this project was on the pleasure that physical activity can provide. Being active should be intrinsically pleasant to do. When you move your body, you feel your body; you feel the muscles, the skin, and the bones. Feeling your body means feeling that you are: the feeling that you live. Research was done to understand how elderly experience physical activity and what pleasures they have when being physically active. It was found that elderly do not perceive physical activity as very important. Elderly relate physical activity mainly to things that are necessary and less to health. Doing things for other people and being together makes activities meaningful and worthy to do. Another cause for passiveness is their social situation. People often have lost their partner and need to find new contacts to do recreational things with. Finding these contacts is difficult, especially in an elderly home where there is a lot of struggle and irritation. How the problem of passiveness is solved is described in a vision. The main theme of the vision is; “Go out and meet the world.” Research showed that people enjoy being among people and watch the world pass by. It gives them a feeling of belonging and worthiness. I want people to discover the world around them together with neighbors or friends. The design is a door to the outer world and offers the possibility for social contact. Besides that it aims to make people aware of what they still do, not focus on making them do new, strange, activities. At last it is important that people can use their personal creativity and initiative. This makes activities valuable and enjoyable. Ideas were generated, and several concept directions were tested. The insights gained through testing and trying lead to the final design; Pearls in North. Pearls in North is a service that stimulates the new people in Humanitas to discover places in their neighborhood. Because of personal invitations from spots in the neighborhood people are stimulated to go out and visit those places. The spots are small businesses in the neighborhood; it can be a café, a restaurant, a shop, an ice cream shop, a bakery or a cultural place. Because the invitation offers a discount for two people, they are stimulated to go with somebody else, for instance a neighbor or a friend. Every month there is a different activity in another spot; that spot is called The Pearl of the Month. Over a year people are introduced to twelve Pearls in their neighborhood and the threshold to go there again will be smaller. This results in more movement outside Humanitas because people feel safe and know what to expect. When people visit the Pearl of the Month there is the possibility to write a review and make a picture with it. This review will be send to Humanitas and will be hanged on the central display in the atrium. These reviews are fun to read and can inspire other people to visit the Pearl of the Month as well. The service was tested to see if the interactions that were foreseen really work as expected. The tests show that the general concept functions very well and is promising for future implementation. The entrepreneurs are willing to join, other customers of the Pearl of the Month are enthusiastic users of the camera and reviews and elderly people start talking about their experiences and inspire other people because of their enthusiasm. The social aspect of inviting another individual; a neighbor or a friend is more difficult than expected. Improvements should be made to make it easier for people to invite one another. Recommendations are made to improve the design and a plan is given to implement this service in the context.","Elderly; Activity Behavior; Context Research; Service Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design For Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","It is without doubt that airport terminals are some of the most com- plex building types in existence. Their scale, the nature of their func- tions, the strict security measures as well as the function-specific components and building equipment that is present in such build- ings are all factors that increase their level of complexity as a build- ing type. In a real design situation, dealing with the variety of design param- eters that the design of an airport terminal incorporates can be a dif- ficult task to manage and may sometimes become an impediment to the design process. Furthermore, solely because of the enormous amount of possible design solutions that exists even for a relatively small set of design parameters1, the discovery of optimal or near optimal solutions through a traditional design approach is not guar- anteed to happen. Given these assumptions, it has been proposed within the con- text of this project that the design of layouts for airport terminals be addressed by the use of computation-based design methods, specifically Parametric Modelling in combination with evolutionary algorithms, The combination of parametric modelling and evolutionary algorithms has been used consecutively in two scales: First in order to search for optimality regarding the layout of the terminal, and with regard to multiple design goals (accessibility, cost, sustainability, re- tail performance). A Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) is used to produce a series of Pareto Optimal solutions, out of which one is selected. Second, a parametric envelope system is applied to the selected layout, and it’s defining parameters are once again optimized, this time with regard to view, sunshading and material usage. Within the context of the project a case study has been performed which focuses on the design of a new terminal at the new Inter- national Airport site in Doha, Qatar. The flexibility of the proposed method allowed for the incorporation of site-specific evaluation cri- teria into the parametric model, allowing for an optimal site-specific solution to be generated, both in terms of layout and of building envelope.","evolutionary algorithms; airport layout; grasshopper; parametric design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-13","Architecture","Building Technology","","Computation & Performance","",""

(mentor)","2011","The goal of this project was to see if information on the grain size distribution of a patch of cobbles could be obtained from the digital terrain model constructed from a laser scan of the cobble surface. The grain size distribution was to be extracted from the laser scans by the use of semivariograms. This was inspired by the research done by Hodge et al. (2009), who did the same. The results were compared to the results found by Hodge et al. (2009). In order to investigate getting information on GSD from laser scans properly, two different patches were made. Then the sizes of the cobbles were measured manually, in order to check the results from the future semivariograms. After that, both line laser scans were made and a 3D scan was made. Due to time constraints and experimental limitations, only one cobble surface was line scanned, and only one (the other) surface was 3D laser scanned. After all, only the line laser scans were processed. Then semivariograms were produced. It was found that if the manually measured data were compared with the variograms, correlations could be found for lags which corresponded to the grain sizes. But actual distinct fractal ranges couldn’t be seen. So, the use of only variograms (so without the manually measured data) is too ambiguous to be reliable. This result corresponded to the results from Hodge et al, who also could see the multifractal behavior of the cobbles, but not the distinct ranges.","laser scanning; cobbles","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geo-Engineering","","Ngan-Tillard D.","",""

The design made by SHAU, is based on a hyperbolic paraboloid or Hypar. The goal of the research was to develop a construction based on bamboo, traditional craftsmanship and a lattice structure with tensional elements providing strength and shade. This means that these elements cannot take a compressive force and that the shading is integrated in the construction. In the research the strength of bamboo was determined to check against background information. The species used, Dendrocalamus Asper, turned out to have lower values than found in databases or literature. Joining two bamboo stems without using nails, screws or holes reduces the risk of the bamboo splitting. Three joints were developed and tested to determine their strength. The strongest was a composite of natural fibres and resin. The entire structure was tested by analyzing it in a finite element program, like GSA, and by making a prototype. In GSA the final design configuration showed local forces and stresses that did not exceed the maximum levels. The prototype showed that the design can be made. As a final recommendation it is advised to use rope to make the joints and improve these with resin. The resin will provide the needed friction. It will also make the joint more durable, so the construction will last longer.","Bamboo; Hypar; Pavilion; Construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-06","Architecture","Building Technology","","Material & Research","",""

(mentor); van Oel, C. (mentor)","2011","The study investigated the bottom line of hotel guest room design from two different angles; qualitative research on mass purchasers and quantitative research on individual hotel guests. The outcome of the researches support the findings of the literature studies that preceded the two filed researches. Finding out the necessary and sufficient hotel guest room condition from the viewpoint of the hotel guests was the main objective of this survey. The study result provides insights into the complexity and trade-offs in designing hotel guest room product offerings for various sub-segments of the mid-range urban hotels. Hotel guest room is the core product of the hotel industry, and an important marketing variable at the same time. Information on guest’s hotel guest room format choice will enable hoteliers and developers target specific customer groups with strategies premeditated to meet their need and preferences. 5 sessions of the semi-structured interviews with event organizers were conducted in order to collect mass purchasers’ views and experiences on hotels. Interview sessions with event organizers confirmed the general idea that hotel guests are not much interested in sustainability issue, even though they do know the importance of the matter. It has also found that hotel guests are not particularly opposing to the notion; the findings of the survey analyses indicate that a moderate guest room configuration can satisfy hotel guests. A typical guest room had been analyzed and divided in to 8 functional areas, that became 8 attributes of the survey questionnaire. The most important factors for the hotel guests were a proper management and a pleasant service, not the most luxurious guest room features. These findings assert that it is possible to perform a leaner and greener hotel development and the need of businesses’ leading on the making the hotel industry more sustainable and socially responsible. Discrete choice questions found the desk to be the most important factor for 3 star hotels. Window, bed, desk, and living found to be significantly important for 4 star hotels. In general, all the attributes except the bath were significantly important. When all the 8 attributes were presented together, the desk type found to be the most important factor followed by the bed arrangement. The most likely choice of 3 star hotel guests is consist of operable full height window, twin bed with design features, bath and separated toilet, single armchair with ottoman, small closet, extendable desk, small TV, and full height mini-bar. They find all the attributes almost equally important and the importance of the bed appeared to be rather lower than anticipated. The importance value of desk attribute is exceptionally high (25.8%). closet and entertainment had lower importances. The most likely choice of 4 star hotel is the room with operable full height window and balcony, a double bed with design features, a small shower stall, a large closet and luggage, double armchair, a medium size desk, swivel TV, and a full height mini-bar. Window, closet, & mini-bar found to be the least influential features, while bed and desk to be the most influential ones. The Conjoint questions 1&2 investigated on which part hotel guests put more value; size of the guest room or the view to the outside. When size and window were presented together, the room size accounted 70% of vignette ratings, and the window showed 30% of importance value. Interestingly, desk shows the highest importance value of all. During the qualitative research, significance of the desk was discussed many times. The outcome of the survey supports the discussion. Desk attribute carries 22.9% of importance and the most frequently chosen level was the medium size desk. Utilities and importances of attributes change significantly in relation with the demographic characteristics of the respondent. Characteristics of travel also found to have a significant correlation with the guest’s hotel guest room preference. Travel characteristics in this context refer the duration of each stay, room share, purpose of travel. However, no significant correlation between income/education level and the respondent’s preferences has found. Large difference among importance values were witnessed on the survey data analysis. For instance, entertainment showed 9.6% of importance while desk showed 22.9% importance. In other words, a desk that meets a guest’ expectation is much more likely to satisfy the guest than an impressive entertainment area arrangement. Likewise, poor condition or choice of desk design can disappoint a guest much more than an entertainment area that doesn’t meet the guest’ expectation.Design and layout of the hotel’s facilities affect its revenue operation potential, as well as guest satisfaction. The customer trade-offs identified with this research serve as an important input for conceptualization of a hotel property development. The research suggests the starting point of a competitive concept composition. Developers can refer to the sub-group studies and generate a customized guest room model. As an example, a hotel concept planning is presented. Hotel concept planning as such will be a valuable input for hotel developers, hoteliers, and valuers. Importance values imply which function should be fortified, which not. The data from this study can present a good direction for hotel businesses on performing renovations; on which part the focus should be set in relation with their guest characteristics. The knowledge obtained by this study will enable managers to select innovative offerings that are most beneficial to the firm and that will truly have an impact on customer’s choices. By understanding customer trade-offs, service firms will have a better market orientation with a resulting improvement in the firm performance.","hotel; hotel design; hotel development; retail & leisure; Real Estate & Housing; hotel valuation; Real Estate investment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

Store owners, customers and producer brands are three parties sharing these needs and there are intelligent systems that offer solutions. Intelligent systems could use the video information from the store and they can offer basic information about what the people in the store are doing by interpreting body language. In this research to address those questions we aim to design a system which can automatically detect the basic actions in a store that are performed by people. We define the basic actions that are most commonly observed in a store and by considering sequences of these actions, higher level information about customers’ behavior can be extracted. We set up a shopping environment for experiments and made recordings in which people are doing shopping and performing the defined basic actions. We analyze the obtained data to examine the common properties and patterns of shopping related actions. Next step is to extract the discriminative features from those recordings that can reveal the actions they belong to. For that part we use two tools, ETH Human Pose Detection framework and Kinect sensor developed by Microsoft. ETH Tool detects and returns the limbs of a person in the scene and we use this information to extract the angles between the limbs automatically. Kinect is capable of returning the depth information, people’s silhouettes and if configured properly also the body skeleton coordinates. Furthermore the information obtained from silhouettes and body skeleton coordinates are used to extract different types of features. Next we evaluate the two tools and the sets of features with different classifiers by employing the developed automatic action detection software module. To conclude we examine the shopping store data, evaluate ETH and Kinect tools with different sets of features and yield to conclusions about those actions and the problem itself. The action detection performance is not very high yet that leads us to a lot of interpretations and deeper knowledge about those actions and possible solutions for addressing the challenges of the analyzed problem.","man-machine interaction; action detection; pose estimation; action recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

But they are “fake-urbanized”. Their urban residential problems directly reflected the situation: On the one hand, they are not acknowledged in urban population’s (UP) urban residential system; On the other hand, they still try to make use of the existing poor residential places in city. The national problem can be easily witnessed in the second-tier city Changsha. This graduation project tries to make a proposal on how to develop a “normalized urban residential system for MW”, in order to allow them to access to normalized urban life. For clarity, the research is divided into seven parts: (1) By comparing the top-down universalized solution and the bottom-up contextualized solution, the study concludes that the “transformation of MW - used existing residential places” is more feasible and possible; (2) Under existing dilemma, the “normal urban life” for MW means the livelihood and the way to live with UP. And the “public realm” is the interface between MW and UP. After the case study of (3) three “normalized residential systems for urban population in different context” and (4) three typical “MW - used residential places”, the public realm can be seen as a “Three Level Interfaces Structure” system to organize the livelihood and meeting of different social strata. (5) This system is developed as a strategy for the transformation of MW - used residential places into “urban residential system”, which allow them to access to the normal urban life. (6) It is successfully tested by planning and designing of the “Village within City” from previous case studies, (7) and the evaluation clearly shows its potentials and flexibility.","City as system; Public Realm; Interface; Formalization; Integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-01","Architecture","Urbanism","","Graduation Studio Complex Cities","",""

(mentor); Van Swieten, P.M.J. (mentor)","2011","Does papercrete fulfil the increased needs of a façade cladding technology? Papercrete is an experimental material which replaces an amount of cement with paper in the normal concrete mix. The total weight, the cost and the CO2 emissions during production are reduced. Its use remains limited, because of the lack of official data about its structural behaviour, mechanical properties and durability. In order to bring papercrete closer to standardization further experimentation is needed. The research is material based, and aims to define the limiting properties and set the main design principles. Results showed that papercrete meet most of the façade cladding systems requirements. It is a lightweight material (7 times lighter than concrete) with good heat and acoustic insulation properties and big variety on shapes, colours and textures. Papercrete though, is a new material and like all the new materials there is a period of time which its applications are limited because the manufacturing, processing and construction techniques are still not developed enough to facilitate its use. Papercrete is a properties limited material. These properties will define whether if can be used as a façade cladding material or not. Adding reinforcement (fibres or metal mesh in the mesh) to improve the mechanical properties, changing the manufacture process (use less water-ovens) to minimize the drying period and increase the strength and prefabricating the panels in a controlled environment and moving them in situ when needed are the first steps towards standardizing the process and improving the quality. There are significant challenges going into business with papercrete but also opportunities. Deep knowledge in material properties and long term liability, advance in processing and building aspects, in combination with future material technology, will bring papercrete closer to standardization. Getting a building permit will become easier, will attract more investments, and eventually papercrete will be commercially accepted.","papercrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Building Technology","","Computation and Performance","",""

(mentor)","2011","Fundamentele veranderingen in havens en de locatie van deze havens hebben een grote impact op de relatie tussen de stad en de betreffende haven. Deze veranderingen worden meestal veroorzaakt door globalisering. De havens willen hun concurrentiepositie op de markt behouden waardoor technologische innovaties nodig zijn en een verandering in productie nodig zijn. Als gevolg hiervan verplaatsten de havens zich vaak naar gebieden buiten de oude stadscentra waar meer ruimte en mogelijkheden voor groei zijn. Deze evolutie heeft ervoor gezorgd dat er wereldwijd in verscheidene havensteden oud verlaten havengebied nabij de binnenstad is achtergebleven. Hierdoor is de connectie tussen water en de binnenstad verbroken. Deze oude havengebieden bieden echter een grote verscheidenheid aan mogelijkheden voor diverse herontwikkelingsprojecten. Het blijkt dat deze ontwikkelingen een belangrijke rol spelen bij fysieke, materiële en economische ontwikkelingen van havensteden. De waterkant is een uniek fenomeen voor stedelijke ontwikkeling. Het imago van water stimuleert het ontwikkelen van een unieke sfeer. De verandering van de oude havens en van het aanverwant transport in de oud-industriële gebieden, laat toe dat het publiek toegang krijgt tot deze verlaten “stedelijke rand”. Het betreffende gebied kan worden teruggewonnen voor de bewoners van de stad en kan een maatschappelijke betekenis bieden (Breen, 1994). Om de toegang voor de bewoners tot deze oude haven gebieden te voorzien is er een verandering van de stedelijke strategie in de havensteden vereist. Deze strategie dient die zich aan te passen aan de nieuwe stedelijke condities. Men moet een nieuwe visie creëren over het veranderen van de leefomstandigheden, over de groeiende dichtheid van de stad en over de identiteit van de stat als havenstad. Dit soort havensteden zijn op zoek naar nieuwe kansen voor de oude verlaten havengebieden en staan open voor diverse aanpassingen om aantrekkelijke, levendige en onderscheidende steden te worden. Het woord “waterfront” is gedefinieerd als het stedelijk gebied dat rechtstreeks contact heeft met het water. Deze gebieden aan een rivier of zee werden voorheen vooral gebruikt voor havenactiviteiten, haveninfrastructuur, verlaten natuurgebieden en voor kleinschalige, informele industrieen. De vernieuwing van deze waterkant gaat gepaard met uitdagingen en kansen om een ruimtelijk gebied te ontwikkelen dat economische en sociale verbetering stimuleert. De transformatie van de waterkant van havensteden kan de stad weer een uniek en persoonlijk imago geven. Het culturele leven kan dicht bij het water van een havenstad gebracht worden. Dit afstudeeronderzoek is erop gericht om de stad Antwerpen te revitaliseren door het gebruik van de oude havengebieden te stimuleren. Het afstudeerproject richt zich op de transformatie van de waterkant van Antwerpen met als doel om de binnenstad weer te verbinden met het water en de identiteit van de stad als havenstad te versterken. Sinds het jaar 850 is Antwerpen reeds gekend als een havenstad. De haven was in die tijd echter nog gelegen in de binnenstad. Talrijke grachten verbonden de Schelde en de binnenstad. In de loop der tijden is deze haven volledig van de binnenstad naar het noorden van de stad verschoven en zijn de grachten en oude dokken in de binnenstad gedempt. Hedendaags is de sfeer van een havenstad niet meer voelbaar in het historische stadscentrum. De oude, overgebleven havengebieden zijn achtergebleven als onaantrekkelijke openbare ruimtes in de buurt van de binnenstad. Dit creeert een slecht beeld van de stad. Deze oude havengebieden zorgen er ook voor dat de stad is losgekoppeld van de rivier en dit terwijl de Schelde een rijke karakteristieke en historische betekenis heeft die gerelateerd is aan het ontstaan van Antwerpen. De oude haven was bepalend voor de ontwikkeling van stedelijke functies in de buurt van het water. Het is dan ook van belang dat mijn afstudeerproject de waterkant en het water weer bij de stad betrokken wordt. De hoofdvraag hierbij is: Met welke ruimtelijke interventies en daaraan gekoppelde strategieën, kan de binnenstad van Antwerpen verbonden worden met de Schelde. Heti s hierbij de bedoeling om gebruik te maken van de verlaten havengebieden. Belangrijk is dat de voorgestelde interventies zowel de economische en de sociale leefomgeving, als de omgevingskwaliteit van het gebied verhogen. Het afstudeerproject beoogt een strategisch plan en een stedelijk ruimtelijk ontwerp om de waterkant van Antwerpen te transformeren tot een aantrekkelijk gebied. De vraag is echter hoe men de huidige situatie kan aanpakken. De waterkantontwikkeling van Antwerpen moet de stad aantrekkelijker maken. Hierbij is het de bedoeling dat door het verbeteren van de economische, sociale en ruimtelijke structuur en door de culturele groei te stimuleren, de stad een sterkere concurrentiepositie zal verwerven binnen Europa. De noodzaak van een vooruitstrevende en goede bescherming tegen het stijgende waterpeil vormt een niet te onderschatten extra aspect in de genoemde waterkantontwikkeling. Een goede aanpak van het project is van groot belang om de hedendaagse conflicten tussen het huidige stedelijke gebied en de oude haven in de stad, op te lossen. Projecten voor herontwikkeling van de waterkant zijn een belangrijke troef voor de stedelijke gemeenschap om onaantrekkelijke gebieden nieuw leven in te blazen en het gebied zo nieuwe economische en sociale kansen te bieden. Het belangrijkste doel van het afstudeerproject is om de identiteit van de stad als havenstad te versterken en te verbeteren door de verbinding van de stad met de Schelde te vernieuwen. Hiervoor moet men het oude havengebied aan de waterkant herontwikkelen, door er een aantrekkelijk en levendig gebied te creëren. Het belangrijkste aspect in het gecreeerde ontwerp om dit doel te bereiken is de aanleg van een boulevard langs de Kaai. Deze is speciaal ontworpen voor voetgangers, fietsers en openbaar vervoer. Daarnaast biedt deze boulevard een beschermende functie bij eventuele waterbedreiging als gevolg van bijvoorbeeld extreme weersomstandigheden. De boulevard zal verschillende wijken met de Schelde verbinden en de identiteit van de wijken versterken door het gebied tussen de Schelde en de boulevard volgens de authenticiteit van de wijk her in te richten.","havensteden; stedelijke ontwikkeling; stadsvernieuwing; strategisch plannen; openbare ruimte; ontwikkeling waterkant; toegankelijkheid en bereikbaarheid; duurzame ontwikkeling; sociaaleconomische leefbaarheid; segregatie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-06","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban regeneration","",""

With these experiments it can be determined if there is preferred gas hydrate formation with CO2 or CH4. The experiments at each initial pressure were done in triple fold to ensure reproducibility. After the formation experiment, the formed gas hydrates were dissociated by stepwise pressure release. By analyzing the gas phase composition by means of a gas chromatograph the ratio of CO2 and CH4 gas hydrates could be determined. Combining and analyzing the results of the experiments at different initial pressures, it can be concluded that the preference of CO2 or CH4 to be captured in gas hydrate changes with the initial pressure. This means the behavior changes, if the initial pressure is below or above the LHV equilibrium of the binary system CH4 + H2O. In general it can be stated that CO2 hydrates are formed preferably at lower pressures, while at higher pressures (higher than the LHV pressure of CH4 + H2O) there is no preferred formation of CO2 hydrates. The dissociation experiments which followed the gas hydrate formation with initial pressures of 5.0 and 6.0 MPa, show that CO2 is not only released from dissociated gas hydrates but also from the aqueous phase.","Gas Hydrate; CO2; CH4","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Jonkman, S.N. (mentor); Verwaest, T. (mentor); Hassan, W. (mentor); Suzuki, T. (mentor)","2011","There is a chance that storm surges occurring in coastal areas cause overtopping over wide crested dikes. The overtopping water results in a hydrodynamic load on the structures built on top of the crest. This is for example the case at the Belgian coast where houses and hotels are constructed on top of the dike crest. In this study, physical model tests were executed on a schematized model scaled 1/30. The aim was to come up with a relationship describing the force on a vertical plane exerted by the overtopping water as a function of wave parameters and geometrical characteristics. Due to time constraints the number of tests had to be restricted so only a limited number of parameters could be varied. Despite these restrictions, the experiments revealed the most important mechanism of the impact process under the two dike configurations included: the dike side case with dike crest width of 0 m and the inland case with dike crest of width 0.5 m in model scale. The overtopping wave force could directly be related to the overtopping wave momentum flux, resulting in a simple formulation for the prediction of the wave force. Thus, the overtopping wave force is proportional to the overtopping wave momentum flux, obtained by integrating the maximum water depth in front of the vertical plane for the inland case and the dike side case. The coefficients of these two cases are almost the same, namely around 0.33. When building the relationship between the overtopping wave force and the incident wave and dike geometrical characteristics, three other approaches were also applied. Firstly, the concept of overtopping wave tongue thickness was introduced into the relationship between the overtopping wave force and incident wave characteristics; secondly, overtopping flow velocity and water layer thickness at the beginning crest of the sea dike were also added into the analysis of overtopping wave force and finally, a new dimensionless overtopping wave force was developed. This dimensionless overtopping wave force is also proportional to the dimensionless freeboard: the least scatter for this parameter gave a rather good potential suitability for force prediction, especially with the conditions of large incident wave height impacts on the relatively low freeboard. The coefficient related to the two dimensionless parameters could also be dimensionless with a form of crest width divided by wave length, however due to the limited configurations, this dimensionless coefficient still needs to be explored further in future study. The reduction effect for crest width of 0.5 m is about 65%. Due to the fact that only two widths crest were tested in the present study, the relationship between the width and overtopping wave force could not be presented. Therefore, in future study, variation of the width of the crest should be increased, and the effect of the crest width could be further researched.","overtopping wave; hydrodynamic load; vertical structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Winkelaar, D.O. (mentor)","2011","The study provides meaningful insights about the customers of KLM.nl, the difference with the international customers, the commercial viability of the segments, needs regarding online booking for two of the most commercial viable segments and concepts that create sales growth and shift for KLM.nl based on these needs. Firstly, the study provides insights about the division of customer segments at KLM.nl using the current AIFRANCE KLM customer segmentation. It is found that the Care for me traveler together with the Comfort travelers are the largest leisure and business segments of KLM.nl. 27% of all customers that made a booking at KLM.nl were Care for me leisure travelers against 22% of Comfort business travelers. It is found by research on 2010 sales data of KLM.nl (all bookings made in 2010), that approximately 40% of all online bookings at KLM.nl were made by business segments. Secondly, it is founded that the AIFRANCE KLM segmentation model can be complemented with two new overlapping segments. First new segment is the VFR leisure traveler, travelling to visit friends and family A second new ‘overlapping’ segment are the Dutch online baby boomers. It is founded that approximately one quarter of all KLM.nl bookers are older than 55 years old. No difference is founded between the age division of online leisure and business bookers. Thirdly, it is founded that a remarkable high percentage (85%) of all KLM.nl customers book the lowest categories of fares. It was expected that this percentage was far lower for KLM.nl business bookers, since 40% of all bookings is made for business purpose. Research shows that business bookers via agents book higher fares compared to leisure bookers via agents. It is founded that there is only a small difference in booked fares between KLM.nl business and leisure bookings. Therefore it is concluded that KLM.nl business and leisure bookers show almost similar booking behavior in terms of booked fare categories. Fourthly, it is founded that the Care for me and Ambitious traveler segment are the two most commercial viable segments of KLM.nl in terms of sales growth potential. Both segments score high on sales potential in terms of shift and growth. However, the shift potential of care for me travelers is doubted and needs some further research, since the AFKL study show some contradicted results compared to the new segment division study. According to the AFKL study, a large percentage (38%) of all Care for me travelers book online while results of this study indicate that this percentage is lower. Further research on booking channel needs to be done to proof this. Efficient business travelers and price driven leisure travelers got a small positive score on sales potential as well. Other segments are commercial interesting for KLM.nl (but show less potential in sales growth). The comfort traveler is the biggest business segment at KLM.nl and therefore important for the sales of KLM.nl. However, it is decided to not choose this segment since the potential for even more sales growth is limited. A similar motivation is used for the pragmatic leisure traveler. Fifthly, several insights are gathered about the care for me travelers regarding inspirational search. It is founded that the new inspirational tools of KLM.nl are offered too late in the inspirational process of the care for me customers. It is founded that care for me customers visit KLM.nl only when they already decide on the destination and airline. Furthermore it is founded that Care for me customers gets inspired by social media. Travel reviews, hotel reviews, travel reports and tips from other travelers are read to inspire and compose their next trip. A concept is designed that gives care for me travelers the opportunity to share their photo’s and tips in a travelmap overview on their ‘new’ Hyves profile. It is researched that Hyves is the social media platform, care for me travelers probably will use the most. Care for me travelers are particularly older than travelers from the other segments and Hyves is the platform with a growing percentage of 55+ years users. myTravelmap is a functional tool for Care for my Hyvers to show others (friends or all Hyvers) their travel history including holiday photo’s for that destination. Next to that, tips can be given to others and a wish list with destinations or activities can be composed. Depending on the security level of the gadget, other friends or all Hyvers are able to post tips and tricks in the wish list of the care for me traveler. It is founded that tips and tricks from acquaintances are highest valued by social media users in general. The goal of the gadget is to inspire care for me customers unconsciously by providing them with a tool that stimulate to look at holiday pictures and post or receive tips about their next travel. Subsequently, the option is provided to inspire further on (via the KLM Travlr application), organize the travel with friends (via the KLM tripplanner gadget) or looks for offers for that specific destination (via the booking tool of KLM). This way, Care for me customers, unconsciously are pulled into KLM’s booking funnel (figure 29). This booking funnel (designed for this study) describes the process from unconscious inspiration to booking online. It is found that KLM.nl provides customers with tools to inspire for their next travel but not with tools that inspire unconsciously. This higher level of inspiration stimulates people to use the inspirational tools of KLM or step into the booking process of KLM.nl However, further research is needed to proof this KLM.nl funnel of inspiration. In the end this new social media gadget will result in a sales growth and shift to KLM.nl bookings. The gadget pulls care for me customers into the funnel of KLM.nl. This funnel takes care that customers are directed to leisure offers or more inspiration. The inspiration tools take care that KLM gets a better leisure image and take care that KLM will be earlier into the consideration set of the customers.","customer study; idea generation; KLM.nl; channel shift; social media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-30","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design (SPD)","","","",""

This map can be used to make an upfront assessment of unfavorable foundation conditions at a proposed installation site. This is not self-evident due to the complex geological setting of the area. Data to complete this research was provided by Fugro Engineers B.V.. The available data set contains (geotechnical) borehole data, geophysical data, bathymetric data and information regarding the surface sediments in the Gulf of Suez. The borehole data are used to perform bearing capacity calculations for different kinds of spudcan foundations, ranging in diameter between 10 m and 18 m. These calculations resulted in a distinction between locations with a “safe” profile and locations for which a punch-through profile is generated. At these unfavorable locations, the actual risk of a punch-trough failure will depend on the deployed rig and the corresponding preload. Therefore, a factor of safety is calculated for these risky locations. The data was integrated into an ArcGIS project. Data analysis resulted in the identification of different safe and risky zones regarding punch-through occurrence. The identified zones turned out to be valid for every spudcan with a diameter between 10 m and 18 m. An observed trend is that for a constant preload, the risk for punch-through decreases if the spudcan diameter increases. Generalization of the identified zones into depositional environments allowed the production of a risk map that also covers these areas in the Gulf of Suez for which no data was available. Two environments turned out to have the highest risk for punch through failure. The first environment is characterised by a deep bathymetry and fine grained sediments, possibly with coarse grained intercalations. Punch-through in these areas is related to these coarse grained intercalations or to different degree of consolidation inside these fine grained packages. The second environment is related to areas where wadis bring a lot of sediment into the Gulf of Suez and develop an alluvial fan at their mouth. Mixing of this coarse grained input with finer grained deep water sedimentation results in the generation of punch-through profiles. Finally, for two areas with a high borehole concentration, an attempt was made to develop 3D ground models with the SGeMS software package. The bearing capacity inside the grid was predicted by applying ordinary kriging between the boreholes. The accuracy of these models and the practicability of the SGeMS program are thoroughly discussed.","Gulf of Suez; jack-up rig; hazard map; punch-through failure; bearing capacity; 3D model; ArcGIS; SGeMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Intensive studies have been conducted to identify the most suitable architecture for high-performance packet switches. These architectures can be classified by queuing schemes, scheduling algorithms and switching fabric structures. The crossbar based switching fabric has been widely agreed to be the most suitable one, for its low cost, scalability and native multicast support. Large numbers of commercial implementations and literature studies have been conducted on the unbuffered crossbar switching architecture. Due to the requirement of the centralized scheduler, scheduling algorithms in the unbuffered crossbar have generally high complexities. This leads to time-consuming scheduling processes that prevent the unbuffered architecture from scaling up with the modern optical link operating at the Gb/S range. The buffered crossbar architecture has been proposed to overcome the scheduling complexity bottleneck faced by the unbuffered crossbar. The introduction of cross point buffers decouples the centralized scheduling process and lowers the scheduling complexity. However, the drawback of the buffered crossbar lies in the fact that it requires $N^2$ expensive on-chip memories, $N$ being the size of the switch, limiting the scalability of the buffered crossbar architecture. To provide the scheduling simplicity brought by the buffered crossbar while having a cost close to the unbuffered one, the partially buffered crossbar architecture has been proposed. With the combination of advantages of the previous two architectures, the Partially Buffered Crossbar (PBC) is deemed as one of the competitive candidates for next-generation switching architectures. However, the previously proposed algorithms did not fully exploit its potential. In this thesis, we: i) propose a unicast scheduling algorithm that further pushes the performance of the PBC switch under various non-uniform traffic settings, while using as few as 2 internal buffers per output. ii) study the multicast traffic support by the partially buffered crossbar switch and come up with an effective multicast scheduling algorithm.","Partially Buffered Crossbar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Sjerps, M. (mentor)","2011","Y-haplotype profiling presents special advantages for forensic casework, paternity and population studies. Y-chromosome DNA is male-specific and can sometimes be detected in stains where autosomal DNA cannot. When a suspect in a criminal case has the same Y-haplotype as found in a crime stain, what is the evidential value of the match? In such cases, knowing an estimate of the frequency of the suspect's haplotype in the population is of interest. Many solutions to find such an estimate have been proposed but never accepted by the entire forensic experts population. In this report we present a new method, called the Neighbor-Matching method, as well as a detailed comparison with the existing methods and a theoretical analysis of these methods. The Neighbor-Matching method uses a population evolution process to estimate which haplotypes genetically close to the suspect's haplotype, called neighbors, are expected to be in the population if the suspect's haplotype is common or rare. No assumptions are made as to the distribution of all haplotype frequencies in the population, and as much genetical information as possible is used to create the neighbors. After the analyze of the theoretical and numerical results, it appears that this new method is well adapted to the problem at hand and quite robust to changes in its parameters, so can be seen as reliable. However, the version presented in this report is a simplified prototype, and more work has to be done to create a program largely usable by forensic experts.","Y-STR haplotype; forensic science; forensic statistics; DNA; match probability estimation; haplorype frequency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Statistics","",""

(mentor); Hidders, A.J.H. (mentor); Van den Berg, J. (mentor); Manuel, B.A. (mentor)","2011","After its founding 15 years ago, Tam Tam has encountered the limits of legacy systems used for the internal processes in recent years. To overcome these limits, multiple efforts have been made to enforce a transition to specific Enterprise Application Integration styles. Although the efforts resulted in working application interactions, the desire for an organized whole sustained. The motivation for this thesis project was to make one final effort towards a new architecture by providing a carte blanche for all steps to be taken as well as their outcomes. The main goal of this thesis project was to research the most logical next step? for Tam Tam to take with the internal systems architecture and to derive which improvements this step brings into the picture. To reach this goal, a crossroad of three key elements is identified. 1. Context, the first element is to figure out what the current architectural landscape looks like and what can be learned from the previous attempts at integrating the systems. 2. Theory, the second element is to figure out how architectures can be compared, what the possible solutions are and which of those fits Tam Tam best. 3. Practice, the third element is to link the theoretical design to the practice to assess its feasibility, to evaluate which improvements for Tam Tam are introduced and, finally, to evaluate the chosen methodology. The choice for sub-steps in the chosen methodology is based on best practices and guidelines from available (relevant) literature and is adapted to be used in this specific context. The focus of this adaption is that the chosen steps must be adaptable to other contexts too. After the complete methodology has been carried out, the key deliverables can be divided into two different categories: science and Tam Tam. For science the main deliverables are: 1. An aggregated list of re-usable insights 2. A case study for an Enterprise Service Bus transition 3. Are-usable step-by-step approach from legacy systems architecture towards the most logical? next architecture. The key deliverables for Tam Tam entail: A. A conclusion of the continuous effort towards Enterprise Application Integration B. Sellable BizTalk know-how C. An improved internal architecture with regard to flexibility, maintainability and adaptability Concluding, the given carte blanche allowed for a successful path towards the best fitting Enterprise Application Integration style for Tam Tam. Furthermore, the methodology used is assembled in such a way it can withstand usage in other contexts and can be seen as a first step towards a formal definition of said methodology. This re- usability is introduced by the context-free focus during the definition of said methodology.","business processes; Enterprise Application Integration; EAI; Service Oriented Architecture; SOA; Enterprise Service Bus; ESB; BizTalk; Legacy systems; architecture transition plan; next generation architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology, Web Information systems","","Information Architecture","",""

The simulation time of the model is dramatically reduced so that the PLL is able to be included into the model to simulate the frequency difference between the transmitter and receiver. Then the distortion caused by this difference can be simulated. Also, the digital baseband is first included into the model, the digital baseband can be divided into two parts – the transmitter part and the receiver part, the transmitter part realizes the PPM modulation and the receiver part realizes the PPM synchronization algorithm and the PPM decoding. Also it is responsible for the verification of the received data. Moreover, the effects of various practical imperfections are included in this model. The imperfections include high order harmonies, VCO noise, Charge Pump current mismatch, leakage current and so on. With this model, we can not only see the performance of each block, but also the performance of the entire system. The model is verified by a number of simulation tools as well as the measurement results. These comparison results demonstrate that the model is able to precisely reflect the real system behaviour with fast simulation time. They also validate that the SystemC/SystemC-AMS is an efficient and powerful language for mixed-signal modelling.","pll; systemc; mixed-signal modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Microelectronics","","Microelectronics","",""

It leads to the problem of lack of street life that make the segregation worse. It is proposed to create a concentration along the spine by adding volumes in front of the existing building facade. On the ground floor it will be programmed for public use while above are mainly for dwelling. It is like a system which can be adapted to different needs and situations. By having those new volumes, it is possible to bring the following benefits: 1. Besides housing, it is imagined those volume could be other programmes like community center, studio, indoor sports center etc. They can be double height or triple height. 2. The climate in London is always rainy and cold in winter, a covered pedestrian walkway would encourage people to stay outside. 3. On the ground level, the space covered by the newly added volumes will become an arcade like space. It is possible to have small shops operated by locals. It could also become a gathering space with benches and indeed it could also be unpreprogrammed space which provides more possibilities by the need of the people. 4. There will be many possibilities or typologies for the volumes. First and most importantly, it can be used as housing. it could be an extension of the existing units which could accommodate the problem of miss match of small housing unit with big Bangladeshis family size. It could help them to expand their unit without relocating them to another area. Of cause the newly added volume could also be an independent unit. 5. Spatially, the new volumes could take different forms, they can be an enclosed indoor space; semi-enclosed space like a large balcony which i guess it was very common in Portugal that people use it as the living room to watch movie etc; it can also be a outdoor space like a terrace. i believe all of those can bring a closer relationship between the people in the housing and the people on the street, as they can have more visual connection than before which there are windows only. 6. It can densify or increase the total floor area for housing in the district without losing any green space as the new volumes are added above the existing pedestrian walkway. it also can prevent adding volumes on top of the existing ones which usually end up with losing the close connection to the street life. 7. Economically, i guess it would be quite cheap to build as they can be as simple as floor slabs without enclosure.","linear architecture; public life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-19","Architecture","Architecture","","Master of Science in Architecture","",""

In this study, we investigated the disturbance rejection and robustness of the six most used angle of attack controllers. We found that dead-beat control provides by far the best disturbance rejection. Furthermore, dead-beat control also performs very well in terms of robustness; its disturbance rejection is hardly affected by model and sensor errors.

(mentor); Christiaans, H.H.C.M. (mentor); Jin, S. (mentor)","2011","A lot of different tools and methods for strategic product development are being used used in the West. Companies cannot exist without doing a sufficient ammount of marketing and branding activities. Customer needs are explored on a daily basis and brands are developing itself to extent from the broad range of companies offering similar services. Companies in SouthEast Asia are having difficulties with competing against big markets like China in terms of production and export figures. The region has to find other differentiators to gain o more competitive position. One of the possibilities for the local industries is to add value to their products by applying Sustainable Product Innovation (SPIN) in their new product development. The SPIN project therefore has the purpose to support local SMEs in Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia with developing (new) products and implementing those products on (inter) national markets. One of the knowledge gaps of the local SMEs in Vietnam is the area of strategic approaches of product innovation. The main goal of the graduation project was to provide tools that will supplement the SPIN consultancy guide in order to create ‘successful’ products. This consultancy guide has to provide the SMEs a step-by-step guidance in developing their products and position those on the right markets. A lot of research has been done in Vietnam to gain insights on the context of the strategic modules. Sector organizations and local SMEs were interviewed in order to derive needs and wishes of the target group of the consultancy guide. The SPIN project continues on a previous project, called the CP4BP project. This project focussed on the production of the products only, but worked within the same context as the SPIN project. The CP4BP project has been evaluated on its results and structure in order to gain learning’s and guidelines for the development of the new consultancy guide. A SPIN knowledge transfer framework was developed in the beginning of the project by the SPIN project’s team to give some structure on the planning and activities of the project. This framework is based on Diehl (2010) and gives an overview on which levels the SPIN projects operates. Level 1 is considered to be the train of trainers sessions in which the trainees will be trained to work at the companies to implement the SPIN approach. Level 2 is considered to be the demonstration projects in which the SMEs will work with the trainers. Literature on existing methods and tools on branding and marketing were explored and analyzed on the possibilities of being useful for the SPIN content. Since the theory of the methods used for the strategic development modules had to be of an introduction level, basic theory on branding and marketing activities are being used to form the theory. During the synthesis phase the modules were developed and the collected theory was transformed in order to fit to the guide. Worksheets were developed to guide the user of the guide through the whole SPIN process in a step-by-step approach. Participatory design groups were used to discuss the content of the guide and to come up with solutions for some minor discussion parts. Hereafter the modules were tested during a train-of-trainer session (level 1), in which thirty trainers were trained to use the SPIN consultancy guide at SMEs during the so called ‘demonstration projects’ for implementing the SPIN methodologies. At an introduction weekend of the first demonstration project (level 2) for six tea companies the modules were also tested. The first results of the strategic development modules can be seen as positive. The users saw most exercises as easy to follow and the results of most exercises were acceptable. The evaluation of the results came up with a few remarks. Some minor changes were made on the structure and rephrasing some exercises and theory after the first round of tests, but the major part of the content stayed untouched. Recommendations on both short-term as long-term were suggested after the evaluation. Short-term recommendations were that the interaction between the theory in the guide and the worksheets should be improved. During the tests it was clear that the users did not use the worksheets and the guide at the same time, in order to stimulate this, improvements on the structure of the consultancy guide has to be made. There was also found that the concreteness of the answers in the worksheets can be of a higher level. Some changes in the description of the assignments and clearer goals of the exercises the user can stimulate the user to answer a more concrete and feasible way. Long-term recommendations can be to include the opportunities of the Internet to the consultancy guide. A suggestion is made in this report to make use of an interactive platform in which the users are able to share information and results of their cases with other users. Such a platform offers the possibility for trainers and SMEs to help each other and learn from colleagues in the same field. A straightforward design process with an extensive analysis phase characterizes this graduation project. The end result of this graduation project is a strategic development module with an introduction to branding and marketing activities that fits into the general SPIN consultancy guide.","Sustainable Product Innovation; Design for sustainability; Branding and marketing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Design for Sustainability","",""

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor)","2011","Philips has determined that the sales of SENSEO accessories and shaving accessories are lagging because shoppers do not notice the products in stores. Furthermore shoppers are unaware of the added value of accessories. There are 4.5 million SENSEO machines and 4.5 million Philips shavers currently in use, which means that the potential target group for Home Care Accessories (HCA) is enormous. The competition for HCA is relatively low. My assignment was to help Philips to achieve in-store excellence for HCA. I developed a strategic advice on the in-store presentation of shaving and SENSEO accessories in the Dutch market. By in-store presentation I mean the position of the products in the store, the shelf or display design and the design of point of sales materials. Before I formulated this strategy I performed several studies. A literature research provided useful insights in the behavior of shoppers and how this behavior can be influenced by product placement and diverse stimuli. Next to that I visited many stores to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the current product presentations. Remarkably was the lack of communication in store. Accessories are either positioned next to the core devices, as a separate category or behind the counter. Presentations where the products are grouped next to the core devices look the best. Shaving accessories are often badly positioned behind the counter or in plastic anti-theft boxes. Inspiring examples for SENSEO accessories are information leaflets on the shelf and second placement of descalers. The new presentation with compatibility guide at Media Markt is the best example of the shaving accessories category. Besides HCA I also examined the store presentation of other categories to gather inspiration. The most valuable research was the shopper and consumer research. Herewith I defined where shoppers look for accessories in the store, what they know and think about the products and what their purchase considerations are. I also determined what the opinion of shoppers is about the product presentation and communication. This study consisted of in-store observations, interviews and online questionnaires. With all the insights I gathered from these analyses I formulated a strategy for the positioning, presentation and communication of accessories. Accessories should be positioned close to the core device and they should be grouped together to increase the visual impact. Interesting products can be shown without packaging to stimulate interaction. Furthermore a link needs to be created between accessories and the core device. By showing images of people who use the products an inspiring ambience is created. Impulse purchases can be stimulated by placing the products at the counter or on an end-aisle shelf. It is essential that the shopper who buys the core device notices that the accessories exist. The communication at the shelf should convey the following three messages: What kind of product is this?, Why should the shopper buy it? And Is it compatible with the shopper’s core device? I gave communication guidelines for the descaler, podholders, shaver heads and the cleaning spray. To communicate the compatibility between accessories and core devices it works best to use images and series names of the core device. Next, I selected two retailers (Blokker and Kijkshop) to develop concepts for following from the strategy. In total I designed 25 concepts. These were then evaluated based on the main requirements: improving the visibility and awareness of the products and improving the communication of product benefits and compatibility. Based on this ranking and Philips’ view, I selected 7 concepts to develop further. Within my project I further developed the winner stage and the 3D shelf stopper. Next to that I designed a compatibility top card for Media Markt. The rest of the materials need to be developed by Philips in the future if retailers react positively. I formulated a three-phase implementation plan for the development and production of these materials. Philips should start by getting properly listed at the important retailers. Second, the accessories should be positioned as a group close to the core devices. For SENSEO accessories the basis is to make clear what the products are and what their usage is. In-store excellence of shaving accessories starts with communicating the compatibility of the shaver heads. In phase one Philips should develop product info cards, out-of-stock cards and a shaver head compatibility guide. If the basics are well-executed then shoppers who look for the products can find them. The following step is to remember shoppers who were not looking for accessories that they might need an accessory. The focus is on core device shoppers. This means that in the second phase materials will be developed that can be positioned in between the core devices. They communicate that accessories exist and convince the shopper of the product benefits. In the final phase the in-store product presentation is optimized. Philips should create materials that stimulate impulse purchases from all shoppers who own a SENSEO machine or Philips shaver. Very effective to attract impulse shoppers is second placement of accessories at end-aisle shelves or at the counter. Special displays for the impulse articles should be developed. To achieve in-store excellence Philips should also develop materials which enhance the shopping experience and simplify the selection process. Besides the order of execution I also calculated the costs and the increase in sales a material should yield to be profitable. Now Philips has to decide what they want to invest in in-store excellence the coming year. Depending on the budget Philips can decide which of the materials from the first phase will be implemented first. Before developing the more expensive projects I recommend Philips to first develop prototypes and test with these the effect that these materials will have on sales. At this point I have approval from Marskramer to roll out in all their stores the 3D shelf stopper and new product cards. Kijkshop is very interested in the product display to show the shaving accessories in the showcase. Furthermore the top card for Media Markt can be rolled out if I get the approval.","Trade marketing; Design; POS material; Visibility; Communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Similar developments can be found around the world. To implement such a concept into the Dutch market it was essential to get to know who the target group is and what happens to them as they grow older. It is also essential to have insight in the government policies regarding seniors. These aspects together with a precedent study are explored by the means of a literature survey, and form the background information for the research. The lack of information about the specific subject made it essential to gather a greater understanding of the target group in the Netherlands. The target group of 3rd age seniors is a specific group of people. The main aim of the research was to get to know who they were and what their needs, wishes and requirements are. This research was done by means of conducting a focus group, visiting a retirement community in Australia, interviewing residents and consulting a number of different professionals. The background information gathered in the first part of the research formed the framework for the interviews. The professionals that were interviewed were a housings specialist in the Province of Groningen, a project developer specialized in the development of senior housing concepts and a housing and care specialist. The combination of professional insight into the field of study and the communication with the target group itself provides a balanced perspective on the information gathered. The data was analyzed using a method called coding in which the data is collected in to groups and compared with each other. The results where then transformed into visual diagrams and sketches, and recorded in the results section. The conclusions form the basis for the recommendation that indicate that it would be a positive development in Oost-Groningen to develop an active senior community. The development should be of a scale relative to the location and size of target group and have a good interaction with the town or village it is connected to. It is very important that the developers involve the target group from the start, so that the development is developed according to the needs and wishes.","senior village; vergrijzing; Oost-Groningen; baby boomers; ouderendorp; seniorendorp; active living; keuze; huisvestings concept; huisvesting; woon concept; wonen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-25","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore lab 11","",""

(mentor); Nijhuis, S. (mentor)","2011","Due to climate change the water level in the Dutch rivers will rise the next century. In the current situation flood defence systems have reached their maximum capacity. The Deltacommissie (2008) recommends measurements in most parts of the river landscape. The trend is to give the rivers more space instead of strengthening the water defence. This leads to a paradox in urban areas, where the built environment takes up the space close to the river. For a river city the experience of the water is important, it gives identity to the place. So is there a way to strengthen the relation between the city and the water and keep the river cities dry? The location of the project is the river city Zutphen, a medium sized city with 50,000 inhabitants in the eastern part of the Netherlands. Zutphen is located on the east bank of the river IJssel, where the Berkel flows into the IJssel. On the west bank is a small settlement, a neighborhood of Zutphen, with enough space for floodplains. The two riverbanks are totally opposite, an urban- and a natural riverfront. Aim of the project is to give the city more experience of the water by integrating the public quay with the inner-city and surrounding areas. A former industry area in the north of Zutphen, along the river, will be redeveloped with inner-city functions. How can these future developments contribute to more experience of the water in the city? Many river cities have the same circumstances as the project location: same urban structure, presence of secondary river, future developments along the river. Four of these cities are studied, the aim is to find which urban elements contribute to an open relation between the city and the water. Generic solutions found in this research are implemented in the case of Zutphen.","riverfront development; room for the river","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-04","Architecture","Urbanism","","Delta Interventions","",""

It is located in the Rotterdam harbour, on the south-western tip of the Maasvlakte. Since the Slufter was built in 1987, the supply of contaminated dredged material has decreased significantly. As a result, it will take a long time before its full capacity of 150 million cubic meters is utilized. At the moment, approximately 50% of the basin has been filled. The overcapacity and surplus of space raises questions on the applicability of this area for purposes other than storage of dredged material. In this research, preparations are made for the establishment of a long term management plan by analyzing the functional, spatial and geotechnical possibilities of the Slufter. The aim has been to find potential future functions and ways to create land in the Slufter. For the short term the best opportunities for future functions can be seen for renewable energy projects and/or nature. For the long term, harbour related functions or industry provide the best options. Two alternatives for creating land have been considered; the first alternative comprises the separation of a part of the basin by means of a retaining structure. The second alternative focuses on the natural process of ripening clay. The geotechnical feasibility of a retaining structure in the shape of an embankment has been proven, but the investment costs are high. In the clay ripening alternative the incoming supply of contaminated dredged material is used as the elevation material. Once a layer of ripened dredged material with sufficient thickness has formed, enough bearing capacity can be guaranteed for further development. This approach is more cost effective, and combines short term opportunities for the application of small scale functions with a long term, sustainable solution towards an early dismantlement of the Slufter.","Slufter Rotterdam; contaminated dredged material; confined disposal facility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports & Waterways","",""

(mentor)","2011","If the Netherlands wishes to achieve an 80% CO2 reduction by the year 2050, technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles will be required to replace their fossil fuel burning counterparts. These technologies however have large consequences for electricity networks; not only will the amount of electricity transported over the networks increase, but so will the peak loads, pushing transformers and cables to their operating limits. This is a challenge that network operators are currently facing, and new methods are required to help them prepare for the future. In this thesis the flexibility of future energy technologies with the goal of limiting network loads in the Dutch low voltage electricity grid is investigated. ‘Flexibility’ refers to different variations, control strategies, and combinations of technologies that exist. Focus is placed on eight electric vehicle charging strategies and five types of electric heat pumps. Solar photovoltaics, electric hot water boilers, micro CHPs, and electric heaters as well as the effect of household insulation and thermostat setting are also investigated. The impact on the electricity grid is quantified by creating a testing environment in which the load of transformers and cables can be easily determined for any combination of market penetrations of the above technologies. Three representative low voltage networks are considered: A city, a village, and a countryside neighborhood. Calculations are carried out for a typical summer and winter day with 15 minute intervals. The technologies are modeled as Strand-Axelsson loads to take into account simultaneousness and accurately be able to predict the peak load of any number of users. The testing environment is validated by comparing the results to those obtained by Gaia, a software package specifically designed for carrying out electricity network calculations. Power demand profiles for all technologies are created using different modeling strategies. The electric vehicles are modeled based on mobility data of 50.000 Dutch citizens. Eight control strategies are modeled, examples are: uncontrolled charging, night time charging, and vehicle to grid. To model space heating technologies a Matlab model has been constructed that accurately predicts the heat demand of a household taking into account factors such as household type, insulation, thermostat setting, and outdoor temperature. With the model the power demand profiles of heat pumps and other heaters are created by modeling their control strategies. The electric vehicle and heat pump profiles are verified by comparing the results to measured data obtained from Alliander. The power demand profiles are entered into the testing environment and simulations are carried out. The impact of each technology on transformer and cable loads is quantified and the effects of flexibility are investigated. It is found that uncontrolled use of heat pumps and electric vehicles present problems for the electricity network: market penetrations as low as 20% could cause transformer loads to reach values above 100%. Flexibility options however do exist and can be used effectively to limit network loads. Electric vehicles offer the most flexibility since the charging times are the easiest to control. Heating technologies have limited flexibility but improving household insulation and using the right thermostat settings can reduce network loads. Micro CHPs combine very well with other technologies and can be very effective at limiting the loads caused by both electric vehicles and heat pumps.","flexibility; electricity grid; electricity network; heat pumps; electric vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2011","Concrete is the most commonly used building material in our time. For every person on earth, more than one cubic meter of concrete is produced every year. Cement is the main feedstock for the production of concrete. Cement makes up about 15% of the mass of concrete. The consumption of concrete will grow in the coming decennia [2]. Beside these developments, there is another issue going on, the issue of recycling concrete - from demolition of buildings or from construction materials(C&DW). Therefore it is worthwhile to examine these material streams. The major part of the demolition waste is now used for the construction of new roads. The objective of this thesis is to recycle the cement, by the means of liberation and separation. The focus of the investigation will be on (pebble) milling. By performing milling experiments, XRF analysis and the determination of the particle sizes more insight is gained in the milling and liberation of cement (calcium). During the milling experiments, variables like speed of the mill, size of the pebbles, fill rate of the feed and temperatures were varied to investigate the influence of these variables. To back up the results some ESEM images were taken and a TGA in combination with mass spectrometry was performed. The main actions performed during the experiments are summarised in a flow sheet. Most of the results were as one would expect. But still some of the XRF analysis and TGA analyses have unexpected results. The milling experiments showed that pebble milling does cause size reduction of the concrete fines. It also showed that heating of the material is not worthwhile. The performed experiments provide a good basis for further research. From this thesis it can be concluded that milling with bigger pebbles (16-64mm) and great mill speed, improve the milling efficiency. And that the residence of the feed in the mill should be around five minutes","pebble milling; concrete fines; sieve","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Materials and Environment","",""

Although the Kamworks’ SHS is on the market for two years, the sales are much lower than expected. Kamworks has reasons to think that the value for money ratio is not high enough. Production, installation and maintenance should be made more efficient and effective in order to 1) bring down costs, 2) enable Kamworks to produce faster and 3) to enable Kamworks to sell their systems in more remote areas. The project is split up into four phases. In the Analysis Phase, a substantial part of the time is spent on research on a wide variety of subjects. Surveys and interviews are taken among existing and potential SHS customers, Kamworks employees, and Kamworks’ management. A context analysis, including research to Kamworks ltd., Cambodia, and the target group, has been carried out. And at last the climate and competition have been analysed. In the Design Phase, the results of the Analysis Phase have been used to develop five structural concepts. Design tools, like the Harris-profile, have been used to select the most viable concept. As the Fishtrap-model prescribes, the chosen structural concept served as the basis for the development of four formal concepts. Again a Harris-profile was used to choose the most viable formal concept. In the Detail Phase, the chosen formal concept has been worked out to a production ready product and in the Finalizing Phase, a prototype has been tested and the product design is evaluated. A result of this project is the new design of the Homebox, the main part of the SHS that contains the batteries, a charge controller and other components to connect the lights and external devices. The new Homebox design will be produced out of plastic injection moulded parts and aluminium profiles. These production methods allow for higher production speeds, a flexible design that can be used for the three system sizes, and a high quality product finish at relatively low investment costs. Another result is the design of a plug&play lighting system, which can be used to connect up to seven lights to the Homebox. The new lighting system is an improvement on the original lighting system, because it is less complex and it takes less time, to install in a house. The use of connectors and standard cables enables Kamworks to carry out more installations with less effort. The technical drawings are included with this report, but there are some hurdles in the road to the production of a quality product. Kamworks has to choose the appropriate manufactures of the plastics parts, the aluminium profiles and the lighting system cables. Kamworks has to make sure that the produced parts meet the quality criteria. Especially the fine tuning between the plastic parts and the aluminium profiles needs a good coordination between Kamworks and the manufactures.","solar; energy; cambodia; kamworks; sustainable; SHS; solarhomesystem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

One key characteristic of such landscapes is they are dynamic and always changing, with either water encroaching on the land or land building into the water. The challenge for cities in such locations is they must adapt to these ever changing environments if they are to survive. Over the past 300 years New Orleans has embraced the strategy of a war against water: trying with infrastructural might to keep water out by constantly building higher levees, bigger pumps, and stronger flood walls. But in 2005, Hurricane Katrina tragically proved the dire consequences of such an approach. The Urban Bayou explores the possible opportunities when creating a different relationship between the built and natural environments, one that uses water as an amenity and natural processes as an advantage; strategies that not only increase safety but also strengthen the identity and urban structure of the city.","building with nature; climate change; delta regions; ecosystems; living with water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism and Architecture","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","This study intends to develop a design method of adding more stories on existing building by using a case study of construction project in Leidschendam where 9-stories are to be added on existing 6-storey residential building. A low riser building is to be changed into multistory building. The state-of-art of the project was designed by the Engineering office of SmitWesterman and implemented by demolishing a section of the existing building where additional stories were constructed. The initial idea was to add 9-stories on existing 6 stories to form a structure of 15 story-high without demolition. Even though this idea was abandoned during implementation but it was forwarded to the University to make further research and formulate possible design alternatives. This study is about searching a proper alternative to be used when adding storey on existing building by using lightweight materials (steel structures) without demolishing the existing structures, which are not at their maturity time. This is a proper method of changing an existing low riser into a multistory building with minimum waste. Therefore, this technique can be used in highly built environment. In this study, the major issue to be solved is to know how an existing low riser building can be changed into a multistory building. This study would have a significant effect on already built residential areas whereby more homes can be built in extremely limited place without demolishing the existing buildings. The major issues are to know the construction method to be used for this particular project, integration of the old and the new structures and the structural system to be used. This study will only cover the structural design of superstructure and foundation. As the new and old structure serve the same function, their function must be integrated but their structures may not be fully integrated. 1. Integrated design: The capacity of existing building will be checked for both superstructure and foundation. If the existing structure shows to be able to carry some loads acting on new structure, it can be mainly used to help new structure in carrying vertical and lateral loads 2. Separated design: If the capacity of existing structure cannot carry load from additional structure, the new structure will be designed differently from the existing one. 3. Partially integrated: This can be implemented in case the old building presents weakness in some structural aspects. The existing foundation is used at 40% but it cannot be used by the new structure since its weight exceeds the capacity of the existing foundation and it is impossible to add more piles. The super structure was designed to take safely only the design loads; no more floors were considered The existing building is stiff in lateral direction because all its 7 axes are filled with walls. Adding stories on existing building is possible with their function being integrated. However, their structures should be semi-integrated; they should be laterally connected for stability but the routes of vertical forces should be separated; the existing building should be bridged. Therefore, the new structure should have its own foundation; Fundex piles were chosen since they are free from vibration. To minimize the weight and to cover the long spans, steel structures should be used. The old and new structure should have the same shape since the cantilevers bring complications, but in case they are unavoidable continuous beam and columns should be used. In this study, dynamic behavior, influence of new to told foundation, thermal and sound comfort were not covered, they should be undertaken in future studies.","adding floors on existing building; extending the existing low riser building into a multistory building; adding more stories on existing building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

In my vision a lineair citypark on top of the tunnel combined with dwellings and several public buildings will give the city a new impuls. By creating more leasure spaces in the public space the new park will not only be a route from north to south, but also a place where people can relax or come together to do outdoor activities. As part of the assignment I made a design for a new Museum that uses the current Bacinol2 building as entrance. The building can be seen as a complex with different building parts: The old building with office space and studio's, the new building with the museum and attached to that studiodwellings. The complex has a courtyard in the middle that connects all these buildingparts. It is a public courtyard that will be open 24/7 and can be seen as an introvert space with sculptures and plants. Here people can relax and take a step from the more busy city park. The museum houses all sorts of contemporary art. The most striking feature of the museum are the ""window boxes"" that give a view over the city. They act as orientation points on the route and give the feeling you are standing outside the building. The staircases are fully glazed and are positioned in the courtyard to also act as orientation points and give a view over the courtyard. The main theme of this project was therefor not only orientation, but also ""to see and be seen"".","Schieoevers; Delft; connect; orientation; museum; Bacinol 2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-20","Architecture","RMIT","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Project description: Living conditions and qualities have become some of the most important and long-standing social and economic issues in cities since the Industrial Revolution. More and more people have been going to cities to look for jobs, capital and different ways of life. Amsterdam is one of these destinations. Housings in the Netherlands were regulated and planned by the state in the first half of the 20th Century. Yet, since the 1980s, a lot of housing associations in the Netherlands which provide social rental housings have been privatized. The government also started promoting home ownership. Under the influence of Neoliberalism, free market was embraced and adopted to developed the economy. The relationship between housings and capital were interwoven and highly dependent on each other. More and more houses have been built and sold by private developers. However, they are mainly developing the housings for profits, not for the social life of the people and the neighbourhoods. A mismatch between the demand and supply of housings has then emerged, especially for the low-income groups with less capital. After the 2007 global financial crisis, the problems of housings were aggravated. The government no longer has capital to build social housings while there is an insufficient supply of housings of which the types are not provided by private developers either. This project tries to deal with the above mentioned issues with various strategies realized in a masterplan in the Amsterdam North. It is a masterplan providing affordable housings for people to rent and purchase, and at the same time generate capital for the housing associations for the maintenance of the old social housings and future development. The hierarchy of networks, programmes and density of the site context were taken into consideration for the implementation of the project. Mixed programmes of residential, public and commerical uses are employed to enhance the social life in the neighbourhoods. A higher density is proposed to meet the critical mass of having local scale businesses. The housing units are configured so that they are either facing south-east and north-west, with the afternoon sunlight and the winter monsoon coming mainly from south-west. On a building level, double-storey flats are provided with low-cost construction. The ground floor is elevated to provide a shaded semi-open space for people to rest and stay during harsh weather. This space is linked to the atrium where cross ventilation is possible for the flats. Split floors are used to foster the physical communication of residents living on different floors. The roof of the building is allocated to the short-stay housing, for students and artists, built with light weight construction. The roof is stepping down as a gesture to make relation to the activities on the ground.","modes of development; Amsterdam North; affordable housings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Delft School of Design (DSD)","","Urban Asymmetries - Amsterdam","",""

The survey took place in the city Odessa. In this city I was struck by the different viewpoints and speeds when moving given by the different modes of transport. I compared this fragmented way of experiencing the space with the Cubism of Picasso. In his paintings multiple viewpoints are composed to one painting. The focus is not on a static experience of space, as with the perspective, instead he focusses on time and movement. Movement through space was the key of this design. Both in the dealing with the context as in the organization of the building itself. From inside the building several fragments of the context are framed, some more close up, some more as an overview. Some framed from a high point of view, some from a low point of view. With architectural elements the speed of the visitor is guided. For instance a steep stairs or a gentle slope.

The factor analysis (FA) model is used to model the data. In order to make the theory applicable in telecommunication and radio astronomy, the model is extended to the case of complex numbers. The necessary mathematical tools for estimation, detection and performance analysis are derived. The maximum likelihood estimator for the FA model in the case of proper complex Gaussian distributed noise and signals is given. Two different iterative algorithms for finding the MLE of the model parameters are presented. The necessary iteration steps for an alternating least squares algorithm are also presented. The Cramer–Rao bound for the FA model is found and the convergence of the estimated parameters to this bound are illustrated using simulations. The improved performance of some popular algorithms like ESPRIT and spatial filtering have been demonstrated using computer simulations. A general likelihood ratio test is presented as a tool to test the correctness of the estimated parameters. An especial case of this test is presented as a constant false alarm detector. This thesis is an initial attempt for developing the factor analysis as a tool for signal processing.

The jump-cut is originally a film editing tool to (un)relate multiple events in a scene, whereas the notion of re-orientation plays an important role. In space it has been interpreted as the movement form one point to the other, being cut by different (un)related scenes programmatically, geometrically and visually. The gridded city centre of Odessa contains two urban phenomena. One is the top-down urban preservation of classical, western-European facades. This type of façadism creates ornamental and symbolic boulevards in the linear network of the grid, being completely detached from its interior and back side. The other phenomena is, a Soviet-period driven, development of the courtyards on the inner side of the grid blocks. Expropriation, intensification of program and people, and deterioration followed each other towards a complex geometrical situation, a loss of façades diminishing the border between interior and exterior, and unexpected visual relationships. The design for the EU-consulate, is based on discussing the surface which divides two spaces, either interior and exterior, or both. The jump-cut takes place by the act of making the dividing surface spatial and programmatically relating and un-relating scenes. The operation which has been used is voronoi on an individual cell-based logic. The operation shifts the six surfaces of a volume (one cell), according to the position the central point. The difference of the minimum shift and maximum shift causes the interior space (the minimum cell) and the in-between space (the edge). Because the operation takes place on all individual volumes, some volumes are shifting away from each other, others are interwoven. This procedure makes it possible to adjust the shift according to the necessary relationships with the neighboring volumes. Besides a geometrical relation, the operation also generates visual relations by the making of openings. Because it works in three dimensions, the language in section and plan is identical. The EU-consulate, a test case for the EEAS (European External Action Service), has been exploited in its diversity of types of program and participants; diplomatic and ceremonial, providing, controlling and personal. The project gives a reading of this programmatic complexity through its architecture.","jump-cut; voronoi; shift; in-between; facadism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Bouwkunde","","Border Conditions","",""

(mentor)","2011","Wink is a creative company that works on assignments given from external firms (mainly focused on fashion and product goods), to design and produce events and environments. The company is expert in providing experiences to its clients, by merging art and branding. Lifestyle, technology, creativity and user involvement are its key ingredient to boost brands. Besides a strong impact and a deep sense of intuition in both the production and the creative part, Wink represents an inspiring platform of skilful artists and designers. However, Wink lacks a tangible identity, to express its benefits and values. In every Wink project, values are co-created with the users, because these values are experienced and determined by the users themselves. So, when they consummate Wink’s service (during events), they make it part of their lives, they exchange it and it becomes part of their memory. This meaningful experience is the core value the company stands for. Meanings allow users to connect actions, words, emotions, objects, and spaces. The overall result of these factors converges in people’s mind into a meaningful experience. The scope of the project is to reconnect the current company’s status with its original driving force, and design a solution to communicate it to the stakeholders. This will provide a support to reveal the company’s core mission and values, and facilitate both the internal and external processes. The end result is a brand manifestation: a lightning system implemented in the creative department, with lamps that create a surrounding that supports the generation of ideas, and inspires the freedom of creative’s expression: the Ultimate Wink Experience can be activated during brainstorming sessions, presentation meetings with clients, or in the introduction phase of new employees in the company, to communicate the mission: the strong philosophy that leads the company to behave with certain norms.","branding; branding; events; decoration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-06-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation and management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Vanstiphout, W.A.J. (mentor); Bantal, S. (mentor)","2011","The garden of delights and a panopticon prison are very similar actually: being inside walls, being protected, is central. Many archaic ideas of happiness are depicted in enclosed safe spaces. That idea presupposes that the outside is a place of danger and corruption and the inside is safe and good, also morally good, where virtue resides and vice is left outside. The typology of a panopticon implies the creation of a new world in which it is assumed that human nature can be engineered, perfected or corrupted. The panopticon, as a building, is an instrument of reformation. A piece of architecture with such claims is unique and too good for an architect not to have a peak into a scary reality, a peak at what it would be like if it was in his hands to transform human beings with such disciplinary mechanisms. How to tune the prison so that it becomes its opposite, a space of selfgovernance and responsibility, of freedom, by tweaking the architecture of a panopticon? If a prison can have people bound, and under permanent surveillance and oppressed, can we design a building with sovereign users? From being under control to being in control. The new building excavates under the center of the main tower, thereby literally blinding the all-seeing eye of the panopticon. It brings light in and darkness out by inserting light wells in the digged out spaces. It introduces an omnipresent thin column grid which breaks the binary system of controllers versus controlled to introduce homogeneity, autonomy and, eventually, responsibility. That is achieved with the program, an academy of builders who work interdisciplinary towards a rational industry.","the good life; interdisciplinarity; individual responsability; eudaimonia; quality of life; panopticon; architecture industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-20","Architecture","Urbanism","","Design as Politics","",""

(mentor); Van Nes, A. (mentor); Meijers, W.L.E.C. (mentor)","2011","Africa has the potential to be the world's breadbasket, however the continent's fundamental problem is that it has invested relatively little in agriculture and in developing its rural infrastructure. Ghana (West-Africa) is no exception to this. Ghana's Northern Region is identified as breadbasket area, but sufficient transportation lacks. Therefore the Ghanaian Government has planned to rehabilitate its railway system and extend it to the rural north, dispersing economic activities and thus leveling the uneven spread of development within the country. This thesis shows how to strategically implement the railway system in the existing urban fabric of Ghanaian cities. Three sets of guidelines are set up as a practical framework for the determination of the railway alignment and the determination of the location of freight station(s) and passenger station(s). They are tested through a proposal for the implementation of a railway system in Tamale (the capital of Ghana's Northern Region) and they can be used as 'toolbox' for the other Ghanaian cities on eve of the railway implementation. The proposal for Tamale is processed through: 1. A city map with the alignment of the railroad and the location of the freight station and passenger station (based on the set of guidelines). 2. A strategic plan to embed the railway system in the existing city and to tackle existing spatial problems of Tamale. 3. An urban design for the station area to illustrate the strategic plan.","Africa; Northern Ghana; Tamale; implementation of a railway system; existing urban fabric; railway alignment; station location; impact of railways; transportation; agriculture; breadbasket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Studio Ghana","",""

For each incoming patent application, they first extract a subset of possibly relevant patents through keyword-based search queries. These results are summarized in long lists, which provide only minimal information on each patent. To immediately determine whether a patent is possibly relevant or not, each patent needs closer examination by opening it and scanning through its content, including drawings. For large result lists, this is a time consuming and strenuous job in the current user interface. In this work, we explore the applicability of novel information visualization techniques and the use of touch-based interactions. Our findings are included in the prototype application TouchPat, a touch-based zoomable user interface for exploring large patent collections. TouchPat provides an overview of a patent collection up to 1000 patents, and allows examiners to use multi-touch interactions to explore and process it. To summarize the information, each patent is visualized with a symbolic thumbnail representation. We use semantic zooming to adapt the amount of meta information for each zooming level and make optimal use of the available space. This thesis describes the design and development approach of the TouchPat prototype application, the individual visualization and interaction techniques used and its evaluation with the patent experts. TouchPat is well received with patent experts, and its user interface experience encourages further improvement in the speed and accuracy of the patent examination process.","ZUI; Touch-Based Interactions; Semantic Zooming; TouchPat; Patents; Multi-Touch; Visualization; Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics","","","",""

The phenomena of the infrastructural lines in between the city and its harbor and the actual encounters of the city towards the harbor gave an more actualized subject to research. The actual routes at the level of approach, transition, crossing and a parallel projection formed the basic elements of my mappings. The relations in these areas reflected upon the routes were mapped each by a different approach. These mappings related to my theoretical essay by subscribing a way of thinking towards new architectural space and a technique to create these spaces by the act of folding and an iterative process. By pointing out new ‘set of virtual movements’ by using 4 existing precedent locations. The set of virtual movements became limited to one act, the act of folding. This act became the act of actualizing abstract thoughts and interests into architectural space. During an iterative process of folding, relating unrelated elements, order and disorder a program brief full of tension and complexity, the program – dog shelter, hotel, wellness, rabies clinic – were combined into a mixture of new programmatic and social interactions. By the use of a digitalized act of folding, a feedback loop within the iterative process and even more at the level of connecting sections the complexity of the building and its program became at a level where I was able to design architectural space.","border conditions; Odessa; architecture; folding; mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-02","Architecture","Architecture","","Border Conditions Odessa","",""

In this thesis we present a platform for wireless on-board spacecraft sensor networks with focus on the sensors that bring high 'added value' to existing space systems while becoming wireless. A novel multi-gateway architecture that uses dual hardware redundancy is proposed in this thesis. The concept of an autonomous (self-describing) modular sensor node (i.e. exchangeable sensors and power sources) is investigated and a general provision is made for future implementations. Electronic Datasheets (EDS) are considered as a way to allow fast self-reconfiguration of the sensor node and its energy device. Next, a survey on commercial off-the-shelf components (COTS) wireless sensor network hardware and protocols is conducted. A test with a Zigbee-based gateway switchover is performed and its impact on the wireless communication is investigated with or without check pointing. The results of this thesis show that current wireless sensor network systems can be adapted for several space-borne applications and can significantly shorten integration-test time (during spacecraft assembly) with the help of a modular based sensor system. Additionally, the limitations and future directions are discussed to provide possible future implementations of the next generation wireless sensor networks for intra-spacecraft applications.","fault-tolerance; 802.15.4; WSN; redundancy; intra-spacecraft; Wireless Sensor; platform; standards-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Høyland, K.V. (mentor)","2011","Analytical and numerical analysis of laboratory-scale shear box experiments on ice rubble have been performed. The experiments were done at NTNU in 2010 (Serré et al., 2011 and Repetto and Høyland, 2011). Three phases in the force-time history of the tests were identified (similar to what Serré et al., 2011 did). The first phase lasted about 2 seconds (compared to 6 seconds in Serré et al., 2011) and ended with a shift in the force-time gradient corresponding to plastic behaviour. Phase one was studied numerically while phase two and three were analysed conceptually. The experiments were done with different vertical confinement and different submersion times, altogether 14 individual tests were carried out. Each combination of parameters (initial and boundary conditions) was repeated three times. There was a large difference within the three tests with the same initial and boundary conditions. Mostly 2 tests were similar, while one test was different. The use of Hellmann’s (1984) definition of 3 phases in shear box testing cannot directly be used to analysis these tests, as the boundary conditions were different. Hellmann had zero displacement perpendicular to the moving piston, while Serré et al. (2011) had constant pressure. The friction angle was derived from phase three assuming that all freeze-bonds were broken and that the rubble was essentially without cohesion. The test with 20 hours (long) submersion times had lower friction angle (9? to 31?) than the ones with 10 minutes (short) submersion times (33? to 74?). This derivation is only indicative, but suggests that the submersion time govern the material properties. Phase 1 was studied numerically with the use of a continuum finite element model with Lagrange method (ABAQUS/Standard 6.10-2). An elastic-perfect plastic model with Drucker-Prager material model was applied, and the three most important material parameters, namely Young modulus, cohesion and friction angle were the main focus. These three were retrieved by trial and error method so as to match the experimental results. Young modulus give the initial slope of the force-time curve, while DP model cohesion and friction angle determine when the yielding points occurred and the force at that moment. So by carrying out numerical simulation, the values of Young modulus for different situations were given and a series pairs of cohesion and friction angle in DP model were given as well so as to match the experiment results. The long submersion times had lower Young modulus (0.9 MPa) than the short submersion times gave (2-4.5 MPa). But which pair of cohesion and friction angle that was the most suitable for the ice rubble material in nature could not be derived from the present study. The numerical simulation showed that the crack patterns predicted by numerical simulation were more or less the same as the ones observed. The question on whether or not a cap hardening model should be used to simulate the primary phase was also discussed and only in the Extra_High_Short test, a cap model is needed. Scaling problems were discussed by assuming that Froude scaling law could be used and it is found that the cohesion after scaling up to full-scale was larger than two recent studies: one is model-scale punch tests done by Serré (2010), another is full-scale punch tests done by Heinonen (2004). The results of this thesis could provide a better understanding for the material properties of freeze-bonds and be beneficial for future study in this field. The conceptual analysis of phase two and three showed that there were some shortcomings in the experiment setup and based on this, some improvement of the experiment equipment and suggestions were given.","ice rubble; finite element modelling; Drucker-Prager model; shear box experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

Today uneven developments dominate in Mexico City Metropolitan Area, a result of a Neoliberal urbanization process. The current urban reality is the result of the unbalanced power relations between the city makers that priorities the city core and the city dwellers that are pushed into urban poverty towards peripheral areas. Those areas are not perceived as part of the city and therefore experience water related problems: flooding and lack of basic services such as safe water supply and sanitation. The Neoliberal policies in the urban process had emphasized the class polarization of the citizens. Valle de Chalco Solidaridad at the south-east periphery of the city is a fine example of a marginalized society in struggle. Moreover, the rapid population growth has led human interventions to affect natural processes and contribute to the growing destruction of natural ecosystems. The story of the natural ecosystems coevolves with the story of the development of Mexico City’s settlement. The human story intersects with that of nature. Until today humans had gain at the expense of nature, which moves ineluctably towards ecological disequilibrium. Current risks of flooding and fresh water scarcity that Mexico City Metropolitan Area is facing will increase if the denial for interaction between the city and water continues. A city that once was an island in complete synergism with water needs to learn how to live with it again and create opportunities from the interaction with it. The desirable is a win-win situation in which harmony between humans and their natural environment is re-established.","water challenges; informal settlements; sustainable water management; urban quality; vulnerability; resilience; water sensitive urban design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","MSc Spatial Planning and Urban Design - [TISD] Technology in Sustainable Development Specialization","",""

There are many actors in the area of the operation, military as well as non-military, friendly and non-friendly. Combined with personnel reductions this creates the need for a flexible and multifunctional military organisation. In an organisation where less people need to do more it is very important to utilise the skills of every individual. Utilising those skills will create a “power to the edge” structured organisation where decision making is also done at lower levels. This results in groups in the field becoming more autonomous. For autonomous groups to be able to make decisions there is a need to facilitate anticipation and increase efficiency. To reach these goals it is important that a group has a good situational awareness. Providing a person with not only information directly addressed to him, but also with information that was sent to others, could increase situational awareness. Autonomous groups could then be better able to anticipate on future events and make better decisions. However, to prevent information overload a relevance system determines if a message is also relevant by calculating a relevance score for every user. The main research question is how the process of transmitting information can be automated and how this can facilitate anticipation and increase efficiency. This question was researched as a bachelor project for Computer Science at TU Delft. The project was part of the Smart Operations programme at TNO. The execution of the bachelor project was carried out using the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) methodology. For a large part this methodology has determined how the project was executed in different phases. In the implemented system, each user can use an application to view the messages that are relevant for him. Latent Semantic Indexing was used for the determination of relevance based on message content, while a fuzzy expert system was used for the overall determination of relevance, which was also based on message metadata. A pilot was conducted with a specialist of the Royal Netherlands Navy. A dynamic scenario was simulated and the system determined the relevance for all messages in the scenario and showed the expert a message list ordered by the relevance. The expert indicated that the developed system has the potential to assist in facilitating anticipation and increase efficiency. He also provided recommendations to improve the current system. The recommendation by the expert was to distinguish separate different message types, for example situational reports and planning messages. Next to this recommendation of the expert we also came to our own recommendations. The first recommendation is to obtain a better dataset for the pilot. The current dataset contained few messages from the environment other than the command center. Furthermore some system components to simulate a scenario are not implemented yet. To do a better test it would be useful to implement a Mission Task Manager, Role Manager and Position Emulator.","relevance determination; latent semantic indexing; situational awareness; military missions; Sesame database; RDF; fuzzy expert system","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Technische Informatica","","","",""

This report has three parts: i) a qualitatively assessment of diffraction effects carried out with SWAN; ii) a comparison between SWAN (phase averaged wave model) and SWASH (phase resolving model) results, regarding refraction and diffraction effects; and ii) a systematic analysis of the results in SWAN on several wave conditions and a few access channel geometries (slopes). SWASH is used to test SWAN capabilities in an environment where significant refraction and diffraction is expected. The results of the comparison are analyzed and recommendations for future comparison are presented. The systematic analysis of conditions provides information about performance of SWAN and its ability to correctly represent physical phenomena particularly regarding refraction and diffraction. Additionally, recommendations for wave propagation analysis for entrance channels are presented. Finally, based on the results, engineering recommendations and considerations are presented regarding operations of ports and the design of related structures such as breakwaters.","access channel; wave propagation; diffraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

In combination with the economic crisis, the climate change and the more demanding end users, this demands a change in the way parties cooperate. Supply chain integration is used as a method to eliminate the problems that exist in the traditional collaboration. However, most supply chain integrations are still premature and there is insufficient information about what the experiences of the experts are regarding successes and problems related to the FLOTIQ aspects. These FLOTIQ aspects stand for Finance, Learning, Organization, Time, Information and Quality. This research combines and compares information of literature with the experiences of practitioners via a questionnaire and case study research. The questionnaire analyzed two populations: respondents with and with no experience in order to determine ‘which experiences do experts in supply chain integration have regarding successes and problems related to the FLOTIQ management aspects?’. For both successes and problems, the experts have different experiences per aspect. The most common successes are: transparency, client satisfaction and efficiency. The most frequent problems are: bad communication, unclear goals and expectations and personal gain first. Successes are repeated in two thirds of the time, but so are the problem, leading to unnecessary insufficiencies. Parties are making some improvements in their process, but there is no clear distinction between the respondent with and with no experience, which strongly gives the impression that parties are conduction an upgrade of a building team, instead of performing supply chain integration. The most relevant recommendations is to have horizontal and vertical communication between colleagues, to monitor and evaluate the project based on preset KPi’s and to actively learn from the information derived from these evaluations.","Ketensamenwerken; Ervaringen; GLOTIK; Supply chain integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-30","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design and Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Blijlevens, J. (mentor); Van Puffelen, S. (mentor)","2011","Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world and the number of diabetes patients is only increasing. There are 284 milion patients world wide right now and it is estimated by the International Diabetes Federation that this number will rise with 50% to 438 milion in 20 years time. Diabetes is a system disease that is caused by lack of insuline or by insuline intolerance of the body. The main treatment of diabetes is done by medicine, a healthy diet and enough physical exercise. But medicine, a healthy diet and physical exercise are not enough to avoid the many possible complications that frequently occur at diabetes. The most common complications that come with diabetes are: accelerated arterosclerose, retinopathy, nephropaty, neuropathy, gastrointestinal problems, erectionproblems, dementia, skin problems and foot problems. Most of these complications happen inside the body and are hard to treat without medicine, but a few happen on the outside of the body, like dry skin, footproblems, oral problems and some eyeproblems and can be treated with self-care products. Though for most prob are a few products available that are also suited for diabetes patients, there is no product line that is especially developed for diabetes patients and covers more problems within one product line. BioClin is a company that focuses on a bio-active concept. They develop (para)pharmaceutical self-care product and remedies. The bio-active concept concept focuses on supporting and activating the natural repair mechanism of the ectodermal tissue (skin and mucosa). BioClin has noticed the the opportunity of the inmature and growing market of self-care products for diabetes patients and wants to develop a product line of self-care products for diabetes patients. The most important ingredient of the self-care products will be the patented bio-active polysaccharide 2QR. 2QR is a polysaccharide extracted from a plant and avoids harmful bacteria to do any damage. To determine what products should be in the new product line research has been done. This research consisted out of desk research, customers research and expert research. The result of this research was that some of the initial products BioClin suggested for the product line three deleted and some new products were added to the product line. One of the foot care products still needed an applicator. The foam has to be incontact with the skin for about ten to fifteen minutes. The foam changes to a fluid in this time and if applied to the skin in this way will create a mess. Therefore the product needs an applicator. The result of this design proces is an applicator the will do the job properly and probably will be used for the application of other foot products of other manufacturers as well. After determination of the product for the product line and the development of the foot care applicator, the products have to be put on the market and a marketing plan is needed. For this marketingplan the input of the customer research was used, but additional research at experts was necessary. The products for the product line were already determined, but the price of the products still needed to be figured out. Most prices were estimated well by BioClin, but some deviated a lot with the opinion of experts, most of the time BioClin could ask more for the products then estimated. The retail channels and the promotion for the products were explored as well with some very interesting results. BioClin has to introduce the product in the spring or in the fall because people are the most busy with their health in these periods of the year. Because BioClin wants to introduce the products as soon as possible, they will initially introduce only a few of the products of the product line. Introducing the other products as line extensions later on has some advantages: The product line will get attention again because of the new products and they have some extra time to develop the other products.","diabetes; self-care products","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2011","Today’s readers want a personal, filtered text abstract that gives an objective insight in a book, instead of the current subjective blurb on a book backs. The abstract’s aim, is to analyze a book on a semantic level, showing more than just an analytic visualization of text. A semantic visual text abstract interprets text and returns a filtered user-specific view on a book. To analyze text the field of subjectivity analysis provides several tools. The semantic orientation of phrases can be defined by a statistical approach called SO-PMI-IR (Semantic Orientation Pointwise Mutual Information Information Retrieval). This algorithm categorized words on a (continuous) positive-negative scale. This semantic orientation analysis, is performed on the book’s most important phrases. These phrases are defined by the TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) keywords of a book. TF-IDF is a popular tool for extracting the most important and unique words from a book. This combination of unique book information and semantic orientation provide a measure for comparing books on content. Apart from a glimpse of a book’s content, readers prefer an insight in what other readers think about the book. Reviews are a perfect platform to measure this popularity. Reviews are placed over time, have a rating and a certain usefulness towards the reader itself. This usefulness is defined by creating user profiles. Neighboring users (people with similar reading taste) are likely to produce more useful reviews, compared to users that differ a lot with a reader’s personal preference. A last measure within a semantic visual text abstract will define the amount a book fits a reader’s taste, also know as a recommendation. This is done by using these pervious described usefulness values and calculate its average. A readers personal average is therefore not based on all the data but on a selected neighboring group. This means the result is always user specific, as these groups and profiles always differ. The final design of the semantic visual text abstract, uses these three blocks (book contents, reviews & recommendation) to create a visual abstract of a book. The final visualization consists out of two layers, the visual layer and the underlying (textual) content layer. The first layer’s purpose is to make quick comparison possible whereas the second layers provides the much desired objective in-depth information. In the end, a semantic visual text abstract provides readers with an objective visual tool that offers a look in a book’s content and context, helps them compare books mutually and last but not least makes the decision process a little bit easier.","data visualization; semantics; book abstract","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Under this perspective, my project examines how a single building can act as an urban design by taking the specific urbanistic gesture in the situation that urban development has been traditionally chaotic and less planned in the absence of an over-all urbanistic plan, Deurne in Antwerp. So I seek the value which among isolated urban fragments, a public building should acquire meaningful urban configuration by putting a stimulus for recombining urban fablic. In the process of the project, I propose on urban scale to reorganize the urban fabric for revitalizing the public spaces in local communities. It was inspired by the narrow alley which people use narrow alleys as an urban livingroom sharing with neighborhoods. By each houses’ household items coming out of houses, some of them are used as a public bench for meeting neighbors and those are used as expression tools of local community by various ways of decoration or gardening in front of each houses. If we see the condition which they can stay with feeling comfortable in the space of alley, one of factors is related to good human scale which is comprised of appropriate height and width of surrounding buildings and proper enclosed space. That is to say that those alleys are working as a lively well-used public space for the local society autonomically within the given environment. Such the urbanistic proposal is continued to architectural proposal on our site, Rodekruisplein. On architectural proposal, after analyzing characteristics of existing urban spaces near site, I could conclude that surrounding elements are recognized as urban islands fragmented. It is judged that this is the reason of retired atmosphere for pedestrian and residual exterior spaces are commonly just being used for the movement or parking of cars. Under this condition, as the proposal on urban scale reorganized the urban fabric for providing various levels of public spaces in good quality, in same context I intend new public spaces made for reintegrating surrounding objects. And also on the visual level of pedestrian in the public space, it is examined consistently that the space has appropriate human scale and good quality of space in connection with surrounding context. In addition, it continues to the composition of interior spaces in same attitude.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-08","Architecture","Architecture","","Building Typology(Hybrid Building)","",""

Songkhla lagoon is the largest lagoonal water resource in Thailand and Southeast Asia. The lagoon is a combined freshwater and estuarine complex of high productivity which represents an extraordinary combination of environmental resources believed to be unique in the region. Climate change, as a response to increased greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, is now a widely accepted phenomenon. Sea level rise, temperature, precipitation, and storminess are expected to change significantly with global climate change and to impact coastal lagoons. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are still not very clear. The general objective of the research is to determine the climate change impacts on mixing and circulation at Songkhla lagoon, Thailand. To archive this objective the lagoon was be modeled with Delft 3D, a model developed by Deltares. After the verification with the available data for the region, different scenarios were created to represent the possible changes in mean sea level and riverflow due to global warming. Then, these results were compared to the current conditions to determine the main changes in mixing and circulation in this coastal lagoon. The results suggest an increase in water velocities of the inlet in future scenarios and a decrease of flushing time. Salinity and stratification showed more complex changes in futures scenarios.","coastal lagoon; climate change; hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The research started from giving the definition of cultural identity in Beijing inner city and investigate current situtaion for these constituent elements.I have stated that those elements are under threats under market oriented development, both of the spatial and social quality are declined. Cultural identity has been evicting from historic city core under modernization and marketization. Then my analysis focus on finding out the conflict between preserve historic identity in city center and modernization under influence of market. Strategy goal was to activating cultural identity and strengthen urban vitality. Meanwhile, social mix and vitality will be rehabilitated.Economic sustained urban regeneration is also a key point in Beijing inner city regeneration, it is inversgated in the graduation project as well. As most of the house property in Beijing inner city are belonging to government, it gives the advantage for me to propose a new strategy for government to regenerate historic districts. The whole process of regeneration can be seen as a process of urban management. Instead of giving all the redevelopment to market, new housing institution can be set up to do the management under government supervision.","urban regeneration; historic districts; cultural identity; Beijing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-27","Architecture","Urbanism","","Master of Urbanism","",""

(mentor); Veer, F.A. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Vákár, L.I. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor)","2011","In the world of structural engineering glass is an innovative material. Compared to other conventional structural materials like concrete, steel and timber, it is especially the transparency property that makes it a valued material. Due to the increasing demand for transparency in contemporary architecture, much more structural components as beams, plates, portals and columns are developed in glass. Besides the transparency property, the brittleness of glass makes it essentially an unsafe structural material as the residual capacity is limited. Therefore, the structural glass column is still in its early phases of development. As architects and clients, in general, do not like columns, they are said to block the view and stand in the way. Engineers need to add columns to buildings to provide support. These conflicting desires can be solved by developing a more attractive column, a glass column. The aim of this research project was to focus on further knowledge and understanding of the structural design aspects specifically related to structural glass columns and, on the basis of these findings, to design a glass column as a structural element in a pavilion. The considered slender columns were assembled from rectangular monolithic flat glass plates into different configurations. An exploratory study to the design aspects of glass columns was performed by doing experiments. One-metre-high glass columns were assembled from glass plates 8 millimetres thick, 100 millimetres wide and 1000 millimetres long and glued with a two-component adhesive based on epoxy resin (Araldite 2000 PLUS 2013) into five different configurations. These columns were compressed by a test bench with felt as the interlayer material to distribute the stresses uniformly over the cross-sectional area. A thorough analysis of the columns and their structural behaviour resulted in four design aspects that should be considered in the design process of a structural glass column: - a difference in the vertical position between the assembled glass plates; - susceptibility to peak stresses at the edges of the glass column; - the stiffness properties of the glue; - imperfections like holes and scratches. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed to study two of the considered design aspects. The effect of a difference in the vertical position between the assembled glass plates (which results in protruding edges) and the stiffness properties of the glue on the stress development in the glass were studied. Another series of experiments was performed to study the effect of several design options on the load bearing capacity of the column. The experiments revealed that, among others, avoiding the chance of uneven loading due to a difference in the vertical position between the glass plates and applying an adhesive with low stiffness results in more uniformly distribution of the stresses over the glass column. Finally, the findings of the experimental and numerical investigations were integrated into the structural design of a glass column for a pavilion. The preliminary design of a pavilion, which consists of ten columns, served as a context for the structural glass columns (each four metres high). Two main aspects were distinguished in the design process of the column: the boundary connection system and the related cross-section. Finally, a safety concept was developed for the monolithic glass column by applying an outer layer of safety glazing around the structural glass column. To conclude, from this research it is found that different design aspects play an important role in the bearing capacity of slender glass columns assembled from rectangular monolithic flat glass plates. On the basis of the experimental and numerical results the most relevant aspects related to designing a structural glass column were listed in the report.","glass; column; transparency; safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","SDL","",""

(contributor)","2011","The general flow pattern of an open channel flow, downstream of a width restriction by two artificial dams, is analysed. A physical Froude-scaled model, under hydraulic rough conditions, with a significant large Reynolds number is used to ensure turbulent flow. Upstream of the dams the flow is uniform in transverse direction, in between and downstream of the narrow part a jet is formed. On both sides of the jet large eddies are formed bounded by the wall, the jet and the dams. Due to the large velocity gradient in transverse direction a mixing layer develops at both sides of the jet. The width of the mixing layer, as expected, grows with the downstream distance and exceeds the water depth. 2D structures are clearly visible by injecting dye. In the mixing layer besides the macro time and spatial scales, the small Taylor and Kolmogorov scales are present. Whereas the macro scales are well represented in the measured data, the small scales are impossible to mark due to limitations of the Doppler device. When there is initial no net momentum in transverse direction present the jet is expected to appear symmetrical. However the jet is aligned to one of the sides every time the model starts to run. The preference for one or the other side seems to be random and cannot be related to momentum in transverse direction in between the dams. During measurements the position of the jet is stationary. The fixed position of the jet during measurements can be related to the Coand? effect. When the flow is disturbed and transverse momentum is added to the upstream flow, the jet can be deflected. The position of the jet and the evolving mixing layers can be related very well to the measured velocities upstream. Due to the limitations of the used momentum balance equation and use of the mean velocity in the bottom friction calculation the measured head loss is large compared to the calculated dissipative terms (bottom friction and Carnot loss).","turbulence; jet; shallow water; mixing layer","en","student report","","","","","","","","2011-07-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","","Additional Thesis","",""

The underwater acoustic channel is a very difficult medium for wireless communications and is subject to severe multipath and Doppler effects. It is possible that each multipath component may have a unique delay and Doppler shift, so called multi-scale/multi-lag channels. This is at present a limiting factor for wireless communications underwater. At the moment always a single Doppler rate is assumed which converts to a narrowband system when re-sampled. In this report a receiver is introduced which can remove the effects of multipath and Doppler where the novelty lies in the fact that it is especially designed for a multi-scale/multi-lag channel. This is done by introducing equalizers followed by channel estimation which are both designed for a multi-scale/multi-lag channel. The designed receiver shows promising results and is able to recover the original transmitted symbols according to the simulations.","Underwater wireless communications; acoustic; multi-lag/multi-scale channels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Signal Proccessing for the Communications","",""

(mentor); Jimenez, J.A. (mentor)","2011","Natural and man made embayment beaches are a common feature along the Catalan coast. Many of these embayment beaches have experience changes in shoreline position jeopardizing the protective and recreational functions of the beach. Therefore, an understanding of the morphological variability of this system is needed in order to facilitate an effective and sustainable coastal zone management. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of: 1) study the shoreline evolution of the Catalan coast, 2) determine medium term oscillation and the forcing mechanisms governing this process by means of a theoretical model and 3) evaluate the frequency of the theoretical model using the last 7 years of wave data. Data from nine sandy beaches along the Catalan coast consisted on previously define digitalized coastlines from the Environmental Ministry, the Cartographic Institute of Catalonia and satellite images from Google Earth. Results from the shoreline evolution showed that the embayed beaches of Catalonia presented a stable behavior, beaches with the same morphology followed a same trend in the stability test propose by Hsu, 1989. The results of beach mobility showed a non-uniform behavior of the sub-aerial beach width within a beach and along the Catalonian coast. The mayor difference between beaches was due to the orientation of the shoreline, the beach type and the exposure to wave conditions. Embayed beaches also exhibited a wide degree of beach rotation. Beaches with similar morphology show similar degrees of rotation. A theoretical model of the main configurations observed during the study period has been developed for each beach. Results showed that exposed beaches presented an anticlockwise, quasi-uniform and clockwise configuration, while semi-exposed beaches only show a higher anticlockwise and a lower anticlockwise configuration. In the analysis of wave forces on the embayment, it has been observed that wave direction was the primary forcing mechanism that generated changes in beach configuration (e.g. beach rotation), however the combination of wave height, period and direction where the responsible of the response time of the beach to a new configuration. The percentage of occurrence of the wave climate during 2001 to 2007 suggested that some beaches have tendency towards one configuration, in most cases to a higher anticlockwise rotation. Differences between beaches can be attributed to the shelter nature of the beach, the orientation and the effect of the natural or man made headland.","embayed beach; shoreline position; beach mobility; beach rotation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Timmer, R. (mentor)","2011","The goal of this study is to improve design support for designers at Philips Design. Philips Design is organized to be completely ‘people centric’: their products fully aim to fulfill user needs and wishes. To achieve this, the employees are supported by the High Design Process. It enables them to do people centric innovation for the Business. This study is ‘designer centric’; it aims to derive the needs and experiences of the designers based on a theoretical model and a phenomenological study. The findings of this study show that improving support for designers will not be achieved by improving the High Design Process, but rather by improving the contextual support. Based on these findings, six opportunities for Philips Design are devised amongst which improving knowledge sharing is the most beneficial in the context of this project. Knowledge sharing is in fact a coupled action of sending (answering) and receiving (asking), if one of two fails, sharing fails. In a collaborative workshop the designers indicated that the two main barriers for sending are motivational of nature: there is no passion for sharing; there is no clear reward system for sharing. The two most important barriers for receiving are operational: it is difficult to know who knows what; there is not enough time to engage in sharing. To tackle these four barriers both motivational and operational, knowledge sharing should become embedded in the ways of working: the Philips Design sharing culture needs to change. To change the knowledge sharing culture, an eight step roadmap is designed which builds on the employees daily routines, on existing solutions and on personal relationships. The roadmap introduces small steps that together will nudge the existing mentality into a knowledge sharing culture. The first two steps of this roadmap introduce small tweaks of fully embraced technology within Philips Design. These steps have been further developed to an operational level to enable testing. The test indicates that the end users perceive the solutions to be a helpful and – more important so – seem to like implementing them. The participants’ suggestions are leveraged into a redesign, further enhancing the efficiency and usability. Philips Design is working hard to implement knowledge management into the organization in the near future. The solutions posed for knowledge sharing in this project contribute to this activity and strengthen the overall proposition. Interest is shown by key stakeholders for knowledge management deployment, to implement certain solutions of this project in the Philips Design organization.","Knowledge; Sharing; Management; Design; Thinking; Methodology; People centric; Organizational culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-23","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM - DM","","master strategic product design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Areas outside the primary flood defenses, here called unembanked areas have a special status in the Dutch water safety policy. Whereas, primary flood defenses have to fulfill to legal standards and a functional manager is appointed for construction, maintenance and management. For unembanked areas this situation is different; some provinces have water safety policy and according to the national water plan residents and users are responsible for taking consequence reducing measures of floods. For the development of new areas decisions have to be made about the desired level of safety and how this is achieved. This leads to the issue of optimal adaptation strategies. What is the best level of safety so that unnecessary high risk levels and overinvestment in safety related infrastructure can be circumvented? This study presents a framework for municipalities and property developers how to deal with flood risk in unembanked areas. 952 developments are planned in unembanked areas of which 183 comprise urban dwelling projects. This thesis especially focuses on these urban dwelling projects where flood events can be regarded as a local, regional and direct tangible risk. The following research question is answered: How can we deal with the uncertainties of flood risk in investment decisions in the development of unembanked areas? 1. What is the current policy of building in unembanked areas and what are the responsibilities of the government? 2. Which strategies can be formulated to create the desired level of safety and how should they be compared? 3. How can a multi-layer safety approach contribute to the safety of the project area? 4. How do area specific characteristics influence the cost effectiveness of the measure? 5. How to deal with the residual risk? A multi-layer safety approach assumes three layers in flood control: 1. Prevention: characterized by structural measures which influence the boundary conditions of the project area. Surface level heightening and the construction of an embankment are discussed 2. Spatial planning, characterized by structural measures which influence the exposure and vulnerability. Wet proofing, dry proofing and an elevated configuration are discussed. 3. Disaster control, characterized by non-structural measures which influence the exposure and vulnerability. Organizational aspects and financial compensation are discussed. It was founded that the urban dwelling density of a project area determines the profitability between individual consequence reducing measures (layer 2 of the MLS approach) and collective probability reducing measures (layer 1). The profitability of collective measures grow linear and transcend individual measures at 24 dwellings/ha. An elevated configuration is preferred above wet and dry proofing. Considering the construction of an embankment it was founded that the profitability grows according to a power function and transcends surface level heightening at 35 ha. All proposed urban dwelling plans in unembanked areas are analyzed on these criteria and it was founded that for 23% of the plans individual measures are preferred above collective measures. 62% of these plans are located in areas where the province has no flood probability standards and therefore consequence reducing measures have a good chance. The other 38% of the plans are located in provinces with flood profitability standards and the profitability of extra consequence reducing measures is dependent on this standard. For the remaining 77% of the areas a probability reducing approach is preferred; of which for 6% the construction of an embankment is preferred and for the other a surface level heightening strategy is preferred. All criteria of insurability (grouped in actuarial, market-determined and societal) are analyzed for a flood damage insurance for unembanked areas. Due to the physical aspects and policy of unembanked areas the formulated criteria of insurability score better for unembanked areas. The actual realization will depend on the market determined criteria. This approach has been tested for a redevelopment project in Rotterdam, Heijplaat, where it was founded that surface level heightening is the only profitable measure.","unembanked areas; risk assessment approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Nicholls, R.J. (mentor); Blanco, B. (mentor)","2011","As a good rule of thumb, one-line models have been in use for a wide range of coastal projects for the past 30 years to predict the beach morphological change and make the appropriate shoreline management plans. Though applied to many coastal sites with certain success, these models are still under further development so as to achieve better predictions. Hence, this research aims to extend a state-of-the-art one-line model (BEACHPLAN) in terms of longshore sediment transport rate by linking with a cross-shore profile model (COSMOS) through the OpenMI-based Pipistrelle platform. To couple these two existing models, three additional modules (i.e. Drift Interpolation module, Vector-To-Scalar module and Orientation Updating module) are developed. The existing two models and the three new modules work together as a whole composition (i.e. the coupled model) which aims to improve the one-line model in terms of longshore sediment transport and morphological response predictability. This coupled model calculates the longshore sediment transport rate based on both the modified CERC-formula and the Energetics approach. It is tested at an idealized straight coast and at Poole Bay, UK. This demonstrates that the model is numerically stable, effective in computing and able to give reasonable predictions of the shoreline morphological change. Hence, this dissertation shows that linking the existing models rather than developing completely new models is a potentially interesting research direction that is both economical and feasible to achieve. Some further developments of the model are also suggested. However, it is currently too early to reach the conclusion that the coupled model is better than the original one-line model since few validations have been made due to the limitations of field data and research time. Meanwhile, the working principle behind the coupled model needs further exploration and re-examination before a sound conclusion can be made. Therefore, the outcome of this research at this stage can be more precisely recognized as a proof of concept which demonstrates that it is theoretically reasonable and technically feasible to couple the one-line model and cross-shore profile model so as to realize practitioners’ certain requirements.","Longshore sediment transport; One-line model; Cross-shore profile model; OpenMI standard; Numerical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

Most of the green energy resources such as tidal and wave are freely available in large amount and also sustainable. On the other hand, the energy demand is increasing along with population growth. Therefore, researchers are developing the technology of energy converter from these resources to support human activities, business and leisure. Indonesia an archipelago country with plenty of narrow strait and surrounded by two oceans makes this tidal energy extraction looks promising. A pioneer study in Bali Strait as the reference site is selected among other prospective sites. Bali strait has relatively shallow water depth, high current density and high energy demand to support Bali Island and its tourism board. As the equipment of tidal energy converter is placed in severe condition for relatively long period, hence it has to be strength resistance and fatigue resistance. Fatigue failure will cause integrity failure which mostly occurs in the joint connections and at the base of support structure. Therefore, Fatigue design plays an important role in the development of tidal energy converter. Fatigue analysis on MCT support structure is based on experience and engineering judgement. Two established industries, oil and gas exploration and offshore wind turbine, are tailored into marine current turbine development. In addition, a range of representative cases is selected in this dissertation. To conclude, the fatigue service life for MCT support structure located in Bali strait has fulfil the minimum required of 80 years (20 years service life with factor of safety 4.0) with various alternatives. Contrary to the offshore wind turbine (OWT) with natural period at soft-soft range, the recommended natural period range for MCT is placed at soft-stiff range. This because of the MCT support structure requires stiffer and more compact structure as they are exposed to more severe loading compare to OWT. However, another analysis should be conducted such as strength resistance and accidental limit stress in order to have a complete design. On the other hand, Environment Impact Assessment should be prepared as well. In addition, this study might be the first study of fatigue assessment in MCT support structure and should be considered as an opening to a further renewable energy development.","natural frequency; current; fatigue life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The Sand Engine is the pilot project for a new nourishment technology (the mega nourishment), which consists of nourishing a huge amount of sand at once and let the nature spread it. For the pilot project Sand Engine Delfland 21 million meter3 of sand are being placed. The evolution and impacts of such a project is widely unknow due to the unique character of the intervention. However, the Amelander Bornrif exhibits a similar shape to the one designed for the Sand Engine, so the understanding of a natural phenomenon may give knowhow to apply and monitor the Sand Engine project. The Bornrif analysis was based on a data analysis that resulted in a conceptual model, where the main features and process were defined. Another aspect derived from the data analysis was the comparison with a wave shape parameter, the breaking intensity, that describes the lagoon shape as well as the reaching of the hook. Applying the knowledge acquired from the data analysis a process based model, Delft3D, was used to numerically simulate the Bornrif.The experiments were divided in two groups: the short term, where the hindcast of 5 years of development was performed even as a sensitivity analysis. For the short-term it is concluded that the main forcings are the waves. The second group of simulations, covered the longterm hindcast, where the inclusion of cohesive sediment had a high impact on the overall Bornrif developement. The Bornrif development is reproduced only applying a wave climatology, not including individual storms. Therefore, some findings can be transferred from the Bornrif to the Sand Engine as the period of the hook evolution, taking approximately 5 years; the possibility of erosion of the mainland due to a channel formation; and the reduction of the morphological change after the hook merges with the mainland.","Morphodynamics; Delft3D; Ameland Bornrif; vortex ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor)","2011","Accelerating rising sea levels, aging coastal defences, and an ever increasing demand for land along the coast, require imminent, reactive, as well as long-term, anticipatory, adaptation by society. One such, relatively novel adaptation strategy, is managed realignment. Managed realignment site selection being non-standardised, this has, to date, necessitated the development of a site-specific selection process for most potential schemes. This status quo has attributed a perceived complexity to managed realignment strategy implementation. This study explores the possibility of creating a site selection tool that may be applied to potential managed realignment sites throughout Europe. A representative range of 9 locations in 9 Western European countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, UK, Spain, Poland, Bulgaria and Italy) are looked at with regards to the current state of managed realignment as well as the potential drivers for managed realignment, constraints hindering the implementation of schemes and the site selection tools currently being employed. Through methods such as questionnaires, interviews and selective site visits, data is gathered for each study site. Key findings regarding managed realignment criteria and site selection processes are then collated into a Europe-wide applicable site selection tool. This study finds that, although drivers for managed realignment schemes vary from site to site, a primary driver may be identified for any given managed realignment scheme. Also, current constraints to scheme implementation are seen to be dominated by financial and political factors. Further, this study finds that current site selection tools contain adequate detail in criteria, but assume pre-conceived drivers and possibilities for managed realignment that exclude the possibility of wider-spread use in other schemes. In addition, the lack of quantitative criteria analysis and the need for a ‘filter’ in the selection process are identified in this study. Using the data gathered the European Site Selection Tool (ESST) is created and tested on a site selection case study along the Solent. The ESST is found to perform satisfactorily though further testing is recommended.","managed realignment; site selection; soft engineering; European","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Crosato, A. (mentor); Blom, A. (mentor); Marence, M. (mentor)","2011","The Langmann reservoir is part of the hydropower system in the river Teigitsch and in the reservoir loss of storage volume occurs. The reservoir was therefore flushed, but recently no permission is granted. The reason is the high sediment concentrations that have negative effects on the downstream region. An optimization of the flushing operations that reduces the negative effects and recovers most of the storage volume is required. Hence, insight in the flushing operations and identification of the key processes that determine the flushing efficiency are required. The reservoir is flushed by creating a riverine flow. The key processes that occur during flushing are classified as progressive erosion, retrogressive erosion and bank erosion. The flushing operations are in the maintenance phase; a channel is already formed and only recently deposited sediments are flushed out of the channel. A large peak in the sediment concentration at the transition of drawdown to riverine flow occurs. The Delft3D software is able to simulate the processes except for bank erosion. Bank erosion can be added to the model through an application that is under development. The model is very sensitive to the grid cell size, due to the small dimensions of the flushing channel. It is advised to decrease the grid cell size and to confine the grid to the flushing channel and the near surroundings as most erosion occurs within this area. The model also experiences problems in the water balance. The problems are caused by the rapid changes in water level, discharge and bottom level, but can be solved by adding and subtracting water to the model. The amount of sediment removed from the reservoir is underestimated. Data for calibration and verification are missing and therefore only the sensitivity to parameters that might increase the erosion is investigated. A measurement plan is set up in order to obtain the required data. The peak concentration is not shown in the model and so the model can not be used properly yet, to simulate different strategies that are implemented to minimize the sediment concentrations. Even though the model does not fully simulate the observed hydrological and morphological changes, it is felt that an important first step is taken in simulating the flushing operations. For the optimisation of the flushing operations a tube system combined with auxiliary channels that drain laterally is recommended. It is desirable to optimize the sediment management of the whole hydropower system in the river Teigitsch and make separate models of the three reservoirs. Pages 35-38 and Appendices B,C,D and E are removed due to secrecy.","reservoir; flushing; Delft3D; erosion; morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kooijman, D. (mentor)","2011","The development process between spatial planning and spatial development is characterized by a high degree of complexity. A multitude of actors are involved in the process with different interests. In spatial planning documents objectives are defined by public institutions designed to influence spatial development. During the process actual events occur that could affect the formulated objectives. The main objective of this study is to investigate and visualize this process. In theory is pronounced that there is a gap or mismatch between spatial plans and actual developments. This gap is seen as a constant given in the theory of planning. This phenomenon is reinforced by top-down spatial planning that formulate objectives which are prepared by municipal institutions. While practice shows that bottom-up spatial plans are influenced by private parties in day to day business. The need, as sought in this study, for empirical studies on policy and decision-making processes is known in the scientific domain. Many publications of scientists in the field of spatial policy and decision-making processes, general management concepts are defined which are not focused on a specific empirical field. This study focuses on the factors that determine the difficult relationship between the spatial planning process (plans) and the urban area development process (reality). The case study in this research is the urban area development of Rotterdam Central Station, with particularly the development of the public space of Kruisplein and the Kruisplein parking garage. The empirical research shows that planning objectives in practice often are not realised in reality. On the one hand that has to do with the fact that the development process actually turns out to be nonlinear. On the other hand, targets are often not based on rational assumptions due to the nonlinear nature of procedures regarding the development and because many actors with diverse interests are involved. So there is a mismatch in the relationship between plans and reality.

(mentor)","2011","The emphasis of this thesis work is placed on improving cell-edge multi-user performance in 3GPP LTE-Advanced networks by utilizing relaying and base station coordination technologies. Relaying is a technology for enhancing the transmissions between two locations on a radio path and base station coordination is a multi-cell processing technology towards mitigating the inter-cell interference. In this report, we first study the capacity behavior of relaying. Two forward strategies: Amplify-and-forward (AF) and Decode-and-forward (DF), are modeled and compared. A new full duplex (FDX) operation mode of relaying is discussed, as well as a relay network with a multi-antenna receiver. Results show that FDX relaying outperforms half duplex (HDX) relaying, DF relaying has better performance than AF relaying under the condition of an ideal relay link (RL) and a multi-antenna receiver gains more from relaying than a single-antenna receiver. Then, we apply the pre-coding on the coordinated evolved Node B (eNB) to realize simultaneous multi-user transmissions on the same frequency band. Designs of the pre-coding matrix are investigated and results show that zero-forcing (ZF) pre-coding of base station coordination reaches significant capacity enhancement in the case of a relatively high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Finally, we propose a novel combination transmission scheme which integrates a shared relay node (RN) and coordinated eNBs in order to achieve higher multi-user sum-rate capacity. We show that the advantages of this combination scheme compared with applying each technology separately can be expected in most cases and it turns out to be a good improvement of the cell-edge multi-user performance.","multi-user; relay; base station coordination; LTE-Advanced","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","wireless and mobile communications","",""

Southampton is one of the busiest and most important national ports, but coastal flooding has not been studied extensively before. This dissertation aims to investigate the likelihood of coastal flooding in Southampton during the 21st century with and without the effect of sea-level rise using the ‘bath-tub’ and LISFLOOD-FP methods. Sensitivity of LISFLOOD-FP and discussion of datasets and methodology are performed to estimate uncertainty in LISFLOOD-FP simulations for Southampton. At present, flooding ‘hotspots’ are located in Priory Road, Millbank, the Cross-house area, Riverside Park, Woodmill Lane, Industrial Park (Bitterne Manor), Weston Shore and The Test Nature Reserve (commercial, industrial areas and open spaces). 1 in 250-year and 1 in 1000-year events could cause deep flooding on a small scale at Millbank, Weston Shore and Test Lane according to LISFLOOD-FP simulations. Under sea-level rise, extreme water levels will be higher and occur more frequently. For Southampton the return periods of extreme water levels may decrease by about ten times for a 0.2m rise in sea level. Future coastal floodplains significantly expand on the west side of the River under 0.4m sea-level rise, and in the Docks with 0.4-1.0m sea-level rise during 1 in 250 year event. A preliminary evaluation on the impact of flooding on coastal infrastructure is made. LISFLOOD-FP results for the 250-year event show approximately 500 and 1,000 buildings could be located in floodplains for 2010, and 0.2m sea-level rise, respectively. 12-13km of railways and 4-7km of A roads could be disrupted by 0.4-0.6m sea-level rise. Structural and non-structural solutions are also proposed for Southampton, including a tidal gate, water-proof technologies, flood forecasting and warning systems, etc. to adapt to coastal flooding over the 21st century.","coastal flooding; Southampton; sea level rise; inundation; LISFLOOD-FP model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

This can provide an organisation with the ability to prevent potential negative consequences due to error in the early phase of the building process.

(mentor); Arkesteijn, M. (mentor)","2011","This master’s thesis is the advisory Real Estate Management Report for the future development strategy of the Dutch upscale department store, de Bijenkorf. Upscale department stores build its characteristic by having invited selected brands, and have specific target group who have higher purchasing power than average, and now de Bijenkorf is the only upscale department store brand in the Netherlands. To take care of its target customers, it has prepared for the commensurate assortment of brands with various departments for the customers’ tastes. As we realize that the department store itself has an image of an old fashioned retail format comparing to other newly developed retail formats, it may look decreasing retail business in these days. However, it still shows that the big retailer in the city center needs to be prepared more properly by predicting the future demands of the cities not only for their business profitability but also for the city’s image or branding. They need to keep this business and prepare more properly for the future. This report is not about how department stores can dominate the future retail market, but about how department stores sophisticatedly can keep and sustain their business more effectively into the retail market of the city. This is all about how to prepare the future of the department stores more strategically by providing research, business strategy, scenario planning and recommendation about efficient future transition of Dutch upscale department store chains, de Bijenkorf.","Corporate Real Estate Management; Leisure & Retail; Scenario Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management / Leisure & Retail Laboratory","",""

(mentor)","2011","This research focuses on polder-belt canal systems. More is demanded from these systems every day. Man induced changes, like increasing population density and increasing land value on one hand and climate change in the form of longer dry spells and more extreme precipitation events on the other hand are the main sources. The operation of the structures in these systems plays a critical role in successfully dealing with these challenges. To get the most out of the current system and its structures, operation by humans alone is not enough, they need to be aided by computers. A promising technique is Model Predictive Control (MPC). A control algorithm that uses a model of the system and forecasts of the future disturbances to determine the control actions for the structures, whilst adhering to the constraints of the system. Forecasts are uncertain and are therefore provided in the form of ensemble forecasts that consist of multiple scenarios. MPC uses only one scenario and is thus vulnerable to these uncertainties. Treebased Model Predictive Control (TBMPC) considers the complete ensemble to determine control actions. TBMPC has, however, only been tested in theory. Only open loop simulations have been carried out, no continuous closed loop simulations have been done. TBMPC uses the complete ensemble, but to save calculation time reduces it to a tree-shaped representative ensemble with fewer nodes. This means aggregating nodes and scenarios on various points in the ensemble. There are multiple rules that determine which nodes and scenarios are aggregated, however, their optimal setting is not known. Also if TBMPC has more added benefit over MPC on certain system configurations (e.g. configurations with higher discharge or storage capacity) is not known either. A model is developed to simulate the performance of MPC and TBMPC. It can deal with different precipitation series, forecasts, system configurations and control algorithm parameters. All simulations have a duration of one year and a one hour time step. The rules that determine which nodes and scenarios are aggregated are investigated first. Transforming the inflow forecast scenarios to cumulative inflow scenarios before determining which nodes and scenarios to aggregate yields better results. The threshold value is also important as it determines whether or not two scenarios are close enough to each other to be aggregated. Nothing was known about the right value for this parameter. One of the objectives was to be able to fine tune this value to the system con guration. Setting this value as a percentage of the maximum pump capacity of the system works well across di erent system configurations. The optimal value is 100% of the maximum pump capacity. The scenario reduction algorithm (i.e. the algorithm that creates the tree from the original ensemble) has two parts. First it reduces the number of scenarios in the ensemble to a predefined number and secondly it creates a tree out of the reduced ensemble. No information was available about the right amount of scenarios for the first part. The simulations show that using more than eight to 10 scenarios does not yield any better performance, but only increases calculation time. To determine if TBMPC is more beneficial on certain system configurations 81 configurations are examined. The performance of MPC with a perfect forecast (i.e. equal to the inflow), MPC and TBMPC is simulated for these configurations. For all configurations TBMPC shows a considerable added benefit, however, there are different reasons for different configurations. For configurations with a high storage and pump capacity the increased performance can be attributed to a more stable water level and a slight improvement in the deviation from set point. For configurations with a low storage and pump capacity the added benefit of TBMPC is seen in a better peak event anticipation. Overall significant improvements to TBMPC have been realized. It is shown that TBMPC not only works in theory, but provides benefits over MPC in practice for a multitude of configurations as well. TBMPC can now be tuned to the water system configuration it is used on and it can be set to reduce calculation time as much as possible without decreasing the performance.","tree-based model predictive control; performance assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

Almost all real wireless networks can be modeled by changing the parameters of the composite distribution which models both multipath and shadow fading. This composite distribution makes the analytical calculation of bit error rate (BER) difficult. In this thesis report, an approximation for this composite distribution has been introduced. A cooperative method, based on decode and forward (DF) for forwarding, is studied. For a required BER, for instance 10?2, the gain in terms of power with using the cooperation with one relay is 4 dB in comparison to a case with same amount of energy to send a same message for a non cooperative network. The impact of parameters of composite distribution on the gain of cooperative communications (CC) in terms of power is discussed. In this work, the optimum value for power allocation in the relay and sender for a cooperative network is found in the simulations. The different position of a relay in a parallel line with respect to the line of sight (LOS) of the sender and the receiver; and its impact on the BER is investigated. The random deployment of the relays in the network is also investigated.","Wireless Communication; Cooperative Communication; Composite Channels; Energy Conservation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Telecommunication, Wireless and Mobile Communications (WMC) Group","","Masters in Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Nes, R. (mentor); Van Ham, H. (mentor)","2011","The RetBus project is a plan of the City Council of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) and the transit operator TMB aimed at improving the public transport service in the city. The project involves building a new Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system called RetBus as well as eliminating or modifying some existing bus lines. The main design objective of the RetBus project is to provide a higher quality bus service to transit users at a lower cost for the operator. TMB and the City Council of Barcelona need to make a decision on whether or not to implement the RetBus project. They would like to make that decision based on the social value and the financial profitability of the project. The thesis contains a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the RetBus project. Two types of CBA have been carried out: financial cost-benefit analysis (FCBA) and social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA). Based on the results of the FCBA and the SCBA, the thesis also presents some recommendations on what type of changes could be made to the project in order to make it more socially beneficial and/or financially profitable. Two project alternatives have been evaluated. Alternative 1 (TMB plan) corresponds to the RetBus project as it would be implemented according to the plans of TMB: the BRT system is implemented and some changes are made in the bus network in terms of routes and service frequencies. Alternative 2 (Cost-reduction plan) contains all the elements of Alternative 1 plus additional changes to the bus network (21 extra bus lines are eliminated). The project effects included in the CBA are: BRT investment costs, change in fleet replacement costs, change in operating costs, change in operating revenues, transit user benefits, safety effects and environmental effects. Travel demand forecasts are necessary to estimate some of the project effects mentioned above. Those forecasts have been produced by means of a model based on the traditional four-stage transport model. First, a growth factor model has been used to forecast future total trip demand by updating a base year matrix. Second, a multinomial logit mode choice model has been used to perform modal split. Finally, two different models have been used to assign transit and private vehicle travellers to the transit and road networks. The assignment of transit trips is based on a multinomial logit model, while private vehicle trips have been assigned by means of a deterministic user equilibrium (DUE) model. The main conclusions are the following: a) both project alternatives are socially beneficial, although Alternative 2 (Cost-reduction plan) is more beneficial than Alternative 1 (TMB plan); b) Alternative 2 is profitable from a financial perspective, while Alternative 1 is not profitable, the main reason being that operating costs are considerably lower in Alternative 2, while levels of transit ridership and operating revenues are similar in both alternatives, c) the social value of both project alternatives could be improved by increasing the operational speed of the BRT system and/or by speeding up the implementation of the project; d) the financial profitability of both project alternatives could be improved by increasing the operational speed of the RetBus system and/or by raising transit fares. The thesis gives the following recommendations to TMB and the City Council: 1) implement the BRT system; 2) redesign the bus network in order to save operating costs and make it more complementary to the other public transport networks in Barcelona; 3) implement infrastructure measures, traffic management measures or other types of measures aimed at increasing the operational speed of the BRT system; 4) consider the possibility of speeding up the completion of the RetBus project, but study carefully its implications for all parties involved; 5) consider the possibility of increasing transit fares as a means to enhance the financial performance of the RetBus project, but study carefully its implications for all parties involved, since raising fares would reduce the social value of the project.","Public Transport; Bus Rapid Transit; Transport Demand Modeling; Project Evaluation; Cost-Benefit Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2011","De professionele paraglider en fotograaf Leo Westerkamp is instaat de kijker dichter bij de natuur en sport te brengen dan ieder ander log en niet wendbaar apparaat. Echter door bochten, windvlagen, luchtdrukverschillen en trillingen van de motor ondervinden de beelden een ernstig stabiliteitsprobleem. Vandaar dan ook dat Featherweight de opdracht heeft gekregen om de camerabeelden zodanig te stabiliseren dat de beelden te verkopen zijn. Tijdens het ontwerpproces is er hoofdzakelijk rekening gehouden met de mogelijkheid de camerastabilisator lichtgewicht en makkelijk bestuurbaar te maken. Aan de andere kant mocht hierbij niet worden ingeleverd op de kwaliteit van de beelden. Ontwerp Om te voldoen aan de wensen van Westerkamp heeft Featherweight gekozen voor de Featherweight Professional. De Featherweight Professional bestaat uit een opzet waar de camera gestabiliseerd wordt door twee gekoppelde dc motoren. Westerkamp heeft zelf de controle om de camera ergens anders op te richten via een duimcontroller, en via de aangeraden LCD-bril is hij instaat zelf real-time te kijken waar hij de camera op heeft gefocust. De motoren worden aangestuurd door een laptop, wiens data verkregen wordt door een microcontroller (Arduino-Mega) en de positie van de duimcontroller. De Arduino-Mega is er om de data van de acceleratiemeter en gyrometer om te zetten naar de afwijkende hoeken die ontstaan zijn door stabilisatie problemen. Implementatie De data van de acceleratiemeter en gyrometer wordt via een I2C protocol naar de Arduino-Mega gestuurd. Hier wordt door gebruik te maken van een versimpelde Kalman filter de verkregen data omgezet naar het aantal graden dat de camera afwijkt van het punt waar hij op gestabiliseerd moet worden. De Arduino-Mega stuurt het op zijn beurt door naar de laptop met de RS-232 interface, waar het wordt verwerkt met MATLAB. Bij MATLAB ligt de nadruk op: - De hoeken aanpassen door de data van de duimcontroller en de Arduino Mega te combineren; - De hoeken begrenzen; - De hoeken en hoeksnelheden via een adaptieve PD regelaar om te zetten naar het gewenste koppel, waar de twee RX-64 motoren mee aangestuurd worden. Daarnaast worden de huidige beelden waar de camera opgericht staat, weergegeven via een LCD-scherm. Evaluatie Bij de evaluatie kwam naar voren dat veel van de eisen uit het programma van eisen voldaan werden, voor zover deze geïmplementeerd waren in het prototype. Het systeem is licht en compact genoeg en stabiliseert de grootste verstoringen uit het beeld. Daarnaast is het systeem makkelijk te bedienen en niet hinderlijk voor de piloot. Aanbevelingen Er wordt aanbevolen, voordat de Featherweight Professional in ontwikkeling wordt genomen, nader onderzoek te doen naar de gebruikerswensen, toepassen van een normale Kalman filter op de sensordata, en het omlaag brengen van de verwerkingstijd. Ook wordt er aangeraden om mogelijk over te stappen naar een gimbal constructie, het toepassen van een lock-functie zodat de camera altijd het gewenste object volgt, en het mogelijk toepassen van een softwarematige stabilisatie. Om Featherweight Professional op een bredere markt te verkopen, moet er onderzoek gedaan worden naar mogelijke klanten. Dit onderzoek kan gedaan worden door een gebruikersonderzoek uit te voeren op een testgroep.","Bachelor Eindproject; BEP; BAP; Featherweight; Camerastabilisatie; lightgewicht; camera; stabilisatie","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Bachelor Eindproject","",""

(mentor)","2011","The TARA scans through a column of atmosphere in order to observe and study cloud system behavior. After 10 years of operation new knowledge of processing has been acquired which allows for an update that will improve measurement quality and processing speed. The main question of this thesis is: How to implement data processing, visualization and storage for TARA? The system, from the radar control to the visualization and storage, needs to be built from scratch. In order to most effectively achieve this, the entire system has been split up into two parts that will be designed separately. To be able to combine the parts, the groups will work together to build an overarching structure in which the separate blocks can be easily implemented (chapter 2). In chapter 3 the program of requirements is given, in which all the requirements for the system are mentioned. Different topics have been researched, in order to be able to do this project, this can be read in chapter 4. Over the years a variety of radar types have been developed, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Four of the different properties are important in TARA. That are: monostatic vs. bistatic, FM-CW radar vs. pulsed radar, Doppler radar and polarimetric radar. Frequency modulation is used to be able to determine the range of the measured objects. By comparing the received frequency with the current transmitted frequency the time that was needed for the signal to travel can be determined, also the Doppler speed of the particles can be calculated. For the implementation of this project we will work with LabVIEW and Matlab. An overall block diagram has been made, after which the more detailed block diagrams and state diagrams of the three blocks that group 2 has to design, could be made. The overall block diagram shows the signals that every block in the systems sends out or receives (chapter 5). The final block diagrams are shown in Appendix A and the state diagrams in Appendix B. The state diagrams are used to describe how the sub-systems accomplish their tasks. Incoming data is processed by Matlab code which is provided. This is one of the main reasons for the choice of LabVIEW, because Matlab code can be implemented in the program via Matlab nodes. Variables that should not be changed during measurement and should be used by multiple different systems are put into global functional variables. Variables that can be changed are sent via notifiers. After everything was designed and some choices for implementation were made, the implementation could begin (chapter 6). First an overarching system was made, but during the development it became apparent that the actions of this system could be interpreted as those of the Radar Control block, a block that was originally designed by group 1. After the choices were made on how the Radar Control operates, the design process of the GUI started and the data processing and visualization block were implemented. Implementation of the storage block has however not been realized, because of time constraints and task re-allocation between the two sub-groups. Finally the system has been implemented in the actual TARA.First real-time measurements have been succesfully performed. An evaluation about what has been achieved compared to the requirements discussed in chapter 3, can be read in chapter 7. As already stated before, the storage has not been implemented, so requirements considering storage have not been met. Besides that, most requirements are met, although improvements can still be made. In chapter 8 a discussion is given about the points on which the project could be improved. In chapter 9 the conclusion is drawn that most of the requirements are met and recommendations are given on how to improve the system further.","atmospheric radar","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Remote sensing of the environment","",""

(mentor); Koutamanis, A. (mentor)","2011","Design processes in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry are claimed to lack performance (Churchill and Thoren, 2009; CIB, 2009; Rezgui et al, 2009). The lacking performance is caused by fragmentation of the industry into multiple disciplines (Rezgui et al, 2009). As a result of the multi-disciplinary nature of the industry, integrated collaboration is becoming increasingly important. However, integrated collaboration appears to be challenging as a result of characteristics of the AEC industry, such as the project-based nature, short-term business relationships and adversarial culture (Anumba et al, 2005 cited in Bektas et al, 2010a; Farinha et al, 2007; Churchill and Thoren, 2009). Throughout the AEC industry, initiatives are undertaken to improve performance of the AEC design process. Initiatives such as Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) and Integrated Design and Delivery Solutions (IDDS) are focused on increasing integrated collaboration within design teams, through a combination of technological developments, alternative business models and a focus on organization and process (AIA, 2007; CIB, 2009). Whereas IPD and IDDS describe rather theoretical visions, a design approach called Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) is focused on operational aspects to translate those visions into practice. VDC provides integrated, multi-disciplinary, performance based virtual design and construction modeling (Garcia et al, 2004). VDC consists of several components, which focus on the level of the Product (the design), Organization (the design team) and Process (the design process) (POP) (Kunz and Fischer, 2009). POP visualizations are applied to visualize product, organization and process, whereas POP metrics are used for performance measurement. Theory describes that the VDC components are applied during an Integrated Concurrent Engineering (ICE) process, which takes place in an interactive meeting room. Although VDC is claimed to increase performance through integrated collaboration, VDC theory is still developing. Moreover, implementation of VDC is currently limited to case study projects and pilot environments in the US. Although companies in the Netherlands have identified VDC as a promising design approach for large AEC projects, the actual implementation of VDC in such projects is unclear. Therefore, this research aims to determine the expected degree of VDC implementation during the design phase of large, real-life projects. Moreover, this research aims to identify how VDC implementation in such projects can be improved. The research was conducted at a Dutch engineering consultancy firm which is currently implementing VDC. The research consisted of an extensive literature study about VDC and two case studies. The first case study was a pilot project during which VDC was applied. This case study was used to identify the current implementation of VDC during a pilot project. The other case study was a large, real-life AEC project. This case study provided insight into the project characteristics and challenges which are found in current, non-VDC practice. Data for the case studies was collected by means of semi-structured interviews with actors from different levels of the project organization. Additionally, observations and documentation analysis provided insight into the design processes of both case study projects. A cross case-theory analysis was performed to identify the influence of project characteristics of large AEC projects on the implementation of VDC. Moreover, challenges of large AEC projects provided insight into the need of VDC implementation. The research results show that in general, implementation of VDC during the design phase of large AEC projects is expected to be limited. The VDC case study showed that VDC components were only partially applied during the pilot project. VDC implementation in large AEC projects will be even more difficult as a result of additional project size, complexity, duration and actor involvement. The research showed that implementation of VDC in large AEC projects is expected to be limited to basic POP visualizations and POP metrics. Integrated Concurrent Engineering is expected to remain limited as well. Although application of more profound POP modeling, POP metrics and Integrated Concurrent Engineering is expected to be a long term goal, the current achievable level of VDC implementation could already provide some improvement of design process performance. Further VDC implementation in large AEC projects is expected to require a significant amount of effort, because of the large gap between VDC and the traditional design approach. Moreover, the added value of additional VDC implementation is yet unknown. In order to decrease the gap and to define the added value, it is recommended to use pilot projects. Pilot projects offer interaction between theory and practice. As such, pilot projects are important for the development of VDC theory as well as the improvement of VDC implementation in practice. Implementation of VDC in large AEC projects should be considered as a gradual process which consists of small steps.","VDC; Virtual Design and Construction; Integrated Concurrent Engineering; design integration; co-location; implementation; BIM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-22","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design and Construction Management (DCM)","",""

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (mentor); Willemen, K. (mentor)","2011","The Efteling believes that people have the need from time to time to escape from their daily lives. That is why the Efteling “sells” an experience of being in the World of the Efteling and continues to surprise with new and exciting attractions and entertainment. Besides the money for the entrance ticket, another important source of income comes from catering and merchandise. Merchandise is meant as a reminder to the visitor and is a way of advertisement for the Efteling outside the amusement park. Preferably, an attraction is a capable theme for merchandise and catering. Their services must fit the guests’ needs. The project is based on the assignment of making a redesign of one of the souvenir shops at the theme park: Valies. The store is located next to the Carnaval Festival, from which the experience should be extended in the design of the store. In April the Efteling will launch a new brand Jokie, which should be sold in the redesign of the store. The main brand assets are happiness, discovery and carefree. Jokie is a brand meant for pre-schoolers. The store focuses on preschool families shopping together. The theme of the store is “travelling around the world is like a celebration”. Souvenir shopping is difficult to manage because you have to deal with the fact that people will not often visit your store. The theory of sacredness is important for souvenir shopping, in which a happy memory towards the products is standing central. The success of the Efteling lies in the experience in which families will forget about their daily routines. However, preschool families shopping at the theme park often find difficulties, which disrupt in this experience. Therefore a comparative study is executed of how shopping at the Efteling is experienced, how the attraction is experienced and how shopping together as preschool families should become. Concluding, the different generations are characterized by different intentions: Children want to discover the world by touch and are soon overwhelmed by all the impulses in the store which drives them crazy. Parents have the need to explore the store without their children to touch anything and prefer them to stay calm and act like they supposed to act in a store. The emotions by the parents are mainly influenced by their children. The positive family experience of the attraction is interesting for the redesign of the store, by serving both parties. Children are happy because of the attraction and parents become happy because of their children. This experience should be extended in the store. From this study I founded a vision (ViP): I want to offer a possibility to discover a happy fantasy and approachable world filled with friendly recognitions. Both parties should feel accepted in the environment. Parents feel happily surprised by the inventions of their children in a playful and unique shopping experience. The evaluation of the ideas is based on the vision and the first consumer journey which lead to the first elaboration of the concept. In the design process the fundamental of the store was to divide the store by two worlds based on height. In which the world of the children instructs how to use the store, characterized by a certain amount of products, to make sure that the children will not become overwhelmed. Children are offered the possibility to connect with the products by touch. The level for parents is characterized by a store as we know, filled with enough stock. Children are supported to stay alert and find their own way in the store, without the necessity of their parents to worry whether children behave well, which was a preference by the older target group. Both parents and children are offered the possibility to make a unique connection with the products, based on their natural instincts in which the product presentation plays an important role. Because both discoveries come together in the heart of the store, the experiences come together. The enthusiasm and happiness of the children could improve sales. The experience of the store offers a memory towards the Carnaval Festival by extending the fundamentals of the attraction like travelling, the recognizable characters and their red noses and of course the music of the attraction. The cabinets are designed based on the theme of travelling around the world: Clocks, suitcases, maps, binoculars, a globe and skylines are all involved in the store. The store embraces the celebration using bright colours and especially the projection of confetti in the back of the store. The style of the attraction is emerged in the store using simple and basic shapes. The store takes into account both parties of the extended family instead of just one, which results in a unique shopping journey as a preschool family. Triggers react on you personally to emphasize the experience of a unique shopping journey. The concept is evaluated by the interactions of one of the cabinets. For the final concept some improvements were made based on the evaluation of the interactions. An implementation of the different cabinets is made together with an overview of the space productivity in the store. Finally a happy, carefree discovery in the world of the Jokie de Prrretneus souvernir shop is created.","Retail Design; ViP; Experience design; Souvenirs; consumer journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-21","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction specialisation Retail Design","",""

But, on the other hand, sustainable ambitions almost always decline during the actual construction project. To realize these ambitions, there is the need for a new project approach.

People not only have high expectations in regard of the conversation quality, but they also need more data download speeds and better coverage. The industry tries to come and fill in this expectation by developing state-of-the art systems that are cost-effective and that ensure good profits. Telecommunication operators require from vendors top class, cheap and reliable equipments for their sites. Vendors on the other hand try to cut down costs by simulating and then developing products. The aim of this project is to simulate three important wireless systems LTE, UMTS and GSM/EDGE (at physical layer level) for base stations, according to the implementations mentioned in the 3GPP standards. The most demanding requirements have been derived in this work for each of the transceiver systems and a realistic system description has been implemented in MatLab 2008b. The tolerance to RF imperfections (DC offset, I-Q amplitude and phase mismatch, cubic nonlinearity, frequency offset, phase noise, etc.) are taken into consideration. Also implementation specific RF imperfection, like the delay and amplitude misalignment in outphasing transmitters has been considered. The RF imperfections have been considered in equal measures for both the transmitter and the receiver. The resulting study ensured a perfect calibration of the BER curves with the theoretical curves using the uncoded bits. The final system comparison in this thesis has been made only for the communication standard LTE, considering classical IQ Tx configuration, a pure outphasing transmitter and an improved efficiency outphasing Tx. This in order to investigate which concept is more tolerant to RF impairments. The parameters used in the simulations to check the system performances are: EVM, ACPR, scatter plots and BER. In conclusion, this study offers some suggestions for future research activities, related to topics like estimation, equalization, Rayleigh channels and Doppler affected Rayleigh channels.","LTE; UMTS; GSM; EDGE; WiMax; OFDM; 3GPP; physical layer; RF impairments; AWGN; linearity requirements; phase noise requirements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Laparoscopic surgery is a part of the Minimal Invasive Surgery (MIS) family and is qualified as a rather new surgical technique. According to a report that is written by the Dutch Healthcare Inspection (DHI) there are no universal norms and standards to assess the minimal performance of the OR team, the equipment and the instruments (Report DHI, 2008). The DHI states that this lack of standards might cause interference with patient safety that is not related to the condition of the patient. To improve patient safety within the OR measurements should be taken to deal with a problem when it occurs without influencing patient safety, therefore troubleshooting should be integrated. In this assignment the context of laparoscopic surgery has been researched and the most influential factors on patient safety have been analyzed and formulated as a potential design direction for a troubleshooting tool. The assignment was developed in close cooperation with the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven (CHE). The context of this assignment was merely determined by the OR1 by Karl Storz. This is the operating room where laparoscopic surgery takes place in the CHE. The OR1 is an integrated operating room that enables the user to control all equipment from one workstation, provides the user with high quality imaging and minimizes the occupation of the floor space. The users of the OR1 system and all other persons that are involved in the implementation of the OR1 system into the OR routine are called stakeholders. In this assignment literature research, supplemented with observations in the operating room and interviews with different stakeholders have lead to the insight on what factors are of influence on patient safety. In combination with the principle of troubleshooting this lead to the development of two concepts that were merely focused on the influence of the OR1 system on patient safety during laparoscopic surgery. The OR1 system has been integrated in the OR complex of the CHE for over five years now and the advantages the system had to offer have become disadvantages merely because the system is not used to its full potential. The causes of this insufficient integration of the OR1 system in the OR routine is very versatile and leads to insufficient basic system knowledge. To be able to solve this problem it is important to know what the system originally should do. Therefore the fundament for troubleshooting has become the formulation of the Basic System Knowledge (BSK). The BSK has been defined as a policy including an introduction, a proficiency test and a support tool. This policy is focused on ensuring a minimal level of OR1 system knowledge. The support tool has been developed in this project as a wheel chart that provides the user with purposeful information on four basic proceedings with the OR1. When the basis for troubleshooting with the OR1 was defined the actual troubleshooting tool has been developed. The tool is an integrated part of the OR1 system and provides support during technical and surgical problems. The troubleshooting tool consists out of two parts; one technical troubleshooting part and one surgical troubleshooting part. Both parts can be found in one application. The Technical Equipment Troubleshooting (TET) tool provides a problem solving suggestion to the user for the OR1 system after a sequence of questions. The Surgical Knowledge Troubleshooting (SKT) tool provides the user with experiental image-based data that is used to find a solution in case of a complication. These data are meant to be for and provided by surgeons. Both tools have been developed in close cooperation with the OR-nurses, the surgeons and the technical support department of the OR. And therefore the OR-nurses and the surgeons have tested the final concepts of the BSK tool and the troubleshooting tool. These tests were merely focused on the usability of the tools and lead to some interesting recommendations for further development of the tools. Both tools should be properly introduced to the users, because the (technical) terminology causes some difficulty. The language of the tools should be reconsidered and some other practical issues like font size, font colouring and content elaboration should be reconsidered as well. Overall both tools have been experienced as an added value to the current situation in the OR1. Integrating the troubleshooting tool in the OR1 system leads to a new phase in the development of the tool in which refinement and detailing can be established. For further development of both tools it is very important to keep involving the users, because they are the best reference of both tools.","laparoscopic surgery; troubleshooting; basic system knowledge; user centered; support tool; troubleshooting tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

Daarnaast bestaat de proefopstelling uit een bak met stilstaand water. Er is dus geen sprake van een horizontale stroming. Er zijn verschillende proeven uitgevoerd, beginnende met het afwerpmechanisme van de ground consolidators, de aanlevermethode. Het grote probleem van vroegtijdig klitten moest opgelost worden. Uiteindelijk is er, na een ontwerpfase met vijf verschillende varianten, met de beste oplossing, de gefixeerde goot met inkepingen, verder gegaan. Vervolgens is er een aantal proeven met de valpijp gedaan. Zo zijn de verschillende valsnelheden van de ground consolidator in de valpijp bepaald door al dan niet gebruik te maken van een toegevoegd debiet. Met deze gegevens valt de dosering van de ground consolidators in de valpijp te bepalen. Ook is de ideale hoogte die de valpijp moet hebben ten opzichte van de bodem onderzocht. Bepalend hiervoor is de spreiding die de ground consolidators hebben wanneer ze in open water worden losgelaten. Met de resultaten die uit deze onderzoeken voortkwamen kan een formule opgesteld worden die de verhouding tussen de vaarsnelheid, zijdelingse beweging en lossnelheid weergeeft. Uiteindelijk, met het in acht nemen van onze randvoorwaarden, is het mogelijk een voorwaartse vaarsnelheid te behalen van 2,5 meter per minuut. Dit is een stuk sneller dan de snelheid die er met stortsteen bereikt wordt. Hiermee lijkt er vooralsnog toekomst te zitten in het gebruik van GC's als bescherming.

(mentor); Chao-Duivis, M.A.B. (mentor)","2011","Two recent developments are the motivation for this research:  Increasing awareness of sustainability and thus the will to design and build with sustainable ambitions.  The emergence of integrated project delivery methods, also because of the changing roles between government and market. Problem statement: When developing a sustainable building, already at an early stage a principal has to decide how the process will be arranged: choosing a project delivery method. For a principal it is difficult to know what the impact of having sustainable ambitions is on the choice and vice versa, what the choice of a project delivery method means for the possibilities to realize these ambitions. This has led to the main question of this research: How can a public principal steer the realization of sustainable quality in both the traditional and integrated project delivery methods with corresponding contract models? Research approach: There are three project delivery methods that have been researched as a selection option: the traditional model, the Design Build model and the Design Build Finance Maintain & Operate model (DBFMO). All have their own specific characteristics and different advantages and disadvantages regarding realization of sustainable quality. The project delivery method is – as part of the organization of the development process – an important determinant of the outcome of that process. The choice depends on the specific circumstances of a principal, the project environment and the needs it has to provide for. Conclusions: When developing sustainable buildings, the selection process of a project delivery method is often not transparent and ‘the will to realize sustainable quality’ has no or limited influence on the selection. There appear to be several reasons for this:  Unfamiliarity of the options.  Formulating and measuring ‘sustainable quality’ is difficult.  Other factors are more important during the selection.  The project delivery method is not considered important. Recommendations: From this research a number of recommendations are formulated that a principal has to pay attention to in order to create the ideal situation from which he can realize his desired level of sustainable quality.  Clear formulation of the desired level of sustainable quality and embedding this in the process.  Going through the selection process of choosing a project delivery method and deciding on the factors considering ‘the will to realize sustainable quality’.  Being aware of general and project delivery method specific focus points that are important to actually realize the desired levels of sustainable quality in the further process. In all recommendations mentioned above a principal can use the guidelines I have developed. These guidelines give a principal a first indication of the selection of a project delivery method and makes him aware of all aspects that can influence ‘the will to realize sustainable quality’.","Sustainable quality; project delivery method; contract; traditional; integrated; principal; opdrachtgever; duurzaamheid; duurzame kwaliteit; traditionele model; Design Build; DB; DBFMO; bouworganisatievorm; contractvorm; realisatie; keuzeproces; initiatieffase; duurzaamheidslabel; BREEAM; ambitie; bouwproces","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Van de Kaa, G. (mentor); Frunt, M.H.T. (mentor)","2011","BAM Wegen, a contractor specialized in road construction and maintenance and (partial) owner of eight asphalt factories in the Netherlands, indicated to have efficiency problems with their reverse logistics activities; all activities needed to reclaim used asphalt. This research therefore aimed at finding a method to better control the supply and demand of the asphalt that becomes available with road maintenance. A supply chain that includes reverse logistics activities is called a closed-loop supply chain in the literature. In the literature much can be found on closed-loop supply chains and reverse logistics activities, though the literature seems to be narrowed to the reuse of packaging, consumer goods and spare parts. Nothing in the literature has been written about the adoption of a closed-loop supply chain in the asphalt industry. The goal of this research has been twofold: The first part has been focused on finding out to what extend the theory on closed-loop supply chains is applicable on the asphalt industry, the situation in the asphalt industry has been compared with the theories available in the literature; The second part has been focused on finding practical solutions for the asphalt industry to optimize its reverse supply chain. The two main research questions that are answered in this report are:  Are concepts on closed-loop supply chains as can be found in the literature and used in other industries applicable for the asphalt industry?  How can the closed-loop supply chain in the asphalt industry be optimized to tackle the difficulties identified? To be able to obtain the goals and answer the research questions a literature study and a case study at BAM have been performed. An overview of the state of the art knowledge on closed-loop supply chains is presented as well as a full analysis of the asphalt industry in which BAM Wegen is active. Comparing the situation in the asphalt industry with the literature showed that there is a gap in the literature; the situation in the asphalt industry contradicts with general theories on closed-loop supply chains. In the asphalt industry the reclaimed asphalt is inspected and separated before transportation, a property that is not considered in the literature. This property seems to be the cause of the contradiction with general theories. Future research should therefore try to sort out if this property is unique for the asphalt industry and that the asphalt industry is therefore just an exception or that the theory on closed-loop supply chains should be expanded. In the current supply chain model used in the asphalt industry the contractor is responsible for the collection of the reclaimed asphalt. One of the main problems identified in this model is that the supply and demand of reclaimed asphalt cannot be controlled. Another main problem is that asphalt factories lack the capacity to keep multiple reclaimed asphalt types on their terrain. In this research report, with the use of the literature and the case study, three alternative supply chain models for the asphalt industry have been developed to solve the problems identified. To be able to score the models objectively a balanced scorecard has been developed and used. Comparing the results of the alternative models with the current model used by BAM shows improvements for the reverse logistics activities for the asphalt industry, though in some situations at the costs of the financial performance of BAM. However due to the unavailability of data, the financial performance of the models is to be expected better than presented. On short term it is recommended for BAM to start by changing the closed-loop supply chain from a retailer collecting model to a manufacturer collecting model. The responsibility of the collection of the reclaimed asphalt shifts from the contractor to the asphalt factories, giving the asphalt factories the ability to control the distribution of the reclaimed asphalt over the asphalt factories. An additional advantage of this change is that data required to predict the financial performance of the 3PL model will be easier to collect and therefore a more accurate and complete assessment of the financial consequences of a shift towards a third party collecting model can be made. On the long run it is recommended for BAM to change its closed-loop supply chain towards a third party collecting model. A third party need to be established that will be responsible for the collection and processing of reclaimed asphalt. Asphalt factories will no longer have to store large amounts of reclaimed asphalt, but instead can buy reclaimed asphalt just-in-time. The third party collecting model provides the best solution for BAM and the asphalt industry. By implementing the third party collecting model more transparency will be gained; the costs of the inspection, separation and collection of the asphalt will be distributed equally over all stakeholders in the price of the reclaimed asphalt. Furthermore asphalt factories will be more efficiently, because they no longer have to lobby for reclaimed asphalt. This research report has shown that there are alternative supply chain models for the asphalt industry to solve the problems that currently exist. On short term the manufacturer collecting model can already solve some difficulties, while a third party collecting model would ultimately provide the most benefits for BAM and other contractors in the asphalt industry.","Asphalt Industry; Closed-loop Supply Chain; Reverse Logistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-06-17","Technology, Policy and Management","TLO","","","",""

(mentor); Van de Schrieck, G.L.M. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2011","A way to equalize granular rockfill dumps at a sea or river bed is the use of a plough. A plough can be modeled as a set of straight blades in sequence. Several cutting models for dry and saturated sand are present in the literature. In cutting coarse material, the increase in pore water pressures caused by dilatancy of the grain structure play a minor role. This results in a different shape of the layer cut than for traditional cutting methods in fine soils. The layer cut has a limited surface slope resulting in grains rolling down under the angle of repose ?. Failure of the grain structure in coarse material depends mainly on the gravitational, shear and inertial forces between grains. This master thesis gives an analytical model for cutting rockfill larger than medium coarse sand with straight cutting blades (Chapter 4.2). A description is given of the important processes involved in equalizing with a plough and the different stages of filling. The analytical model is realized by use of models made by S.Miedema for cutting saturated sand and models for cutting dry sand by Hettiaratchi, and Reece (1966). The analytical model is verified by performing a physical scale model. The scale model is used to attempt to simulate the process in a discrete element computer model EDEM.","equalizing; plough; rockfill; cutting; coarse; discrete; continuum; EDEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering and Dregdging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2011","This graduation project is conducted for the Seeds crowdfunding platform, a project of ABN AMRO Dialogues Incubator. The platform is one of the first crowdfunding platforms for starting companies within the Netherlands. The starting companies present themselves on the online platform and interested visitors (the crowd) can become investors by investing (funding) in this company. Investments start from 10 Euro. The goal of this project was to gain insight in the investor involvement during an online crowdfunding project for a starting company. Currently only information is available about investor involvement for charity or creative crowdfunding projects. Investing in a starting company differs from other crowdfunding initiatives since this is a real type of investment with a possible return on investment instead of only an in-kind reward. Involvement is the main motivation to participate in a crowdfunding project and therefore it is important to gain insight in the investors involvement for crowdfunding projects for starting companies. In order to gain insight in the involvement and motivations for this group of investors different research methods were used. Various interviews were held with crowdfunding experts and different types of investors; informal investors, mini angel investors and crowdfunding investors of charity and creative projects. The results of the interviews were used to develop a questionnaire study. Which was conducted with potential crowdfunding investors for a starting company. The goal of the questionnaire study was to gain insight in the importance of the different properties of a crowdfunding proposition for starting companies. The goal was to develop an application to help the entrepreneurs to communicate with the crowd. But also to keep the investors involved and informed. The application should fulfill the needs of the target group of the Seeds crowdfunding platform and help the entrepreneur to easily stay in touch with their crowd. Apart from the informative function the application also has the goal to make the entrepreneur profit from the involvement of their crowd an enable the investors to contribute to the company. The main focus of the application is the information need of the investors and their willingness to contribute to the company. The application offers the investors structured information. The information is solely available for the crowdfunding investors and is written by the entrepreneurs of the company. The information about the company does also contain pictures and movies. The investors can stay up to date about the progress and news of the company, notifications can be created to stay up to update about specific topics. Investors can also contribute to the company, the application makes this easy by standardized templates. The templates are not only useful for the investors, but also for the entrepreneurs. Information sent by the investors is manageable and is easier to handle for the entrepreneurs. Investors can contribute with their knowledge, network, skills, and evaluations and have the option to ask questions to the company. In this way the entrepreneur can easily collect investor insights with the application. The application also offers investors the opportunity to comment on news items and pictures. Investors can also react on each other’s comments. Users test with the Seeds application gave useful insights about the application. Although the overall structure of the company was clear, the participants had some difficulties with the manner of how the different companies are displayed on the home screen. Sometimes there where some misunderstandings because of the limited content available for some of the screens of the prototype. But overall the participants where enthusiastic about the application and saw it as an addition to their investment and would really use the application to stay informed and involved with their investment in a starting company.","Crowdfunding; Starting company; iPhone application; Involvement; Interaction; Investment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction & Strategic Product Design","",""

This project started with a strong position on how to approach designing for sustainability with regards to consumer electronics and how the problem should be defined. Time and care was taken to focus on improving social quality of life and develop a long-term vision on how consumer electronics can play a role in helping users live more sustainable lives. A set of Design Guidelines were refined in the process of developing a concept, Fog. With a vision of a healthy evolution of technology for people, the Design Guidelines show how the vision is translated to more tangible product qualities. The Fog concept was an example of how a design can allow space for disconnection by treating the digital connections with care, and not as an addiction to solve. It allowed for a more sensitive way of dealing with overload, that can be naturally incorporated by users with the help of CE. The web prototype, Protofog, was built to enable users to incorporate Fog in their everyday communications with chosen partners. The test yielded valuable feedback for evaluating the potential of Fog. Protofog also showed that following the Design Guidelines can yield immediate changes in polite expectations, and it gave directions for how future development in hardware and software can better support it. The process and deliverables as a whole showed how the approach increased user-centered sustainable value, that in turn gives worth to the CE production process.","sustainability; social translucence; practice theory; vision-driven design; consumer electronics; interactive prototype","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Sustainability","","","",""

Finance for real estate based on real care production.","Ong, F.H.D.","Van der Voordt, J.D.M. (mentor); Van Oel, C.K. (mentor)","2011","De poster beschrijft de effecten van de wijzigingen in het financieringsstelsel voor vastgoed op de besluitvorming van vastgoed in de Nederlandse geestelijke gezondheidszorg sector (GGZ). Voor dit onderzoek is een case studie gevoerd bij GGZ Noord Holland Noord. De resultaten zijn vergeleken met GGZ Ingeest en GGZ Lentis. Besluitvorming vastgoed Uit het onderzoek kan de huidige besluitvorming omschreven worden als: Een besluitvorming die voornamelijk gebaseerd is op: - Initiatieven vanuit de zorg groepen o Deze initiatieven zijn meestal gebaseerd op signalen vanuit de werkvloer. Dit kunnen klachten of verlaging van de productie zijn. - De afdelingen financiële zaken en vastgoed hebben een adviserende rol binnen deze besluitvorming. o Deze afdelingen werken binnen de gestelde financiële kaders vanuit de overheid en de initiatieven van de zorggroepen. Door de huidige besluitvorming lopen GGZ instellingen achter de feiten aan. De besluitvorming is hierdoor inefficiënt en er wordt niet optimaal gebruik gemaakt van het vastgoed. De huidige besluitvorming is te verklaren door het feit dat de gebouwgebonden kosten gefinancierd worden door de overheid. Deze financiering is vrijwel altijd gegarandeerd. Hierdoor is er geen directe reden om zorgen te maken voor wat betreft de financiering voor vastgoed. Het werd toch wel betaald, is de gedachte. Financieringsstelsel vastgoed In het huidige financieringsstelsel voor vastgoed wordt de financiering voor vastgoed jaarlijks nagecalculeerd. De overheid financiert alle gebouwgebonden kosten inclusief leegstand en rente. De enige voorwaarde is dat de zorgaanbieder een vergunning had om zorg te mogen verlenen. Met het nieuwe stelsel blijft de overheid financier voor gebouw gebonden kosten, echter zijn de regels aangepast. De nieuwe financiering zal in een component geplaatst worden, het normatieve huisvestingscomponent (NHC). In het nieuwe stelsel zal het NHC gekoppeld worden aan de zorgfinancieringen (Zorg zwaarte pakketten & diagnose behandel combinaties). De zorgfinancieringen zijn op hun beurt weer gebaseerd op de werkelijke zorgproductie. Kortom, geen productie is geen financiering voor vastgoed. Met het nieuwe financieringsstelsel voor vastgoed zal de nadruk gaan liggen op strategische vastgoedmanagement. De onderzochte GGZ instellingen bereiden zich voor op de wijzigingen door interne huurprijzen in te voeren. Hiermee willen de instellingen hun zorggroepen bewuster maken van de gemoeide kosten voor vastgoed. De huidige vastgoedportefeuilles worden momenteel nagelopen en berekend op de financiële prestaties. Er is nog geen sprake van strategische vastgoedmanagement bij de onderzochte instelling. Door het invoeren van interne huurprijzen zal de verantwoording wel stijgen, echter kan het zijn dat de zorggroepen hun eisen nog hoger gaan stellen omdat zij uiteindelijk de interne huur gaan betalen. Zo is te zien dat de budgetten zelfs worden overgeheveld naar de zorggroepen. Hierdoor zullen de zorggroepen nog meer regie hebben in de besluitvorming. Ondanks dat de overheid de invoering van het NHC blijft uitstellen is het raadzaam voor GGZ instellingen om strategische vastgoedmanagement toe te passen. De tijd die de GGZ sector nog heeft tot de werkelijke invoering van het NHC zullen zij moeten aangrijpen om de vastgoedorganisatie en vastgoedportefeuille op orde te krijgen. Zo zijn de risico’s en kansen van vastgoed nog niet inzichtelijk gemaakt. Daardoor zal een zorggroep ook niet weten wat vastgoed kan betekenen voor hen. Tot slot zal strategische vastgoed management de gehele organisatie en met in het bijzonder de zorggroepen meer zekerheid geven. Zo zal de vastgoedportefeuille afgestemd worden op de organisatie. En zullen fluctuaties beter opgevangen kunnen worden. Aanzet tot strategische vastgoedmanagement in de GGZ sector Mede door de invoering van het nieuwe stelsel en de relatief lage ervaring die de GGZ heeft met strategische vastgoedmanagement, is er met behulp van de onderzoeksresultaten een handleiding opgesteld voor vastgoedmanagers in de GGZ sector. De handleiding is opgesteld op basis van de wetten en regelgevingen van de GGZ in 2010/2011. De handleiding heeft als doel: - de vastgoedportefeuille af te stemmen op de zorggroepen - productfluctuaties beter op te kunnen vangen - langere termijn visies te ontwikkelen voor zowel zorg als vastgoed - Inzichtelijk maken van risico’s - Vertalen van ondernemingsstrategie naar vastgoedstrategie Met behulp van scenario planning kan er een redelijke inschatting gemaakt worden van de toekomst. Twee factoren spelen een prominente rol voor de bepaling van de scenario’s. Namelijk de ontwikkelingen van de GGZ in de zorg context en de financieringen die de GGZ ontvangt van zowel de zorgverzekeraar als de overheid. Op basis van de strategieën en scenario’s wordt in de richtlijnen uitgelegd hoe de strategie uitgevoerd kan worden. Deze stappen dienen zorgvuldig uitgevoerd te worden. Met behulp van de strategie en de organisatie zal er criteria opgesteld worden om de huidige vastgoed portefeuille te ‘testen’. Hieruit zal uitwijzen hoe optimaal de vastgoedportefeuille is afgestemd op de organisatie. De laatste fase van de richtlijnen bestaat uit ‘controleren’. Controleren is een belangrijk aspect. De zorg is een dynamische markt, hierdoor zal de vastgoedportefeuille deze fluctuaties tijdig moeten kunnen opvangen. Daarom zullen de ontwikkelingen van de GGZ zelf en de ontwikkelingen van de financieringen voor de GGZ in de gaten gehouden moeten worden. Op het moment dat deze veranderen, zal ook de vastgoed strategie veranderen. Met het nieuwe financieringsstelsel zal het essentieel van belang worden dat de vastgoedportefeuille afgestemd is op de organisatie. Niet alleen zal het primair proces bevorderd worden, ook zullen de risico’s lager worden en zal de instelling beter in staat zijn om product fluctuaties op te vangen. Hoe eerder de GGZ sector gebruik maakt van strategische vastgoed management des te sneller zij zich meer kunnen concentreren op hun primair proces, de zorg.","Corporate real estate management","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

This included, but was not limited to, the development of the resource estimate; geotechnical assessment of the different rock zones; investigation of potential mining methods; design and optimization of selected mining methods including equipment selection and CAPEX and OPEX estimation; development, optimization and cost estimation of the raw material handling process stream; investigation of potential processing methods; process plant design and capital and operating expenditure estimate; environmental impact assessment (EIA); project risk assessment; market analysis; and project finance. The project was designed with two different mine systems; room-and-pillar and longwall mining. A variation of the room-and-pillar design, referred to as Post room-and-pillar design was also costed. New software to link Microsoft Excel and Gemcom Surpac was developed for this project to allow optimization of the mine design. Over 12,000 individual mine configurations were constructed, validated and measured so that the optimum design was selected. A total of 7 different mining constructs were designed. The transportation of the raw material to the surface is achieved with either trucks or conveyors. The CAPEX and OPEX of mine and/or sized stockpiles were estimated as well as the costs of changing from conveyor to trucks mid-process. In total, 32 different material handling scenarios were fully designed and estimated. The processing technologies for nickel laterite ores were reviewed and heap leaching was selected as the most appropriate. A slight alternative to the normal heap leach design is the creation of two leach pads; a quick leach pad for saprolite ore and a long leach pad for mixed ore. The combination of 7 different mining strategies and 32 materials handling options gave 72 valid options in which the deposit could be mined and processed. The net present value for each option was calculated for production rates ranging from 1000 to 15000 tonnes per day and for cut-of-grade ranging from 0.0% to 1.3% nickel with an ultimate total of 15,192 net present values being calculated.","Nickel; Laterite; Albania","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Resources Engineering","","EMMEP","",""

(mentor)","2011","Spectral analysis of non-stationary signals is known to be a challenging task. Classical methods like the discrete Fourier transform are often inadequate to capture and track periodic content with rapidly changing frequencies. This is basically for two reasons. On one hand, the Fourier transform is intended for expressing frequency content in terms of constant-frequency contributions. On the other hand, the simultaneous accuracy of temporal and spectral localisation is limited by the timefrequency uncertainty principle. This thesis lays out the findings of an explorative study towards potential improvements on time-frequency analysis. Anticipating on the first issue, the concept of time-warping has been explored. By stretching and contraction of pieces of the signal, frequency changes may be ""flattened out"", resulting in improved detection of non-stationary frequencies and much sharper spectra than possible with traditional Fourier analysis. Both linear and non-linear time warping approaches were investigated, together with the required non-uniform interpolation techniques. Application of linear time-warping prior to a Fourier transformation leads to the definition of the Fan chirp transform. This transformation is in essence closely related to the popular short-time Fourier transform, but provides time-frequency basis functions in a fan-geometry rather than a rectangularlytiled grid. The skewed basis functions match the harmonic structure of an instationary component with linearly increasing frequency. The second issue is addressed by considering periodic signals in their entirety rather than by their individual partials (or harmonics, overtones). A novel concept is proposed: timbre analysis. The timbre representation provides means to classify a tonal signal, similar to the way the human ear (which is in fact a remarkably sophisticated Fourier analyser) perceives and identifies sound. It is shown that the instantaneous timbre, obtained by normalisation of the harmonic phases, tends to remain stationary throughout a non-stationary signal. The timbre representation is used to identify components in polyphonic problems, where the signal is a mixture of multiple crossing tonal components. In addition, a pitch tracking technique is proposed that tracks a periodic component based on its timbre. The component can then be isolated and extracted using Vold-Kalman filtering.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

As the company is currently undergoing a transition from serving telecommunications only to expanding its offering to include internet, multimedia and entertainment solutions, the company is getting into a broader and fiercer field of competition. SC Innovation & Strategy is the business unit responsible for delivering innovations matching the overall company strategy. This thesis project revolves around the question of how customers can be effectively involved in the innovation ecosystem through online communities. The POST framework is used to develop a co-creation platform where users submit, comment on, rate and build ideas. The platform is integrated in the existing SC Labs platform, which is already connected to an early adopter community of over 6,000 users. Role-play testing of a working prototype and a short period of beta testing indicate strong potential for most of the input into incremental innovations. The quantity of user contributions is substantial for over 160 ideas and around 300 comments flowing within four weeks. A subset of participants were interviewed in a pre-test and a post-test semi-structured technique. The results revealed an overall acceptance and a high degree of motivation for further participation on the platform. The strongest point of the critique was the low degree of process transparency. Indications that more radical innovations could be produced from the platform are present in some ideas. The focus is on user-generated content. The platform is a space where the user is more powerful than the company. Therefore, direct and targeted challenges should be posed to users through the proposed context framing method where content is asked around a blog entry or news story. Extending the borders of an innovation ecosystem to an expert consumer base has been a successful strategy for several other leading global companies such as Dell, Google and Starbucks. To fully adopt the platform and intertwining it deeper in the innovation process at SIS, for disruptive innovations, and at RES, SME and CBU, for incremental innovations, faster and better innovations are therefore necessary Concluding, the platform needs the support of higher management in the process. If user contributions do not receive this support, they will remain entries on a platform that will become meaningless to its users over time.

(mentor); van de Geer, S. (mentor); van der Gaag, A. (mentor)","2011","Starting in 2011, when the baby boomers will leave the labor market en masse, the first signs of the aging population will become apparent. In the next twenty years the number of people over 65 will increase to 25% of the population, caused by the so-called “double aging society”. The double aging society will increase the demand for care because there will be more senior citizens, but the same elderly will also live longer due to the ever-increasing quality of our healthcare system. Thanks to the improved social economic position of most elderly people it is possible for them to live independently and function on one’s own resources. This independent living will stagnate once elderly are no longer able to move around within their own house. It is therefore important to keep the elderly healthy and mobile. The main reason elderly people call health workers for help is that they start to become immobile. If somebody is no longer able to move around within their own environment, they become dependent on these informal or professional caregivers. One way to maintain mobility is to perform the sit-to-stand (STS) movement more frequently. Deterioration of a person’s mobility becomes apparent for the first time during standing up. The STS movement out of a chair is essential to maintain the muscle function and thereby independence and mobility of people. The STS movement is an activity most people perform many times a day. The capacity of an individual to stand up from a chair is an important indicator of an elderly person’s functional independence. As people are aging, the ability to perform this STS movement gradually deteriorates. To prevent this deterioration and maintain the independence of elderly a product was designed that supports the STS movement while, at the same time, stimulating the remaining muscle power of the user. The market potential to develop a new STS assist is considerable; over 396.500 people in the Netherlands are estimated to experience medium to considerable effort during the STS movement. There is a lack of products that help people to stand up out of their relax furniture without being stigmatizing. Furthermore, many products that help people to stand up do not stimulate the muscles in order to prevent further deterioration. It is clear that there is a need for a product that helps people who are starting to have problems with the STS movement. To respond to this need a product was designed that provides support during the STS movement in a comfortable and ergonomically reliable way. The people, who start to experience problem with the STS movement, are often reluctant to admit that they have STS problems; it is therefore important that the product is not stigmatizing and not perceived as an aid. The product is likely to match their home environment / living room, if not it can be customized. During use of the product the remaining muscle power of the user is used and stimulated. The main aim of the product is to increase the quality of life (independence, comfort, relaxation, safety). During the ideation and conceptualization phase a very broad range of ideas was generated. In the selection process it became clear that an interesting possibility would be to hide the “assist-function” of the product in an all-day product. It was decided that the STS help function is “hidden” in a floor lamp. This will help reduce the stigmatizing character of an aid. An important advantage is that the “assist” is also functional in another way than helping the user to stand up, and the product will not be an obstacle when not in use. The product that is designed and elaborated is named: Relux, it refers to the ability to stand up again (resume, recover, rehabilitate), the light and luxury it brings in the home environment (relux) and the possibility to age in a relaxing way. The Relux can be seen as a bright spot in the aging process. The Relux is a floor lamp that can be used next to comfortable low furniture, it helps the user with the STS movement without necessitating help of a second person and at the same time the user uses their own remaining muscle force. During the STS movement the user is in control of their rise velocity and experience an increased motor- and muscle control while stimulated to bring their center of mass above their base of support, which increases the chance of a natural STS movement. Furthermore, the Relux is stable during intended and unintended use without the necessity to fixate the product in its environment by damaging the surroundings. The Relux is available for use at any time and does not bother the user when it is not in use, thereby maintaining the possibility to perform the STS movement without using the Relux. Concerning the aesthetics, the product does not possess stigmatizing characteristics as often appear in current STS assists. The test participants questioned up till now did not perceive the Relux as an aid and it was gathered that they perceive the Relux as high quality, reliable, and durable but easy to use. The Relux accentuates and shows people what they are still capable of instead of focusing on their disabilities. It does not tell them what they have to do but offers the possibility to perform the STS movement as they used to do when they were younger without offering an aid that can be perceived as stigmatizing by themselves or people around them. The Relux is designed as a lighting fixture, this could imply that the product is less likely to be perceived as an aid. Further (marketing) research amongst the target group should confirm this statement and discover other wishes from this target group. The project is concluded with the building and testing of a prototype, the results were promising and therefore, Welzorg is advised to investigate the possibilities for further development of the Relux.","sit-to-stand movement; lamp; lighting; support; assist; aid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2011","Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) is a means of transportation that offers personal, on-demand non-stop transportation between any two points on a network of specially built guide-ways. It consists of small vehicles able to carry four passengers, combining the advantage of privacy offered by private advantage of cars and the social advantages of public transportation. The company 2Getthere successfully implemented a PRT system in Masdar city last November 2010, providing continuous service between two stations. A future challenge the company has identified, is to be able to increase the occupancy rate of the PRT and the grouping of travellers in a future in which the system will have a higher number of stations. Consequently the purpose of the project “Ride fast, ride together” is to explore and deliver concepts that can trigger and motivate travellers in riding together in PRT, towards those stations that are selected the most. The context of ridesharing has been analysed with literature findings, consult with experts, and creative techniques. The main challenges identified were understanding how to influence the behaviour of the different types of traveller, and how the current use of the system can be improved. In particular, it has been explored how way finding can help guiding and grouping travellers, what structures waiting lines should offer, what layout stations should have and how the layout of interfaces influence decision making. Concepts have been presented by means of scenarios of use, considering the interactions in waiting in lines, booking rides, operating ticket machines and making in use of mobile technologies. During this phase, insights have been gained by observing participants acting out different scenarios and taking into account the pros and cons of every different situation. The final design proposal is an engaging, rewarding and motivating service that stimulates travellers in riding PRT together in order to gain credits and prizes. The proposal consists of a platform gate that triggers travellers with catchy claims, an internal PRT interface linked to a mobile application with which travellers can gain credits in addition to organizing their journeys. Furthermore, a scalability plan has been proposed where the way-finding solution, ticketing machines and a full mobile application to organize and book journeys has been designed. As a conclusion for the project, the steps the designer went through in order to come up with the final proposal are presented, with detailed images, and results from the user tests. An evaluation of the project and the process is presented together with final acknowledgments.","PRT; interaction design; automated transport; ridesharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","This report presents the design research and final design of the Transparency concept. The transparency concept is a solution for the current claustrophobic galley space and reduces the feeling of waiting while boarding the plane. By using a mobile app to order and pay for the drinks during the flight, the cabin crew can serve the passengers quicker and easier. From the Internet research that has been done can be concluded that the flight experience can be improved by creating an extra service for the passengers. The kindness and quality of the cabin crew are important elements for how the passengers experience their flight. The questionnaire conclusions show that the current galley space is too claustrophobic during the boarding process, the atmosphere is impersonal, the space is not inviting and the waiting line is too long and boring. The interviews show that the waiting line develops frustration and anger and the solution for this would be more entertainment. From the literature “The psychology of waiting lines, written by David H. Meister” this result can be substantiated and explained as ‘Occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time’. Creative sessions with designers, non-designers and engineers from Driessen Zodiac Aerospace showed that more transparency in the galley space and more transparency between the passengers and the flight crew would improve the flight experience. The passengers will feel more at ease and the threshold to ask questions or call the cabin crew by their names would be lower then it currently is. According to the results from the creative sessions, it is better to let the galley space be more part of the interior of the rest of the plane. The literature ‘The psychology of waiting lines by David H. Meister”, “it depends: Moderating the relationship among perceived waiting time, anger and regret by Clay M. Voorhees” and “Enriching by Pieter Desmet” concluded that waiting stands between consumers and the accomplishment of desired goals; therefore, it often creates a sense of frustration. It also shows that the more valuable the service, the longer the costumer will wait for it. According to the product manager at KLM, creating a more pleasant galley space can possibly also cheer up the cabin crew, which makes their work easier. Currently the cabin crew is responsible for a friendly welcome and a trustful feeling for the passengers so their mood is very important for the passengers flight experience. The questionnaire with some members of the cabin crew of KLM concluded that some kind of self-service for the passengers would be helpful for the flight crew. Instead of walking around asking what everybody wants to drinks, they can choose what and when they want something to drink themselves. All these conclusions lead to nine different design direction which delivered 22 ideas and based on these ideas, 3 concepts were worked out: (1) Connect the galley, concept based on an open kitchen principle, (2) the Info Zapper, a device that presents info about the objects you aim it at, and (3) the info space, a galley space that provides information on screens in the galley and on the trolleys. The concept selection is based on poster feedback sessions, meeting with the client and a requirement checklist. The ‘connect the galley’ concept came out as most suited for this project. A redesigned version of this concept is the ‘Transparency concept’ The ‘Transparency concept’ is new, social, informative, innovative and open. It creates the opportunity for passengers to have conversations with each other while staying in their seats, see the flight crew at work during the flight, order drinks and pay for it with their mobile phones and have the ability to look at the seat area while boarding the plane instead of a solid wall that creates a claustrophobic feeling. The flight crew can work from their ‘open kitchen’, see the orders on the screen in the galley space instead of walking around and ask for it and they don’t have to bring cash because the payments are done digitally. For Driessen this concept is very interesting because the order screen inside the galley is an add-on for the electric panel that will be redesigned the next few years. Also the transparent wall is an ideal solution for the claustrophobic and isolated atmosphere in the galley space that fits within the production capabilities of Driessen Zodiac Aerospace. For the airliners, this concept can be interesting because the interaction between the flight crew and the passengers is better then with the current setup. The overall flight experience of the passengers will be perceived as more positive which is good for the airliner’s image.","Galley Space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

This product for the educational market combines pressure sensitive reflective LCD technology with Wacom’s pen technology. Right at the start of this project users have been introduced to these technologies. They could experience them in first hand by using the Palette v1.0 prototype, which originated from a previous project for Wacom Europe GmbH. The Palette v1.0 prototype was used during 5 focus group sessions and during these session a total of 21 insights have been captured. After each session the insights were summarized in the form of insight cards in “cartoon style“. These insight cards were used as discussion guidelines and provided inspiration and structure throughout the separate focus group sessions. Based on the outcomes of the focus group sessions functional changes to the device setup were made and tested in an early prototype: Palette v1.1. This new design was validated and a high fidelity prototype was made: Palette v2.0. This prototype was also the end result of this project. Based on the insights gathered with Palette v1.0 & v1.1 a new product design was made and prototyped by using the SLS rapid prototyping technique. This prototype is fully functional, operates through a wireless interface and the functional components were integrated. The general look and feel, size, weight and functionality was as close to an engineering sample as possible. During the final user tests 5 participants evaluated the product in 3 separate controlled sessions. 3 participants were new to the Palette concept, but all the participants were enthusiastic about the new Palette v2.0. Its has opened a whole new world interactive possibilities for them.

The objective of this thesis is to find out how the long term (decadal) evolution is affected by the intensity of hurricanes and by various recovery factors. In order to investigate the long term behavior of barrier islands a model train of a coupled storm impact model and a recovery model is created. The erosion events are modeled by making use of the depth averaged 2DH model XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009). The recovery phase in between hurricanes is modeled with a newly developed recovery model. The model train is calibrated with 8 years (2002 – 2010) of data from the Chandeleur islands, Louisiana, USA.","hurricanes; recovery; numerical modelling; model train; Chandeleur Islands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","A rational decision-making under risk is based on two conditions, modeled risk and completed information. However, due to the nature of real estate development, complex, unique and dynamic, it is difficult for developers to obtain relevant historical data and consequently the probability cannot be readily calculated. They have to deal with the unexpected circumstances which change constantly within development process. Fast track construction has received considerable attention with its’ time related benefitover the last decade. By design and construction phase overlapping and work packages overlapping, its time saving feature has placed it as a possible alternative to the traditional more sequential method. But fast track construction often results in unexpected extra cost and does not necessarily lead to shorter project duration. In this research the hybrid cross-impact analysis (CIA) model is developed to assist developers in risk-based decision-making. The aim of the CIA method is to refine the probabilities relating to the occurrence of individual future developments to the point that these probabilities can be used either as the basis for planning or as the basis for developing scenarios that subsequently can be used in planning. The hybrid CIA model integrates the strengths of two major practitioners of the CIA method, INTERAX and BASICS model, which can avoid fatiguing and tedious data collection and generate internally consistent scenarios to identify conditions leading to major changes in fast track construction project. Furthermore, with aid of Monte Carlo simulation the hybrid CIA model can also quick response to dynamic situation changes in real estate development projects.","decision-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-23","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor)","2011","Heden ten dage zijn er onoverzichtelijk veel verschillende klimaatinstallaties. Deze installaties geven vaak problemen in verschillende fasen van het bouwproces, zo ook in de ontwerpfase. In dit werk is een selectie van meest voorkomende installaties in de woningbouw integraal onderzocht in haar omgeving om de thermische en energetische prestaties vast te stellen. Om deze installaties te kunnen onderzoeken is er voor gekozen om zelf een computermodel op te zetten op basis van de Eindige Elementen Methode, waarin zowel het bouwfysische als het installatietechnische onderdeel zijn gemodelleerd. Het model is iteratief in overleg met bouwfysische en installatietechnische adviseurs tot stand gekomen. Het model is gevalideerd met behulp van VABI, door handmatige nacalculaties, en door vergelijkingen met andere reeds voor handen zijnde referenties. Uit het computermodel blijkt dat de thermostaat van grote invloed is op het gewenste binnenklimaat. Veel thermostaten meten enkel de luchttemperatuur en regelen de installaties dus niet op basis van de operatieve temperatuur. Hierdoor slaan luchtverwarmingsinstallaties te snel af, terwijl vloer- en wandverwarming te laat afslaat. Bij een regeling op basis van de operatieve temperatuur is de opwarming bij vloerverwarming nog steeds traag ten opzichte van radiatoren, terwijl (lokaal opgewekte) wand- en luchtverwarming 15 tot 30% sneller verwarmt. Dit komt doordat de laatste twee de warmte direct afgeven aan het vertrek, terwijl de ‘zware’ installaties eerst een watervoerend pakket en andere massa moeten verwarmen. ‘Zware’ installaties kennen dan ook nog steeds meer overshoot en energiegebruik als gevolg daarvan. Luchtverwarming gebruikt meer energie, omdat deze een ventilator gebruikt. Elektrische wandverwarming kent vergelijkbare energetische prestaties als radiatoren. Een warmtepomp (WP) verbruikt de minste primaire energie, maar kent zo een laag vermogen dat ze continue aan moet staan voor een goede verwarming. Tevens hebben ventilatie-installaties als warmteterugwinning (WTW) en vraagsturing (VS) invloed op de opwarming en het energieverbruik. VS zorgt ervoor dat er voor dat er bij afwezigheid maar 10% warmte verloren gaat t.o.v. 30% bij WTW en warmt dus sneller op. WTW kent echter minder energieverbruik, omdat deze ook bij aanwezigheid functioneert en dan ook tot 70% van de warmte terugwint. Onderzoek naar gebruikerspatronen heeft opgeleverd dat het continue laten aanstaan van de verwarming in een goed geïsoleerd gebouw 10 tot 15 % meer energie kost. Het kost slechts 1% wanneer ook WTW wordt toegepast. Tenslotte blijkt voor de zomer van belang dat er warmere zomers bestaan dan waar de normen nu rekening mee houden en die dus regelmatig overschreden worden. Verder blijkt het vermogen van koeling ontzettend van belang, omdat temperatuuroverschrijding vaak met grote warmtelasten gepaard gaat. Men moet tevoren preventief koelen om aan de normen te voldoen. Als het koelvermogen dan ook nog gering is, zoals bij een WP het geval is, is het moment dat de WP aanvangt met koelen vaak al te laat. Daarbij blijkt elektrische koeling bij een hogere setpoint (dus niet preventief) vergelijkbare energetische en thermische prestaties te behalen als een WP-koeling. Een regeling op basis van de operatieve temperatuur kan 10 tot 20% energie besparen bij veel verwarmingsinstallaties. Het verdient aandacht om regelingen door te ontwikkelen en aan te passen. Elektrische installaties blijken een betere thermische prestatie te kunnen leveren voor de opwarming. In combinatie met aanwezigheidsdetectie kan het 10 tot 15% energie besparen te opzicht van andere verwarmingsinstallaties. Echter gezien het primaire energieverbruik van elektrische energie is het dan gunstiger om continue te verwarmen met bijv. aardgas of zelfs een WP, in combinatie met WTW, omdat dan helemaal niet meer opgewarmd hoeft te worden en dit slechts 1% meer energie kost. Voor koeling is er nog geen comfortabel alternatief voor handen. Verder verdient het aanbeveling om andere klimaatjaren als referentie te gebruiken.","installaties; comfort; klimaatinstallaties; binnenklimaat","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Beemster, M. (mentor)","2011","A compiler translates one representation of a software program into another. Beside translation compilers often have other tasks such as optimizating the result and warning the programmer for mistakes. Internally a compiler uses an Intermediate Representation (IR) for analysis and manipulation of the program at hand. Data dependencies in most programming languages are implicit. Some compilers use an IR in Static Single Assignment (SSA) in which each local variable is only defined once to simplify analysis of data dependencies. If the number of assignments in the IR is not restricted, it is said to be in normal form. Input of a compiler is in normal form and translation is needed to bring the IR in SSA form. SSA-form contains phi functions to merge values based on control flow. After optimizations on SSA-form are performed it is not trivial to translate SSA-form back to normal form because the properties of phi nodes cannot be translated directly to processor instructions. The algorithms of Briggs and Sreedhar are the two major methods of back-translation. This thesis presents a modification that can be applied to the methods of Briggs and Sreedhar. The original methods append copy instructions to the end of existing source blocks. The presented modification splits edges between source and target by inserting phiblocks where the algorithms of Sreedhar and Briggs emit copy operations to replace phi functions. For this study a bridge between LLVM and CoSy was built such that LLVM can be used for the optimizations on SSA-form and CoSy for the post back-translation optimizations. Four back-translation algorithms are implemented in CoSy. The methods are compared through experiments with six testcases from the SPEC benchmark suite. On average the presented modification reduces the execution time of the resulting code with 5% for Briggs’ method and 3% for Sreedhar’s method. Experiments also show that the result of back-translation with or without phiblocks is suboptimal: repeating optimizations after back-translation that were already done on the IR in SSA-form can reduce the execution time on average with 18%.","SSA; LLVM; CoSy; back-translation; Briggs; Sreedhar; phiblocks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

The strategy for the future of Hof van Delfland response to the changes in rural landscape and developments for policy for these kind of areas, to be specific: - the transformation towards a post modern rural landscape - the next step for the bufferzone - and the search for metropolitan or regional landscapes and parks This graduation project is bound on the theme of production and consumption in the landscape; which results in the research question: What should be the new patterns for production and consumption in a metropolitan landscape development dealing with a rural identity? With this research question a general and location specific leads to different tasks for the strategy for Hof van Delft: results of these researches are the base for the interventions to define new and strengthen patterns in production and consumption for Hof van Delfland. First the problems in the existing productive landscape ( dairy farming) will lead to a program of demands for the production landscape: an innovation in dairy farming to maintain the quality of the landscape, which the dairy farming brings today. Second the research in the existing consumption and future consumption has lead to the following tasks in the landscape; the accommodation of the rural experience, strengthen the recreational edges more with the rural identity, accessibility of the landscape, bringing broadening of farms to the next level and at last to integrate the spatial effect of the ‘horsification’ of the landscape . Third, the productive and consumptive changes on the scale of the yard ( scale increase, broadening of farms, change of function) have had a huge effect on the embedding of the -mostly idealized- farm yard; yards that became ‘footloose’ from the landscape. This means it’s time for design for yard and farm. This research has lead to the motto for intervention: LUST = NUT and NUT=LUST. It is about integrating production and consumption in landscape, infrastructure, buildings and yards. It will be the transformation from a rural landscape with recreational edges into a productive landscape with a rural –consumptive- park structure. The design assignment is about to accommodate the rural experience. This rural experience give specific spatial interventions showed into three projects to develop Rural Park Hof van delfland. This three projects will be explored in the center part of the area, which shows generic solutions for the whole Hof van Delfland: The first intervention is about what the entrances should be for a rural park. On the higher level (regional and national) the area will have a local ‘food’ transferium/market next to the A4. Were not only cars can be parked to go into the rural park by bike or by feed, but local food can be collected and distributed from farmers, horticultural industry and private to citizens, restaurants caterers etc Next to that on the lower level the area will get its park meaning of a park in-between the urban structure ( a front position) instead of a backyard of the cities. This will by done by a design of –some - the entrances of the park. The second intervention will deal with the recreational edges: by giving it more meaning by a more rural use which connects it better to the rural land and use this area to develop the –needed- horse facilities The last intervention is the main project. It is about the transformation in organization of the farmland dealing with the problems in the diary farming. This project will give the strategy for the rural land which will bring not only organizational solutions but will mainly bring a transformation in the spatial structure of the infrastructure, yards and buildings in the rural land, which will bring the main park structure. This will be draw up in three cases: the rural park structure, the yard transformed to a civilian yard and the boerenhof 2.0 The boerenhof 2.0 is the project where NUT and LUST is used as the main strategy for future in dairy farming. This projects is elaborated on the scale of architecture. In this project the rural experience exists out of getting acquainted with the modern sustainable dairy farming on the one hand. And on the other hand experience the pleasure of the rural land by broadening functions like a Spa, education and a accommodation and horse riding facilities. The experience of this program is housed in a new barn structure by connecting stables and barns to each other by a wooden roof structure. These projects mostly are small interventions that can be implied and work separately, but together they will bring the rural experience that is needed for an agricultural future for this area. The architectural project is the main key project that enhances the future as an agricultural area. Using the motto of Nut and Lust it brings the answer for a future farm and a future rural area in a metropolitan landscape development by enhancing existing qualities.","rural landscape; metropolitan landscape; future for dairy farming; Hof van Delfland; production and consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-01","Architecture","Urbanism + Architecture","","Urban acupuncture","",""

(mentor)","2011","This thesis explores the decision making process about the implementation of a new train safety system at ProRail. ProRail is responsible for the entire rail infrastructure of the Netherlands and faces tasks such as maintaining, optimising and replacing the infrastructure. One of ProRail’s current projects concerns aged train safety systems and they must be replaced before 2018, because the economic and technical life-cycle will come to an end. A general choice between two families of train safety systems has to be established. In addition, reliability and safety may diminish if the aged train safety systems are not replaced on time. One of ProRail’s incentives is to maintain maximum availability and safety of the railway infrastructure for transport companies, therefore this project can be considered as a very important project. The endurance of the decision making process constitutes ten years and is still ongoing. Therefore, we are intrigued to find out why the endurance of this process is relatively long and what factors contribute towards this issue, this research will help to answer this challenging question. To answer this explorative research question, two rounds of interviews were performed. The first round of semi-structured pre-interviews included three participants at various hierarchical levels. These pre-interviews were conducted to acquire background information about the decision making process. With the help of ‘discourse analysis’ most important features influencing the decision making process were found. The second round of semi-structured interviews is an extension of the first round of pre-interviews. In that case seventeen interviews were performed of all functional groups and hierarchical levels within ProRail that are involved in the decision making process. This round focused upon the factors that were gained during the first round of pre-interviews. Again discourse analysis was used as an analytical tool in order to establish key-points that have an effect upon the decision making process. Furthermore, a comprehensive literature study was conducted about five theories, namely principal-agent theory, contingency theory, resource dependency theory, transaction cost economics and social network theory. These theories were used in order to give meaning towards the results. This exploratory study adds perspective towards the decision making process at ProRail. The results from discourse analysis ascertained that organisational structure, communication, group decision making, inconsistency and culture influence the speed of the decision making process. It is worth mentioning that these key-points have a reinforcing effect upon one another. Furthermore, culture can be regarded as an independent variable influencing the decision making process. This explorative study adds new and improved perspectives on scientific and managerial aspects. Still, this study also bears with some limitations. Due to the small sample size, the most likely categories influencing the decision making process are far from generalization. Another important note, the study did not analyse external parties that are involved in the decision making process. However, the explorative nature of this study does supply a first large building block on this topic, which will have an informative character towards ProRail.","decision making process; discourse analysis; social network theory; contingency theory; group decision making; company culture; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-14","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organisation, Law & Gaming","","","",""

(mentor); van Oudheusden, B.W. (mentor); Ghaemi, S. (mentor)","2011","In the past, different modifications of trailing-edges have been investigated with the aim to reduce noise emissions. One promising solution, which has been shown to reduce the intensity of trailing-edge noise, is the application of so-called sawtooth serrations with different proportions and sizes. Current research aims at applying new tools of flow field interrogation, first of all tomographic PIV, to the problem of trailing-edge noise and at creating links between the phenomenological description of the flow field in terms of coherent structures and noise spectra in order to improve understanding of the noise generating mechanisms. In the framework of this thesis, sawtooth serrations applied to a NACA 0012 airfoil have been investigated and compared to the straight trailing-edge of the unmodified NACA 0012 baseline model. Acoustic far-field, surface pressure and a series of PIV measurements have been performed for this purpose. In a first step, acoustic far-field measurements on a large selection of serrated models have been performed. On one hand, tonal narrowband noise associated to the shedding of vortices from the blunt parts of the trailing-edge poses a large penalty for the reduction in overall sound pressure level. On the other hand, the acoustic measurements have indicated a small reduction in noise level originating from the serrated trailing-edge for frequencies in the broadband spectrum exceeding the tonal range, which is in agreement with Howe’s theory of trailingedge noise. Overall, a decrease in total sound pressure level could not be observed. In a second step, PIV measurements of the boundary layer close to the trailing-edge have been performed in order to identify a subset of coherent structures, which can be linked to the production of noise and in particular to the production of tonal noise. Large coherent structures appearing close to the trailing-edge or in between the serrations have been visualized, dominate in terms of vorticity level and show the shape of horseshoe vortices. Most of these structures show a large spanwise coherence on the order of the distance between two serrations and reappear at the frequency of the tonal noise. This suggests a link between this category of coherent structures and the tonal noise observed in the acoustic spectra.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Terwel, K.C. (mentor); Bos, M.J. (mentor)","2011","The main objective of this graduation project was designing a feasible load bearing structure for the Rotating Tower, within the set boundary conditions given by the architectural design. The concept “Rotating Tower” is developed by the Italian architect David Fisher. The main idea behind this concept is: the building of the future. Mr. Fisher translated this idea into the design of the Rotating Tower: a tower with separate rotating floors. The tower consists of multiple (non-circular) floors that can rotate independent around a common axis. Since all floors rotate independent, the building can (theoretically) transform into every shape imaginable. The original design of the Rotating Tower (designed for target city Dubai) has a height of approximately 435 meter. To get a more detailed view of previous designed load bearing structures 3 reference project with comparable height were analysed. Different load cases were analysed and used in the calculation for the structure: dead load, live load, wind load and earthquake load. In this analysis local conditions for Dubai are taken into account. The current design of the stabilizing core for the Rotating Tower does not meet any of the requirements given in the codes. Therefore different solutions for stiffening and strengthening the structure were investigated. Most striking solutions are: higher concrete grade, thicker core, activating steel structure of the storeys and active systems. With the results of the optimization analysis 5 different feasible designs were made for the stability structure of the Rotating Tower. All these designs have one or more adaptations from the architects design. 3 of the 5 alternative designs are considered to be the most relevant for the project and are presented as “final designs”. These 3 final designs are worked out to a more detailed level. The main conclusion of this thesis report covers the structural feasibility of the project. For several designs it is shown that the project is feasible from a structural point of view but not without adapting the architectural design. All alternatives contain one or more adaptations to the architectural design, but keep the main concept of the project unchanged.","Rotating Tower; Feasibility; Dubai; Structural design; Concrete core","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Introduction Low Impact Development (LID) is an alternative approach in managing stormwater runoff. Its main philosophy is to replicate the pre-development hydrological properties of water catchment. It seeks to first infiltrate, filter, store and retaining the surface runoff near to its source before draining it to downstream. Some of the common LIDs include green roofs, permeable pavement, vegetated swales, infiltration drains, bioretention cells (also known as rain gardens). While LID seems to be a viable solution to reduce the flooding problem, we would like to investigate its performance after the LID (in particular infiltration drain system) has been put into operation for some time. A case study in Prinsejagt, Eindhoven will be used as data from previous studies is available to allow for comparison on the performance of infiltration drains after ~10 years of installation. Problem definition Infiltration drain has been used in Netherlands quite extensive, it is important to find out its current performance after years of operation. Existing researches or studies of infiltration drain system concentrate on its performance when it is newly installed. Studies that look into performance of an existing system which has been put into operation for quite some time are still quite rare. Research My research focused on determining the percentage reduction in exfiltration rate at the measurement site as compared to initial readings derived from previous research. It involves the monitoring of water levels at the same locations of the infiltration (IT) drain system in Prinsejagt (as carried out the previous monitoring scheme in 2003) and to carry out IT drain model simulations. In addition, we also conducted closed-loop test at four selected stretches of infiltration pipes to ascertain the exfiltration properties of the particular stretch of pipe. First, we seek to explain the phenomenon observed at our monitoring site qualitatively before applying quantitative approaches (like graphical, curve-fitting and simulation methods) to assess the percentage reduction in exfiltration rates at the monitoring locations. Based on the projected clogging rate, simulations were carried out to predict the future system exfiltration rate. Results 1. System behaviour (of the IT drains network) coupled with the influence of groundwater level determine the overall performance of the IT drain system. 2. Individual IT pipes exhibit more varied rates of exfiltration (due to different localized conditions) 3. Verified that linear mathematical function can adequately describe the water level trends to an accuracy of 0.01m RMSE for all monitoring locations 4. Observed a 9.4% drop in exfiltration rate [L3/T] in the IT drain model. By 2021, the exfiltration rate is expected to drop by 20% from its starting value. Conclusions and recommendations Regular maintenanceto clear the accumulated sediment inside IT drains and thereafter monitoring of performanceshould be carried out so as to determine its effectivenessin increasing the overall permeability.Moreover, water quality monitoring in IT drain system could be implemented to prevent any contamination to groundwater resources. In lowering the pipe invert level of the entire IT system, the IT system performance can be enhanced during low groundwater period.","infiltration drain system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

Mimetic Discretization Methods on the other hand combine concepts from the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and provide a uni_ed and straightforward approach to model any physical _eld problem. Mimetic Methods aim at preserving as much as possible the structure of a PDE by 'mimicking' at the discrete level, important properties of the continuous realm, such that symmetries and conserved quantities are preserved. Central in this framework is the relation between physics and geometry. The Mimetic Discretization approach developed in this thesis is based upon B-splines1 for representing the unknown _eld variables. Besides inheriting all advantages from the IsoGeometric Analysis framework, B-splines appear as a natural basis for Mimetic Discretization Methods. They can be seen as higher order Whitney forms and provide vector spaces which are discretely conservative by construction. The resulting discretization approach resembles a Finite Volume Method on a staggered grid for the representation of the conservation laws and a Finite Element Method for the representation of the constitutive equations. In short, the scheme features the following advantages, - exact geometry description and tight integration with CAD; - fundamentally a higher order approach, featuring spectral like convergence. In practice though, IGA is con_ned to low or medium order due to bad conditioning of inner product mass matrices as a function of the polynomial order; - increased continuity resulting in continuous representations of _eld variables and derivatives; - a strong indication exists that these methods automatically meet the inf-sup conditions, leading to naturally stable discretizations of any physical problem; - local conservation of primal variables (strong) and secondary variables (weak); - in contrast to FVM and FEM which describe variables only locally, the Mimetic discretization is induced with a global topology which makes it possible to make useful decompositions of _eld variables.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor)","2011","The purpose of this thesis is to compare the Hull-White short rate model to the Cheyette short rate model. The Cheyette short rate model is a stochastic volatility model, that is introduced to improve the fit of the implied volatility skew to the market skew. Both models are implemented with piecewise constant parameters to match the term structure. We calibrate the Cheyette model to the EURO, USD and KRW swaption markets and compare the calibration results to the Hull-White model. We propose an efficient implementation method to speed up the calibration process. In general we see that the Cheyette model gives indeed a better fit, in particular for the EURO and KRW markets. The models with calibrated parameters are used to price exotic interest rate derivatives by Monte Carlo simulation. Comparing the results of the Cheyette model to the results of the Hull-White model, can give insight in the skew and curvature impact on exotic interest rate derivatives. We consider digital caplets, digital caps, range accrual swaps, callable range acrruals and a callable remaining maturity swap. The price impact on digital caplets and digital caps are in line with static replication. By this we mean that the prices computed with static replication are better matched by the Cheyette model than by the Hull-White model. For the callable range accrual on LIBOR we have to be more careful, since a one-factor model cannot be calibrated to two market skews per option maturity. This implies that the price of the underlying range accrual is not in line with static replication, since we calibrate to co-terminal swaptions, while the underlying depends on the cap market. For the callable remaining maturity swap we do not encounter this issue, since the underlying depends on the same co-terminal swaption skews. For a callable RMS we observe that the Hull and White model underestimates the option price, compared to the Cheyette model.","short rate model; stochastic volatility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Numerical analysis","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2011","In modern day Formula One, aerodynamics has become the key performance differentiator. The two tools used for the aerodynamic design are the wind tunnel and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). For a rapid development rate, it is crucial to use these tools as effciently as possible. The goal of this thesis is to improve the optimization methodology at the CFD department of Lotus Renault GP (LRGP). This is a challenge because CFD simulations are expensive; they require a relatively large amount of wall clock time to complete and in addition there is a restriction on the number of runs that can be carried out. This restriction was agreed upon between the Formula One teams to reduce the cost of the sport. The pre-existing optimization methodology makes extensive use of the design of experiments (DOE) approach, in which the design space is filled with a set of points that are run in CFD. The results are then analyzed and the best design is chosen, possibly followed by tweaking it manually to improve the performance. Two approaches are investigated to improve upon this methodology and two CFD test cases are set up to assess them. The idea of the first approach is to make use of local optimization algorithms. Gradient-free and gradient-based algorithms are investigated. SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming) methods are found to be the most efficient solver.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The storm surge also entered the bay through the inlets causing great damage along the bay and the port of Houston. Because of the high probability that a hurricane would strike again the “Ike Dike” was developed. The concept consists of heightening and extending the floodwall on Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. Barriers will be placed at the San Luis Pass and Bolivar Roads inlet whereas the Rollover Pass might be closed completely. The Bolivar Roads barrier will be a combination between a floodgate and a lifting gate structure. During non-storm conditions, when the gates are open, the flow area through the inlets are expected to reduce up to 40-60% due to the barriers. The reduction of flow area can cause a decrease of the tidal prism and tidal range. Also current velocities are expected to increase near the barriers and decrease in the main bay. The residence time of fresh water in the bay is expected to increase and the salinity to decrease. The reduction of the tidal prism, tidal range and current speeds can cause a redistribution of the sediment from marshes and flats to the channels within the bay. The blocking of sediment from the Mexican Gulf by the barriers can further enhance this. Changes of the hydrodynamics, water quality and morphology in the bay could potentially result in loss of habitat and disturb the ecology. A 2D hydrodynamic model has been created in order to investigate the impact of the barriers on the tidal prism, tidal range and circulation in the bay. The morphology and water quality of the bay are investigated qualitatively using literature, reference projects and the outcomes of the 2D model. It is concluded that a 40-60% decrease of the flow area at the Bolivar Roads entrance affects the hydrodynamics of the Galveston Bay. To mitigate or prevent these effects the design could be altered such that the flow area is reduced by less 20%, because the impacts of such a barrier are relatively small. Another mitigating solution could be to build compartment dams to preserve the tidal range.","Galveston Bay; barrier; Ike Dike; hydrodynamics; morphology; water quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

This type of person, and there are millions of us, have an unusual pre-occupation with cars. And sometimes it’s not at all rational. Indeed we are talking about people of all ages, and all walks of life, who are certifiably car-crazy. Why are people so car-crazy?” (TV Show The people behind the cars) Passion for the automobile is an inspiring and worldwide phenomenon. What makes a car so special and why is it so much fun? Why do people love cars? What is that experience that car owners have, especially car enthusiasts with their beloved classic car and hobby project? “The real challenges of car design are going to be addressing the future generations’ perceptions of what they want car’s to be in their lives. They are kind of like avatars, how to show myself to the outside world through this car.” (Chris Bangle) HEYNSDYK SPORTS CARS Heynsdyk’s philosophy is developing open 2-seater sports cars based on an existing chassis through traditional production technologies and providing a both raw and pure building and driving experience for the user. Re-using the 944 chassis, powertrain and driveline extends the life cycle of the existing parts and shows that a passion for special cars can very well be combined with a sustainable solution. Heynsdyk offers the client the possibility to participate in the (dis-)assembling process and by working on such a great project, addressing his or her (hidden) creativity. It is about having fun, getting dirt under your nails and experiencing something new. LOVE Love is “a rewarding, dynamic, and long-term relationship people build with special products they own and use” (Russo, 2006). Love is best described as a relationship. How can we inspire designers to design for love and foster rewarding, long-term, affective, emotionally stable and, ultimately, sustainable person-product relationships? Russo identified a number of aspects related to the experience of love that are relevant to the field of design:  Components of love: passion, intimacy, commitment  Interaction & factors  Relationships over time: attraction > building > continuation > deterioration > break-up PRODUCT AND EMOTION Emotion is a central quality of human existence and most of our behavior, motivation, and thought is enriched with and influenced by emotions. A product, or using a product, can elicit a wide range of emotions. Ignoring the emotional side of product experience would therefore be like denying that these products are designed, bought and used by humans. Within the research-pillar of User Experience, research concerning the Design & Emotion and Designing for a Love Experience has led to theoretical frameworks of emotional processes concerning user-product interaction. Understanding how to design for a user-product love experience can provide designers with better communicative tools and insights useful for enhancing product usability and future design projects. The combination of design and psychology stimulates researchers to bridge the gap between behavioral sciences and design practice. Designing products that have an added emotional value requires an approach that focuses on appraisals and concerns. The Appraisal theory uses the factors stimulus, concern, appraisal and emotion. In short, when a person perceives a stimulus (which can be a product) he or she immediately appraises the situation (‘Is this good or bad for me?’) using a stock of concerns. After the appraisal the user experiences an emotion and possibly acts on this (Desmet). A stimulus can be a product or product feature which elicits a certain user-product interaction, after which the user immediately experiences a positive or negative emotion, based on the appraisal he or she has made. This approach provides an addition to the established and conventional ways of designing and engineering. REASON OF EXISTENCE Heynsdyk Sports Cars and Delft University of Technology want to benefit from the synergy of academic theory and automotive practice. My objective is to develop a feasible car concept based on a loveable character. I want the user to be involved with the car from the very start so that he or she can develop a relationship with it in such a way that the car and the user are part of each other’s identity and legacy. DESIGN TOOL Determine the type of relationship you want to design for and you will know the different phases the user will go through with that product. The next step consists of giving qualitative descriptions of the most relevant user-product interactions in that relationship. These descriptions combined provide the designer with the desired list of product characteristics and the desired product character which answers to the user’s concerns and facilitate the love experience: Phase 1: Attraction  Context: seeing the car for the first time, knowing it is yours  Essence: reflecting approachability  Characteristics: familiar, accessible, expressive Phase 2a: Building  Context: working together, blood, sweat, tears, perseverance  Essence: progressive battle  Characteristics: stubborn, confrontational, moldable Phase 2b: 1st Test Drive  Context: high expectations of the end-result, inevitable moment  Essence: resisted receptiveness  Characteristics: strong will, impressible Phase 3: Continuation  Context: creating memories, driving intuitively  Essence: sincere dominance  Characteristics: trustworthy, loyal, honest A LOVEABLE CHARACTER I concluded my research with an analogy that provided me with a character-development or narration: THE DRESSAGE HORSE  Phase 1: Attraction Seeing each other for the first time, finding that one horse, soul mate, knowing it is already yours, raw and untouched in the wild, familiar and expressive  Phase 2a: Building Working together, blood, sweat and tears, perseverance, confronting you with your pros and cons, formable, recalcitrant, progressive battle  Phase 2b: 1st Test drive High expectations of the end-result, inevitable moment, resisting, admissible, strong individual, that long expected first ride on its back  Phase 3: Continuation Context: creating memories, driving intuitively driving & owning, winning contests, merged intuition earned each other’s trust: two bodies, one mind","automotive; love; emotion; heynsdyk; van overbeeke","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-09","Industrial Design Engineering","ID","","Section DA","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Savov, B.V. (mentor)","2011","The coast of Bulgaria is subject to erosion. Because of this fact, around the town of Balchik, which is situated on the Black Sea coast, almost no sandy beaches are present. Last years there have been vast tourist developments in and around Balchik. Because of these developments, the province demands solutions to adapt coastal protection structures to become more attractive regarding recreation. In this study, a small pilot project on the creation of an artificial beach will be described. One possible source of nourishment sand is to dredge it from the local bottom. However, this sand is too fine to form a stable beach without a breakwater in front of it for protection. In this study is investigated whether it is technically feasible to use a floating breakwater to protect the new proposed beach in Balchik. In order to do this, the following approach is followed. A description of the current situation as well as boundary conditions regarding wind, waves, water level, bathymetry and sediment properties is given. Next, the maximum allowed wave height to form a stable beach is determined by means of sediment transport calculations in cross-shore and longshore direction and several possible nourishment sand sizes are considered. In order to lower the incoming waves (boundary conditions) to the maximum allowed wave conditions, a floating breakwater with a certain transmission coefficient is necessary. An investigation on possible types of floating breakwaters is made and the possibilities to produce the floating breakwater are described. From the types of breakwaters found, the most suitable type is selected. The last step is to determine the required dimensions and offshore distance of the floating breakwater in order to achieve the required transmission coefficient. If the required dimensions stay within reasonable limits, it can be concluded that it is technically feasible to use a floating breakwater as beach protection. It is chosen to use concrete caissons to create the floating breakwater, because of the fact that in the vicinity of the project location a company is located which can produce floating concrete structures. Regarding beach nourishment materials, the equilibrium beach profiles with mean grain diameters 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0 mm are considered. It is chosen to further elaborate the case of the locally available sand with a mean grain diameter of 0.1 mm, because for this sand a floating breakwater is necessary in order to stabilize the nourishment. The other two sediment sizes may form a stable beach without a breakwater in place. In order to determine the required dimensions of the floating breakwater, a distance of 200 m between the floating breakwater and the coastline is chosen. With the aid of a literature study on floating breakwater dimensions it is found that for this particular location and governing wave conditions, the draft of the floating breakwater is the governing parameter which determines the transmission coefficient. The breadth of the structure is determined by stability requirements. In this design, it is assumed that the breakwater is fixed in space, which is, regarding the main outline of the design, a reasonable assumption. The result of the study is a preliminary design of a beach nourishment with a volume of 91,000 m3 which is protected by a 240 m long floating breakwater consisting of three elements. The final conclusion of this study is that it is technically feasible to use a floating breakwater as beach protection measure.","floating breakwater; coastal erosion; beach protection; coastal protection; Balchik; Bulgaria; Black Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Aprile, W.A. (mentor)","2011","Signet has two core components that aim at supporting the user in making safe and diverse password choices. By choosing image hints automatically, the user does not need to be burdened with unlimited possibilities for hinting. With gesture recognition and length (i.e. number of strokes) guidance, the effort for precision encoding/recall is also significantly reduced. Drawing on Signet also nods at the increasing popularity of touchscreen devices and answers the frustration that is precision typing something complex on touchscreens. Images work as if they were meant to hide a message waiting for the user to uncover and use, thus making them a personal and meaningful cryptography solution. Spending time analyzing allows for deeper memory encoding and the multiple images can have a pleasurable surprise effect in users. All image hint concepts have also proven the power of visual memory in remembering. One of the key to the success of Signet is the combination of visual recall and recognition features in a lightweight manner. Signet also embraces the reality of authentication nowadays. Most passwords are for Internet services and therefore there is no hesitation in relying on a solution that uses the power of cloud computing for guiding the user who still keeps privacy under control.","passwords; authentication; gesture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-08","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Communication & Conceptualization","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

These new parallel systems su?er a “programmability gap”: there is a large gap between the performance a platform is theoretically capable of, and what the programmer is able to achieve. Early programming models were very closely tied to the underlying hardware. A proliferation of programming models has lead to a push for standardisation. This standard became OpenCL. In this thesis we investigated how the programmability of many-core systems has evolved in the past years. We started with the hardware-centric Cell SDK and compared it to the new standard OpenCL. We compared programmability on performance, portability and productivity. We found that OpenCL is a major improvement in portability and productivity, but that performance is still lacking.","OpenCL; GPU; GPGPU; Cell BE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Parallel and Distributed Systems","",""

Because of the interdisciplinary character of projects, it seems that project management approaches are not sufficient to deal with the complexity of projects. Therefore the interdisciplinary aspect has to be considered and managed appropriately, which brings us to the following research question: “How can project managers combine tools and techniques from project management approaches and discipline oriented approaches, for managing multidimensional complex projects successfully?” First a number of management approaches are selected and classified, in order to identify the focus and steps of the approaches. Next, complexity is taken into account, where it becomes clear that complexity in construction projects can be assessed by the TOE framework, while on a meta level the complexity elements of the ASC framework can provide insight in the complexity of projects. Expert interviews were conducted to identify the extent to which different management approaches support mapping and managing project complexity elements. The results point out that the Project management body of knowledge scored weak in dealing with actors, support tools and involving the context elements of a project. Finally, some techniques of other management approaches which score better are presented in order to enhance the project management approach for dealing with complex projects.","complexity; project management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Plugge, A.G. (mentor)","2011","Over the last decade, offshore outsourcing of IT services increased in volume every year. Every year new clients start with outsourcing IT services to lower cost countries like India or China. New suppliers start offering offshore outsourcing IT services on a regular basis. Expected is that this trend will continue, despite the fact that relatively seen a large percentage of offshore projects will fail. Research identifies that about 50% of offshore outsourcing initiatives fail with 46% of the work performed by offshore teams with insufficient quality. Although the realization of cost savings is not always one of the primary reasons to start with offshore outsourcing, 53% of the offshored projects result in equal or more cost compared to projects performed locally in Europe or North America. The base problem that is covered in this thesis is the fact that despite utilizing lower cost resources in the offshore projects, the performance of offshored projects from the perspective of cost are often not as high as should be expected. However, as the total performance of the project is not solely depending on cost, the performance of projects will be considered from the perspective of seven performance criteria, being: scope, cost, time, quality, project management quality, team satisfaction and customer satisfaction. The handles provided in this thesis to solve the performance issue mentioned above are focused on the term governance. Research proves that projects with effective governance may lead to 20% more profits than projects in which governance will be negleted. In other words, a lack of a proper governance structure will hinder achieving generic business and individual project goals. It will also hinder transparency between all stakeholders involved. Hence, governance should help to organize and control a project better and should help to avoid troubled situations. The governance model that is developed in this thesis will consist of several governance factors. In the literature there is limited information available from a functional governance perspective. Functional governance is governance oriented on the level of individual projects. To mitigate the lack of research to governance at the level of individual projects, governance factors have to be identified using a different approach. This approach will be based on identifying risks, success factors and best practices leading to governance factors required to develop the governance model for offshored projects.","governance; governance factor; offshoring; geographically distributed delivery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management","","Engineering & Policy Analysis","",""

A microturbine was constructed in the Gas Turbine Simulation software GSP in order to assess its viability for a low-power range extender. Due to the small magnitude of the turbine, scale effects need to be incorporated into the performance models. A microturbine has various advantages over other heat engines (Wankel, Piston, or Fuel Cell), and the capabilities in terms of range extension of the HEV are potentially superior. Through the use of the Engineering Design Process, a new microturbine design was developed that allows the system to be implemented into the HEV system. Aspects such as geometric size, weight, cost, availability, and ease of production were used to compare the different concepts and determine their feasibility. Empirical loss models previously researched were adapted and implemented into scheduling components of the microturbine base model. The model was used to simulate the required output data (Mechanical/ Electric Power, CO_2 emissions, Fuel flow rate, Exhaust gas temperature and Exhaust gas mass flow) for a range of predefined design powers (9, 15, 22, 30, 36 kW). Power-to-weight ratios and component dimensions were also calculated and sent for analysis. The data above was generated under two control schemes (fixed and variable speed) and at three power codes; maximum power (100%), part load (60%) and idle (20%). The HEV model used this data to configure and size its own system. Simulations of design and optimization are important as it restricts the size of the HEV. The results suggest that the variable speed control scheme will extend the life of the system and reduce emissions substantially. If the microturbine is operated at or below ISA conditions the scheme offers numerous other advantages. However the control system is far more complex and will cost more to develop. Recommendations have been highlighted for model configuration improvement and focus on the control system is important for continued programme development.","Microturbines; Hybrid Electric Vehicles; Fuel Analysis; Performance","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(contributor)","2011","The harbor of Surgidero de Batabano is a harbor that lies in the Gulf of Batabano in the South-Western part of Cuba. It serves as a connection between the main land of Cuba and the islands 'Isla de la Juventud' and Cayo Largo. The Batabano harbor suffers from sediment accretion. The accretion of sediment is harmful to port operations, since the depth of the quays and approach channel decreases gradually and ships are no longer able to enter the harbor. Since 1959 maintenance dredging is required every 4 years inside the manoeuvre area of the harbor, along the quay and inside the approach channel, in order to keep the harbor available for shipment. This is a costly operation. The Cuban harbor authority, APN (Autoridad Portuaria Nacional), want this problem to be solved. When considering the problems described above, the goal of this project is defined by the following: 'To reduce the frequency of dredging of accreted sediment in the harbor of Surgidero de Batabano, while keeping in mind costs, future plans, impact on the environment as well as local facilities'. Furthermore it is very important to calculate the amount of sediment accreting in the harbor and its origins. This information is useful when considering the solutions for the problems. During the analysis of the project, the project site has been investigated by literature and a site visit. The boundary conditions have been determined and the technical demand have been specified. The desires of the APN have been taken into account as well. Using all information obtained in the project analysis, the sediment transport processes inducing the accretion of sediment in the harbor have been analysed. Using theory, calculations and computer simulations, it was discovered that a combination of alongshore and cross-shore sediment transport governing the accretion in the harbor: - Alongshore transport of sediment along the coast, mainly from East to West, generated by normal wave conditions from an East/South-East direction. Sediment transported by this alongshore current, will be deposited in between the breakwaters; - Cross-shore transport of sediment perpendicular to the coast, where both sediment from deeper waters as well as accreted alongshore sediment in front of the harbor is transported by normal and extreme conditions. With the source of sediment known, several preliminary designs were created. Using a Multi Criteria Analyses, cost estimation and risk evaluation 4 preliminary designs were selected to be designed in further detail; extension of the existing Eastern breakwater, extension of the Western breakwater, a combination of these two and the current solution (remain dredging every 4 years). The main reasons for selecting these designs are: efficiency against accretion one the one hand and the wishes of the APN on the other hand. In order to obtain an optimal solution, the above mentioned designs were varied in layout. From these 9 layout options the 4 best options were selected as final designs to be further elaborated. These were a Western breakwater (attached and detached), an Eastern breakwater and a combination of a Western- and an Eastern breakwater. Using theory, calculations and computer simulations, the effectiveness against accretion in the harbor was estimated. Every design was evaluated using an Multi Criteria Analyses (MCA). The costs of each design has been determined. Using both costs and the MCA the best design was selected. The design to be recommended, is the combination of an extension of the existing Eastern breakwater and the expansion of the Western breakwater. Though this is not the cheapest option nor the most effective against accretion of sediment, the combination of these factors give the best overall results for a life span of 50 years. Another great advantage of this design, is the fact it can be built in two phases: first the Eastern and last the Western breakwater. In this was APN will be able to spread the costs of the construction of the design over a longer time.","Cuba; sedimentation; coastal morphology; sediment transport","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","The overall objective of the graduation project ‘Economic Driving’ was to generate a more economic driving style of truck drivers in order to meet the desire of clients of DAF and create improvements in terms of traffic flow, safety and decrease in harm brought to the environment. ‘Economic Driving’ should be in benefit of both the client of DAF; the fleet company, as well as the user group; truck drivers. From this perspective the Vision in Product (ViP) design method was used (Hekkert 2001, Lloyd 2006) in executing a thorough deconstruction of the subject domain and creating a vision and mission statement used in the design process. This process consisted of a 2020 scenario and mid-term intermediate design of 2017 and short-term design of 2013. Deconstruction Anticipation can be considered as a key element in performing an economic driving style. Anticipation refers to adequate adaptation to the upcoming traffic situation. Almost every single cause of an inefficient driving style or action is due to a lack of anticipation. In both truck driver interviews as well the observational research studies anticipation also proved to be a key element within economic driving, though, it was observed or mentioned a lack of anticipation occurs due to the infrastructure as well as the act of other road participants. The infrastructure as well as other road users negatively influenced the anticipation due to abrupt changes and fluctuating behavior. These behaviors, such as changing traffic lights and unexpected driving styles of others, result in abrupt behavior of truck drivers as well, causing uneconomic driving. Therefore it can be concluded both vehicle 2 vehicle (V2V) as well as infrastructure to vehicle (I2V) consist of a lack of cooperation causing a decrease in traffic flow, economy, safety and tranquility (Lämmer 2008). Although economic driving is dependent on the overall driving style in terms of vehicle operation, the aim was to improve the cause of uneconomic driving, instead of focusing on the driver, who is not always capable of predicting the upcoming situation. This aim corresponds to the research results of Nestler (2008) who claims that in order to anticipate properly, the driver requires information on the upcoming traffic situation. Mission statement Truck driving will be under severe pressure in the future and is negatively influenced in terms of governmental legislation, superior force and society. The growing unpopularity of truck driving has to be reversed into positivity and advantages. Truck drivers should experience control and freedom during their daily work routine by having clarity in traffic anticipation. Truck drivers will become more united and loyal to their truck and their profession and will build respect and recognition of other road participants and colleague truck drivers by executing a leadership role on the road. Two items that will be changed are on one hand the unappreciated and disrespected feeling of truck drivers and on the other hand the mostly biased negative image of trucks. By giving truck drivers control and freedom during driving they will experience higher satisfaction and job overview and will loose their unappreciated feeling. By constructing an anticipation leadership role of truck drivers, changes can be obtained and trucks will play an important role in the big chaos of traffic by being able of ‘visionary’ estimating upcoming traffic situations and guiding surrounding vehicles through within a mutual cooperation. 2020 scenario The scenario of 2020 consists of the expected future shape within a positive representation towards truck and economic driving. The scenario focused on traffic consisting of both V2V as well as I2V cooperation decreasing the abrupt and unexpected behavior of vehicles and infrastructure mutually. Due to improved perception of the upcoming traffic situation in terms of anticipation an increase in traffic flow, efficiency, safety and tranquility will be obtained. The scenario consists of 1. Platooning; meaning various vehicles will drive in a short distanced train mode fully automatic, in which the vehicle will take over all the driving work and the people behind the steering wheel can work or relax. Trucks will form the head of each platoon and function as guides and passenger vehicles, equipped with the essential intelligent platoon system, can line up behind. 2. Traffic light privilege; when approaching a traffic light, this will switch to green in time, in order to prevent the truck from braking. Passenger cars and older truck models, without the system, can anticipate on this truck in order to benefit of this ‘green wave effect’ and 3. The truck exterior lay-out. In the past trucks were referred as being heavy, tall, large and dangerous. In 2020 trucks should be categorized oppositely. People will perceive them as friendly and equal on the road because of improved social interaction and less heavy and dangerous appearance. The truck is not an ‘essential burden’ but something very functional and supporting in traffic. 2017 mid-term intermediate design In 2017 various traffic lights contain the specific ‘privilege’ application. Remaining traffic lights, without the privilege system, are capable of providing information about their future green or red status. The final anticipation solution consists of trucks proving support to other road users in situations as crossings, congestion and hazard. It was decided to present various anticipation solutions via windscreen projections and give additional auditory feedback to the truck driver. The truck to surrounding vehicle communication in 2017 uses a combination of both V2V communication as well as an illuminated exterior visualization. 2013 short-term intermediate design The only part of anticipation technique which would be feasible to introduce in 2013 will be traffic light knowledge. The driver information design and truck to surrounding vehicles communication design of 2013 was developed using iterative user testing. Within two interior steps and three exterior steps the signaling, application and position was tested. The best interior information proved to be a symbol and velocity advice range presented in the speedometer. Using symbols for the future traffic light status and arrows to indicate the act of the truck is the best exterior information in order for people to anticipate on trucks. In addition, focus was put on implementation of the anticipation function of trucks consisting of vehicle integration, involved stakeholders and introduction to society.","economic; truck; lorry; anticipation; driving","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","Wind energy is growing fast, in numbers but also in size. A bigger wind turbine will experience higher loads during operation. The increase in size and higher loads will both lead to heavier components. This increase in mass should be minimised to avoid additional costs of material, fabrication and lifting. Besides, it is undesirable to have unused weight at high altitude. Therefore a design for structural components like the main frame is often to keep the components as light as possible while remaining its stiffness and strength. Topological optimization can be used as a design tool for a wind turbine’s main frame. It reduces the weight of the frame while maximising its stiffness. This leads to a light frame that is still capable in resisting the loads. Designing the main frame through topological optimization may however may adversely affect the bolt strength at the main frame flange connection to other components. This may lead to an over dimensioning of the bolt connection. The improvement of the main frames weight is then overshadowed by the increased bolt size at the connection. The main goal of this report was to find a fast and easy method that includes the bolt connection into the topological optimization of the main frame and compare this with the standard optimization. The method must be applicable at the start of the topological optimization, so without any knowledge about the final geometry of the frame. Moreover the method must preferably be very general so it can be applied on different structural components and all types of wind turbines.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Voor het BAP hebben wij als opdracht gekozen om een draadloos domoticasysteem te ontwerpen op basis van het ZigBee draadloos netwerk. Het iNow domoticasysteem is een domoticasysteem dat het mogelijk maakt om verschillende taken in huis te automatiseren en inzicht te geven in het verbruik van de aangesloten apparatuur. Het domoticasysteem bestaat uit lichtsensoren, bewegingssensoren en stopcontactpluggen en werkt met draadloze communicatie tussen de modules, via een draadloos ZigBee netwerk. Verder is er een centrale verwerkingsmodule met een user interface, waarmee de gebruiker het systeem kan bedienen. In de stopcontactpluggen wordt de opgenomen energie van een aangesloten apparaat bijgehouden om de gebruiker inzicht te geven in het energieverbruik. Het systeem kan schakelen op basis van sensorinformatie van de licht-en bewegingssensoren. In deze thesis richten wij ons op de hardware van het systeem. De doelstelling van deze thesis is het vinden en realiseren van een passende hardware oplossing voor het iNow domoticasysteem. Deze hardware bestaat uit een bewegingssensor, een lichtsensor en een stopcontactplug waarmee energieverbruik gemeten kan worden en waarmee een apparaat aan-en uitgeschakeld kan worden. Omdat het ZigBee systeem niet meer beschikbaar was is als vervanging een microcontroller gebruikt, om de hardware te demonstreren. Hierin vindt de verwerking van de sensorsignalen plaats, wat oorspronkelijk door het ZigBee systeem zou gebeuren. De energiemeting is gerealiseerd door middel van een spanningsmeetcircuit voor het meten van de spanning, een stroommeetcircuit voor het meten van de stroom en een microcontroller om uit de gemeten spanning en stroom het energieverbruik te bepalen. Voor de bewegingssensor is gebruik gemaakt van een passieve infrarood sensor in combinatie met een RC circuit om de uitgang te stabiliseren. Deze uitgangsspanning wordt in de microcontroller vergeleken met de grenswaarde, deze bepaald of er beweging is gedetecteerd. Voor de lichtsensor is een LDR gebruikt in combinatie met een weerstand. De softwarematige hysterese zorgt ervoor dat de verlichting niet gaat flikkeren. Voor het schakelen is een solid state relais gebruikt, dat aangestuurd wordt door de keuzemodule, die als vervanging van het ZigBee module dient. In de keuzemodule wordt de sensorinformatie verwerkt en op basis hiervan worden de stopcontactpluggen aangestuurd.","energy metering; domotica","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","CAS","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Ever since the start of containerisation ship sizes kept increasing, and still are to this day. Because of the demands on short cycle times for the cranes, port operators required faster hoisting speeds to keep up with the increased hoisting height. These increased hoisting speeds (up to 180 m/min for an empty spreader), introduced a new problem to STS cranes: snag loads. Snag loads are the shock loads which are exerted on the crane when the load of the crane snags behind an object during hoisting. It’s also possible for the container to jam inside the ship cell due to skewing. These shock loads can greatly exceed the normal operating loads of the crane, causing damage to the crane. This damage ranges from minor damage like bent rope sheaves mounting, to an entire boom collapsing. Through time, a number of devices were installed on STS cranes to absorb or reduce the snag load. These mechanisms proved to be expensive, and required maintenance. It is therefore favourable to reduce the snag loads to a level where the crane is strong enough to withstand it without a snag protection device. The purpose of this thesis is to construct a method to calculate the snag loads on the STS crane and improve the hoisting winch so that snag loads are reduced to an acceptable level.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""
