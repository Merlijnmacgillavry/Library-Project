(mentor); Moulijn, J.A. (mentor)","2007","In earlier studies at R&CE, TUDelft the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone was found to be highly selective towards cyclohexanone, but unfortunately the conversion rate is low due to deactivation of the catalyst. The aim of this study is to improve the conversion and in the same time to reduce the deactivation of the catalyst during photo oxidation by increasing the oxidation activity on the TiO2 catalyst surface by deposition of metal gold. Metal gold deposition as nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface decreases the electron-hole recombination of the TiO2 semiconductor, resulting in a more efficient charge separation. This better charge separation would improve the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. Several TiO2 supports (Degussa P25, Hombicat, Aldrich and Merck) and two different methods for reduction of Au3+ to Au0 , i.e. calcinations and chemical reduction by NaBH4 were applied. All catalysts were characterized for specific surface area and for pore distribution by nitrogen physisorption, for active sites by ammonia-TPD, for Au particle size by TEM, for anatase/rutile ratio of TiO2 by RAMAN, XRD, for adsorbed water and OH-groups by TGA and for absorbance capacity of light by UV/VIS. The Au/TiO2 catalysts were tested on their photo catalytic activity in three different oxidation reactions, namely cyclohexane oxidation to cyclohexanone (liquid-organic oxidation), degradation of methylene blue (liquid-aqueous oxidation) and oxidation of propane and propylene (gas-organic oxidation). During cyclohexane photo oxidation, high selectivity to cyclohexanone is obtained (cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol 90-97%). For all catalysts the character of the kinetics is very similar. The photo oxidation of cyclohexane follows two reaction stages, an initial stage and a steady-state stage. After an initial stage of 45-60 minutes of illumination the reaction rate decreases significantly. The decrease of reaction rate is attributed to deactivation of the TiO2 catalyst by oxidation of cyclohexanol to carboxylates, which adsorb at the active sites of the catalyst surface. Decarboxylation reactivates the catalyst and is assumed to be the rate determining step in the steady state stage. A two-loop reaction model is proposed to understand the kinetics. Gold deposition of the TiO2catalysts did not result in higher reaction rates, but in a decrease of both initial as steady state reaction rates. The stronger oxidation activity of Au/TiO2 will increase the kinetics of the cyclohexanol loop of the reaction model. Consequently, oxidation of cyclohexanol leads to accumulation of carboxylates on the catalyst surface. Further research and development of methods, which might speed up the decarboxylation step would be worthwhile for improvement of the photo oxidation rate in the steady state stage. The kinetics of the decomposition of MB appears to be pseudo first order as well for decomposition with pure TiO2 catalysts as for decomposition with Au/TiO2 catalyst. A two-cycle model is proposed, of which each cycle has two pathways, one involving a superoxide radical and the other involving an adsorbed hydroxyl ion. The cycles describe the decomposition of MB and the decomposition of MB degradation products respectively. All catalysts show fast decomposition in the initial state at a rate around 0.03/min. This rate appears to be independent of the active site concentration. This leads to the conclusion that the adsorption step is the rate determining process of MB decomposition by photo oxidation in the initial state. The photocatalytic oxidation of MB appears to be a two-stage process, with a decomposition rate in the initial stage, which is a factor 3-8 higher than in the steady state stage. The reduction of this rate is due to the production of degradation products, which compete with MB for absorption sites. In the steady state stage the desorption of degradation products becomes rate limiting. Pure Hombicat shows an initial delay of MB decomposition, which is explained by the presence of sulphites, which scavenge radicals formed by photo oxidation. After all sulphites are consumed MB decomposition can start. Gold deposition increased the decomposition rate for Aldrich catalyst only. For Au/Hombicat and Au/P25 the lower rate is believed to be the direct and/or indirect effect of lower active site concentration, in combination with limited diffusivity of MB due to pore diameter restrictions. The significant reduction of active sites could be due to sodium poisoning after the reduction by NaBH4. Photo oxidation of propane to acetone appears to occur with visible light, although at low conversion rates. Unfortunately, the challenging idea of the possibility of direct photo oxidation of propylene to propylene oxide in the presence of water has a negative outcome. No epoxies are formed, but a lot of other species like acetone, carboxylates and carbonates are detected by FTIR. In conclusion, the photo catalytic activity could be enhanced by gold deposition. However, competing reactions and catalyst deactivation could have large negative effects on the overall kinetics. As shown in this study, each combination of catalyst, photo oxidation reaction and environment has its own specific limitations. E.g. reaction mechanisms in liquid/gas phase or in aqueous/non-aqueous environment could be different for the same catalyst. In order to exploit the advantage of high selectivity, each specific photo oxidation process needs to be optimised for catalyst deactivation and competing reactions. Increasing the oxidation activity by gold deposition only is not enough to enhance the kinetics. Some ideas to study are selective active sites by catalyst modification, continuous removal of formed compounds to avoid competing reactions, and reaction medium that contains selective scavengers, which can prevent active sites blockage.","photocatalysis; gold/titania; photocatalytic oxidation; cyclohexane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-28","Delft University of Technology","Catalysis Engineering","","","",""

Sinds mensenheugenis moet men in dit gebied een gevecht leveren tegen het hoge water van de zee en de rivieren. Naar aanleiding van de watersnoodramp van 1953 is de vraag naar veiligheid omtrent hoogwater belangrijker geworden. Het voorkomen van een overstroming is tegenwoordig niet de enige prioriteit, ook de gevolgen van een overstroming worden bekeken en de mogelijke noodmaatregelen hiertegen. De veiligheidsketen beoogt, door middel van een ketenaanpak, bestaande risico's te reduceren en/of een effectieve aanpak van deze risico's te garanderen. De veiligheidsketen is een procesmatige benadering van risico's; vanaf het benoemen van het risico tot het daadwerkelijk manifesteren daarvan in de vorm van een calamiteit of crisis. Dit onderzoek heeft tot doel een bijdrage te leveren in het beoordelen van maatregelen uit de veiligheidsketen door middel van een kostenbaten- analyse (KBA). Daarnaast wordt de toepasbaarheid van de veiligheidsketen onderzocht voor overstromingsrisico's. Veiligheidsketen Wanneer een ramp zich nog niet heeft aangediend, zich manifesteert of reeds heeft voltrokken, zijn verschillende maatregelen mogelijk. Het casusgebied voor dit onderzoek is dijkringgebied 7, Noordoostpolder. De dijkring is opgebouwd uit dijkvakken (15) en kunstwerken (10). De dijkvakken en kunstwerken zijn onderverdeeld in 7 dijkringdelen. Uit de dijkringdelen zijn de scenariokansen bepaalt. In de scenariokansen is de invloed van de verschillende faalmechanismen gecombineerd voor zowel de dijkvakken als de kunstwerken. Door de scenariokans te combineren met de scenariogevolgen volgt het overstromingsrisico. Per maatregel wordt de risicoreductie uitgerekend. Door deze met de kosten per maatregel te vergelijken volgt er een kostenbaten verhouding. Daarnaast wordt ook het aantal slachtoffers onderzocht. De belangrijkste conclusie die volgt uit deze studie is de constatering dat het overstromingsrisico voor dijkring 7 het beste beheerd wordt met maatregelen uit de preventie schakel (gebaseerd op de maatregel ""verbeteren zwakke schakels""). De maatregel ""verbeteren zwakke schakels"" geeft een zeer gunstige batenkosten verhouding en grootste risicoreductie. De schakel proactie dient door landelijke regelgeving uitgevoerd te worden. Een gemeente zal zichzelf immers niet benadelen door uitbreidingen te verbieden. De schakel preparatie (voorbereiden, oefenen) heeft effect op maatregelen in de repressie schakel. Preparatie zorgt voor een betere risicoreductie. Het toepassen van preparatie resulteert niet altijd in een betere kostenbaten verhouding. De veiligheidsketen moet gebruikt worden als hulpmiddel in toekomstig onderzoek naar overstromingsrisicos, op alle niveaus (dijkring, landelijke en mondiale watersystemen). De veiligheidsketen kan gebruikt worden bij het bepalen van het overstromingsbeleid en de veiligheidsketen kan als hulpmiddel dienen voor het plannen van strategieen het afwegen van de keuze voor maatregelen. Er dienen goede afspraken gemaakt te worden bij het gebruik van de veiligheidsketen om verwarring over de te treffen maatregel te voorkomen. Er dient onderzoek te verricht te worden naar alle maatregelen die effect hebben op overstromingsrisico's.","overstromingsrisico's; veiligheidsketen","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Stelling, G.S. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Nieuwenhuis, O. (mentor); van der Boon, B. (mentor)","2007","Tsunamis are a series of long waves, caused by rapid perturbations of the water level. For Banda Aceh, only submarine earthquakes are a likely cause of tsunami-generation and only negative waves (with an initial decrease of the water level) will arrive at the shore line. The probability of tsunamigenic earthquakes in Banda Aceh was investigated, based on existing models. The propagation of a tsunami wave can be described with equations that are valid for normal shallow water waves. Difficulties arise in determining the initial signal (excitation) in relation with earthquake magnitude. Furthermore, simple shoaling laws are not accurate close to the shore. Therefore a depth-averaged 2D-model is used to determine the wave heights at the Banda Aceh shoreline for different earthquakes magnitudes (see Table above). The reference case is the Dec2004 Tsunami that caused almost 300.000 missing or dead people in the countries around the Indian Ocean. In Banda Aceh alone, more than 70.000 people were reported dead or missing and the damage was estimated to 1,12 billion USD. It is concluded that for higher tsunamis, low-crested structures and protection by mangrove trees or other vegetation is not effective. Protection should aim at reflection of the tsunami wave. Therefore, three main tsunami protection alternatives are developed; 1) a tsunami barrier located offshore at 10m water depth, 2) a coastal barrier and 3) an inland barrier. These structures are designed and modelled in such a way that overtopping could occur. Many sub-alternatives are modelled, both in numerical (depth-averaged) 2D and 1D-models. The effectiveness of each alternative is expressed in the amount of inundation volume that still entered the area of Banda Aceh compared to the Dec2004 Tsunami event. It was found that offshore structures show the highest reduction of the tsunami wave in relation to their retaining height (i.e. the visible height of the structure). A procedure is set up to relate tsunami inundation volume with damage. With decreasing protection level the residual damage increases. By relating this residual damage with the probability of tsunami-events, the residual risk for each protection level is defined. Based on typical designs for the three alternatives, construction costs are estimated. By adding up the (Net Present Value) of the residual risk and the construction costs, the optimal design level for the three alternatives is derived. For these optimal levels, the costs of tsunami protection are compared with the benefits (i.e. the prevented risk). From this Cost Benefit Analysis it is concluded that none of the alternatives is economically feasible, except under very favourable conditions. In this case only the inland and coastal alternatives show a positive cost-benefit ratio. For the offshore barrier, the costs consequently outweighed the benefits. Nonetheless, considerations about the 1) little escape time between a tsunami warning and the actual arrival, 2) the value of life, and 3) other non-quantifiable advantages of a tsunami protection structure, could still support a decision in favour of an extensive tsunami protection. In that case, a Multi Criteria Analysis showed that offshore solutions are most preferable. High structures on land will unacceptably affect the socio-economic development of Banda Aceh. Thereby, tsunami height, run-up, velocities and impact are smaller in offshore conditions. Therefore it was decided to elaborate further on the design of an offshore tsunami barrier, despite the negative cost-benefit ratio. Finally a design is presented that is stable in earthquake conditions and can withstand the high current velocities both over the barrier (overtopping) and through the gaps.","tsunami protection; Banda Aceh; tsunamis; tsunami modelling; feasibility tsunami protection","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

In order to tap this energy various designs for wave-energy converters are currently under development. One of these devices is the Archimedes Wave Swing. It is basically a submerged air vessel consisting of a floater and a stator. The floater is free to move vertically under varying wave pressure, while the stator is anchored to the sea bed. Energy is extracted from the relative motion of the two parts. The control objective is to optimize the power produced while ensuring that the motion of the floater remains within certain prescribed limits. The main difficulty is due to the high degree of irregularity of ocean waves. Two consecutive waves can have significantly different heights and periods, and the controller should be able to deal with that. The controllers are designed based on two different principles. The first method controls the trajectory so that the velocity of the floater remains in phase with the excitation force. Model predictive control is used in order to be able to eact to the constraints ahead of time. The second method makes use of a prediction of the excitation force in order to calculate the control force which maximizes the energy produced.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","EPP","","","",""

A successful wind turbine of this type has not yet been made. It was investigated whether a wind turbine with a wagging blade, the Windstem, can be competitive at any location with other wind turbines, taking into account that the cost of an original, less visible wind turbine can be slightly higher than the cost of conventional wind turbines. To answer this question, several options for roll control (roll is the main rotation of the blade) and pitch control were examined. Using a simple construction and blade element/ momentum method calculations, the blade dimensions and the characteristic of the roll motion were optimized to find an estimate for the efficiency of a realistic configuration of the Windstem, regardless of how the roll and pitch are controlled. After getting this efficiency, the Windstem strengths and weaknesses were compared to other wind turbine types. Based on the analysis, the following configuration is considered optimal. The Windstem will have two springs on either side of the roll axis. The springs (preferably hydraulic) are only in contact with the structure for a limited roll angle close to the maximum roll and for the rest of the motion the roll rate is about constant. A counterweight will balance the blade and if the mechanical losses and spring losses are sufficiently low, the Windstem will be self starting. There are several options for a generator which will all result in an efficiency of seventy to eighty percent. The options for the generator are: a hydraulic piston next to the spring connected to a hydraulic motor, a linear generator connected to the roll axis or a rotating generator connected to the roll axis through a mechanism that converts the oscillating motion to a rotating motion in one direction. The blade will have a chord of 10% of the blade length, and the inner forty to fifty percent of the blade will not be used for generating aerodynamic lift...","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Zeman, M. (mentor); Bartek, M. (mentor); Van Elzakker, G. (mentor)","2007","In recent decades, the public awareness of the need for renewable energy sources has increased greatly. Considering the current climate changes, it is clear that today’s energy systems have to be radically transformed onto a more sustainable basis to avoid the otherwise very likely adverse effects of global warming on tomorrow’s society and economy. In this framework, solar cells offer an interesting alternative for large-scale electricity generation. The first-generation crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, which still dominate the photovoltaic market, will likely not be used for such large-scale applications, because of the relatively large amounts of material that would be required for the fabrication. Thinfilm solar cells, such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells, have a great potential with respect to the costs, because much smaller amounts of material are needed in the fabrication process in comparison to c-Si solar cells. However, the typical conversion efficiency of an a-Si:H silicon solar cell is much lower than the typical conversion efficiency of a c-Si solar cell. Further, the performance of an a-Si:H solar cell degrades over time when the solar cell is exposed to light, which is not the case for c-Si solar cells. In an attempt to increase the conversion efficiency of thin-film solar cells, research interest moved towards multiple-junction solar cells, as opposed to the conventional single-junction solar cells, so a wider range of the solar spectrum could be absorbed. One particularly interesting multiple-junction solar cell is the so-called micromorph tandem solar cell, which consists of an a-Si:H top solar cell and a hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (?c-Si:H) bottom solar cell. The interesting aspect of this particular multiple-junction solar cell is that both the bottom and the top solar cell can be produced from the same cheap base material: silicon. Both solar cells can be deposited by means of plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) from silane gas. To obtain a highly efficient a-Si:H solar cell for possible later use in a micromorph tandem solar cell, it will be attempted in this thesis to optimise the heart of the a-Si:H solar cell: the absorber layer. To obtain a stable material, a hydrogen-to-silane dilution ratio of 20 is used during the PECVD deposition of a-Si:H. The influence of various deposition parameters, such as the pressure, the rf-power, the silane flow, and the substrate temperature on the quality of films and absorber layers is investigated. Fourier Transform Photocurrent Spectroscopy is used to evaluate the quality of Si:H films and solar cell absorber layers, since from the obtained sub-band gap absorption coefficient spectrum the defect concentration can be estimated. It is found that the highest material quality of films and absorber layers is achieved for a high deposition pressure, a low rf-power, and a low substrate temperature. The silane flow does not have a significant influence of the quality of the deposited material. None of these deposition parameters has an influence on the degradation rate in films and absorber layers. An increased stability against light soaking is observed for the films and absorber layers deposited at a hydrogen-to-silane dilution ratio of 20 in comparison to a film and an absorber layer deposited from undiluted silane.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Components, Technology and Materials","","Solar Cell Group","",""

(mentor); Hobma, F.A.M. (mentor)","2007","Recent research shows that a majority of Dutch organisations now own accommodation plans or real estate strategies (Ernst and Young, 2005, p9). This legitimizes the research question What do real estate strategies look like in practice? This question, along with Vande Puttes (2007, p11) observation that the structure and physical appearance of strategies has been mostly overlooked, is the reason for conducting this research. The goal of the research is to gain insight into the characteristics of structure and content of real estate strategies by Dutch organisations. The description of the characteristics is made by comparing the documents to literature on real estate strategy. The focus of this research is on explicit strategies. Explicit meaning: strategies that have been written down on paper. As a result of the analysis of the documents, four potential structural archetypes have been identified. The four types of strategy structure for the documents have the following characteristics: (1) A compilation of information document does not have a clear structure. Most of the information is about past, current and upcoming affairs in the real estate portfolio. This type of document is characterised by little or medium resemblance with any of the views on the strategy development and a low or medium content level of the strategy design process. (2) An aligning and/or match based document has a structure that comes from the tool or the design method that was used during the design process. It is characterised by a high focus on the strategy design process and a high resemblance with rational planning. (3) The boundary-defining structure determines the rules for the coming years. It does not result in concrete actions, but determines the boundaries in which future actions will take place. This type of document is characterised by high resemblance with guided learning and little focus on the strategy design process. (4) The toolkit is a document in which most of the information is presented using strategy design tools. Conclusions and information coming from one tool form input for the use of the next tool. It features many figures and drawings and does not contain long paragraphs of text. The application of an analytical framework shows a resemblance between literature and practice. Design methods such as aligning or linking and tools such matching or scenario planning are used. More often than not they are not used as prescribed. The research shows phenomena such as single-step aligning, quantity-only matching, the extrapolation of trends and the ability to influence scenarios. Another conclusion on the use of design methods and tools is drawn: they make up a lot of the content in the analyzed documents. The use of tools and design methods has a high resemblance with strategy development views like rational planning and guided learning. But Idenburg (1993) uses the words flexible and developments to define emergent strategy . These two keywords are used frequently throughout six of the analyzed documents. This contrast between rational planning/guided learning and emergent strategy is ground for the following conclusion: There is a mismatch between the structure and content of the analyzed documents. Six of the organisations aim to formulate a strategy based on rational planning or guided learning, but are in practice adopting an emergent strategy for their real estate. The abundant use of the word development(s), in different meanings, shows that the writers of the documents have little grip on both internal and external changes. They are unsure about the meaning of, the consequences of, and how to deal with, changes. Flexibility often seems to be a euphemism for saying that no decision has been made yet.","real estate strategies; vastgoedstrategieen; inhoud; structuur","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Real Estate & Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor); Penninga, F. (mentor); Van Oosterom, P.J.M. (mentor)","2007","This thesis is about the visualization of a Tetrahedral Irregular Network (TEN) in a web client. A tetrahedron is the simplest geometric form in 3D space, a pyramid with a triangular ground face. Its four points can lie anywhere in the 3D space as long as they do not lie on one plane. 3D objects can be composed from multiple tetrahedra. In a fully partitioned TEN even air and soil are modeled with tetrahedra. Most GIS analyses on a TEN can be deducted to an operation on the triangle simplex, therefore 3D analysis on A TEN is relatively easy compared to analysis on another 3D data structures. Chapter one (Introduction) gives an overview of the background of the research, the objectives, the requirements and the research methodology. In Chapter two (Data models for 3D geo-information) the theory around 3D data modeling is given. It starts with an explanation of the 3D feature components. In the next part, there is a comparison of 3D data representations and 3D data models and a conclusion is drawn why the TEN is the best data model. In the next paragraphs, theory on the TEN data models is given as well as theory on the derived 3D TIN and ‘TEN view’ data model.

(mentor); Fraaij, A.L.A. (mentor); Bouwmeester, W.J. (mentor); Koenders, E.A.B. (mentor)","2007","One of the most basic types of breakwaters is the rubble mound breakwater which in essence is a heap of stones consisting of a core of fine material covered by an armour layer of big rock or concrete elements. Mostly unreinforced, these concrete elements exist in different sizes and geometries varying from massive concrete cubes to more complicated shapes like Dolos, Tetrapode, Accropode or Xbloc. The reaction of cement with water is exothermic and an unequal heating up and cooling down of the massive units can lead to too high tensile stresses which lead to cracking in case the actual tensile strength of the concrete is exceeded. Therefore, in this thesis, the main focus is on the production and hardening process of the units. What internal mechanisms during the hardening stage might lead to cracking and/or breakage of these colossal concrete armour units? For six different concrete mixes, the thermal and strength properties were experimentally determined and analyzed. The found results were used as input for a numerical hardening model. The model permits to give an estimation of the expected temperature rise, the eigenstress development as well as an indication of the possible cracking trajectories. Using the probabilistic approach of Van Breugel, an assessment on the risk of failure could be done at material level. A further analysis using the Mohr-Coulomb criterion gave also the possibility to evaluate possible breakage patterns at element level. For a reference mix, a parametrical study was done regarding the influence of specific hardening circumstances like type of formwork, moment of removal or the type of mix used. In a last step, the implemented hardening model has been used to analyze a specific case-study in the Netherlands where concrete armour units are severely damaged. The conducted research put in evidence the importance of maintaining the eigenstresses at low values in order to reduce considerably the risk on cracking. The different parametrical studies showed that different factors play a prominent role in getting a higher or lower risk of cracking, namely: the choice of a specific type of formwork, the demoulding stage, the sizes of the elements and the casting and environmental temperatures. Moreover, the implementation of the model to other concrete mixes, revealed the importance of the mix choice on the temperature and stress development. In case for instance fillers or binders are used to replace partly the needed amount of cement, it is important to make a thorough study on their quality and reactivity. It can be concluded the elaborated hardening model gives a good indication of expected temperature rise, stresses and cracking patterns and that the adopted calculation methods give a good indication of weak and critical points in the elements and possible cracking and breakage patterns and mechanisms. The results show high probabilities on crack occurrence and crack patterns that agree very well with the block damages observed at the practical case in the Netherlands. Further investigations regarding the influence of the shape, an analysis on micro scale of weak points in the structure and the effect of the quality of binders are recommended to get a broader scope and to extend the hardening model which was set-up. Moreover, it is of crucial importance designers integrate all together the aspects from concrete technology and hydraulic/ coastal engineering point of views to come up with a final design for concrete armour units of breakwaters.","breakwater; armour unit; concrete","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Van Loosdrecht, M.C.M. (mentor); De Koning, J. (mentor); Janssen, A.N. (mentor); Evenblij, H. (mentor)","2007","A proved technique to upgrade (wastewater treatment plant) wwtp effluent to improved water quality is dead-end ultrafiltration (UF). Although the use of UF for upgrading wwtp effluent results in an excellent basic water quality, this technique faces problems due to membrane fouling. Especially particles in the size range between 0.1 and 0.45 @m (5 to 20 times larger than the membrane pores) are mainly responsible for membrane fouling. By the implementation of a pretreatment step for the dead-end UF installation, the particles in the critical fraction between 0.1 @m and 0.45 @m might be removed. Previous pretreatment methods did not give satisfying results. Apparently pretreatment with multimedia filtration, microfiltration and in-line coagulation with poly aluminium chloride (PACl), sometimes in combination with continuous sand filtration, did not remove the (effect of) these particles. Filterability did improve though, but only with a small percentage. In this research six pretreatment methods for dead-end UF are investigated. The objective of this research is to determine if the implementation of those pretreatment methods have any influence on the filterability of wwtp effluent. When an increase in filterability takes place, after a certain pretreatment step, the fraction in which the main filterability increase takes place, has to be determined. The six pretreatment steps were investigated on three different wwtp’s in the Netherlands. From February until May water was taken from wwtp Maasbommel. At this plant three pretreatment steps were involved; the dosage of NALMET (a polymeric substance, mainly for removal of heavy metals, the dosage of powdered activated carbon (PAC) and treatment with granular activated carbon (GAC). At wwtp Veendam experiments were carried out with a Fuzzy Filter in April. From July until September investigations started at wwtp Horstermeer with two different techniques; a multimedia filter and treatment of wwtp effluent with water fleas (Daphnia). The collected samples were fractionated which divides a sample in four fractions; the raw fraction, <0.45 ?m, <0.2 ?m and <0.1 ?m. The filterability of every sample was measured on pilot scale with the Specific Ultrafiltration Resistance (SUR). This method has been developed at the Delft University of Technology. With the SUR the impact of pretreatment on the initial filterability can be indicated. It can be measured in a short period of 30 minutes. A low SUR value indicates good filterability. Besides measuring filterability of every fraction, five foulant concentrations were determined as well; Total Organic Carbon (TOC), colour, polysaccharides, proteins and humic substances. At wwtp Horstermeer filterability of effluent treated with a multimedia filter was measured on pilot scale. Three different fluxes were applied. Of the six applied pretreatment methods for ultrafiltration, only two did improve filterability of the effluent. Pretreatment with the four other methods resulted in no change in filterability or even a worse filterability, compared with the effluent. Filterability increase was achieved after dosage of NALMET and after treatment with GAC. NALMET did improve the filterability with 40 to 55%, GAC lowered the SUR with 0 to 40%. PAC did cause problems at wwtp Maasbommel. The carbon apparently falls apart in very small fractions which subsequently have a bad influence on filterability. Inspection at the pilot plant of wwtp Maasbommel revealed broken membranes due to friction, resulting in fractions of PAC in the filtrate. Treatment with the Fuzzy Filter did not have any influence on the filterability during this research. Contrary to previous researches, filterability decreased after multimedia filtration. The treatment process at wwtp Horstermeer differed from other experiments by the dosing of methanol which makes it an anaerobic process. Formed biopolymeric components during this process probably have a bad influence on the filterability. Daphnia did not increase the filterability either. The vessels with the water fleas were situated outside where the residence time is four days. This long residence time probably allows biological growth and subsequently a worse filterability compared with the effluent. From this research can be concluded that the main contribution to the filterability is caused by particles in the fraction of 0.1 to 0.2 ?m. This fraction is for 45 to 70% responsible for the total SUR. Filterability increase, which happened by treatment with NALMET and GAC, was mainly caused by the removal of particles in the fraction >0.45 ?m. Pretreatment with NALMET and GAC is not able to effectively remove the (effect of) the most important membrane fouling fraction of 0.1 - 0.2 ?m. Treatment with PAC and GAC did remove proteins, colour and humic substances. Polysaccharides accumulated in front of the membrane, resulting in high concentrations. No change was determined after treatment with GAC. After dosage of NALMET concentrations of TOC, DOC, proteins and humic substances increased. Concentrations of polysaccharides and colour stayed more or less constant. Treatment with a Fuzzy Filter did not have any effect on all the measured foulants in this research. Varying results were obtained after both multimedia filtration and Daphnia. No foulant did increase or decrease structurally after both pretreatment methods. High SUR values go hand in hand with high concentrations of proteins, colour and humic substances. This is not the case for TOC and polysaccharides. Foulants could not be related to filterability per fraction. The total SUR is mainly caused by particles in the fraction between 0.1 and 0.45 ?m, while most of the foulants are present in the fraction <0.1 ?m. For removing the most important membrane fraction, other options should be investigated. Other methods which might remove the critical fraction are a precoat layer, ozonation and slow sand filtration. Optimizing the configurations of the used pretreatment methods might give other results than illustrated here. Repetition of the experiments carried out for this research could confirm the outcomes of this thesis.","fouling modification; ultrafiltration; wwtp effluent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lindenbergh, R.C. (mentor)","2007","The Greenland ice sheet is sensitive to climate change. Global heating is expected to result in ice mass losses that will contribute to global sea level rise. For this reason monitoring Greenland’s ice mass balance is of utmost importance. Data of both the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimetry mission and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity mission are used to create two independent estimates of Greenland’s ice sheet mass balance over the full measurement period of about 2003 until 2007. For ICESat data, a processing strategy is developed that uses the elevation differences of geometrically overlapping footprints of both crossing and repeated tracks. The dataset is cleaned using quality flags defined by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) science team. (The GLAS is the sole scientific instrument on ICESat). The cleaned dataset reveals some strong, spatially correlated signals that are shown to be related to physical phenomena like melting glaciers. On the other hand, strong correlation is also visible between the observed elevation differences and the combined effect of roughness and surface slope. Different processing strategies applied to different sets of laser campaigns are used to convert the observed temporal elevation differences to mass changes for 6 different drainage systems, further divided into a region above and below 2000 meter elevation. Here all available laser campaigns are used and outliers are removed using N-sigma thresholding. Both a uniform and non-uniform weighting scheme,used to estimate the elevation changes with respect to a reference epoch, is evaluated. The non-uniform weighting scheme is developed to account for the influence of roughness and surface slope, but it turns out that also signals of interest are sometimes suppressed. In order to obtain our final estimates based on ICESat data, the uniform weighting scheme is applied. For the whole of Greenland the estimated mass change rate is equal to -142.6 Gton/year. This value can be mainly attributed to strong mass losses in the region below 2000 meter elevation. On the other hand we show that for different processing strategies this value ranges between approximately 0 and -200 Gton/year. In general, the obtained results confirm trends discovered by other authors who use altimetry. Differences can be explained by different time spans of the used datasets, but mainly by differences in sampling of the data in the region below 2000 meter. Furthermore, GRACE based monthly variations of the Earth’s gravity field as processed by CNES, CSR, DEOS and GFZ are used to estimate the mass change rate for North and South Greenland. Here, both a Gaussian filter, for half-widths of 300, 500 and 800 km, and a Wiener filter is used. It turns out that the Gaussian filter with a half-width of 500 km has the best performance. The final estimates obtained after application of this filter for the different GRACE solutions range between -60.9 and -93.1 Gton/year. The differences in estimates among different GRACE solutions can be mainly explained by differences in processing strategies used by the processing centers to obtain the monthly gravity fields. Only for the DEOS solutions, these differences can also be attributed to the different time span of this dataset. In any case the estimates are low compared with recently published GRACE estimates, which can be explained by an unaccounted leakage effect in our estimates. The unaccounted leakage effect also mainly explains the differences between estimates based on ICESat and GRACE data. Due to their global coverage and high temporal resolution both the ICESat and GRACE mission have improved the estimations of Greenland’s ice sheet mass balance. Further improvements are possible when both datasets are combined. Hence an attempt is made for a joint inversion of both datasets. Depending on the used GRACE solution the estimated combined mass change rates range between -114.3 and -124.7 Gton/year.","ICESat; GRACE; Greenland; ice sheet; mass balance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Department of Earth Observation and Space Systems (DEOS)","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2007","Dit onderzoek richt zich op de afhandeling van het treinverkeer tijdens calamiteiten. Tijdens een calamiteit zal de vervoersprestatie dalen. Tijdens versperringen wordt momenteel gewerkt met versperringsmaatregelen. De versperringsmaatregelen worden momenteel op basis van ervaring gemaakt, in overleg met de betrokken vervoerders. In een versperringsmaatregel is een tijdelijke dienstregeling opgenomen. De planning van de tijdelijke dienstregeling bepaalt de vervoersprestatie tijdens de calamiteit. Dit onderzoek richt zich op het verbeteren van de planning en de uitvoering van de versperringsmaatregelen met als doel het minimaliseren van het verlies van vervoersprestatie. Om het verlies van vervoersprestatie te kunnen meten, moet worden bepaald hoe dit het beste is uit te drukken. De huidige criteria ""punctualiteit"" en ""aantal opgeheven treinen"" zijn geen goede indicatoren om de vervoersprestatie te kwantificeren. Een betere methode is om te kijken naar het effect voor de uiteindelijke gebruikers van het spoorsysteem. Het uiteindelijke effect voor de reizigers is vertraging. De totale vertraging van de reiziger is niet exact te berekenen, omdat de gegevens niet toereikend zijn op dit moment. Om de totale vertraging van de reizigers te bepalen moet er een benadering worden toegepast. De benadering van de totale reizigersvertraging gebeurt op basis van lijnmatrices en overstapmatrices uit het reizigerstoedelingsmodel TRANS. In een lijnmatrix is uitgewerkt hoeveel mensen reizen van alle stations naar alle stations langs de route van één treinserie. In de overstapmatrix is opgenomen hoeveel reizigers overstappen van de ene naar de andere trein op een overstapstation. Allereerst wordt in de benadering voor de vertraging het directe effect voor de mensen in de gehinderde treinseries berekend. Daarna wordt er een correctie toegepast voor de overstappen van gehinderde treinseries naar andere treinen. Deze benadering is voldoende nauwkeurig. De planning en uitvoering van een versperringsmaatregel hangen niet alleen af van het minimaliseren van het verlies aan vervoersprestatie. De planning moet uitvoerbaar zijn, te implementeren in de huidige of toekomstige treindienstleidingssystemen en de versperringsmaatregel moet duidelijk zijn voor het personeel en de reizigers. Om een uitvoerbare planning te ontwerpen, wordt er gebruik gemaakt van de bloktrapdiagram theorie van Pachl [2002]. Met een bloktrapdiagram kan worden bepaald wanneer een blok gereserveerd moet zijn voor één specifieke trein. Met de bloktrapdiagrammen van de verschillende treinen kan een realiseerbare planning opgebouwd worden. In deze planning worden de kritieke punten en de speling duidelijk zichtbaar. De planning van de versperring kan op een aantal manieren gestuurd worden. Grofweg zijn er twee strategieën. Enerzijds zoveel mogelijk in stand houden van de huidige dienstregeling, anderzijds de dienstregeling loslaten en zoveel mogelijk treinen door een bottleneck leiden. Naast de planning kunnen ook de infrastructuur en uitvoering van de versperringsmaatregel worden verbeterd. Om de ontwikkelde strategieën te toetsen en de effecten van een versperringsmaatregel te kwantificeren is er een case uitgewerkt. De case is een enkelsporige versperring op het baanvak Hoofddorp - Leiden. Bij de evaluatie van de huidige maatregel bleek dat er de versperringsmaatregel niet altijd precies uitgevoerd wordt. Afwijkingen van de versperringsmaatregel hebben als gevolg dat het plan minder goed uitvoerbaar wordt. In de case zijn de huidige versperringsmaatregel en 7 ontwikkelde alternatieven getoetst. De in dit onderzoek ontwikkelde alternatieven naast het nulalternatief waren:  NulplUS De mogelijkheden van de huidige maatregel zijn in dit nulplusalternatief maximaal benut, door meer treinen te laten rijden.  Breken Bij breiden worden zoveel mogelijk treinen door de bottleneck gereden. De treinen worden na de bottleneck opgehouden op een halte tot het volgende pad voor de betreffende treinserie. Het voordeel van dit plan is dat veel treinen de bottleneck kunnen passeren en de vertraging blijft beperkt binnen de bottleneck.  Wissel Het wisselalternatief bestaat in deze case uit het toevoegen van een extra overloopwissel. Het enkelspoortraject wordt hierdoor korter en er kunnen dus per saldo meer treinen de bottleneck passeren.  Pendel Een pendel is op een zo hoog mogelijk frequentie heen en weer rijden door de bottleneck. Voordeel is het gelijkmatig vervoeren van reizigers door de bottleneck. Van dit alternatief zijn drie verschillende varianten gemaakt, omdat er hier verschillende mogelijkheden waren.  Colonne Bij het colonnealternatief worden zoveel mogelijk treinen in één richting door de bottleneck gestuurd waarna de rijrichting omgedraaid wordt en in de andere richting zoveel mogelijk treinen gaan rijden. Theoretisch kan zo het grootste aantal treinen door de bottleneck rijden. In de case moest wel rekening worden gehouden met het plaatsen van extra seinen om dit alternatief uitvoerbaar te maken. De pendelalternatieven bleken op dit baanvak geen verbetering op te leveren voor de totale reizigervertraging. De pendelalternatieven zijn daarom niet gekozen. De wissel- en colonne alternatieven hebben te veel kosten. De kosten wogen niet op tegen de baten, daarom moest er een keuze gemaakt worden tussen het nulplus- en brekenalternatief. Uiteindelijk is het nulplusalternatief gekozen omdat de implementeerbaarheid van het brekenalternatief erg nadelig is. De belangrijkste conclusies die uiteindelijk naar voren kwamen zijn:  De versperringsmaatregelen zijn sterk afhankelijk van het ""BasisUur Patroon"" (BUP). Het BUP is altijd een randvoorwaarde. Hoe beter op deze randvoorwaarde aangesloten wordt, hoe beter de oplossing voor de reizigers is.  Door analyse zijn versperringsmaatregelen significant te verbeteren. In de case was een vermindering van de reizigersvertraging met meer dan 7% mogelijk en zelfs 24% met aanpassingen aan de infrastructuur. Analyses zijn nodig omdat er geen algemene strategie op elk baanvak toegepast kan worden.  De effecten van versperringsmaatregelen zijn uit te drukken in maatgevende getallen. De reizigersvertraging is hiervan de belangrijkste. De kwaliteit van deze getallen hangt echter sterk af van de kwaliteit van de invoergegevens.  De eerste fase van een versperring is cruciaal, want als een versperringsmaatregel van kracht is, wordt de capaciteit maximaal benut en zal een verstoring uit de eerste fase lang doorwerken. De belangrijkste aanbevelingen uit dit onderzoek zijn:  Analyseer de belangrijkste versperringsmaatregelen. Veelbelovend is het toepassen van het colonneprincipe op een baanvak met dubbel enkelspoor beveiliging.  Communiceer kritieke punten met het treinpersoneel en treindienstleiding. Zo kunnen de mogelijkheden maximaal benut worden en neemt het aantal ongewenste afwijkingen af.  Verbeter de nauwkeurigheid van de invoergegevens. Een belangrijke winst kan geboekt worden door het ontwikkelen van een dynamisch reizigerstoedelingsmodel.  Onderzoek de automatisering van de processen voor een real-time methode. Alle gegevens moeten beschikbaar zijn en de berekening moet automatisch uit te voeren zijn, om in elke situatie een passende oplossing te kunnen berekenen en implementeren.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""
