(mentor); Winterwerp, J.C. (mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Van Maren, D.S. (mentor)","2007","Most estuarine, and some coastal, areas are characterised by large amounts of fine-grained cohesive and non-cohesive sediments. At sufficiently high concentrations, sediment transport in suspension may significantly influence the hydrodynamics. In sediment-laden flow with concentrations of approximately, stratification may occur due to a vertical gradient of sediment concentration. In a stratified flow, turbulence is damped due to buoyancy destruction. According to many reports in literature buoyancy destruction results in a decrease of effective hydraulic roughness. Furthermore, the sediment induced stratification causes an appreciable modification of the vertical profiles of velocity, vertical eddy viscosity and shear stresses (e.g. Winterwerp [2001])). Considering the propagation of a tidal wave in estuaries, the decrease of roughness results in an increase of the depth-averaged velocity and an increase of tidal amplitudes of the water level. When modelling flow behaviour in estuarine and coastal environments, vertical gradients of horizontal velocity and sediment and salt concentration in stratified systems can only be simulated with three dimensional numerical modelling. However a full three dimensional model is not always practical. The wide shallow domains that occur in civil engineering practice make depth-averaged simulation often necessary in view of the computational demands. However no theoretically accepted, justifiable parameterisation for effective hydraulic roughness in turbulent sediment-laden flow exists to date. Therefore the effect of suspended sediment on tidal propagation in estuaries is not accounted for in 2Dh modelling. This makes 2Dh modelling intrinsically less accurate than 3D. In case the flow contains an appreciable amount of suspended sediment it is difficult to reliably predict flow behaviour in estuaries through 2Dh modelling. In depth-averaged equations solved in 2Dh models, the bottom shear stress is explicitly prescribed using a friction coefficient. The reduction of hydraulic roughness due to stratification can in this case effectively be accounted for by alteration of the friction coefficient. By applying theories commonly used for stratified flow in the earth's atmosphere and taking into account the free surface effects, a depth-averaged friction law was derived This friction law is validated by numerical experiments with the 1DV POINT MODEL. These numerical experiments show that the buoyancy effect is small compared to the integral effect of sediment in nature that is reported in literature. To further evaluate the depth-averaged roughness parameterisation it is applied to a numerical model of the Yangtze Estuary (China). Calibration shows that the bottom of the Yangtze Estuary is very smooth even without the buoyancy effect, and that the buoyancy effect decreases the effective roughness further. For the Yangtze Estuary the buoyancy effect is properly simulated by the depth-averaged roughness parameterisation. Through the parameterisation the effective ChÃ©zy coefficient is increased from for clear water to for flow conditions commonly found in the Yangtze Estuary. Thereby the sediment-induced error in 2Dh modelling is reduced by approximately 75%. From this it is concluded that 2Dh modelling becomes more accurate through application of the roughness parameterisation. Several other issues can be done that might increase the reliability of 2Dh models even more. For example it is recommended to implement the roughness parameterisation in the numerical code of DELFT3D-FLOW, so that the effective hydraulic roughness is continuously updated with feedback to hydrodynamics and sediment transport.","sediment; stratification; flow; buoyancy; turbulence","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Deze elementen worden in de fabriek gemaakt waarna ze worden getransporteerd naar de bouwplaats. Op de bouwplaats worden deze onderdelen aan elkaar bevestigd. Deze werkwijze bespaart tijd in de uitvoeringsfase ten opzichte van traditionele betonbouw (bouwen met ter plaatse gestort beton). Op de bouw is het vaak wenselijk dat het aantal handelingen beperkt blijft. Om dit te kunnen bereiken worden de verbindingen vaak scharnierend uitgevoerd. De elementen hoeven dan alleen op hun juiste positie te worden geplaatst en bevestigd. Onder normale omstandigheden zullen er geen problemen optreden met een geprefabriceerde constructie. Interessant wordt het wanneer er een bijzondere belasting aangrijpt op de constructie, bijvoorbeeld een gasexplosie. Het optreden van een gasexplosie kan ervoor zorgen dat een element bezwijkt. In de traditionele bouw met monolietconstructies is herverdeling van krachten wanneer een draagelement bezwijkt mogelijk. Voor geprefabriceerde betonconstructies met scharnierende verbindingen is dat niet het geval. Het bezwijken van elementen kan voortschrijdend instorten van de constructie tot gevolg hebben. Een constructieve oorzaak voor het voortschrijdend instorten van constructies is het ontbreken van voldoende incasseringsvermogen van constructies. Onder incasseringsvermogen wordt verstaan de weerstand die de constructie levert tegen de optredende belastingen. Het bezwijken van één element kan ervoor zorgen dat een deel van de draagconstructie instort. Het volume van de draagconstructie dat bezwijkt, moet zo beperkt mogelijk zijn. Er zal dus moeten worden gezocht naar constructieve mogelijkheden om het incasseringsvermogen van de constructie te verhogen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is het vinden van constructieve methoden om het incasseringsvermogen in constructies te verhogen bij een gasexplosie plaatsvindt. In de nieuwe norm prEN 1991-1-7, worden wel rekenregels gegeven betreffende voortschrijdende instorting. Het is dus zaak dat deze regels op de juiste wijze worden toegepast in de praktijk. Daarom wordt er ook onderzocht in hoeverre die regels geldig zijn. In dit onderzoek is de constructieve samenhang onderzocht na een gasexplosie aan de hand van een een modelgebouw.

For CubeSats employing the generic inflatable de-orbit device discussed here, this range is extended to 910 km by increasing the frontal surface area of the satellite. The device essentially is of the attached ballute type and consists of a thin membrane covering an inflatable structure, which is chemically rigidized after deployment. Coatings are applied to the structure to provide protection against the hostile low Earth orbit environment and to manipulate the temperature of the inflatable.

A preliminary design of the pyramid-shaped device is performed for a 1-unit CubeSat of 1 kg mass, with focus on ease of integration. Initial results of the physical development of the structure are shown. A development model of a flexible connector piece is constructed to which five inflatable tubes are attached at right angles in a leak-tight manner. The method used to bond the tubes to the connector piece as well as attachment of the membranes to the inflatable structure is outlined. Lastly, stowage and deployment of the inflatable structure are discussed.

(mentor)","2007","In the framework of the ComCoast project, the concept of the Crest Drainage Dike has been studied regarding the reduction of wave overtopping. This study only focuses on the average wave overtopping discharge. The basic concept of the Crest Drainage Dike is a basin, integrated in the crest of the dike, that collects overtopping water and thus reduces the load on the inner slope of the dike. The collected water in the crest basin is drained landward or seaward through pipes. The main goal of this report is to identify the physical background of the concept of the Crest Drainage Dike and to predict the wave overtopping discharge as a function of hydraulic and geometric boundary conditions. Therefore two different types of theoretical studies have been executed. The first study is process-based and serves as a basis for the numerical program that has been developed. Since this model is partly based on several assumptions, several physical model tests have been executed to verify or reject the stated hypotheses. In the physical model tests, several hydraulic and geometric boundary conditions, such as the wave height, the crest freeboard, the use of berms, the wave spectra, the wave steepness and the drain layouts, have been varied. Since the predictions of the numerical program are well in line with the measured wave overtopping discharges, the numerical program is used to investigate the use of a Crest Drainage Dike in two case studies. The case studies are the Hondsbossche Sea Defence and the Perkpolder Sea Defence. Both dikes are located in the Netherlands The use of this numerical program gives a better insight in the physical background of the Crest Drainage Dike. The description of these physics is the second part of the theoretical study. For dikes with severe wave attack, such as the Hondsbossche Sea Defence, only a small fraction of the waves is reaching the crest of the dike. However, the waves that do reach the crest of the dike have a relatively large volume and the buffer capacity of the Crest Drainage Dike limits the effectiveness of the Crest Drainage Dike. Besides this, there is a high statistical uncertainty since the average wave overtopping discharges are determined by only a couple of waves. For dikes with a lower wave attack, such as the Perkpolder Sea Defence, more waves with a lower volume per wave are overtopping and therefore the concept of the Crest Drainage Dike works well. However, the crest freeboard reduction with the use of the Crest Drainage Dike is in these specific cases is only minor. Based on the numerical studies and the current Dutch overtopping criteria, the reduction of the crest freeboard with the use of the Crest Drainage Dike is determined and is significantly lower then the assumed reductions in earlier studies.","crest; drainage; dike; wave; overtopping","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","At locations where two natural streams of different velocity come together, a mixing layer develops. In this free shear flow, the velocity difference between the two streams is gradually reduced through the exchange of lateral momentum. This involves different forms of turbulent phenomena. If the width of the flow domain is large compared to the water depth, as is often the case in rivers, the mixing layer is shallow. This shallowness further complicates the flow patterns. In this thesis the development of shallow mixing layers is studied using Particle Tracking in a field study in a natural river. The aim is to improve our understanding of shallow mixing layers and hence to contribute to improvements of computational models of these flows. Field measurements were performed in a lowland section of the river Spree (width 30m, depth 1m) near Berlin, in collaboration with the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB). A 30m long splitter plate was constructed in the middle of the river, parallel to the banks, with an upstream weir on one side to control the discharge. A large shear layer developed with noticeable coherent structures. Three setups were created with varying velocity differences across the splitter. Both single point measurements (Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry, ADV) and whole field measurements (Particle Tracking Velocimetry, PTV) were done. The Particle Tracking consisted of the interval release of floating particles in the beginning of the mixing layer, from the end of the splitter. These measurements were done at night using small tea candle lights, providing sufficient contrast with the water surface. Three runs were filmed from a camera fixed in a tree at 10m above the water surface. A special point of interest in the data processing, which was done using custom-made Matlab programming, was the perspective transformation of the camera images. The analysis of the Particle Tracking data focused on: - mean velocity profiles in the horizontal plane - visualisation of particle streaklines - Lagrangian single particle and two-particle statistics Using Particle Tracking as a whole-field velocimetry tool proved difficult. The particle density was too low and the area of interest was not completely covered. Nevertheless, the characteristic tangential mean velocity profiles were found. The streakline plots proved the existence of large two-dimensional coherent structures at the low-velocity edge of the mixing layer in the two setups with the highest shear. The use of Lagrangian statistics proved a particularly valuable tool for acquiring information on particle dispersion. Moreover the Lagrangian analysis matched well with the Particle Tracking data. It yielded information on the spreading rate of the particle cloud and the ensemble averaged separation in time of initially close particle pairs. Most notably, the result of the latter was identification of two distinct separating regimes using Batchelor time scaling. Lastly, the ADV analysis, performed by IGB in Berlin, showed that the advective stresses of the horizontal velocities were an order of magnitude higher than the plane Reynolds stresses. The ADV analysis, which is not completed yet, will help to gain insight into the role of the composite bed friction on the lateral momentum exchange; thus complementing previous laboratory research at TU Delft.","particle tracking velocimetry; fluid dynamics; turbulence; field study; lagrangian fluid mechanics","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

The objective of the study is to investigate if a TPP would be technically possible and economically feasible for Saemangeum. This has resulted in a design for a Tidal Power Plant. All decisions were made taking into account possible future shifts in facts in economy, energy prices and spatial planning ideas. The most important future functions will be polders for agricultural, industrial or residential purposes and a fresh water basin. A design without one of these functions is most likely to be rejected during the decision process. Existing plants and their performances have been studied as well as several feasibility studies made throughout the years, including the Sihwa project, a single, low basin plant which is at present under construction in South-Korea. A single, high basin and a single, low basin scheme are the most interesting schemes for the Saemangeum case. A bulb turbine is the most suitable type of turbine for tidal power. A Storage Area Approach Model was made to predict the energy output. The possibility to vary the basin area (including the depth-storage relationship) is built in, as well as the possibility to vary the number, efficiency and rated head of turbines (related to the head and flow velocities) and additional sluicing capacity. Also the construction costs, a Net Present Value calculation and the annual energy output are some of the output parameters of the model (with varying discount rate, future energy price). For various reasons it was decided that a layout with the basin area of 114 km2 at MSL must be selected and equipped with a low basin plant: This layout contains a large inter tidal zone, both a fresh water basin and polders, and it turns out to be the economically most feasible option. The selected layout contains a fresh water basin of 90 km2. Generation will only take place in one direction, from sea to basin (flood generation). No extra sluicing capacity is needed, as the 300 meters of present sluice length are sufficient. The powerhouse will be equipped with 18 bulb turbines (runner diameter 7.5 m) and generators, having a total installed capacity of 142 MW. The plant will generate approximately 454 GWh per year and the construction costs will amount to 286 Million US$. For the construction process a cofferdam consisting of circular cells and connecting cells is built around the future TPP power house location. At the barrage side the circular cells have a diameter of 31.8 m and at the basin side the circular cells have a diameter of 25.2 m. The given parameters have been determined by an economic optimisation. The numbers given above are based on assumptions: the plants design has a maximal Net Present Value after 40 years, with a discount rate of 4 %, an annual rise of energy price of 4 % and an actual energy price of US$ 0,03 per kWh. This production price has been set at US$ 0,03 per kWh, because the plant is expected to be able to compete with other energy sources. Under these assumptions tidal power in Saemangeum turns out to be attractive and feasible. The Net Present Value after 40 years of operation is US$ 187.6 Million for a discount rate of 4 % and an expected annual rise of energy price of 4 %. The break even point will be reached after 25 years of operation and the Internal Rate of Return is 6.5 %.","tidal power; Saemangeum; South-Korea; bulb turbine; basin","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Van de Kuilen, J.W.G. (mentor); Coenders, J.L. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor)","2007","In the last few years the timber gridshell has gained popularity. Recently two gridshells were constructed: the Weald and Downland gridshell in 2002 and the Savill Garden gridshell in 2006. These structures are examples from which the benefits of timber gridshells become apparent. A gridshell can display elegance and style, with its slender ribs curved into shape. It is also a sustainable structure, as the use of material is small, due to the shell behaviour. Also the timber can source from sustainable resources. Despite the advantages of the timber gridshell and the interest in sustainable engineering and free form architecture, the gridshell is not used very often. What can be seen as an important reason for this is the fact that the design process for a free form gridshell is rather complicated. An iterative design process is used to determine the grid geometry, which is only known to a few people. Main goal of this Master’s thesis is a study into the application of a design tool based on the geometrical properties of the grid of a grid shell, i.e. equal distance between the nodes on the quadrangle grid. The gridshell structure is a structure built with long slender laths. The laths are positioned in a flat quadrangle mat with one or more layers in two directions. This mat is then pushed and pulled into the desired shape by bending the laths and deforming the quadrangle meshes into rhombic shapes. When the desired shape is achieved, the laths are attached to edge supports and the structure is stiffened by diagonal bracing or applying a continuous layer on top of the laths. Timber is outstandingly suitable for this kind of building method. It is lightweight compared to its strength and can be bent and twisted relatively easy. Timber has always been used in structures by mankind. It was not until the twentieth century for timber to be used in large scale shell structures. In 1975 the first large scale timber gridshell was finished. This structure is the Multihalle in Mannheim. The structure can be seen as true pioneers work. The geometry of the structure was determined by physical form finding and it was constructed by pushing up the flat mat of laths by aid of scaffolding towers and fork lifts. More recently the Weald and Downland Gridshell and the Savill Garden gridshell were constructed. The former was constructed by lowering down the flat mat into shape on a special movable scaffolding. The latter was constructed by simply laying out the grid on a pre-shaped formwork. The gridshells were designed by aid of a computer form finding technique. The gridshell design tool has been set up to generate a gridshell grid on an arbitrary surface. The method used to generate the gridshell geometry uses two spheres to determine the intersection points of the gridshell laths. If the two spheres are positioned in such a way that their midpoints are located on the surface and that the two spheres are intersecting, there will be two intersection points between the two spheres and the surface. Together with the sphere midpoints, these four points form a mesh in the gridshell grid. A script has been created to execute this determination of points in a sequence which locates all possible intersection points on the surface. The sequence starts from start-off sections, interpolated on the surface. This implies that the correctness of the grid is dependent on the correctness of these start-off sections. Although the results of the grid generation tool look promising, further testing is advised to prove this. The design tool has been set up having the possibility to check the curve angles of the generated grid. From these angles the bending stresses can be calculated and checked if the bending or torsion stress criteria are exceeded. If this is the case, the checked element is given a colour. The generated structure can be checked visually for stress levels exceeding the stress criteria.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","In 1997 cracks were found in the relatively new movable part of the Van Brienenoord bridge, a repair method for steel orthotropic bridges has searched for ever since. For fixed bridges a solution was found: the steel deck plate is overlayed with a concrete layer with a thickness varying between 50mm and 120mm and on top of the repair layer a new wearing surface is created. The concrete layer is either connected by studs or by an epoxy layer. Movable bridges have a thin wearing surface. Due to weight restrictions, it is not possible to apply a relatively thick concrete layer on top of the steel deck plate. So, different solutions have been researched and the best option seems to be to overlay the steel deck plate with a thin heavily reinforced concrete layer. This method has already been analysed under static loads, but also the fatigue resistance should be guaranteed. This master thesis project aims at designing a 20mm concrete layer in order to increase the lifespan of an orthotropic steel deck of a movable bridge by replacing the wearing surface of this deck by this concrete layer. The main topic dealt with is to determine the fatigue life of the repaired structure. It is assumed that the governing position in the structure is the connection between the trough web and the steel deck plate above the crossbeam. At this position the largest hogging moment exists. Three different alternatives are defined to come up with the most effective solution, all with the same composition, dimensions and material properties except the type of reinforcement. The repair method consists of a 17mm thick high strength fibreless concrete layer, on top of an epoxy layer sprinkled in with calcinated bauxite. The different types of reinforcement are: epoxy coated and sprinkled in with sand Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), stainless steel and epoxy coated “ordinary” steel reinforcement, all with a bar diameter of 6mm. The centre to centre distance of the rebars is 12mm and the concrete cover on the rebars is 6mm thick. The stresses occurring due to the fatigue loading based on the Eurocode (load model 3) are calculated and the fatigue lifetime of each material is defined. Since uncertainties exist about the fatigue behaviour of the interaction between materials, an experimental research has been started. Test specimens were created and dynamically loaded by a hogging moment in a four point bending test. In the experimental research it became clear that the steel reinforced alternatives fail by reinforcing bar failure, whereas the CFRP alternative fails by debonding of the rebars. Besides these failure modes, concrete cracks occurred in the anchorage zone of the reinforcement. These cracks have been further researched, because they might become critical in practice. It is concluded that the concrete is only governing in case of relatively high moments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

This was done by experimental research in the wave-flume of the Fluid mechanics laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology. 17 experiments were performed with packing densities between 44.8 and 61.1 percent. For every experiment the under layer, toe and armour layer were rebuilt. The placed Antifer layer was tested with eight irregular wave series with increasing significant wave heights from 9cm up to 20cm. From these experiments followed that regular placement methods behave more stable than irregular placement methods with a similar packing density. Also the more irregular (less accurate) positioning of blocks within a regular placement method caused a decrease in stability. Higher packing densities for equal placement methods lead to higher stabilities and higher reflection coefficients. The resulting -values were between 4.0 and 23.7. If the reflection coefficients during the first wave series were high, this resulted in more overtopping during the latest wave series, which indicates that there is a positive correlation between the reflection and the overtopping. Overall it could be concluded that, when the under layer and the toe are smooth and the blocks can be placed accurately, the best performing placement methods are the closed pyramid placement method for packing densities around 45% and 50% and the double pyramid placement method for packing densities around 55% and 60%. The size of the openings to the under layer, of the double pyramid placement method, influenced the reflection coefficients. When the second layer was shifted half a nominal diameter upwards the reflection coefficients were minimal. It is recommended to investigate the possible negative influence of oblique incoming waves on the stability of the double pyramid placement method. The eventual choice of the placement method and packing density depends on the allowed reflection and/or overtopping and the construction costs. The construction costs can be divided into the production costs, the placement costs and the constant costs. For equal constant costs and equal or small differences in placement costs the placement with the higher packing density and accompanying stability value is cheaper for high design wave heights. When the placement costs decrease for both placements or only for the placement with the higher packing density, then the placement with the higher packing density becomes also cheaper for lower wave heights.","antifer; placement; stability","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

In this design, the breakwater is constructed of a sand core and a layer of large stones directly on top of it, without the traditional filter layers in-between. The single layer of stones serves as one open filter layer that has to reduce the wave induced flow and turbulence well enough to keep the erosion of sand through the filter layer within an acceptable amount. By accepting a controlled amount of erosion and necessity of maintenance, the alternative design can be very cost-effective over the life-span of the structure. In cooperation with Van Oord, one of the world market leaders in dredging and coastal engineering, a research into the applicability of very open filters on sand cores has been initiated at Delft University of Technology. My thesis study is the second consecutive in this larger research that has the goal of finding a good theoretical description of the occurring erosion processes and developing a practical design tool for breakwaters with a very open filter layer on a sand core. The focus of my study is the relation between the wave height, -period and regularity and the amount of erosion occurring with it. Physical model tests for this study have been performed in the long sediment transport flume of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory. This flume is equipped with a wave generator that loads the structure with the desired wave spectrum. The results have been analysed for relations between loading and erosion.","open filter; breakwater; geometrically open filter; hydraulically sand open; sand core","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","Heterogeneous System Development needs Hardware/Software Partitioning performed early on in the development process. In order to do this early on predictions of hardware resource usage and delay are necessary. In this thesis a Quantitative Model is presented that can make early predictions to support the partitioning process. The model is based on Software Complexity Metrics, which capture important aspects of functions like control intensity, data intensity, code size, etc. In order to remedy the interdependence of the software metrics a Principal Component Analysis performed. The hardware characteristics were determined by automatically generating VHDL from C using the DWARV C-to-VHDL compiler. Using the results from the principal component analysis, the quantitative model was generated using linear regression. The error of the model di?ers per hardware characteristic. We show that for ?ip-?ops the mean error for the predictions is 69%. In conclusion, our quantitative model can make fast and su?ciently accurate area predictions to support Hardware/Software Partitioning. In the future, the model can be extended by introducing extra software metrics, using more advanced modeling techniques, and using a larger collection of functions and algorithms.","reconfigurable computing; regression analysis; software metrics; C language; hardware description languages; principal component analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

The removal of iron from groundwater is a common treatment step in the production of drinking water. Even when clear water meets the drinking water standards, the water quality in the distribution system can deteriorate due to settling of iron (hydroxide) particles or posttreatment flocculation of dissolved iron. Therefore it is important to remove dissolved and particulate iron to very low levels. The objective of this study was to reduce the particle load towards the distribution system and to improve the iron removal at the groundwater pumping station Harderbroek, consisting of aeration, rapid sand filtration and tower aeration. A maximum flow of 1800 m3/h can be treated and the average production is 800 m3/h. Although previous research showed the clear water meets the drinking water regulations, the drinking water company Vitens is not satisfied with the turbidity and iron concentration of the clear water. The mean iron concentration is 0.04 mg/l.","iron; groundwater; Harderbroek; hydroxide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vrouwenvelder, A.C.W.M. (mentor); Jonkman, S.N. (mentor); de Bruijn, K.M. (mentor)","2007","The new flood safety approach for the Netherlands includes, besides the probability of extreme water levels, other type of dike failures and the consequences of a flood. The consequences of a flood are economic damage, materialistic damage and the number of fatalities. To determine the possible number of fatalities during a flood, fatality functions have been proposed by Jonkman. The Jonkman functions are mainly based on the flooding in 1953 in the Netherlands. Fatality functions give the relationships between flood characteristics and the fatality rate. Flood characteristics are: water depth, rise rate, flow velocity and arrival time. To improve the insight in the relationship between the flood characteristics and the fatalities the flooding of New Orleans, caused by hurricane Katrina, is researched. To determine the flood characteristics of the New Orleans flood a part of the total flooding is simulated. The output of the simulations is used to determine relationships between the flood characteristics and the fatalities. In the New Orleans flood event, two relationships can be distinguished. The first is the breach zone relationship. In this zone the building damage is high and the flood conditions are severe. The flow velocity and the water depth are the characteristics that determine this zone. The second relationship is the remaining zone relationship. In the remaining zone the flood conditions are less severe and the water depth causes the fatalities. Compared to the existing Jonkman fatality functions the biggest difference is that the rise rate has no clear influence on the number of fatalities in New Orleans. In previous studies the rise rate is considered a very important flood characteristic, but in the New Orleans flooding it had almost no influence. The two approaches have been determined on two independent flood events. To compare the two approaches they have both been applied to a case study of dike ring 14 in the Netherlands. For this dike ring there are ten possible flood scenarios for which the number of fatalities is estimated with both approaches. The fatality estimations with both approaches are in the same order. The New Orleans relationships give a slightly higher number of fatalities. To use these numbers of fatalities in a risk analysis, the individual and societal risks are quantified. The individual risk is the probability that a person dies at a certain location given a flood. Comparison between the two approaches shows that the spatial distribution of the individual risk is relatively large. So on a local scale it is difficult to determine the risks. The societal risk is the probability of a certain number of fatalities. The societal risk is a measure for the safety of a larger area, like a dike ring. When the two approaches are compared the differences in societal risk are relatively small. The difference expressed in a protection water is only 0.40 meter. The New Orleans functions give a protection water level that is 0.40 meter higher than the one for Jonkmans functions. This difference is smaller than the uncertainty in the extreme water levels, which is approximately 0.80 meter. So on a larger scale the number of fatalities can be estimated reasonably well. Improvements on the assumptions and more information on for instance the evacuation rate will lead to a better model. But to what extent does a better model influences the decisions that have to be made in the new flood safety approach.","New Orleans; Katrina; fatality; fatalities","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Van Goethem, M. (mentor); Van Ommen, J.R. (mentor)","2007","The goal of this project was to embed the Shock Wave Reactor (SWR) into an ethylene plant in order to assess the performance of this unique reactor. The performances are based on the energy consumption and ethylene yield. There are some researches done. Unfortunately no information is found in articles about how to embed the SWR in an ethylene plant. So, to embed the SWR, the behavior of the whole plant must be monitored. The embedding of the SWR in an ethylene plant is done by integration this reactor in an ethylene plant based on conventional cracking. Conventional cracking is done by a furnace. The only different is the cracking reactor.The separation configuration is taken the same. Strong GDP (gross domestic product) growth in major regions results in strong petrochemical demand growth. The reason of this growth is due to the growing market of China and India. So the importance of ethylene increases. Ethylene is and in the future still be an important bulk chemistry in the petrochemical and industry The process chemistry with its thermodynamics and kinetics are based in earlier research done by R.Bosma. Normally more than 1 million reactions occur during ethane cracking but here 7 major reactions are used. The residence time plays a big role in this cracking. Thermodynamically high temperature is favorable but kinetically not. High temperatures increase the secondary reactions with more by-products as result.The SWR was already modeled in Matlab by R.Bosma [21]. To investigate the SWR energy consumption, the SWR is modeled in Aspen. A user model in Aspen has been made, which reflects the behavior of the SWR at some given conditions. This Aspen model is validated in order to determine the reliability of this model. The model is successfully made but some parameters where slightly different. With Aspen Pinch, the determination of the energy consumption is made. This is very important because the energy consumption will conclude if this SWR economical favorable compared with a conventional furnace. Also the environmental impact of the SWR has been studied. It is known in the aviation industry, shock waves produce a lot of sound power. It can have a certain risk to the human health and environment. This is a complex problem because of the difficulties to monitor the sound behavior of this reactor. It is concluded that the SWR is an energy slurping process compared with a conventional furnace. The ethylene yield is also lower than the ethylene yield produced with a conventional furnace.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Section Product & Process Engineering","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Process Technology","","","",""
