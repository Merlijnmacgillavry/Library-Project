(mentor); Lefaivre, L. (mentor); Cuperus, Y. (mentor)","2003","Because of its fascination with safety and control, Dutch society at the end of the twentieth century became subject to fear for the unknown. Panic and terror overpowered society, and imprisoned it into a permanent state of institutional living. The proposed alternative for this development is to revalue and restate the achievement of todays society. The valuation of the panoptic and polycentric model helps to propose a positive perspective in dealing with the institutionalised living. The historical precedents of institutionalised living in Dutch society show the continuity of the issue, and help to relativize the current situation. As Schama stated, seeing what distinguished insiders from outsiders is one way of defining the limiting perimeter of the culture itself. The paper discusses this distinction in the seventeenth century Dutch city. The network of institutions that dealt with outsiders proofed to be a humane and relatively peaceful way to bridge the gap between insiders and outsiders. By looking at the asylum seekers centre, which is a result of the way the Dutch deal with outsiders nowadays, the perimeters of contemporary Dutch culture are explored to a certain degree. The establishment of asylum seekers centres as alien and unwanted centralised institutions in the outskirts of the Dutch landscape has mostly been defined by fear for the unknown. This has partly contributed to an increasing polarisation of insiders and outsiders in Dutch society.Architecture, as an object that manifests the type of distinction between insiders and outsiders, and the models and processes underlying the realization of architecture, play an important role in the manifestation of this polarisation. In the reflexive period of a temporary declining pressure on the asylum seekers centres, by a declining number of admitted refugees, other ways of dealing with outsiders should be considered. The architectural design project is an alternative proposal for an asylum seekers centre, as a polycentric, anticlave network of institutionalised housing. The project tries to normalise the dwelling situation of asylum seekers as much as possible. It does so by dividing the common asylum seekers centre into many small parts that interweave in an existing urban fabric. History has taught us that outsiders are relatively well integrated in a polycentric network of institutions. Today the polycentric network could again serve as a model in order to deal with the housing of asylum seekers. The limiting perimeters of the Dutch culture are in this project redefined, restated, and extended.","architecture; asylum seekers centre; immigration; integration; housing; institution","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor); Holthuijsen, L.H. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Zitman, T.J. (mentor)","2003","The wave growth experiment in the Australian Lake George (Young and Verhagen, 1996a) is the first multiple-station depth-limited wave growth experiment and the dataset is probably the best that is available. The lake has a horizontal flat bottom with a depth of about 2 meters and is orientated north-south. There are however some discrepancies in the wave growth data that were observed. The development of the waves differed significantly between northern- and southern-wind cases and to a lesser extent between day and night. In addition, the significant wave height decreases with an increasing fetch after a certain distance. These anomalies may have a significant influence on the coefficients of the wave growth expressions that were determined by Young and Verhagen (1996a). Therefore, the objective of the present study is to determine the cause of these anomalies and to investigate their influence on the wave growth expressions. Simulations with the SWAN wave model, in a version that uses the RIAM technique to solve the quadruplet wave-wave interactions show that the differences in the wave growth between northern and southern are caused by the lateral coastline over the first half of the lake. The observed wave growth during northern-wind is very much comparable to the idealized situation of wave growth in a one-dimensional situation with a straight coastline perpendicular to the wind direction. In southern-wind conditions, the wave growth over the first half of the lake is significantly slower. In addition, the recorded spectra in the first stations during southern-wind are anomalous. It was found that the decrease of the wave height in the second part of the lake is greater during northern-wind than during southern-wind. The decrease during northern-wind is much stronger during the night than during the day. The cause for this decrease of the wave height had not been found in the present study. There are however some indications that the shape of the lateral coastline are (at least partly) responsible, but that whitecapping and quadruplet wave-wave interactions mask this behavior. There may also be some secondary influences of atmospheric stability (stronger decrease in unstable conditions). The shape and location of the coastline in Lake George have a strong influence on the directional properties of the two-dimensional wave spectra. The wave model shows two peaks in the directional wave spectra at some measurement stations and in case of slanting wind conditions, the model shows that the waves tend to align to the main direction of the lake, rather than to the wind direction. New coefficients for the wave growth expressions are proposed here, based on the northern-wind cases as these cases seem to be fairly free from the influence of the lateral coastline. In addition, the influence of the decrease in the significant wave height is ignored explicitly","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Veale, D. (mentor); Van der Molen, W. (mentor); Ligteringen, H. (mentor)","2003","The downtime of a jetty terminal is one of the key factors in the planning and design of the onshore facilities. Long waiting times (downtime) due to restricting environmental conditions should be avoided. During the first design phase of a berth for Liquefied Natural Gas carriers many alternatives are open but no detailed calculations have yet been made for the analysis of ship motions and line forces. A rapid assessment tool, e.g. in the form of a nomogram, ca be helpful to give the designer a quick estimate of the expected downtime of the several alternatives without having to perform detailed (model) studies. This will help the designer to quickly oversee the implications of his first berth layout alternatives with relatively little effort. First a literature study has been performed after which computer simulations have been carried out in order to study the behavior of LNG vessels, moored to a jetty. For the simulations use was made of the Time Domain simulation program Termsim 11. A first version of the rapid assessment tool has been developed. For this study a 130.000 m3 LNG tanker has been chosen, with a specific jetty mooring layout and a constant underkeel clearance. Since so many factors influence the behavior of a moored LNG carrier it appears that a nomogram is not the most suitable tool for the calculation of downtime. Therefor a different tool form has been designed. The main advantage of this tool is that it is able to include an unlimited number of parameters. The rapid downtime assessment tool is a ""website based tool"", which gives the maximum line forces and the maximum manifold movements for a given set of environmental conditions. The current version is designed for a specific case. However, this limitation can easily be overcome by adding different scenarios to the existing data set.","LNG terminal; downtime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Groenveld, R. (mentor); Horstmeier, T.H.W. (mentor); Marriage, J. (mentor)","2003","This Final Report presents the results of research on the sensitivity of outcome construction costs due to varying site investigation data. The study concentrated on the design for the construction of a new port and dry-dock complex at Duqm in the Al Wusta Region of the Sultanate of Oman. The study was carried out in co-operation with Posford Haskoning Ltd., Peterborough, United Kingdom. This report presents designs for two design phases, the preliminary design phase and the detailed design phase. In the scope of this research, a port lay-out already prepared by Posford Haskoning was adopted for this study. Following port components have been designed: breakwaters, quay walls, dredging works and land reclamation. Next costs and designs of the different port components are compared between the preliminary and the detailed design phase. In the first design phase, referred to as the preliminary design phase, a design is presented on basis of limited data. A lower bound (optimistic) and upper bound (realistic pessimistic) design are also presented. Subsequently cost estimations for the designs are established using a unit rate technique. In the second design phase, referred to as the detailed design phase, a design is presented on basis of more detailed data. Again lower bound and upper bound were indicated. Same unit rate technique was used to establish a cost estimate for the detailed design phase. The protective structures consist of two breakwaters. The main breakwater is protected with Core-Loc, the lee breakwater with rock as primary armour unit. A block-work wall is preferred as quay wall structure. In port projects like Duqm the geotechnical and wave data are of uttermost importance. On basis of the data available it has been indicated what design margins could realistically be expected for the breakwater design, the quay wall design and the dredging works and land reclamation. With the available information the sensitivity on costs of variations in the wave climate have been analysed. The results of this analysis are only valid for Duqm but they provide a good view for comparable projects. Contrary, the limited geotechnical information available made it only possible to give an indication of the margins to be expected at Duqm. For determination of the inshore wave climate same offshore wave data were used in both design stages. Although same offshore wave data were used in both design stages, the inshore wave climate changed considerably. In the first design phase hand calculations were used to determinate the inshore wave climate while in the second design phase the inshore wave climate was determined with a SWAN-analysis. The difference in inshore wave climate can be explained by the fact that the SWAN-analysis does take account of the bathymetric profile and the shape of the land. Small changes in wave climate can have great influence on the breakwater costs. Especially at the point where rock of sufficient weight to be stable is not available anymore and the breakwater has to be protected with Core-Loc primary armour.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
