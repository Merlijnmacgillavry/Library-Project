(mentor)","2013","The exploitation of the abundant renewable energy potential in most Small Island Developing States (SIDS) will be crucial in the near future for safeguarding their access to affordable energy, and the preservation of their eco-system. Some SIDS have already introduced renewable energy technology (RET) for exploiting primarily the available wind and solar energy. However, these islands are dealing with the intermittent nature of these renewable energy sources by only compensating the energy generation part of the electrical network. This limits the penetration level of RETs based on the flexibility of the supply side. The other option for compensating the variable output of RETs is demand side management (DSM), and even though the theory behind this subject is well documented, little attention has been given to actual SIDS cases. Therefore, this paper presents an assessment of the DSM potential in Aruba, because it is currently one of the few SIDS with a significant penetration level of RETs. This assessment relies on a mixed research method approach, based among other things on Linear Programming techniques, which can also be easily applied to other SID-cases. The results suggest that the current DSM potential for Aruba is a compensation capability of approximately 12,7-17,8 MW within 10 minutes, if only the largest consumer, i.e. the hotel sector, is involved. Furthermore, the proposed DSM program of directly shedding the air-conditioning load of the hotel sector was found technically and economically feasible although customer related barriers may hamper implementation.","load shedding; wind energy; integration; small island developing states; Aruba; demand-side managemente","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","System Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Gibescu, M. (mentor)","2013","The increasing share of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in oday`s electricity mix has introduced new challenges for the geing European power networks. Optimal large scale deployment of wind and solar units around Europe necessitates the upgrade of the transmission system. Identifying transmission bottlenecks for fully accommodating high amounts of renewables comprises the objective of the so called Transmission Expansion Problem (TEP). However, in times of high RES in-feed and consequently high network congestion, minor RES curtailment could potentially be more economical than reinforcing another network branch. The related annualised investment costs of these transmission lines can be larger than the value of the respective RES energy integrated into the power system. Primary objective of this thesis is to perform certain sensitivity analyses in an attempt to optimise between renewable power curtailment and network reinforcement investment costs. A new heuristic approach that employs Optimal Power Flow (OPF) as its main tool, termed Least Upgrade Curtailment Sensitive Pseudo Optimisation (LUCSIPO) was developed for this purpose. The LUCSIPO approach, integrated with a statistical branch overload ranking, is a simple, straight-forward methodology that determines the least upgrades needed for obtaining a feasible solution. Its novel feature is the sensitivity on the curtailment limits applied. It is a key part that actually guides the algorithm towards a minimal cost solution, since it considers the trade-off between network upgrades and curtailment of RES power. In order to validate the LUCSIPO results, a modern Meta-Heuristic TEP approach that utilises the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) concept was also developed. This nature inspired algorithm, mimics the collective behaviour ants exhibit while searching for food. When an ant locates a food source, it travels back to its nest and emits a certain serum called Pheromone. Trailing this serum effectively guides the other ants towards the food source. The most visited paths will exhibit the highest pheromone concentration and thus will form the shortest (""optimum"") path to the nest. When applied to the TEP, a path corresponds to a set of upgraded network branches while the path length represents the total system costs. The IEEE-39 bus New England Test System has been employed as the testing platform for the two developed approaches. Sensitivity analysis results prove the existence of an economic optimum between grid upgrades and RES curtailment. They further highlight the importance of network upgrades and high non-synchronous penetration limits for secure and cost-efficient large scale RES integration. For the selected high installed wind capacity system, the sum of curtailment and investment costs is minimised and thus regarded as the \optimum"" in the at curtailment limit region between 30% and 60% of the installed wind capacity. The merit order effect, however, has a direct impact on the trade-off between RES curtailment and grid extension. The previously identified \optimum"" is shifted to a curtailment limit of about 70-80% (discarding c.a. 0.75% of the available wind energy) if the operational costs are also taken into account. The LUCSIPO`s approach efficiency in providing solutions that minimise the total costs involved, has been compared against the ACO algorithm. Results show that the LUCSIPO approach introduces major calculation time speed-ups while providing solutions very close to the ACO methodology. The final goal of this thesis was to create a continental Europe High Voltage network model for potentially applying the developed approaches. Employing similar modelling techniques and assumptions as in pan-European grid integration studies, led to the development of a consistent,spatial resolution flexible DC load flow modelling platform. It integrates publicly available consumption data with externally supplied RES time series and network information for effectively modelling the European HV network.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Power Systems -EWI","","SET","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A. (mentor); Aprile, W. (mentor)","2013","PLATFORM------- Interactive (technology-enhanced) spaces are becoming omnipresent in our modern world. Designers and companies alike are learning that technology can change people?s impression of a sample of physical space in such a way that yields profit and creates meaning. In the business of designing interactive spaces, there is a dependency on experts to design and help realize these installations. The reliance is due to the many specialized and multidisciplinary skills required to create these interactive exhibitions, including industrial design, electrical and mechanical engineering, programming, and architecture. Industry tackles this problem by creating companies with mixtures of skilled people. In academia, experts with years of experience are assigned to groups of students. This project aims to create a tool to lower this dependency on experts. The tool aims to do this by sharing and restructuring information about design, engineering, and technology to make the design of well thought out interactive spaces more accessible to beginners. The tool is intended to be used both commercially within companies and academically among students across various design backgrounds. It is a go-to tool catering to both practical and academic needs in the process of creating interactive spaces, helping to guide and inspire beginners at the design table while also acting as a great general creativity tool for experts. The target users of the tool include: students in interactive technologies design courses entry-level product designers and interaction designers, entry-level architects and interior designers, and expert-level project managers (and designers). The purpose of the tool is not to replace experts, but to lower beginner?s reliance on these experts by giving them the tools to make some educated decisions in the first few phases of conceptualizing an interactive space before involving experts in later phases. ------- DESIGN BRIEF------- The design goal of this thesis project is to create a tangible manifestation of a toolkit through a four (4) cycle iterative embodiment development process that empowers inexperienced designers with the knowledge to create concepts for meaningful and creative interactive spaces. For further information on how we define interactive spaces or distinguish experts from beginners in this study, refer the project's use of terminology. Tangibility and accessibility are a few of the major design requirements for this project (see project's design requirements). The design required physical elements that were easy and inexpensive to acquire for users and easy to populate with new information, so materials used for the design consisted of papers, woods, acrylics, and compressed fibers, mostly materials that would allow users immediate access to the toolkit through a printer and a laser cutter. ------- DESIGN RESULT------- The project concludes with the design of Cleo: The Hands-on Design Tool for Conceptualizing Interactive Spaces. Cleo divides the entire process of designing interactive spaces into three (3) stages: Context, Concept, and Refinement; and five (7) creativity categories: Actionable Moments, Sensables, Technology, Design of Spaces, Ideation Strategies, Interactive Cases, and Energizers. The tangible design consists of four (4) custom-designed wooden containers that rest on a storage dock with 180+ specially designed cards and an smaller inspiration dock that sits at designers’ desks. ------- EVALUATION SUMMARY------- Cleo was tested in a series of eight (8) use cases with students and designers in academia in both individual and collaborative contexts and reviewed by two well-known design firms in industry. Results demonstrated a high level of flexibility in how designers can interact with the tool, indicating that the tool is adaptable to various project and design situations and highly appropriate for facilitating creative sessions. The depth and specialization of the tool makes it especially suited to the design of interactive spaces. Participants in all studies indicated an overall increase in productivity and creativity. Cleo is designed to be used without facilitation by researchers of this project to facilitate structure, creativity, and organization throughout any design period. This was successfully supported by the results of all single-user test cases and one multi-user test case. The remainder of the multi-user test cases indicate that the proactivity and team management skills of a designers are directly correlated to how effectively Cleo can be used. The double-sided design of every card effectively accommodated both visual thinkings and information-driven thinkers. Despite ten (10) decks of card tools, all participants found amount of content to be manageable, inspiring, and not intimating. ------- FUTURE OF CLEO------- Cleo is a design tool that designers can learn in advance or learn to use as they go, meaning that the way designers use the tool the first time is likely to be different from subsequent times. We suggest conducting longitudinal studies with specialized design firms or users tests with repeat participants to observe these effects. Cleo has proven to be a successful design toolkit for the creating interactive spaces both by function, form, and interaction. However, there are a few issues with Cleo that need to be addressed in future developments prior to introducing the tool to the commercial market. The issues include (1) creating a digital platform for updating content, (2) building a credible reputation for Cleo by way of either more user tests, or partnering with notable names in design, and (3) developing a sustainable business and distribution model that ensures the continued success of the tool.","interactive spaces; interactive; interactive technology; thinking tool; card tool; design tool; tangible; hands-on; conceptualization; interaction design; iterative design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design Master","",""

(mentor)","2013","Johma is the largest and most known preparer of salads in the Netherlands. Johma strives to hold this position by delivering salads with the best quality over and over again, and by developing new salads. The focus of the company is therefore on the new product development and the production of the salads. The external logistics are outsourced to a company specialized in refrigerated food transportation. The internal logistics of ready products are automated for the bulk production lines. Besides fourteen bulk production lines, Johma possesses six nonbulk production lines. Salads from these nonbulk production lines are mostly buckets and portion packs for the professional market. Also a production line for pilot products is considered a nonbulk production line. The salads filled and packed on these lines are palletized manually at the end of the production line. Once the pallet is full, it is transported to a pallet track using a forklift. At the end of the pallet track, in the ready products storage, the products on the pallet are scanned and the pallet is labeled by hand. An employee uses a forklift to store the pallet in one of the upper locations in the storage. The floor positions are so-called pick positions. Pickers pick salads from these positions towards a client-dedicated pallet, according a pick order. Once the pick position is empty, the pallet stored in an upper location is retrieved and placed in the pick position. All above mentioned steps in the internal logistics involve labor. Because the internal logistics are not part of the core of the business and their costs should consequently be kept to a minimum, the feeling is automation could be beneficial. Johma mentions three reasons for automation. Firstly automation should lead to cost reduction; the savings on labor should exceed the investment costs. Secondly the production flexibility should go up; an automated system is always available within its capacity, opposed to employees. Finally automation should result in better quality of work, because the pickers do not have to walk anymore. This research answers the following research questions: ‘What are the alternatives to automate the internal logistics of the products of the nonbulk production lines at Johma? Does the best alternative have a positive net present value?’...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Four out of ten of these victims has fallen indoors, of which one out of eight was fallen in sanitary facilities. On a yearly basis 3.000 elderly were treated for a fall in the bathroom or shower. Direct medical costs of injury from a fall in the bathroom are counted to be 8.400 yearly. (Consument en veiligheid, 2010) Current bathroom aids, mainly designed to give elderly comfort and to prevent them from falling, often look outdated and therefore do not fit their bathroom. Besides, most elderly do not want to buy (bathroom) aids before they are injured because they do not want to admit to ageing. This problem has lead to the assignment of this project. Assignment The assignment is to develop a concept design of a product or product line, for elderly which provides them comfort when taking a shower, and prevents them from falling. The concept should be safe and ergonomic on one hand and attractive for the user group on the other hand. The product will have a focus on the Dutch market, besides is asked to study possibilities in Germany, the UK, USA, Scandinavia, and Japan. Method In the analysis is investigated what the requirements for this product should be from both a market and ergonomic perspective. Literature and desktop research were used to further define the target group and the possible market. Interviews with expert and several stakeholders, as well as a questionnaire among the target group gave guidance to the main objectives for a product design from different aspects. Vision in product design was executed simultaneously to help to form a vision for further product development. During synthesis ideas were generated, in which brainstorm sessions offered a wide spectrum of products. Several loops of diverging, clustering, comparing and converging have led to a product direction that fit the problem and the company. A second analysis phase guided requirements for this specific product direction. In which mainly the ergonomic guidelines for a safe grip were defined by several applied researches and a literature study. Within the product direction several concepts were generated, one of these concepts was chosen with help of the program of requirements and further materialized. During this stage simulations were performed to verify the reliability of the construction for different user scenarios. Final concept The final concept consist of an aluminium extruded profile. Of which the outside is based upon the ergonomic guidelines and the inside on functionality and installation. The rail allows the user the connect different products of the product series, to be further developed, Figure .. gives and impression. Next to the profile a construction element is designed that connects the profile with the wall of the bathroom. In the design easy installation, as well as aesthetics that fit the modern bathroom of the target group were taken into account.","fall prevention; elderly; bathroom","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-03-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Pel, A.J. (mentor); Taale, H. (mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Katwijk, R.T. (mentor)","2013","With the introduction of electronic toll collection the opportunity opened for new concepts in road pricing, such as high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes, express toll lanes, truck only lanes, cordon tolling, and mileage-based pricing. Whereas, the historical use of tolling has been to fund high-cost projects, it can now be used to manage congestion on a network with limited capacity. The HOT-lane concept consists of a dedicated lane, similar to the current rush-hour lanes, and it requires for single occupant vehicles (solo drivers) to pay a toll for access of use that varies based on demand, in order to be able to provide non-congested traffic conditions and reliable travel times. The consideration of implementation in the Netherlands of such a concept prompts the need for an efficient way to identify and assess the possibilities and the effects of such an implementation. Therefore the research aims at addressing all the aspects and considerations by developing quick and efficient methodology in order to identify and assess implementation possibilities in the Netherlands. Comprised of two major phases, the methodology includes all the necessary elements ranging from initial planning and the corresponding goals and objectives up to the implementation setup that provide insight on the interaction of design aspects and performance indicators. The first phase provides the steps for screening, ranking and selecting the suitable location and the corresponding conditions for the concept to be feasible. This is achieved with the used of criteria and specific indicators that ensure the fact that the chosen location enhances the potential of the concept. The second phase is more extensive as it includes all the possible design and operations options into the development of scenarios that are evaluated and adapted with the use of a modelling procedure that provides the necessary results. Besides the final evaluation, the modelling procedure provides guidance towards an optimal setup while highlighting the trade-offs between choices. The methodology is applied to specific cases in order to assess and clarify usability aspects that dictate its efficiency. Several locations are analyzed based on criteria such as congestion, reliability, demand and physical attributes and subsequently ranked with the use of determined weights. A specific location is then picked for the application of Phase 2. An adapted modelling framework is devised around a chosen existing traffic simulation model. The inclusion of several user groups is arranged (income classes) and the addition of a mode choice model for the carpooling is made. Another addition is the algorithm developed for the determination and iteration of toll values. For the inclusion of the previously mentioned aspects in the modelling procedure, several modifications had to be performed within the model. The methodology has proven to be comprehensive enough to cover most of the aspects related to the implementation and offer sufficient flexibility for adaptation according to specific purposes and needs. Further research and attention need to be considered with regards to the modelling framework. Due to the extensive behavioral aspects that can be included, adapting or even developing a traffic simulation model is a challenge. In terms of future consideration of the concept for the Netherlands, HOT-lanes should be put in relation or combination with existing dedicated managed lanes such as the rush-hour or truck only lanes.","HOT-lanes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Logistics & Infrastructure","",""

(mentor); Melles, M. (mentor)","2013","E-learning is a common used education method within different types of organization, as well in the medical sector. Both nurses and physicians are obligated, partly by law and partly by the medical institutions, to take examinations to maintain their accreditation confirming they are qualified and competent to use medical devices. The Competence Group, together with different medical centers, develops medical equipment e-learning to facilitate nurses and physicians with the knowledge and skills needed to pass these examinations. The e-learning modules are based on protocols and device manuals, resulting in a gap between the knowledge and skill acquired from the e-learning and daily practice. This gap causes a low level of motivation among medical employees to use the e-learning. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop a game-based generic addition for medical equipment e-learning, which increases the motivation of the end users, by decreasing the gap between daily practice and e-learning. In order to gain insights in the context of the assignment a literature research into e-learning, adult learning, game-based learning, motivation, and social interaction is performed. A product analysis of the medical equipment e-learning of The Competence Group and its main competitors resulted in an overview of the strong and weak characteristics of the e-learning, and different field researches were performed to sensitize with the target group. The results of these explorations were used to create a vision to support the design phase. The main aspects of this vision are: * The focus will be on social interaction between nurses. * The e-learning should stimulate a self-directed process and focus on life-centered and goal-oriented learning. * Game-elements contributing to competition, collaboration, exploration, or story telling should be used to increase the motivation for using e-learning. An interaction vision was created to describe the intended interaction the new generic addition should stimulate. The interaction vision is as follows: The generic addition to medical equipment e-learning should enable nurses to socially interact with each other during learning. The nurses should not only become engaged in their own learning process, but also in the learning process of other nurses. After a creative exploration two concept directions were created: ‘challenge a colleague’ and ‘share your personal experience’. Only ‘share your personal experience’ was chosen for further development, which resulted in two paper prototypes that were evaluated with seven nurses of the Maastricht University Medical Center. Based on this evaluation the final design ‘My experience’ was created. ‘My experience’ is a new e-learning module that focuses on sharing personal experiences from daily practice. The learner is asked to choose a medical device and share an experience about a situation that could have had serious consequences, but was somehow intervened by him and/or a colleague. The chosen device should play a role in the situation. Sharing the experience can be done using six multiple-choice questions and six open questions. During answering the questions a visualization of the given answers is shown. After sharing the personal experience the learner is provided with two experiences of colleagues about the same device. An overview of these experiences is given, and after reading them the learner has to indicate to which extent this situation is happened or could happen to him too. Up next, the learner can send an automated message to the writer to inform him about the fact his experience is read. All experiences shared will be stored in a database which could be used by the learners to search for specific experiences. The final design was evaluated with nurses using a digital prototype of ‘My experience’ to research the effect of the new module on the motivation and to test the final design on its usability. The fact that the module asks for personal experiences and provides the possibility to read experiences of others was appreciated and indicated as being instructive by the nurses. They were motivated and felt even obligated to share their experiences, but the module was also seen as extra work, since ‘My experience’ does not contain the theoretical information asked during the obligated examination for maintaining the accreditation. ‘My experience’ can be seen as a first step towards a new type of e-learning. The experiences shared during the coming year(s), could form the grid for the development of more practical and daily practice based e-learning in the future. Making this goal very clear to the nurses during the implantation of ‘My experience’ will contribute to their motivation for using the new module.","E-learning; Nurses; Sharing Experiences; Medical equipment; Game elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction with specialization Medisign","",""

Energy companies source the needed resources through organizational relationships. However, there is no garantueed success for entering into organizational relationships. It is therefore vital for strategic purposes to control and manage these relationships through appropriate organizational governance structures. Organizational governance structures are structures through which risks that accompany organizational relationships are managed and controlled. Appropriate organizational governance structures are designed along complex decision-making processes. This research focuses on the design of a framework for the support of decision-making processes concerning organizational governance structures. Based on theory, and knowldge gained during a case study analysis and a workshop a decision framework is designed. The decision framework consists of three layers: factors, risks, and organizational governance structures. Together with a risk matrix, the decision framework provides guidance by illustrating the aspects that need to be considered, the relations among these aspects, and the steps decision-makers should take in order to design appropriate organizational governance structures.","decision framework; organizational governance structure; risk; trust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-26","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Infrastructure","","Systems, Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

One of the solutions to this problem is to introduce service robots which can provide a day to day care, allowing elderly to live longer independently. However performing basic household tasks proposes many challenges as the robot will have to act in a dynamic environment and reuse its previous knowledge to adapt to novel situations. Therefore this thesis introduces a modular and reusable software architecture able to efficiently and robustly solve a variety of complex tasks in household environments. Most of such tasks require robust object manipulation independent of object properties, location and orientation or motion of the object. In order to solve this problem most of the state of the art methods require prior knowledge on object shape properties, optimal points to grasp it as well as the best grasping configurations. In this thesis a novel method is presented that allows manipulation of unknown objects for which no prior information on object properties or environment is necessary and all grasping knowledge is built online. This method consists of locating the object, tracking the object and finally grasping the object using a constant feedback loop from the object tracker. This method together with the software architecture have been implemented and tested on the robot Robby, equipped with a mobile base, a single DOF robot arm and an underactuated gripper. Through numerous tests performed in household environments benefits of using the proposed approach is shown.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","OZ Export is a Dutch flower exporter which buys flowers in The Netherlands, processes them and sells to wholesales across the world. Its turnover is over €150 million, making it one of the world’s largest flower exporters. The market is changing, customers order more often in smaller quantities and later in the day. Flowers must be cooled in the logistic chain from grower to customer to keep them fresh (Cool Chain). Customers put increasing demand on a good Cool Chain. In addition, the sales of OZ Export have increased with 30% between 2009 and 2011. These changes cause an increased capacity demand. OZ’s management has decided to expand the production hall OZ-1 (30.000m2) with a new hall OZ-2 (5.000m2). OZ Export would like to have a proposition for the process layout of OZ-2. Secondly they want an analysis of the AS-IS situation to be able to optimize it, regarding productivity, controllability and Cool Chain. The current processes of OZ Export were analyzed according to the Delft Systems Approach. From the analysis follow a number of issues. First, standards on the processes are incomplete with regards to effectiveness, efficiency and quality (including Cool Chain). Results are not accurately measureable. This causes the performance on these parameters to be based on subjective feeling. Measurements have shown that the true effectiveness is lower than what was expected. The productivity is being measured, but in a way that season and product influences disrupt the measurement. Second, the control of the product stream is ad hoc. OZ Export has a functional organization structure, but the necessary central production planning is missing. This makes intervening difficult, interventions are done too late, because only right before the deadline it becomes clear whether an order will be finished in time. The product flow shows the trademarks of a functional organizational structure; the organization is flexible, but after the products are processed, they are being pushed to the next process. This causes buffer to overflow and time wasted on searching for products. As a solution, the missing standards have been created for the effectiveness, efficiency and quality. To determine the result, a dashboard has been made that uses normative times, working hours, order data and finish times. The effectiveness is expressed as the percentage of orders finished on time. The efficiency is expressed as the normative hours against the real working hours. The results are now shown on signs at the departments in OZ Export, so that employees know them, and controlling on results becomes possible. For better control in the processes a product flow oriented organizational structure has been designed. By using a pull-based supply chain, the control becomes simpler, effectiveness and efficiency increase and the Cool Chain improves. From this complete design, a specific product line is lifted and placed onto OZ-2; the Chrysanthemum-Packaging flow. Moving this flow to OZ-2 creates a controllable production line in OZ-2. Of all possible options, this also leads to the biggest increase in available cold storage space, conveyor belt capacity, gate and dock facilities and floor surface for the processes that remain in OZ-1. As an experiment, this flow is placed in OZ-2 and the processes worked as a production line. Measurements show that the efficiency of the flow shows a small decrease, but the effectiveness and Cool Chain improved. This confirms the expectations based on calculations. OZ Export continues to work according to this production line organizational structure.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Hombergen, L.P.I.M. (mentor); Leijten, M. (mentor); Koops, L.S.W. (mentor)","2013","Parties working together on a project usually have different interests in executing that project, but they all aim at achieving project success. This project success has been widely discussed in literature since reaching it is the main goal of each party; but what project success actually is and how it can be determined differs per party. In project success a distinction is made between success criteria, the set of standards by which the measurement of success occurs, and success factors, those aspects that directly or indirectly influence project success. In this research success criteria are studied. Currently there is a lot of literature on project success and also on its criteria, but it only very limitedly relates to the public sector. Which is remarkable since researchers agree that project success is dependent on the perspective taken to look at it: an architect may have a different view on when a project is a success than a contractor. The proposition is that, due to the difference in nature of organization between public and private parties, each uses its own set of success criteria for the judgement of its project success. This research focuses on the public project manager: the operational manager of the public party who is commissioned within his own organisation to carry out the assignment; in this role he represents the ‘client’ to the contracting parties with which he has contact in executing the project. As mentioned project success perception depends on the perspective taken to judge it; and if there is indeed a different success perception for a public party than for a private party this discrepancy will become most clear at the operational level, where they work in close contact. This research aims at closing the now existing knowledge gap and identifying the success criteria relevant for the public project manager. By means of Q-methodology, a method used for studying subjectivity, the view on project success of 28 interviewed public project managers was assembled and analysed. The first step in using this method was to determine the Q-sample: the complete list of criteria relevant for the public project manager. To determine the public project manager’s view on success the 28 managers were asked to rank these criteria in relation to their importance in determining project success. This list of relevant criteria was formulated through studying literature and executing five test interviews; firstly 25 criteria were distinguished of which the representativeness for the public sector was checked. Eventually a number of criteria were combined, a number of criteria was left out due to lack of relevance for public project managers and a few other criteria were added, leading to a final list consisting of 19 criteria. In determining this Q-sample, two important conclusions were drawn. Firstly, since literature focuses mainly on the private sector, many criteria are too commercially oriented to reflect the public organisation’s nature; in these cases the public equivalent of the private sector criterion is determined. Secondly, a number of criteria presumed to be relevant for public sector success determination are not found in literature. These new criteria were added to the Q-sample and their relevance can be determined after the research has been conducted.","project success; success criteria; public success; public sector; public project manager; Q-methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tidball, B. (mentor)","2013","Running and operating an on-line social campaign in the context of authoritarian regimes is not a usual task to do. Besides motivation and courage, it requires creativity and flexibility. I have tried to explore all possible aspects of such context (from sociology and marketing to political science and design) and implement those findings into the real experience of an on-line social campaign in a design-driven process. The project has been started with a focus on the subject of sustainability of social campaigns on social networks, specifically in the context of authoritarian governments. I have tried to shed light on this brand new subject by discovering different aspects of it. To begin with I have started a theoretical explorative research on the subject in order to gain sufficient insight and design a framework. Sociologists believe that one of the preliminary conditions of social changes is increasing the production of Social Capital. This concept helped me to focus on two main aspects of social activities: Internal dynamics (bonding) and external dynamics (bridging). These are the basics for establishing social campaign. I have also looked into the field of Marketing and Social Marketing in order to understand the principals of classical social campaigns that are more or less the same principals in the brand new world of Web 2.0. Although these principals are universal but it is not that easy to implement them in the context of authoritarian regimes. Nonetheless in those regions there are other social activities that are practicing by millions in their ordinary daily life that create major social changes. Asef Bayat describes them as Non-Movements. So because of its social and contextual relevance, I have borrowed this concept as the theoretical spinal column of my framework. By combining principals of Non-Movement with social marketing strategies, I have generated a new framework (Non-Campaign) for establishing on-line social campaigns in that specific context. To test this framework in real field of experiment I have used Participatory Action Research (PAR) method in order to be engaged in different phases of its operation. The contents of such a campaign should be communicative with a large audience and to do so it needs to become viral; thus choosing the right medium is very important in communication. So I have defined three iterations to test three popular mediums (text, image, video) and find the most viral one. In the end based on the findings about internal and external aspects of an on-line social Non-Campaign, I will suggest a toolkit for social activists so they can establish their own on-line campaign in social networks.","Social Network; Online Campaign; Social Campaign; Civic Engagement; Participatory Action Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-03-22","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Communication and Conceptualisation","","Design for Intraction","",""

(mentor)","2013","As land resources decrease, commodity prices increase and technology evolves, deep sea mining is becoming a viable and sustainable alternative to meet the increasing demand for minerals. Successful deep sea mining operations are built on a sound identification of the resource, proper selection of equipment, a thoughtful production plan and good project management. These four key activities can be further optimized by analyzing how the spatial variability and uncertainty of the ore body properties impact the final mining operation. To address this problem, IHC Merwede and TUDelft are in the process of developing a risk quantification framework, which makes use of state of the art geostatistical simulation methods and transfer functions to quantify geological uncertainty and translate it into decision or project risk. The contribution of this master thesis is twofold. First, it offers a new methodological procedure to simulate realizations of the spatial deposit v ariability, in order to characterize risk and uncertainty. The Local Average Subdivision method (LAS) is introduced into mining geostatistics and new extensions are presented to (a) simulate under a nested spherical structure, (b) deal with not normally distributed data, and (c) incorporate point measurements of geotechnical and ore grade properties. Due to its computational efficiency, the presented method is suitable for simulating largely extended sea floor deposits on a scale of the Smallest Mineable Unit (SMU). Secondly, the research illustrates, through several example case studies, the significant benefits of a risk based approach. The geological uncertainty is propagated through the entire mining operation, and as such translated into financial or operational performance indicators. In particular, the focus is on assessing financial project risk and on the design optimization of the deep sea extraction equipment by analyzing cutting forces, specific energies and power requirements.","deep sea mining; geostatistical simulation; local average subdivision; risk based decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-23","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource engineering","",""

A Q-methodology based study was performed to reveal the subjective perceptions of the project managers on the relative influence of various contract aspects and of other influencing factors of owner-contractor relationships. The influence of contract types on the relationships for project-specific situations was investigated by a project evaluation study. In this study, the relationship quality of four different projects was evaluated, using a relationship maturity assessment matrix. The research results show that contract type is not the tool to influence relationship effectiveness. The only contract aspects, which are identified as instrumental to improve the relationship, are contact aspects related to project structure specifying roles and responsibilities, and contract aspects about targeted criteria for performance.","contract types; alliance contract; team effectiveness; owner-contractor relationship; project management; project performance; project evaluation; maturity model; relationship effectiveness; relationship maturity assessment matrix; Q-methodology; Q-sort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-22","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

Through review of existing literature and case studies on civil construction projects, a list of factors affecting the successful implementation of SE has been formulated and their relative effect on the implementation rate of SE is determined. In this article six key problem areas are identified, which negatively influence the implementation rate of SE. We propose that contractors adopt a single, independent organizational entity in their organization for process and SE management, who implicitly implement SE within the standard working procedures. Towards the client, these procedures depend on the level of SE-maturity of the client. This approach helps contractors to manage the identified problem areas, thereby improving the implementation rate of SE in their organizations.","Systems Engineering; Implementation; Success Factors; Civil Construction Industry; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lenseigne, B. (mentor)","2013","Paintings are versatile near-planar objects with material characteristics that vary widely. The fact that paint has a material presence is often overlooked, mostly because of the fact that we encounter many of these artworks through two dimensional reproductions. The capture of paintings in the third dimension is not only interesting for study, restoration and conservation, but it also facilitates making three dimensional reproductions through novel 3-D printing methods. These varying material characteristics of paintings are first investigated, after which an overview is given of the feasible imaging methods that can capture a painting’s color and topography. Because no imaging method is ideally suited for this task, a hybrid solution between fringe projection and stereo imaging is proposed involving two cameras and a projector. Fringe projection is aided by sparse stereo matching to serve as an image encoder. These encoded images processed by the stereo cameras then help solve the correspondence problem in stereo matching, leading to a dense and accurate topographical map, while simultaneously capturing its color. Through high-end cameras, special lenses and filters we capture a surface area of 170 cm2 with an in-plane effective resolution of 50 ?m and a depth precision of 9.2 ?m. Semi-automated positioning of the system and data stitching consequently allows for the capture of surfaces up to 1m2. The reproductive properties are conform the digitization guidelines for cultural heritage. The preliminary results of the capture of a painting by Rembrandt reveal that this system is indeed ideally suited as a topographic imaging device for the near-surface of paintings. This data can be used for making a lifelike reproduction in full dimension and full color.","painting; 3-d; topography; scanner; ringe projection; stereo vision; hybrid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Moes, C.C.M. (mentor)","2013","In 2010 research institute TNO teamed up with office furniture manufacturer Markant Nederland B.V. and design agency Vormdrift, to address the rising problem of a passive lifestyle in the context of the office. Through the development of a work-workout product. The collaboration resulted in the workstation unit Oxidesk, at which a modest workout can be executed simultaneously during deskwork. Next to the need of a single workstation unit, Markant and TNO have shown that a need exist for an integrated set of workout units to be used in the meeting circumstances. This graduation report describes the design of the meeting-workout furniture. A furniture designed for the creativity centred work environments, which enables office workers to have a modest workout during a meeting. The final design of the meeting-workout furniture, is based on a four stage design process (analysis, ideation, embodiment and evaluation). Through initial research, the context of the problem has been explored. The research has shown, that in 2012, in the Netherlands 5.7 million people had a job during which the majority of the time they were in a seated position. Several studies classify office work as sedentary. A state of minimum movement by a person, which results in several increases of health risks. Secondary studies have indicated that the risks of sedentarism are equal to those of ill-movement (no workout at all). Thus office work, in its current conditions enhances the health risk of office workers. Although sedenterism can simply be broken by simple actions (e.g: reducing sitting, stretching, talking a walk, etc), it will require change in behaviour by office workers. For a more thorough tackle of the problem, several studies have been held on the combination of work with a workout. These studies, (including a study held by TNO) have indicated that it is possible to combine work with a workout. Next to the decrease of the health risks, working-out has a positive influence on the mental cognition. Office work is not only consisted of deskwork, but a significant time (30% for the majority of office workers and 70% for managers) is spend in meetings. Meeting time, is increasing with the developments of the creativity centred work environment philosophy. However, in general the majority of participants of meetings (44% of all Dutch, 75% of governmental officials and 67% of managers) feel that most meetings take too long. Thus a combined need exists for a meeting facility which is designed for the creativity centred work environment, enhances meeting efficiency and enables office workers to reduce sedentarism. Through the process of ideation and conceptualization, the final design of the meeting-workout furniture has been developed. The final design entails an integrated, but modular meeting-workout hub. In the hub, participants can discuss and have a modest “cycling” workout in a semi-closed environment within the open office environment. Depending on the hub configuration, 3, 4 or 6 meeting seats are available. The incorporation of a multimedia screen is optional. The basic configuration (4 seats, 4 wall panels) has a suggested sales price of 20.163,-. The meeting-workout hub enables office workers, to have a meeting, in a seated position, at a table. The workout, as it is executed by the legs, does not influence the meeting process. This has been validated by a user study executed with a functional model of the final design. The user study showed, that participants are able in combining a workout during a meeting. The user study has also indicated points of improvement on the design.

(mentor)","2013","Self-reconfigurable modular robots are mechatronic devices that have the capability to modify their own shape. They have a promising potential as a result of being able to solve a wider range of problems. However, programming self-reconfigurable robots is in general a difficult task. General-purpose languages like ANSI-C or Java provide only general abstractions that do not facilitate tackling difficult issues such as distribution, unreliable hardware, and dynamically evolving communication topology. We believe that a domain-specific language is needed to be able to program robot behavior on a higher, more productive level. Existing DSLs and control approaches have been developed in the past, but were designed to solve problems specific to certain scenarios. In this work, a domain analysis is used to identify and define concepts in existing approaches. Based on this, a prototype for a new DSL is implemented in the language-workbench Spoofax. The prototype is called MetaForma and comprises a compiler with Eclipse IDE support and a static runtime-system. The runtime system acts as an abstraction on top of the ATRON robot and the USSR robot simulator. The USSR simulator is used to conduct experiments on generated Java code that simulates the behavior of the ATRON robot and justifies claims for robustness. The contribution of MetaForma is twofold. First, it supports shape-transformations and locomotion of small ATRON ensembles. Second, it supports locomotion methods for large-scale ATRON ensembles, that were published in earlier work but not implemented in a language before. Although not all solutions are yet implemented in the MetaForma runtime-system, and it currently only runs in simulation, we believe that MetaForma is a powerful DSL solution for the ATRON robot.","self-rconfigurable robot; ATRON; DSL; global to local; Spoofax; code generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P.J.M. (mentor); Wasserman, N. (mentor)","2013","This thesis research for the Master of Science programme Geographical Information Management and Applications looks at the possibilities of completing the asset information life cycle at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Therefor an analysis was made of the current situation, after a literature research was conducted towards the subjects of data exchange and Building Information Modelling (BIM). The insights in data exchange principles are needed to understand the potential problems in completing the asset information life cycle. At the moment as-built information is delivered to SGIS, but not re-used in new projects. The most important problems are caused by systems that are not able to communicate with each other and data structures that are different by nature because of its native software. BIM is a topic that currently gets much attention in the world of design and construction. From their perspective BIM deals with another way of executing design and construction, where collaboration and integration are the key words. In practice BIM has a broader scope and can be defined as, being a process in which relevant actors collaborate on creating, analysing and managing multiple dimension data within a dynamic model representing one or more assets throughout its/their life cycle. For this thesis research the new data model for asset information at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Schiphol GIS or SGIS, was analysed. SGIS replaces four other systems that contained all asset information at Schiphol, but that also contained double and inconsistent information. With SGIS these problems must belong to the past. The data model mostly contains 2D or 2½D data of all assets, including the most relevant information on the asset. SGIS also communicates, or will do so within two years, with three other systems that as a complex are the back bone of the asset management process at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. There are currently two problems with completing the asset information life cycle. The first problem is getting the information from the 3D model to SGIS. To solve this problem a workflow is suggested. This workflow includes an export to the open standard IFC from the original 3D AEC modelling software. A small addition to SGIS has to be made therefor, to be able to support the 3D geometries that are coming from that software. The second problem is to get the information back from the operations and maintenance phase to a new design phase. Currently the most optimal solution seems to re-use the received IFC file and to add a DWG containing the changed geometries. Thereby it needs to be mentioned that the multi-patch objects from SGIS will be exploded to individual faces. The preferred solution would have been to work from one central (spatial) database, but that is technically not possible yet. The problems are caused by the fact that AEC (3D modelling) software and GIS do not share a common geometric data model. Additionally it needs to be researched what the actual information demand is for the design phase. In the current situation information gets lost after the exchange from construction to operations and maintenance, because the information need in those phases is less detailed. With the suggested solutions and changes/additions to SGIS it is possible to complete the asset information life cycle for Schiphol and the relevant stakeholders and main-contractors. An inventory of the necessary resources to plan these changes still needs to be made.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","We study the application of stochastic scheduling methods for dealing with the negative impact of uncertainty on the timely delivery of NedTrain maintenance projects. A stochastic scheduling problem includes a quantification of uncertainty by representing the duration of a maintenance activity with a probability distribution. The solution is no longer a schedule but a scheduling policy: a dynamic process for determining when to execute activities on-the-fly. Our objective is to find a policy that minimizes stochastic tardiness by expectation and also by variance, to minimize risk. We concentrate on the class of Early-Start (ES) policies. An ES policy is a PERT network representation of the projects in which the width of the partial order defined by the precedence edges is restricted such that resource requirement will not exceed resource availability. ES policies enable the use of standard PERT management practices (developed for handling uncertainty in projects with unlimited resources) to projects with limited resources (e.g., NedTrain projects). Simulation is considered as the only practical means to evaluate the objective function in stochastic scheduling. This approach is computationally expensive, especially for large (e.g., NedTrain-specific) instances with activity durations that exhibit high variability. We observe that circuit timing graphs in modern VLSI design use a PERT network-like representational mechanism. Statistical Static Timing Analysis (SSTA) is a new research area with a wealth of methods for solving the PERT problem on massive networks, offering high accuracy at low computational cost. We propose the use of SSTA techniques, treating a given ES policy as a circuit timing graph. This enables us to evaluate the objective function and more importantly to implement informed heuristics with efficiency. As a proof-of-concept we studied the use of Linear-Gaussian SSTA, applicable when activity durations exhibit Gaussian variability and may have linear interdependencies. Our other contribution is to propose efficient enumeration schemes for ES policies, overcoming the infeasibility of the existing scheme on problems of practical size. Experiments suggest that the proposed enumeration schemes in combination with SSTA establish a frame work for the design of competitive heuristic solvers, suitable for large-scale problem instances with high durational variability.","stochastic scheduling; project scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Science MSc","",""

(mentor); Santema, S.C. (mentor)","2013","Introduction Most people prefer waiting at big railway stations above waiting at SRS's. While SRS's are the engine’s which feed passengers to the big railway stations, limited attention has been given to this important group of stations. Since a couple of years the focus points of the NS includes the improvement of SRS's, it is of importance to research where the potential improvements of these SRS's are lying. To contribute to this development this graduation project will explore the opportunities to increase passengers' travel experience on SRS’s and make these stations pleasant and useful places to stay. The input for the actual concept development consists of literature and passenger research in which the context and the passengers of SRS's are researched. These results are translated into potential concepts, followed by the development of the final concept. The evaluation, conclusions and recommendations will reflect on the whole process. Analysis NS Stations is operator of 380 railway stations and aims to bring these stations alive by offering services and facilities to their customers and thereby create a convenient DTD travel experience. Project developer of NS Stations, NS Retail Company, exploits several retail formulas on these stations. The Retail Company has always been focused on the big stations and their passengers, while SRS’s are the ‘life line’ of the big stations. SRS's need a different approach than big stations, especially in terms of target group. Because of the low number of passengers on SRS’s the target group for any commercial facilities at the station must be enlarged. The most obvious audience to involve can be found in the direct neighbourhood of the station and are the residents of the city. To get a better understanding of the characteristics of SRS's an analysis about these stations was done. From this analysis it is concluded that every SRS is unique in its own way. Even if two stations have several comparable characteristics, a different type of passenger will have a significant influence on the success of the same retail format. Besides the fact that all stations differ from each other it can be concluded that SRS’s: Are located on a central place in the city/village Are typical commuter stations Transports mostly ‘must’ passengers and, Are often unsafe and not clean To give a certain feasibility to this project it is decided to choose one station as case study for further concept development; the station of Nijkerk. The literature study explores the theory of Customer Experience Management (CEM) and challenges in (travel) retail. Effective CEM seems to start with a good understanding of the customer journey and exists of expectations of the service and customers’ judgment when the service or experience is consumed. For an effective approach of managing this customer experience, an unambiguous approach within all departments of a company should be applied. Service performance of NS should at least meet customers’ expectations in order to achieve satisfaction. For increasing this satisfaction, NS should use a more effective approach by deconstructing the journey into experiences. Every part of the DTD journey contributes to the overall customer experience in which the transfer time has a lot of influence because of its low experience value. Travel retail is characterized by speed, convenience and reliability and will win the confidence of the time-pressed consumer. Clear and reliable information will decrease stress among passengers and increases their purchase intention. Consumers expect freedom, service and access at every moment of the day; the most recognizable characteristics of Multi-channel retail. After the literature study, the station, passengers and surroundings of Nijkerk are researched. The location of the stations seemed to be very suitable for a better integration with the city center and his residents. The station building is used highly inefficient and people do not value their time spend on the station. In other words, the great possibilities the station offers are not being used optimally. After this a stakeholder analysis is done which has identified the key parties involved in this project and suggests that better cooperation of, amongst others, NS and municipality will contribute to a more successful concept development. Passenger Research A qualitative passenger research is done to gain passenger insights concerning the passengers' perception of a SRS, its train journey and their travel experience. This research has been conducted by means of context mapping, including a group session and observations. The group session was held with five frequent travellers of Nijkerk and observations were held at the same station. From the results of the passenger research two personas are created and used to reveal opportunity points in the passenger journey. The Young Always Connected Consumer is chosen to focus on in further development steps. He/she is characterized by its independency, relaxed behaviour and quick adaption to new technologies. All the insights gathered from the passenger research and the research concerning Nijkerk have revealed three main areas of opportunity: (1) Unpleasant stay on the station, lowering the travel experience (2) Highly inefficient use of the station building (3) The location of the station close to the city centre To help translating all the insights and focus areas into a successful concept a design vision is created: The young always connected traveller on SRS's expects services that makes the DTD journey a fluent activity, a seamless travel experience in which the time at the station is perceived as pleasant and effective time. Low effort and no obstruction during the train trip. The travel experience should lower the stress factor, create convenience and change the perception of a train trip from a common ‘must do’ activity, into a memorable train trip. A SRS brings passengers and residents together and contributes to a memorable station experience. This design vision and opportunity points are the input for the idea generation which starts with a brainstorm session. Ideation & Conceptualization The ideation was started with a brainstorm session, based on the three focus points described above. This brainstorm resulted in 62 ideas which are clustered and transformed into idea cards and used in the idea judgement session with NS colleagues. This session has examined the feasibility of the ideas and the extent to which it would increase passengers' experience. This session resulted into three potential concept directions of which one is chosen as leading concept element: a take away service. The concept is optimized with two other elements, a waiting facility and a café-restaurant. These elements together form an optimal concept fitting the characteristics of the station (environment) and the potential of the station of Nijkerk. To prevent the concept from separate elements and make it attractive for a broad target group, the concept resulted in a cooperation with HEMA. The choice for this retailer is based on the power of the brand, their attractive pricing and assortment and their recent developments regarding presence in small neighbourhood stores. The combination of HEMA and the three elements resulted in: HEMA Take Away, HEMA Wait & Inspire and HEMA Lunch & Dining. The concept attracts, passengers residents and employees of neighbouring businesses. The concepts increases the DTD travel experience by adding liveliness and comfort to the station. HEMA Take Away The Take Away is the starting point of the concept and meets the needs of an easy and efficient DTD journey. Besides the service offer to the passengers, it is also attractive for non-travelling residents of Nijkerk. For a more efficient service, the Take Away is supported by an online application, which allows customers of the Take Away to order their meal at home or in the train. This allows passengers to pick up their meal immediately after arrival at the station. Customers can pay online or with cash at the desk, but also by using their OV card. HEMA Wait & Inspire The HEMA Wait & Inspire offers passengers comfort but also ways to kill time at the station. Waiting passengers can browse through recipes on the wall, be inspired by the latest products and sales offers and buy several basic or forgotten products from the dispenser. The dispenser sells products such as bicycle lights, umbrellas, gloves or t-shirts. The room has an open design to make it more approachable and in order to create a view on the platform. To fully inform passengers about departing trains, the waiting room is also equipped with time schedule information. HEMA Lunch & Dining Even as the Take Away, the Lunch & Dining offers everyday food and should carry the brand image of HEMA stores: For everybody & quality for good price. Simple lunches and dinners can be consumed at an affordable price. During lunchtime, passengers and resident can come for a lunch, but it also focusses on employees of neighbouring businesses. After the concept development, a cost estimation is made to assess the feasibility of the concept. Results show that, despite the high investment and long pay-back period, the concept in this state is making profit. Because profits are not very high, several suggestions are given for adjusting the concept in order to increase profit, for instance, more effective use of space and opening hours. Evaluation The final concept is evaluated based on the established requirements and wishes. This evaluation resulted in 32/37 achieved requirements. From this it may be concluded that the concept improves the travel experience of the young & always connected commuter and helps building a more functional station environment. Based on the executed research, concept development and evaluation, several recommendations are given, on concept level but also on project level of NS. It is recommended to focus more on surroundings of SRS’s to assess the potential of the city or village, involve other parties in the concept such as municipalities, and get a better understanding of their customers on SRS’s. Several other recommendations, limitations and my own experiences will end this graduation assignment.","railway stations; retail; customer experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-03-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Different evaluation techniques can be used in order to assess the quality of a multi-label classification task. The most commonly used performance measures in classification are the classic information retrieval notions of precision and recall. These measures assume independence between the target labels meaning that the assignment of a label to an item can either be evaluated as correct or incorrect and not somewhere in between. The drawback of these binary evaluation measures is that they do not take into account the difference in semantics between the concepts depicted by the labels. For example, an item classified as plant instead of flower would be considered as wrong although the concepts are semantically related and a flower is a specialisation of a plant. A way of improving the evaluation of a classification would be to also consider the degree of semantic relatedness between concepts. The work in this thesis focuses on improving the evaluation of a real-world multi-label classification task by using the notion of semantic relatedness. The labels of this classification task represent concepts originating from a hierarchically structured thesaurus. Intuitively, the concepts that are close to each other in the graph are more related than the ones that are more distant from each other. Several techniques that measure semantic relatedness based on this principle have been proposed in scientific literature. This work investigates the performance of such techniques in the evaluation of multi-label classifications by assessing them against human judgements of relatedness. It is shown that an evaluation incorporating semantic relatedness is likely to be more accurate than the traditional binary evaluations. The knowledge on classifier assessment acquired in this study is applied in practice in the form of an evaluation framework comprising several techniques for measuring and analysing the performance of classifiers.","classifier evaluation; semantic relatedness; multi-label classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information Systems","","Computer Science, Software Technolgy","",""

(mentor)","2013","Health Information Exchange (HIE) is a term used to describe the sharing of health information electronically among two or more entities. These entities are mostly organizations, which provide health services to their clients (the patients) and also enable the sharing of electronic health information. The exchange of medical data takes place primarily between different medical departments within the same health organization. This happens most of the time through an Electronic Health Records (EHR) system within the organization, but also across the organizational borders on the regional level (through Regional Health Information Systems, RHIS) or across the country (National EHR). The previous efforts of the national EHR system in the Netherlands (L-EPD) had a top-down approach, based on the national architecture (i.e. AORTA). The top-down implementation of the national EHR in the Netherlands, as evidenced by the opinion of a number of Dutch experts in the field, has caused several resistance among GPs, medical specialists, patients and several other interest groups. The upcoming stakeholder analysis also reveals severe problems in this regard. Requirements analysis in a bottom-up fashion can be a practical remedy to this problem. Following this perspective, the present research tries to specify some of the viewpoints of the most important stakeholders, including the users of RHIS. It describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the regional health information exchange in the Netherlands. These requirements are based on two different questionnaires, which were designed and further conducted by the author among the primary users (i.e. medical staff) and secondary users (i.e. patients) in 2012. In addition, the interviews with several RHIS experts (representatives of almost 50% of all Dutch hospitals) and an extensive document analysis of an EHR vendor of hospital information systems revealed several constraints and complementary requirements. The primary contribution of this research is the identification and thorough analysis of the most important stakeholders, involved in the field of health information systems, their viewpoints and the existing problems with RHIS. Furthermore, it is one of first attempts to translate these findings into important usecases, real-case scenarios and a set of business goals, areas of concern and requirements. The outcomes of the research indicate that future works in this field should focus on a bottom-up approach towards gathering more specific informatio and adapting the general requirements found in this research to particular cases and contexts of use.","EHR; EPD; L-EPD; Regional Health Information Exchange; requirements; guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science (Information Architecture)","","IA / Web Information Systems","",""

It consists of evaluating those physical properties by substituting the reacting CO2 with an inert gas of a similar structure, N2O. The diffusion of CO2 in amine solvents is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Unlike experiments, MD simulation allows a direct measurement of the CO2 diffusivity. In MD simulations, the reaction between CO2 and the amine can be switched off. The Fick diffusion coeffcients are derived from the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities and the thermodynamic factors. Different amine solvents like monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, methyl-diethanolamine and ethylamine are investigated.

(mentor)","2013","One of the main challenges in Multi-disciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) is the interoperability of heterogeneous simulation tools. Some researches have reported that, due to these interoperability issues, only around 20% of the product development time is spent on analyses and creative design tasks. Clearly, there is a lot to gain, when it comes to improving this figure. Key to the success of MDO is Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) and Simulation Workflow Management (SWFM) technologies. However, developing KBE and SWFM applications requires a substantial amount of programming knowledge and expertise. Due to these constraints, the technologies are less accessible to non-programmers. Additionally, there is an increased risk that applications may become black boxes when it is not clear what knowledge went into the application. This complicates sharing and reusing knowledge in future projects. Therefore, a methodology is needed to avoid these complications. MOKA, the most well-known methodology for developing KBE applications, focuses on the KBE side rather than SWFM side of design systems. Therefore, a new methodology is developed that covers SWFM. Meanwhile, the aim is to reduce the amount of required expertise for modelling simulation workflows. The methodology presents new step-by-step instructions to guide engineers in the modelling process. Furthermore, the methodology introduces new forms, the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), and an N2 notation to capture and structure process knowledge. This knowledge is then formalised (i.e. translated to a format which is closer to computer language) before the workflow is automatically generated in Optimus, a SWFM system for building executable workflows. For this purpose, a new integration framework has been developed, based on the Integrated Design and Engineering Architecture (IDEA), which evolved from the Design and Engineering Engine (DEE). The new framework couples a Knowledge Base (KB), product (KBE) and process (SWFM) tools. Reducing the required expertise is achieved by introducing High-Level Activities (HLA). Capturing lower-level knowledge in these HLAs allows for inexperienced engineers to model workflows at a higher abstraction level. Meanwhile, a new parametric high-level workflow has been designed, that enables engineers to optimise KBE product models without actually modelling a workflow. Both the HLAs and the parametric workflow are used in several use cases involving a packaging design optimisation and an MDO workflow for thermoplastic injection moulding. In the end, this work has delivered tools, methods, and a framework that increases transparency of SWFM applications, saves development time, and reduces required expertise to model simulation workflows.","Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE); Simulation Workflow Management (SWFM); automation; knowledge engineering; methodology; MOKA; Multi-disciplinary Design Optimization (MDO); engineering design framework; automatic workflow generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Delgado Lopez, G.A. (mentor)","2013","In this research we investigate a class of systems which can only be controlled by dissipating energy. As an example, we investigate the control of a robotic manipulator without motors, but merely dissipative elements such as brakes and dampers. The energy source of the manipulator is the potential (gravitational) energy of the package which it is handling. This package is supplied to the manipulator at position higher than where it needs to be placed. After dropping the package, the manipulator moves back towards the starting position by using stored energy, for example using springs. The dissipative elements constrain the possible control signal to dissipating energy. We call this robot the passively controlled manipulator. The challenge is that classical feedback solutions cannot be used to control this class of passive systems. Standard methods rely on the possibility to inject and extract energy into the system using motors, but the passively controlled manipulator has merely dissipative elements. Optimization methods could be used, but these have the downside of being computationally expensive. In this thesis we analyse this challenge and present a novel control methodology. The developed solution tries to follow a trajectory along which no control is needed in order to reach a target position. If the end effector does not start on this trajectory, it is controlled towards it using a passified velocity field tracking controller. The developed controller has been successfully implemented on both a simulation and a physical setup, and is capable of controlling the passively controlled manipulator towards multiple target positions. The controller has been compared to a second controller, which is the passified standard impedance controller. It outperforms the passified standard impedance controller on the ability to realize a desired workspace velocity.","passivity; manipulator control; natural dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Case Study for the Western Scheldt","De Boom, L.","Vrijling, J.K. (mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Spaargaren, G.R. (mentor)","2013","Flood protection of the land around an estuary has been important for the Netherlands since the floodings of 1953. There are several types of possible solutions. For example; levee heightening, construction of a dam or a storm surge barrier. All these solutions have certain disadvantages, like costs or environmental impact. Another option is a reduction barrier. This was one of the options for the Eastern Scheldt barrier, but at that time a storm surge barrier turned out to be better. A reduction barrier can provide safety by introducing additional resistance in the estuary. This can reduce the amplitude of the tide in the estuary. The reduction barrier itself can be described as a dam with some openings in it. Water can still flow in and out of the estuary which is important for both the environment and shipping traffic. The design water level consists of a combination of regular tide and a storm surge. The tidal wave has a smaller timescale than a storm surge wave. This makes the tidal wave much easier to reduce than the storm surge wave, since slow motions are more difficult to dampen. The reduction barrier is more effective on reducing the tidal wave in estuaries where this wave is amplified due to the shape of the estuary. The tidal wave reduction means that the reduction of the water level maximum is limited, since the storm surge wave is not reduced. The analysis revealed that the Western Scheldt is a suitable location for a reduction barrier. The Western Scheldt requires a relatively small reduction in water level maximum, due to the relatively high quality of the levees. Belgium requires a reduction of the water level maximum of 0.5 metre in the current situation near Antwerp. The reduction barrier can be adapted for up to 1 metre sea level rise by installing moveable gates. The shipping traffic through the barrier is an important aspect for the feasibility of the barrier, since there are four ports located along the Western Scheldt. The barrier is located just east of the line Vlissingen - Breskens. The reduction barrier has two shipping channels. The main shipping channel is located near Vlissingen and the secondary shipping channel is located near Breskens. Vessels are able to pass through the barrier during normal conditions. It is assumed that the environment is not harmed since 80% of the original tidal prism can be maintained. The barrier is mainly composed of concrete caissons and rubble mound. The construction costs of the reduction barrier are an estimated 4 billion euros, this is comparable with the costs of the Eastern Scheldt barrier and also comparable with the costs of levee heightening. A reduction barrier in the Western Scheldt is technically feasible. For further research is recommended to make models of the water motion and sediment transport in 3-D. Fast and real-time shipping simulations can be used to optimize the shipping openings.","flood protection; barrier; shipping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The efficient nearest neighbor algorithms we compare are Locality Sensitive Hashing and Vantage Point trees. The two options are compared to several baseline systems in the general video retrieval framework. We used three sets of features to test the system: SURF features, color histograms and topics. The topics where extracted using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. We show that fusing the individual feature sets with a learned metric improves the performance upon the best individual feature set.

(mentor)","2013","This paper is the result of my graduation project for studio Maaike Roozenburg: ‘Design of an experience with responsive 3D audio augmented to replicas of seven porcelain cups and saucers.’ Museums offer a treasure chest of objects, stories, pictures and knowledge about our past and present. The rapid pace in which technology is changing allows the physical and the digital to blend together in new and innovative ways. The project started out with the research question: ‘How can smart replicas be used to reunite people with historical artefacten.’ ‘Smart replica’ is a new term and is used to identify copies of historical artefacts that were made using 3D scanning- and printing techniques to allow audiences to engage with them. The ‘smart’ refers to the property that the replicas are enriched with additional information by augmented reality. This project starts with analysing museums, exhibitions and historical artefacts. The main conclusion is that the encounter between an object and a layman visitor is hampered by old-fashioned notion of an exhibit. You can look at the artworks, but are not allowed to interact with the pieces. In the context of recreational activities a perception exists that an active engagement would lead to solely entertaining experiences. However, an active encounter can create a situation in which the visitor is stimulated to learn as well. With this the design challenge is set out: “Design an experience in which laymen are enriched by an active encounter with the historical artefacten.” The project started with two given means; replicas and augmented reality. Without knowing the relevance and meaning of these solutions, they have no functionality. Therefore the concept creation starts with finding the relevance and meaning of these means for the final design. Subsequently, the design challenge is translated into a vision in which the encounter between object and visitor should feel like a conversation between two people. The interaction qualities: understanding, satisfying, intriguing and integrity are set as requirements to elicit this vision. From these interaction qualities an experience was developed. The key feature is the response of augmented audio to the position of the visitor and the action of picking up an object. The design itself was tested and found valuable on multiple aspects; the addition of an ambient soundscape contributes the intriguing quality of the concept, the responsiveness of the audio contributes to the understanding quality and both the selected information and the ambient sound contribute to the satisfying quality. A final validation with Boijmans concluded that restrictions in the walkthrough of the experiences should be limited to answer better to the integrity quality of the Boijmans museum. This led to the final concept: An exhibition, in which the visitor downloads an app, places a headset on his/her head and walks by the different displays. This route is premeditated by the means of an obvious path, however, not forced upon the visitor by sound. While they walk by a display they are pulled in by ambient soundscapes triggering their thoughts and are presented with audio that tells the story of the cup and saucer. At every display they have the opportunity to engage more with the objects by picking up the object. This sets off the audio that informs the visitor with specific information that is connected to visual element on the object. In this way, the visitor walks by the displays and has the opportunity to choose as to what extent they want to learn. Regarding the control of the audio additional research is needed. The proposed controls (sensors that measure the distance between the visitor and artefact, thereby controlling the audio) were implemented after limited experimental explorations. The main limitation was that they were not validated in an environment where people were not consciously occupied with the control. Most significantly, this design process produced a concept in which untouchable artwork is transformed into commodities that tell a story.","Art; Boijmans Van Beuningen; Augmented; Audio; Replicas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Steele-Dunne, S.C. (mentor); Judge, J. (mentor); Menenti, M. (mentor)","2013","Currently, vegetation is considered a barrier to soil moisture retrieval by both passive and active remote sensing missions. Microwave emission and backscattering of vegetation is driven by the vegetation dielectric constant, which is a function of vegetation water content. The latter is a measure of root zone water availability. Understanding the variation in dielectric properties of vegetation will contribute to soil moisture retrieval using microwaves in vegetated areas. This study presents a unique dataset of the diurnal pattern of the leaf dielectric properties, which was linked to vegetation water content and water stress. Using a microstrip line sensor, in-vivo dielectric property measurements were conducted on three maize leaves (leaf 8, 10 and 12) from 8 to 19 October 2012. A correlation was found between the resonant frequency of the microstrip line and the leaf water content of maize. This showed that a decrease of leaf water content during the day led to an increase of the resonant frequency. Water stress was quantified by calculating the evaporation deficit and by measuring the soil water tension at 30cm and 50cm depth. It was found that the diurnal difference in resonant frequency of the sensor at leaf 8 increased in similar fashion as the soil tension and evaporation deficit, which indicates a correlation between water stress and vegetation dielectric properties. The upper leaves 10 and 12 responded differently to increased water stress. The diurnal difference in resonant frequency of the sensor at leaf 10 and 12 decreased or was non-existent. The dielectric measurements revealed the complex reaction of vegetation to water stress and pointed out many opportunities for further research. The water-cloud model was used to demonstrate the impact of changing water content at different frequencies and polarizations. For L-,C-,X-,Ku- and Ka-band the sensitivity of radar backscatter to soil moisture and vegetation water content was modeled. This showed that at L-band, for low volumetric soil moisture (<0.2) vegetation is the main contributor to total backscatter. At higher frequencies backscatter was mainly sensitive to leaf water content. Time series analysis of modeled radar backscatter, based on field measurements of vegetation water content and soil moisture, showed that using the standard water-cloud model, the simulated diurnal difference in backscatter was small (0.05 dB). A modified water-cloud model was formulated that takes into account leaf and stalk water content separately. This model simulated a higher diurnal difference in backscatter (0.8 dB) and corresponded better to the trend in decreasing leaf water content and increasing water stress. This study presented interesting results that will hopefully stimulate follow up research projects. As a first step, it already revealed possibilities of using vegetation as an indicator for soil moisture, vegetation water status and water stress. The eventual possibilities of monitoring this at a global scale will lead to new innovative applications that will contribute to improving the state of the world.","dielectric constant; water stress; vegetation; water-cloud model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

In this thesis, the applicability of CAN bus signals for estimating the Level of Service (LOS) on motorways is assessed. The real CAN bus data of single equipped vehicles, obtained from the Smart In-Car project, is used to estimate the LOS, using loop detector data as ground truth. To assess the LOS estimation accuracy at higher penetration rates, simulation data is used. The available real CAN bus signals provide a correct LOS estimation of 37% with single vehicles. The simulation results show correct LOS estimation rates ranging from 52% at 1% penetration to 70% at 100% penetration. LOS estimation using only positional data (GPS) is found to outperform LOS estimation using CAN bus data for most penetration rates, showing that the CAN bus signals do not contribute to better LOS estimation. There are however many other applications which may benefit from CAN bus signals.

However, changes in the container shipping market, international conflicts and new generations of vessels are some examples that could drive the desire the relocate or adapt quay wall structures. The objective of this thesis is to design a flexible quay wall structure for panamax container vessels that can be reused and can be reconstructed within a relatively short reconstruction period. Several quay wall structures have been designed and assessed, finally resulting in a quay wall, which consists of concrete caissons of 100m long, 33m wide and 11m high. The application of floating structures was considered too, but the required stability could not be guaranteed and motions are likely to exceed the tolerances for container lifting operations. Two caissons are placed on top of each other, resulting in a retaining height of 22m. The lower caissons are filled with water, to make de-ballasting relatively easy. The upper ones are filled with sand to create sufficient weight to satisfy stability against sliding and overturning. The structural strength has been calculated, resulting in an optimum wall thickness and applied amount of reinforcement steel. Determination of floating stability, resistance against earthquakes and slide planes in the subsoil has proven that the structure is a technically feasible alternative. To determine the financial feasibility, the flexible quay wall is compared to a traditional quay wall, for various scenarios. The initial construction costs are about 64% higher than the average constructions costs of traditional structures, but the reconstruction costs are about 28% lower. In combination with a faster reconstruction period and a higher residual value, it turned out that the flexible quay wall structure could be a financially feasible alternative to traditional quay wall structures too.","flexible quay wall; reusability; flexibility; caisson; container vessels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

These two set of equations will be coupled, where the back action of the moving fluid on the fields is neglected. Then we will design a realistic external source to model a focussed laser beam, to create a high intensity electromagnetic field around a focal point. We then solve the Navier-Stokes equations and investigate the resulting fluid flows. The choice of the fluid for our simulations is (pure) water.

(mentor)","2013","The semiconductor industry is on an ongoing quest to realize smaller feature size, requiring the constant implementation of new technology. A possible new technology is the use of a spatially controlled heat source to actively deform a mirror substrate to compensate for wavefront aberrations. In order to validate the ability to generate deformations, and to hold them, a measurement system is required. Although many off the shelf surface measurement system exist, none fulfill all requirements (measurement speed, working environment, mirror size, ect) to be implemented right away. Therefore a dedicated measurement setup is build consisting of an interferometer based fringe projection method. However an initial evaluation of the measurement system showed the performance to be insufficient. To improve the performance of the measurement system, the system is divided into four subsystems: Illumination system, interferometer, imaging system and data processing which all have been improved. The illumination system is improved by the addition of an optical isolator and polarizer to clean the laser beam, an extra beam expander to improve beam quality and pinhole overlay to reduce reflections. The interferometer is improved with the addition of beam stops to generate calibration images. The imaging system is improved by introducing: An aperture to focus on, a lens is added to improve the focus, the protection window on the CCD is removed and an aperture is introduced to reduce reflections. The data processing is improved by the tuning the filter shapes and introducing another filter to decrease edge effects. With the improvement the stability error of the measurement system improved form 2.5 nm to 0.29 nm. The reproducibility error decreased from 4.85 nm to 0.80 nm. The spatial resolution of the improved measurement system is 0.4 mm To validate the scaling of the measured deformations, an absolute shape measurement is done. This absolute shape measurement requires the system shape (measured shape due to all components in the measurement setup) to be known. While measuring the system shape, the topology of the measurement mirror is assumed to be flat, the topology amplitude of this mirror is validated by an auto-calibration measurement and proved correct. However, the drift in the measurement setup prevents the system from measuring an absolute shape with an high accuracy. Although the accuracy is not sufficient for absolute shape measurements, the scaling of the measured differences is proved correct (order of magnitude).

(mentor); Negenborn, R.R. (mentor); Lodewijks, G. (mentor)","2013","An intermodal container transportation network is being developed between Rotterdam and several inland terminals in North West Europe. This EUROPEAN GATEWAY SERVICES (EGS) network enables an integrated network transport between 7 inland terminals and 3 Rotterdam seaports. To use this network cost-efficiently, a more integrated planning of the container transportation is required. The most relevant aspects of such a planning are identified with a new model. This model introduces three new features to the intermodal network planning problem. First, the model combines two formulations for a multi-commodity network: a minimum cost network flow problem and a path-based network design formulation. Secondly, the model allows for overdue delivery at a penalty cost. In this way the practical flexibility of negotiating delivery times with customers is more closely represented than the use of strict delivery time restrictions. Thirdly, the model combines two types of operation: both self-operated services, operated by the network company as subcontracted services, operated by partners are used. The model distinguishes between rail and barge services and the use of truck when necessary. The model is applied at two different levels. At a tactical level, the optimal service frequencies between the network terminals is determined, considering barge or rail modes and both operation types (self-operated and subcontracted). This is called the service network design. The model is used to determine the optimal service frequencies between the terminals in the EGS network. The most influential aspects for the costs of this service network design are determined. The results of the experiments at the tactical level show that the costs for transferring have a strong impact on the amount of containers that are transported with intermediate transfers. An increase in intermediate transfers can lower the costs for transportation significantly. The results are used as a basis for an adapted model at an operational level. With this model the impact of a disturbed service is determined, by comparing the undisturbed planning with a full planning update after the disturbance. This impact can be seen as a measure for the gravity of a disturbance: a high impact means that a disturbance comes at high costs, even if handled in the best possible way. Hence, a high impact indicates disturbances that must be prevented. A second measure is the difference between an optimal (full) update and a local update, defined as the relevance. The local update represents the current practice of the manual planners. A high relevance indicates a disturbance that can be solved in a much more cost-efficient way by updating the existing planning fully, compared to only updating directly disturbed containers. The model is used for the same EGS case that was used at the tactical level. The impact and relevance of early departure, late departure and cancellation of services in the network are determined. The results show that service cancellations have the largest impact. Apart from that, early departure of a barge has a high impact as well. Indicators of disturbances that have a high relevance and should be solved with a full update are the following: the disturbed service is a barge, is self-operated and/or operates on a corridor with a high frequency of alternative services. The study shows that the new model is suitable for solving the problem at both the tactical and operational level. Points of attention for the manual planning are recommended and a focus for automated planning is proposed.","intermodal planning; synchromodal planning; network optimization; container transportation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Department of Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van Prooijen, B.C. (mentor); Breugem, W.P. (mentor)","2013","Little research was done in the past concerning the propagation of three dimensional effect in shallow wake flow caused by a roughness patch. Today’s research on related subjects is dominated by emerging obstructions in shallow water where the flow can be assumed as (quasi) two dimensional. However the relevance of a submerged obstruction with increased roughness can be found in wake control, oyster reefs, river- and estuary bottoms and heterogeneous land occupancy. To get a better understanding of the consequences of the three dimensionality of the flow structures, experiments are performed in a wide shallow flume to examine these structures. The main objective is to examine whether the wake structure of a roughness patch can be treated as (quasi)-two-dimensional. The objective has been answered by a combination of a literature study and an experiment performed at the faculty’s laboratory. The results show four dominant mechanisms in the wake of a roughness patch: transverse mass flux, bottom friction, mixing layer and the secondary circulation. Based on a momentum balance the transverse mass flux and the bottom friction are the largest contributions to this balance. Although the contribution of the mixing layer and the secondary circulation to the recovery of the wake are of the order of 10%, their influence on the flow structure is more pronounced. The mixing layer is shifted towards the wake centerline due to the presence of a transverse mass flux forming a misalignment between the maximum spanwise Reynolds stress and the position of the wake half width. Since this shift is of limited influence on the position of the secondary circulation, a misalignment if formed between the maximum momentum transport by the secondary circulation and the mixing layer causing a lower streamwise velocity at the edge of wake with respect to the wake of an emerging obstruction. The secondary circulation is responsible for the transport of low momentum fluid towards the edge of the wake near the bottom, and high momentum fluid towards the wake centerline near the surface. This behavior is responsible for the cross gradient in the streamwise velocity profiles as shown by the data obtained. For modeling purposes of well mixed quantities, a (quasi)-two-dimensional approach only holds if the weaker streamwise velocity near the edge of the wake is taken into account. In the case a prediction of depth varying quantities is desired, the cross gradient caused by the secondary circulation needs to be implemented as well which results in the need of a three-dimensional modeling approach.","secondary circulation; mixing layer; roughness patch; shallow wake flow; turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Mugge, R. (mentor)","2013","Branding and packaging are extremely important factors for a brand in order to become successful, especially when operating in the FMCG business. As a consumer, we are constantly confronted with numerous brands and their products and in order for them to be successful it is essential for a brand to differentiate itself from competition. Brands provide consumers with the possibility to differentiate and identify themselves with the brand. Therefore the value of branding and packaging for companies is of major importance, especially for companies operating in the FMCG market. Cartils, a branding and packaging design agency, provides independent, specialist advice with the focus on the development of brand packaging, corporate identities and brand personalities. Cartils provides strategic advice to international companies in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. Clients include leading names in luxury products, in divers sectors, such as: beverage, tobacco and personal care. In order to provide their clients with the best and tailor made advice Cartils developed a branding philosophy, which is called the BrandStar philosophy. Based on the philosophy, Cartils requires that a tool is developed in order for all departments to be able to perform a branding and packaging analysis. Currently, only the strategy department is using the BrandStar philosophy as an analysis tool, other departments such as account and design only use the terminology of the tool. Therefore the BrandStar is currently mainly functioning as a guideline for internal communication regarding running projects. However, in order to achieve the most accurate analysis of packaging it is important that at the start of a project, account, strategy and the design department are all able to quickly analyse the branding and packaging of a product and combine their results. First of all, the evolution of the BrandStar philosophy is analysed in order to map the development and the theory behind the philosophy. Furthermore an extensive literature study is conducted addressing branding and packaging, design teams and existing design tools, providing valuable insights, a solid base for the concept generation phase and inspirational examples. Since the tool is specifically meant for Cartils interviews are conducted with employees, resulting in a clear overview of the overall design process at the company, opinions on the current philosophy and willingness to adopt an analysis tool in their personal design process. This resulted in a list of requirements which have to be met in order for the tool to become successful and adopted in the design process. Based on the set criteria, decisions were made regarding the platform, content and structure of the tool after which ideas were generated. Finally the developed concept is illustrated by text and visuals, explaining the structure, features and process of the tool. The tool that is developed is called the BrandStar tool as it is based on the BrandStar philosophy. The tool provides employees at Cartils the possibility to simultaneously perform a branding analysis, before having an internal meeting on the project discussing the perception of the product and possible design directions. The tool is constructed in such a way that the analysis can be done ‘quick-and-dirty’ or elaborate, offering flexibility. Furthermore communication can be supported textually as well as visually and analysis results between departments or individuals can quickly and easily be compared. The concept is developed to a level that it directly can be programmed and implemented in the design process of the company. The methodology behind the tool is tested to see whether employees understood the structure and whether all required analysis features were available and presented in a clear and attractive manner. The test results indicated that the employees were surprised and enthusiastic about the new tool and they really could see the benefits for the company, for each department and for their own design process. Furthermore the tool proved to have a clear structure and an easy and attractive interface. Finally, the user tests provided recommendations and comments to consider when implementing the tool, these are taken into account during the evaluation of the BrandStar tool and project.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-03-05","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mulder, I.J. (mentor); Prins, R.G. (mentor)","2013","Physical activity (PA) benefits a healthy condition. On the broader canvas public health benefits from promoting a healthy lifestyle, which includes sufficient PA. Apart from the lives that are improved, The financial merit of improved public health is substantial. Walking is deemed one of the most effective forms of PA. It is for this reason that interest in research on the topic of walking and PA has increased over the past years. A study is being conducted by Erasmus Medical Centre if and how new social and physical interventions in certain neighbourhoods in Rotterdam can induce an increase in the weekly amount of time that people aged 55+ spend on walking. Developing new interventions requires a creative process. Therefore the discipline of Industrial Design offers a valuable addition to the set-up of the study. Senior citizens and other people with a sedentary lifestyle, particularly in some of the neighbourhoods in Rotterdam with lower socioeconomic status, would benefit socially and physically from increasing the role of walking in their daily routine. However they lack sufficiently strong incentives and perceive barriers to go out on the street. A persuasive design, tailored to the context of the neighbourhoods and the motivation of the elderly is desired to influence the citizens aged 55+ to advance their walking behaviour. The assignment is to create an intervention in the physical environment which should - together with other physical interventions - induce an increase in time spend on walking with 30 minutes per week, which is roughly 20% of the average time older people (aged 65+) currently spend on walking. Inspired by a process of context mapping with an emphasis on personal stories, an iterative design approach was followed to develop an appropriate and functioning design to address this matter. The resulting intervention: ‘De Reizende Roos’ (the travelling rose) can best be typified as an effort to brand walking as a social tool - which ultimately helps people retain independence. The objective of the branding campaign is for people to be able to deploy this tool according to their needs. One widely recognised quality of walking is highlighted: Walking benefits a good conversation between two people. Creating awareness around this quality happens by means of a learning experience: Participants are immersed in an experience and subsequently guided to turn the experience into knowledge by reflection and abstraction. ""De Reizende Roos"" (the travelling rose) is a narrative which gives meaning to an assignment that leads to the aforementioned learning experience. The narrative is about improving ‘the’ neighbourhood by improving one’s perception of the neighbourhood, about taking initiative and plucking up courage. A box containing the assignment is passed on between participants. The rose is the character who explains the assignment. Hence the name: travelling rose. Essentially the assignment is a challenge to make a walk together and while doing so, starting another initiative to improve social relations in the neighbourhood. After performing this act the participants are asked to reflect on the process by filling out a guestbook. Part of the report is to share experiences about if and how walking supported a conversation. The goal of the guestbook is for the participants to put the experience into words and thus transform it into knowledge. Experiments have demonstrated that the pass-on system works in principle, however some limitations are found. The most important finding is that not every senior can cope with the uncertainty of receiving a mysterious box and assuming responsibility for it. Furthermore it is inevitable that the boxes stop progressing at some point. An organisation is required to ‘respawn’ the boxes in such cases. These and other issues are addressed in what is called the ‘final’ design. However, it should be mentioned that the reality that a design is never final, applies on this project. The first and most important steps to evaluate will be how the adjusted pass-on system functions and whether the reflection in the guestbook guides towards an actual learning experience. By creating a learning experience and offering a tool to retain independence, a socially relevant and durable contribution is made, that is, a contribution which exceeds the boundaries of the intervention study and has a long lasting effect in the lives of the target group.","persuasive design; persuasive gaming; social cohesion; physical activity; motivation; experiential learning; elderly; senior; walking; talking; product service system; intervention study; behaviour; iterative design; public health; context mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Since the early days of exploration seismology seismic receiver field arrays have been employed for purposes such as suppressing high wavenumbers present in wavefield, reducing the volume of recorded data and improving its signal-to-noise ratio. These receiver field arrays rely on the receivers being placed on a predetermined geometric layout, a condition which is not always met in the field. Misplacing receivers can have a detrimental effect on the performance of the field array. Fortunately, advances in seismic acquisition now enable a) recording the output of individual receivers and b) knowing with high (but limited) accuracy the actual location of each receiver. It is possible then to form arrays digitally on a computer, a process known as group forming. Group forming can be viewed as a combination of filtering and resampling. We propose two algorithms that take advantage of the positional information available about the receivers and generate a linear space-varying (LSV) filter. The LSV filter is suitable for filtering the nonuniformly sampled data, generating the filtered output on the nominal grid. We examine the relation of our algorithms with other algorithms from the bibliography and investigate their performance on synthetic data.","seismic acquisition; nonuniform sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","MSc. track Telecommunications","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor)","2013","At the invitation of KLM research on a new handling process for odd-size baggage is performed. Oddsize baggage is a special type of hold baggage which cannot be handled by the baggage handling system at Schiphol. The new handling process for odd-size baggage is needed because the configuration of Departure halls 1 & 2 is going to change and KLM starts handling baggage of certain Schengen flights in the new baggage hall South. To determine the new handling process in Departure halls 1 & 2 different concepts with one or two outbound odd-size baggage flows towards the South hall are developed. After evaluation the scenario in which all odd-size baggage of Departure halls 1 & 2 is dropped off at the odd-size desk in Departure hall 1 is preferred. From this point on odd-size baggage will be transported to the South hall. Regarding the handling process in the South hall the research showed that there will be two input flows and one output flow in the new situation. The input flows are odd-size baggage of Departure halls 1 & 2 and transfer odd-size baggage. The preferred outbound odd-size baggage flow consists of a delivery of odd-size baggage at the regular baggage loading quays. At this location odd-size and regular baggage are merged and loaded on carts. Thereafter the carts for a specific flight are transported to the platform. And finally all baggage is loaded into the hold of an aircraft. Before outbound transportation takes place the odd-size baggage will be temporarily stored in a buffer in the South hall. The preferred method for buffering is using a roll-track. The sorting at the roll-track will be done based on Scheduled Time of Departure. Small carts will be used for the outbound transportation to the loading quays. The development of both the odd-size handling process in Departure halls 1 &2 and the South hall are based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis. Furthermore Multi Criteria Analyses are used to evaluate all concepts which are generated both for the departure halls and the buffer. The criteria used in this evaluation are set by KLM. The weights of the criteria are balanced with input of employees of KLM. A gaming simulation is performed to design the odd-size buffer in detail. By measuring different performance indicators, the simulation revealed that a buffer of 25m x 2 m (lxw) is sufficient. The simulation also showed that when 13 small baggage carts are used in the buffer the optimal transport interval to the loading quays is 15 minutes. Next to the new handling process, KLM also has a need for a vision on odd-size baggage handling for the future when 510.000 aircraft movements will take place at Schiphol. The developed vision consists of three concepts that are applicable for this scenario. The concepts are all reviewed qualitatively. Based on this qualitative evaluation a centralized odd-size baggage handling in a baggage hall called the BRR prevails with the remark that future changes and quantitative insights can result to another outcome.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""
