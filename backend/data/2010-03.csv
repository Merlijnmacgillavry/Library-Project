(mentor); Hoogervorst, J.A.P. (mentor); Van den Berg, J. (mentor)","2010","DEMO is a methodology for designing and engineering organizations which is mostly used for Information System Development (ISD) and redesigning the business processes. DEMO has the ability to reduce the complexity of an organization by providing an ontological model of that organization. Although DEMO has promising advantages and has provided successful outcome in practice, it hasn’t received the deserved attention from The individuals in practical fields. While many of the competitor methodologies are more successful and accepted among the practitioners, DEMO is at the risk of being forgotten among all other methodologies in the methodology jungle. It seems trivial to use effective tactics to increase the acceptance of DEMO among individuals in practice. These tactics can only be effective if they take the reasons behind this specific point of view about DEMO into account. Various factors from a technical anomalies to opinion of others can influence the perception of people about a methodology. While the acceptance of DEMO by people in practice is very important in the success of the methodology in practical fields, no research was found in the literature that the statistics on reports the adoption rate of DEMO in practice and identifies the reasons behind certain adoption behavior. Therefore, alongside providing such statistics the main goal of this thesis is to identify the factors that can determine certain behavior towards DEMO and propose recommendations to increase the adoption of DEMO based on these factors. We conducted this research in three phases: Theoretical, Quantitative and qualitative analysis. In theoretical analysis we have identified the factors that were proven to influence the adoption of other methodologies. In quantitative analysis we have tried to find out whether these factors have any influence on the adoption of DEMO. At the end, we captured the actual experience of the individuals in practice with DEMO. In this research we were able to identify several factors that influence the adoption of DEMO. We realized that the support of DEMO by management, coworkers, other individuals with the same skills as the individual and the eagerness of the individual to keep him self updated about DEMO can increase the adoption of DEMO to a great extent. Furthermore, uncertainty one’s position in the organization has a negative effect on the adoption of DEMO. Finally, the ability of the methodology to produce results in a way that can be communicated with all the individuals with different levels of knowledge about DEMO is also influencing the adoption of DEMO.","DEMO; design and engineering methodology for organizations; adoption; methodology adoption; acceptance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Information Architecture","",""

The DSEM uses an inverse optimisation method to predict muscle forces from net joint moments. In this study two new modes are presented that constrain the inverse optimisation with muscle force boundaries based on muscle dynamics (inverse forward dynamical mode) and boundaries based on EMG-recordings (EMG-assisted mode). The new modes were validated with measurements of two standardised movements (abduction and ante exion) from two subjects. A proof of concept has been given that both new modes work. It was concluded that DSEM predictions can be dominated by morphological differences between the subject and the cadaver on which the DSEM is based. Until better scaling routines are developed the IFDO mode is not very useful. When EMG-constraints are added, muscle and GH-joint reaction forces are predicted to be higher. Adding EMG for one muscle can predict cocontraction in other muscles. By adding EMG-based constraints, the DSEM can account for individual strategies in control strategy for the data that was analysed and is therefore an interesting topic for future research.","shoulder; musculoskeletal modelling; EMG; muscle force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Boeijen, A.G.C. (mentor); Wit, R. (mentor)","2010","South Sudan, after the long civil war between North and South, is still remained war-affected. In order to find the opportunities for reconstruction and rehabilitation in South Sudan, SHF conducted fact finding missions and decided to prioritize the assistance by realizing suitable water and sanitation (WATSAN) facilities before starting a complete housing program. Therefore, BB4P as a building company working with SHF, wanted to develop WATSAN facility for South Sudanese BOP customers based on their Bubble-building concept. The goal of this project was, therefore, to identify the needs and demands of South Sudanese BOP customers in the areas of health, water and sanitation, and to develop the total system for the WATSAN units. In order to achieve the goal, five different research and design phases were planned and executed. The phases are: (1) exploratory research; (2) context analysis; (3) culture analysis; (4) optimal solution search; and (5) final concept proposal, evaluation, and recommendation. Throughout the explorative research, basic project knowledge was attained, and how to make the project successful was found. As the way to make a successful project, context and culture analysis was proposed as the research method not only to identify the WATSAN needs and demands of South Sudanese BOP customers but also to obtain other necessary information for developing locally tailored solutions, in other words, the solution ensuring the success of implementation. Context analysis found general problems, barriers, and opportunities around water and sanitation. At the end of the analysis, the synthesis result showed the complex problem model in South Sudan. By simulating hypothetical scenarios, eight significant factors were found and then they were again narrowed down to four focal points such as education, WATSAN, healthcare, and media. On the basis of these focal points, several possible solution models were suggested. Culture analysis found WATSAN specific problems, needs, preferences, their WATSAN products/services, behaviors, as well as their general mindset. During the synthesis of culture study, the target place and people were decided to primary schools and school children, and design requirements and design guide were formulated as well. Based on the design requirements and design guide, the initial product-service model in primary schools was created, and it was revised into the final concept throughout the optimal-solution search. The revised product-service model was evaluated, and recommendations were suggested at the end. As a main final result, a toilet unit includes ventilation-improved urine diversion toilet, waterless urinal, hand-washbasin using P.I.P.A. rain water harvesting system, wash-and-change room for girls, and cleaning materials; the primary source of water is harvested rain water; cleaning and maintenance system involves school health club, school farmers, cooks, and community caretakers. The final product-service model also includes (1) fence around the school, (2) trash separation/burning/recycling, (3) school health center and sickroom, (4) kitchen and school bathroom, (5) lulu tree farming for soap supply, (6) water filter for water treatment and distribution, etc. for the students’ better safety, health, education, and more pleasant learning environment. The whole system creates jobs and helps increase overall health awareness in the community level as well. In order to make this project implementation successful and more sustainable, the first imperative future work was advised to let the exact users, cleaners, and maintainers (e.g., students and teachers) know and evaluate this solution model, and to make sure that they would like to adopt, build, use, and maintain this solution. Effective health and hygiene education (e.g., CHAST) and sector-wide approach should go together with the project implementation as well. The ideal scenario for the planning and implementation, and other necessary future works were suggested as recommendations too.","BOP; Southern Sudan; WATSAN; water; sanitation; needs assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-30","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Field data validation of the XBeach model","Voukouvalas, E.","Stive, M.J.F. (mentor); Van Dongeren, A.R. (mentor); Walstra, D.J.R. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor)","2010","The storm surge early-warning system that is going to be established in the Netherlands, combines the accurate weather forecast with the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic models in an operational mode, in order to estimate the potential impact on the coasts. This study focuses on the morphodynamic validity of the operational model system, by studying two historical storm surge events on prototype scale. Due to the lack of warning, the 1953 storm surge left behind thousands of casualties and extensive wreckage of the Dutch coastline. In order to reduce the probability of experiencing again such a devastating storm surge, the coastal defense policy in the Netherlands had been reorganized on national level and more effective countermeasures had been received. When the 1976 storm surge attacked the country, the civil awareness and the reinforced coastal defense abate the impact and the fatalities. The degradation of the coastline has been recorded as part of the Jarkus coastline monitoring programme, and after the conducted analysis the non-uniform impact along the North Holland province became evident. Two numerical models form the operational model schematization; the deformation and the propagation of the storm surge are simulated with the Delft3D model and the nearshore hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes by the XBeach model. The available storm surge level records attest that the model underestimates the storm surge level for both of the events, up to 0.70m and the phase lag up to 45 minutes. In the studied site of Bergen, the performed sensitivity analysis of the XBeach model proves that the water level underestimation is an important parameter for the deviations between the coastal profile records as a result of the 1976 storm surge and the computed post storm profile, as higher computational skill is obtained when imposing the measured storm surge level record instead of the computed one. Furthermore, the XBeach model reacts as expected at the changes concerning the waves' asymmetry and the slumping of the water area through its avalanching mechanism, reflecting a higher computational skill. In contrast, the model is insensitive to the long waves' sediment stirring and to the additional imposed wind setup. Concerning the model performance in the area of Castricum, the model skill is excellent and very good convergence is obtained on estimating the volume change and the estimated dune retreat. In Julianadorp, while the influence of the groins is not accounted, due to the significant scouring that is observed in the backshore zone, the model performance is bad. The geological features and the bed profile of the studied areas present a different pattern of the energy distribution, which may indicate a possible reason for the longshore erosion variability during the 1976 storm surge. The operational model needs to be further verified with the 2DH simulations in order to account for the longshore profile development and the effects of the hard non-erodible structures, while it is also recommended to further investigate the extensive scour development in the backshore zone.","storm surge; 1953; 1976; operational model; XBeach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kleinsmann, M.S. (mentor); Stompff, G. (mentor); Van Vliembergen, E.J.W. (mentor)","2010","Products are developed with groups of people. These groups of people need to have a common idea what the product they are developing should look like at the end. Product development is considered a social process where the end result is created in negotiation between all participants. Literature show that having more shared understanding about the intended end result of the project leads to more successful products. Shared understanding is a common interpretation, or framing. When the interpretations about a product of two people overlap, the product has many similar relationships with other pieces of information within the minds of both persons. But the pieces of information one has in his mind and the way these pieces are placed in his mental networks, are influenced by previous experiences, education, culture, etc. This implies that when people are working together, they will have different perceptions of the task, the context and the outcome because their pasts will not be completely similar. And this mismatch in perceptions can lead to problems in collaboration. Consider the situation where a person thinks it is good enough if a consumer can use a microwave after reading the manual. If he cooperated with someone who wants to create a self-explaining product, they will not understand each other when discussing the way the end user needs to setup the microwave. A strong factor in determining the content and the links in the mental networks of individuals is the organizational culture. This claim is supported by literature and empirical evidence in this report. Organizational culture comprises of for instance the following elements: jargon, products, stories, behavior, values, mission and habits. Some of these elements are nested very deep in an organization and so taken for granted that they are not questioned anymore. Because they are so deeply integrated in the organization and taken for granted, it is hard for organizational members to be aware of the presence and to express them when asked. These elements are called assumptions. At Océ, people from different R&D sites work together to create new products. Sometimes people from other organizations are involved in the product development too, think of employees of Flextronics, Benchmark, Konica Minolta and Canon. Each Océ R&D site has its own distinct organizational culture, since the history, jargon, stories and habits differ. And the variance with the organizational culture from Océ Technologies in Venlo with that of the external companies is even bigger as less is hold in common. The divergence in organizational culture hinders the creation of shared understanding in product development teams. Unfortunately, creating better or more specifications is not the answer to the difference in interpretations throughout the project team. The creator of the specifications founds the specs on assumptions. And the same assumptions might not exist at the other organization where they work with this list of requirements. The receiver of the requirements misses then some essential building blocks to come to the same interpretation of the requirement as the creator did, leaving room for new and different interpretations. Only in discussion can the receiver create a similar interpretation of the requirements as the sender. An attempt was made in this graduation project to define what kind of organizational assumptions are used in product development. In the study, it became clear that a full list of organizational assumptions cannot be created in a half year time, because the context determines what assumptions are used and in what way. The same reason made the creation of a communication tool useless, as the context in the next project or over an half year would be so different, the communication tool would not fit anymore. Something that would certainly lead to improvement is to raise awareness of the role organizational assumptions can play in New Product Development. When people have this awareness, they will start communicating more careful, leaving room to discuss the assumptions in their work. And a game appeared the best form to gain awareness of the role of organizational assumptions in New Product Development. The developed game is called ‘Princen: Assumptions in product development’. In ‘Princen’, that can be played by 6 people at the same time, the participants mimic the creation of a convectional microwave in a co-creation setting with 6 different companies. In the game, the participants read a rich story about a company that will influences them. Next, the participants select images to express what their company wants to achieve in the convectional microwave project. Participant will make decisions. In the game, the group has to decide which developments to carry out. ‘Will we do A or B?’ These developments have an effect on the character of the convectional microwave. After a game, a reflection takes place, In the reflections, the facilitator will ask questions that leads the participant to: 1) Awareness that a part of his mental knowledge network relies on organizational culture. 2) Awareness of the differences that exists in this specific part of his mental knowledge network with people working for other organizations, which results in problems. 3) Discover at least 2 example from the participants’ own work where organizational assumptions influenced the decisions. The game was tested with Océ employees as participants and it was possible to meet the three named objectives. The participants also indicated the game to be fun and a good learning experience. It is expected that the game could be a relevant training within Océ R&D to enhance the cooperation between R&D sites and outside organizations. This is done by creating awareness that product development is a social process where assumptions influence the interpretation and several of these assumptions come from the organizational identity. With this awareness, the product development will benefit because it will reduce the development time, minimize errors and the outcome will be better products.","organizational culture; shared understanding; mental models; assumptions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Correljé, A.F. (mentor); De Bruijne, M.L.C. (mentor); De Jong, S. (mentor)","2010","The functioning of vital infrastructures, such as energy and telecommunications infrastructure, is key to societal and economic security and well-being in modern society. The reliability of these infrastructures is thus of paramount importance. Transmission system operators (TSOs) fulfill a central role in achieving this reliability, by maintaining, operating and developing the transmission networks that form the backbone of the infrastructure. However, the TSOs have to achieve this in changing conditions and with increasing uncertainties; vital infrastructures are faced with rapidly changing market conditions and regulations, especially given the ongoing liberalization process in the European Union. Furthermore, they not only have to maintain reliability, but also other values like affordability, accessibility and sustainability. To ensure an adequate level of reliability, while also remaining efficient and profitable in a changing environment, TSOs need to continuously reevaluate their planning and investment decision making methods. To be able to do this, they need insight in the trade-off between reliability and efficiency and the different investment options to improve reliability. In this research, we aim to add to that insight by comparing three vital Dutch infrastructures (the gas infrastructure, the electricity infrastructure and the fixed line telecommunications infrastructure) using an analytical framework based on the ISO31000 Risk Management standard. By using risk management, we create a generic framework that explicitly deals with uncertainty. We focus on three elements in the risk management process: context, assessment and treatment. The study consists of a comparative case study, based on literature review and interviews with TSOs and regulators. The context has been described along a set of factors, that have been categorized as either technical, economic or institutional. The final set of 12 factors is considered to be as parsimonious, relevant and complete as possible, to give a structured and efficient overview of the different infrastructures. From analyzing the context it follows that the infrastructures are very different, but often have striking similarities on individual context factors and experience similar developments, such as internationalization and institutional fragmentation. This fact enables us to analyze the particular influence of these factors on the assessment and treatment of reliability. This final set of factors thus forms a strong basis for the rest of the analysis. Reliability is neither a simple nor an unambiguous concept for multiple reasons. First, we can identify different levels of reliability. Second, reliability risks can occur on different timescales and in different parts of the supply chain. Third, in vital infrastructures the public interest in reliability has a large influence on the perception of reliability. Finally, the discussion on reliability is often embedded in a specific infrastructure. To compare the assessment of reliability in different infrastructures, we have to deal with these complexities. Therefore, we have developed a new conceptual model that identifies different levels and dimensions of reliability and also is generic enough to be applied to all analyzed infrastructures. The assessment of reliability in gas and electricity infrastructure shows strong similarities, while in telecommunications infrastructure the assessment is radically different as a result of rapid technological developments and strong differentiation in services offered. When analyzing the treatment of reliability, it becomes clear that individual treatment options are very infrastructure specific and comparing them is difficult and of limited use. Therefore, four high-level treatment strategies have been identified, which can be compared between infrastructures. These four treatment strategies are investing in larger infrastructures, investing in smarter infrastructures, supply responsiveness and demand responsiveness. The dominant strategies of the TSO in gas infrastructure are investing in larger infrastructures and supply responsiveness; in electricity infrastructure it is supply responsiveness and in telecommunications infrastructure it is investing in larger and smarter infrastructures. Demand responsiveness is important, but not a central strategy for TSOs, because they deal with aggregated traffic flows and have no direct contracts with consumers in which to include incentives for demand responsiveness. The trade-off between reliability and efficiency is sometimes mistakenly simplified and over rationalized in the discussion between regulators and regulated TSOs. Considering that the costs of reliability risks and the investment costs to reduce these risks can be estimated, it is contended that this trade-off can be analytically optimized. However, given the multidimensionality and subjectivity of reliability and the complexity of transmission networks, this optimization is most likely false and extremely difficult. In an infrastructure where different stakeholders have different perceptions and requirements for reliability, which also change over time and as a result of incidents, an adequate level of reliability can only be determined in a political, rather than an analytical, process. Another concern is that fragmented regulatory oversight and the decoupling of public values, can lead to conflicting interventions and suboptimal decisions by the TSO. Especially when the regulation of a specific value is very stringent compared to other values (e.g. efficiency by price regulation) and the regulated TSO has only specific responsibilities and capabilities, the risk exists that the scope of the TSO is narrowed only to those responsibilities and capabilities, instead of developing and encouraging new solutions. To avoid this, regulation should be more holistic and should address conflicts between different public values instead of decoupling them. To achieve an adequate trade-off between reliability and efficiency, while dealing with institutional fragmentation and uncertainty, TSOs should employ more proactive mechanisms to efficiently and effectively utilize existing and future transport capacity. Especially the gas infrastructure lacks such mechanisms, e.g. an efficient capacity allocation mechanism. Also, while we have shown that analytically optimizing the trade-off between efficiency and reliability produces no sensible results, TSOs still need a way to determine and achieve an adequate level of reliability. Considering the political and complex nature of reliability, it is necessary to develop instruments to achieve long-term reliability in cooperation with other stakeholders.","vital infrastructures; reliability; transmission networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Infrastructures","","","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2010","During this graduation project, ‘Vrachtfiets and the C2C islands – Ameland’, the applications for Vrachtfiets that fit in the philosophy of the Cradle-to-Cradle islands project have been explored. Ameland was chosen as the context for development. Vrachtfiets is a modular transport bicycle that enables the creation of custom made mobility solutions. This includes the possibility to design Product-Service Systems in which different Vrachtfietsen with different purposes work together as an integral solution to local transport needs. The dematerialization of products into services create user sacrifices in our consumer society. Therefore it is vital to adapt a product to a local context and lower this sacrifice. The combination of the modular Vrachtfiets which is adaptable to local contexts and PSS creation in practice provides an interesting case. The project started with the development of a ‘Vrachtfiets module and Product-Service System (PSS) creation Methodology’. This methodology has been used throughout the project to aid the creation and communication of ideas. First an analysis of the specific context was made including material flows and stakeholders. From this analysis, conclusions about possible Vrachtfiets applications were drawn and translated into scenarios. These scenarios were ideas and concepts for Product-Service Systems based on the Vrachtfiets and its customizable modules. Meetings with local actors and discussion of these scenarios resulted in the collaboration with a holiday park on Ameland. This holiday park was interested in Vrachtfiets mobility solutions for both its internal and external transport needs. The internal transport needs are the movements of the park its employees including the cleaning ladies, the technical service department, the park manager and the animation team. The external transport needs are the transport needs of their guests that arrive by boat. Analysis of these transportation needs resulted in the design of three different modules and a PSS in which these modules work together. The different transport needs have a fluctuating demand. By interchanging the modules on the Vrachtfiets however, its application can be changed to meet the transport need of the moment. One of the designs is a Tourist Vrachtfiets on which tourists are able to transport themselves, their family and their luggage between the ferry and the holiday park. This service can be booked on beforehand and provides the tourists with an alternative to bringing their car along to Ameland. This reduces the amount of cars on Ameland, saves money by not bringing your car on the ferry and creates a unique and fun experience. As a visible and comprehensible example of a ‘green’ product it inspires people and communicates the relationship between Ameland and the environment. The design of the Tourist module has been prototyped and tested in user test on Ameland in February 2010. The tourists react enthusiastically and eager to use the service when it becomes available. The employees of the holiday park are enthusiastic as well but they will need some time to adjust. The prototype has been made possible by the province of Fryslan.","design; modular transport bicycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In most situations when people eat dinner, after the food is served no more heat is transported to the food which results in a temperature decline. This causes a less sensational taste experience than when the food were consumed on the temperature that the cook intended. This problem can be solved by a system that maintains the food temperature when it is on the dinner table. The project described in this document is a journey that walks through four main phases to end up with a complete solution for this problem. In the first phase, where the research is executed, literature and existing patents are studied that are related to the subject. In questionnaires and interviews that are conducted in restaurants and other possible markets like elderly care and nursing homes, the market interest is investigated. It seems that the hospitality business is quite conservative and not soon embracing innovations, which is probably why only a small share of the market seems interested in the idea. However this is still a relatively big market due to the massive size of the market in total. In the elderly care and nursery branch people are more interested, but the budgets are very small. The development costs that need to be recovered by the first series of products will probably cause the introduction price to be too high for this branch. Therefore the first market where the development of the product will be focused on will be the hospitality business. For this market, seven concepts are developed that are based on the solutions of sub problems that arise when designing for this branch. These concepts do all have a different point of view on the problem and with use of a Harris profile, the one that fits best in the hospitality business is selected. Although there was a clear winner according to the Harris profile, two concepts are developed further. The reason for that decison is because there is room in the market for both products, because they share different parts of the market. The plates filled with Phase changing material and the shell that can be put on top of a restaurant table are worked out. With use of proof of principles it turned out that these two technologies are capable of providing a suitable solution for the problem. The plate with PCM is worked out conceptionally and visualized with use of CAD software. The induction shell is worked out both in CAD software, as well as onto a physical prototype, that has less high tech properties than the designed concept but it shows exactly the main functions of the induction shell: You can put a plate anywhere on the table; it will detect where the plate is positioned and it provides a balanced amount of energy to keep its temperature stable.","food; temperature; induction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial design","","","",""

However, the optimal settings of attaching to and detaching from delicate tissues are unknown. This study presents the effects of the instrument heating properties and initial contact force on the adhesion force, detachment success and thermal damage. An instrument prototype was developed to test attachment and detachment for different combinations of generated heat (3.5-20.0mJ) and pulse length (0.25-2.50ms). Thermal tissue damage was estimated with electro-thermal FEM simulations and histological analysis. The adhesion force depended strongly on the amount of generated heat and contact force. Pulse length played a minor role. Detachment success was determined by the maximum instrument temperature. Thermal tissue damage was strongly related to the amount of generated heat, the effect of pulse length was marginal. In RPE-choroid graft analysis, the RPE cells were not affected by heat. HIAD proved sensitive to heating characteristics and tissue properties. Nevertheless, this principle creates potential to build better performing tissue manipulators.","heat; tissue; adhesion; detachment; damage; eye","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BioMedical Engineering: Medical Instruments & Medical Safety","",""

(mentor); Kragten, G. (mentor)","2010","The particular category of the underactuated grippers is chosen for the automation of the item picking in distribution centers. The underactuated grippers have fewer degrees of actuation than degrees of freedom, so they are mechanically simpler than the fully-actuated grippers, and they are able to adapt to objects regardless of their shapes. However, the existing underactuated grippers found in the literature are regarded overdesigned because more than enough passive elements are included. This paper is aimed to design and build a more simplified but still workable underactuated gripper for the item picking. The designed gripper contains a cable-pulley driven underactuated finger which has two phalanges, and an opposite fixed finger. Moreover, the fingertip of the underactuated finger is intended to move along the ground where the target object is laid. The dimensions of the gripper are selected in order to achieve the following two tasks: picking the cylindrical objects from the ground and retaining the grasp during a lifting transportation. The experiment setup fails to drive the fingertip of the underactuated finger moving along the ground, but it is shown that the designed gripper is still able to fulfill these two tasks, except for the case that when the initial spacing between the moving underactuated finger and the object is rather large.","Underactuated gripper fixed finger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G. (mentor); Wisse, M. (mentor)","2010","The initial assignment, as formulated by the Delft Biorobotics Laboratory (DBL) for this graduation project was “Design a personal assistant robot for elderly” During the first phase, the design directions have been explored. This was done by looking into the world of the elderly and into the world of domestic robots. The findings from this study have shown that until now, these two worlds do not match; the kind of assistance that is needed for elderly is too complex by the present-day robots to be executed. The biggest challenges lie mainly within the artificial intelligence which is not yet developed to make robots operate successfully in the unstructured domestic environments. A striking finding during the exploration is the fact that many elderly have accidents at home caused by falling from a ladder. This problem can be addressed by the application of the DBL gripper, which, using just one motor, can grab a large variety of objects in the house. Hence, the assignment has been reformulated into “Design a Robotic Personal Assistance Tool for Elderly”. The analysis showed that no products have been developed that specifically makes it unnecessary for people to stand on ladders. The existing reaching products are not able to grab the variety of objects that are located on high shelves. Also, the structure of the existing products leave many high places unreachable and require high force exertion of the user to lift regular objects. During the conceptualisation and materialisation a new product has been developed. This product applies the technology of the DBL, the gripper, in a consumer product for elderly. The main issues that have been solved are; the reduction of forces on the users, make it possible to reach all necessary locations, keep the use simple, intuitive and safe. Subjects from the target group have been referred to regularly to test possible solutions for these issues. The result is a new archetype reacher of which a working prototype has been built in order to evaluate the principle. The costing calculations show that, for large series, the selling price of the product can fit in the price range of domestic appliances.","robotics; elderly; accidents; reacher; gripper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor); Vermeeren, A.P.O.S. (mentor)","2010","In the five years that Hyves exists it has grown to be the biggest social network site in the Netherlands with over 9 million members. One of the most used parts of the site concerns the uploading, editing and sharing of photos. At the moment more than 3 billion photos are stored on Hyves and 1 million more are uploaded each day. This project focused on gaining insights into the way photos are uploaded, edited and shared on Hyves currently and the experience users of Hyves have while doing this. Furthermore, more was found out about the reasons of people for taking, editing and sharing photos and their wishes concerning an application that supports one or more aspects of this process. To gain these insights six participants were asked to show the way they use the Hyves photo feature. Next to this seven participants were interviewed about their reasons for taking photos, what are important aspects of these photos and how and with whom photos are shared. One of the things that became evident in research was that users like telling stories when showing photos to others in real life (e.g. on a laptop). It was felt by participants that this could not really be done when showing photos to others online (by placing them on Hyves). It was decided to make a redesign for the photo feature of Hyves focusing on telling stories. More was found out about what would enable users to tell stories online, by organizing a creative session and creating scenarios. A redesign was made of the photo feature, which enables users to share photos with specific friends. Groups of contacts can be made to make selecting friends easy and quick. Next to this, shared albums can be created to which specific friends can add photos as well. Photos in albums can be used to create stories. Stories can be created by using text balloons and frames in several shapes into which photos can be placed. Next to this, details in photos can be emphasized by adding little messages (notes) to a photo. Stories can be viewed by the creator of the story and visitors. To view a story a separate layer is placed on top of the photo specific page. When clicking on a photo while viewing a story, users can respond to a photo in the story by placing a comment or respect.","redesign; photos; social network site; Hyves; website","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Buijs, J.A. (mentor); Smits, M. (mentor)","2010","Robots for long-term care The development of robots for long-term care is driven by a fascination for the technological possibilities rather than an eye for the needs and desires in its designated context. Although robots are seen as the ultimate solution to the continuously aging population and the decreasing availability of caretakers, robot experts are not familiar with the daily needs of caretakers and patients. Early involvement of relevant stakeholders through participative vision assessment can steer robot technology towards a desirable future. Participative vision assessment Participative vision assessment aims to make a new technology more beneficial for society by bridging the gap between the visions and underlying assumptions of its creators and its designated users. The three-phased process, as shown in the diagram, ultimately leads to an dialogue in which existing visions are exchanged an new visions on the desirable future of robots in long-term care are constructed. New visions New visions arose most prominently on the level of concrete applications. For example, a robotic hospital bed that only has to be steered by one nurse was designed by a team of robot experts and caretakers. This robo-bed could save 50% workforce while on the same time allowing the nurse to fully focus on the mental and physical state of the patient. Conclusion Although the robot applications that were designed during the dialogue workshop might not seem to be futuristic, the new visions on the desirable future of robots that are inscribed in them are significant. Rather than aiming for super-intelligent autonomous humanoids, the robot experts should focus on developing modest robotic tools to solve the urgent needs in long-term care.","visions; assessment; robots; participative; dialogue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor); Fortuin, J. (mentor)","2010","The television market in the Netherlands has a lot of growth potential for Digital television. There are a lot of players on the market on different infrastructures. KPN has a difficult task to influence the consumers to switch from their current cable subscription to a subscription at KPN using a different infrastructure. A lot of research has to be done to identify the potential consumer of digital television and especially the potential consumer for Digitenne. The research objective for this project is: “To create a better insight on the non digital television users and to define what the best approach is to target them.” The digital television market in the Netherlands is evaluated using multiple research project conducted by and for KPN and public research projects. With the help of two types of segmentation methods, Mosaic and life stages, the users of the television market are evaluated. Moreover, the users are compared on largeness, type of digital television, and number of analogue users. Combining all findings a target group that has the most potential to become future users for Digitenne is chosen: the elderly between 55 and 70 years old. This group is the late majority of digital television and has thereby some typical characteristics that have to be taken into account when designing the final promotion campaign for Digitenne. Via interviews insight in the target group was created. Based on this insight, five factors are found which form a barrier for adopting new technologies, especially in switching from service or service provider. The factors found are: advice, finance, service, trust, and knowledge. These factors play important roles in the choice of a new service. Finance is more a top of mind factor that triggers the consumer while the other factors are more underlying. This means that they do influence the decision but are not on the top of mind. In the focus groups the factors were tested to see if they could be used as a trigger for the target group. To test the factors, each factor was transformed into a proposition, which describes the situation, the dilemma, and the promise KPN can give the consumer. The focus groups showed that all situations and dilemmas of all propositions were recognised by the target group, but that the target group was not convinced by the promises of KPN. The main insight of the research is that there is only one trigger for Digitenne, which is the price. No other propositions can function as a trigger for Digitenne. On the contrary the propositions are recognised by the target group and do play a role in buying Digitenne. These propositions are seen as thresholds of switching to a new television subscription. The main threshold of Digitenne is the negative word of mouth advertisement about the reliability of Digitenne and the quality of the product. In order to overcome this threshold people need to explore Digitenne themselves. This can be done on two ways; by demonstrating Digitenne to them or by let the target group try Digitenne by themselves. Three concepts are developed to stimulate the elderly in adopting Digitenne. These concepts are KPN communication, Super User, and Push. The concepts are tested on the list of requirements. The concept that scored best on all the criteria is the Super User concept. This concept is the starting point for the final design. Before the final design is developed the findings of the consumer research has to be validated and the aspects of the super user has to be investigated. An online survey is conducted to validate the findings. The findings of the research are validated using hypothesises. The results show that the respondents prefer getting advised, the knowledge of the television market does not influence the switching incentive of the elderly, high satisfaction of current subscription does negative influence the switching incentive, and a minor relation was found between the price of the subscription and the satisfaction of the user. Comparing the digital television user with the analogue users showed that both parties are satisfied with their current subscription and indicate the same features as important aspects in a new television subscription. Analogue users have a more positive attitude towards switching subscription than digital users. The most important aspects for switching subscription are: the ease of switching, image quality, and price. The super user concepts aspects were also tested on the respondents. The respondents have to identify the most convincing person, preferred kind of information, preferred orientation channels, and sales channel. The elderly prefer to orientate on their own findings, trust their own findings the most, and prefer using the product in house. When they orientate the most used channel is online. The most used sales channel is the store with the best service. The final design is based on the outcomes of the consumer research. The final design is a campaign that is based on the AIDA method. The goal of the campaign is getting Digitenne in the houses of the elderly. The elderly are triggered by the price advantage and convinced by online movies of current Digitenne users in their neighbourhood. The elderly get the offer to try Digitenne for free at home, so they can convince themselves by using it. By introducing this method the late majority will be triggered and convinced of Digitenne.","Late majority; Digital television; Campaign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Loth, M. (mentor)","2010","On average, each person visits the toilet 8 times a day. Each day, 15 minutes are spend on a toilet. Therefore no one can deny the important role of toilets. This project scrutinizes toilets in public spaces. The development of mass produced cheap material public toilets, placed at the wrong locations, has lead to many problems. Problems such as terrible hygienic conditions, vandalism, misuse and a bad image. Many toilets were in such a bad condition that they have been removed and not been replaced to save costs. This has lead to even more problems with public toilets these days: bad availability, bad accessibility and bad maintenance. Foreign sources report that over 40% of public toilets have been closed over the past ten years. In the Netherlands, there is currently no law that insists that city councils provide public toilets. This project uses two different approaches to make a good implementation of modern public toilets possible. The user is the centre of the design. One approach is the from a macro level down to a product level, the other one is from the user up to the product level. This approach has lead to an analysis of current regulations and cities within the Netherlands on one side and an overview of the user wishes, based on user analysis and research on the other side. Apparently, the amount of regulations for public toilets is very limited. Analogies have been found to figure out which factors play a role to determine an availability-formula. It appears that the need for public toilets is very high, especially for specific user groups. With the increasing percentage of elderly in the Netherlands, the need for public toilets will increase. Toilets are the most important building for disabled visitors to be able to get access to. The analysis has lead to a set of factors, that play an important role to calculate the availability of public toilets. These factors have been spoken through with experts in two brainstorm sessions. Also, the choices a stakeholder will have to make when deciding to fulfill the need for toilets have been discussed and explained in a set of guidelines. The end result is a publication with fill-in forms to make it easy for city councils and involved parties to determine a policy for public toilets. The publication contains 6-steps to analyze the current situation and tackle the important problems regarding availability, accessibility and maintenance. The availability is easy to determine using a formula involving the degree of urbanization, the hotspots and the type of users in a centre area. The accessibility is based on different choices that have to be made and tips and tricks to prevent vandalism and misuse and stimulate use. The maintenance explains multiple possibilities to boost the image of public toilets. Finally this project process report ends with suggestions for the recently set up Dutch Toilet Organisation on how to proceed. For users, DTO should aim on communication. For stakeholders, promotion and information are the most important to-do’s for the near future.","public toilets; guidelines; strategic; implementation; public space; regulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Meer, J.D. (mentor); Van den Brink, F. (mentor)","2010","This graduation project has been performed at AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals in order to attain the Master of Science degree at the Faculty Industrial Design Engineering of Delft University of Technology. In this executive summery an overview of the most important information is given. AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals consists of a managerial board, which is assisted by service units, Manufacturing & Technology services and 5 sub-Business Units (sBU); Energy, Salt, Chlor-alkali, Ecosystems and MCA. AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals has approximately 1,900 employees. AkzoNobel is a chemical concern that creates products for other companies: business-to-business. It becomes more and more important to know what your input as a company on the environment is as well as the input on the environment of your suppliers. The Carbon Policy has been developed in a wide scope of sustainability and describes their short- and long-term targets and ambitions to manage their cradle-to-gate carbon footprint: the sum of all direct and indirect emissions contributing to global warming. AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals has chosen to involve all the different sBU’s to reach the 10% goal in 2015. The objective of the assignment for this graduation project is to develop an implementation strategy, which aims to introduce the corporate Carbon Policy to different groups of employees of AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals. While sometimes more information about a subject gives new insights, not everyone needs to know the same things to reach the goals described in the Carbon Policy. The employees of Industrial Chemicals differ from each other in background, work, skills and more. Therefore the employees are divided into six groups who need more or less the same information for their function. Based on the abstraction level and adaptation speed 3 clusters of groups can be formed for which a mutual toolset can be used to create awareness for the Carbon Policy. To embed the Carbon Policy in the organization extra attention has to be paid to the strategy to reach the employees working as operator or maintenance. Because these employees form together with one other group a cluster a more detailed concept for this cluster is developed. Therefore a more detailed concept for this cluster is developed. To embed the Carbon Policy in the organization, the approach of the employees towards their daily work routine has to change. Providing environmental knowledge and awareness does not automatically lead to pro-environmental behavior. The use of the HRM instruments and especially the learning conditions has to be influenced to stimulate behavior change. The choice of the right communication tools and stimulation of the communication climate can create a learning environment for the employees of AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals. Four stages where addressed in the concept From Plant to Plant. In the first stage there is a training in where group Yellow, the plant management team, train group Blue, Operations & Maintenance, by a presentation, an assignment and discussion. The second stage is the possibility to find extra information on the Carbon Policy; work related, non-work related and individual goals. The third stage was the idea phase using the (existing) suggestion box. The final stage is a groups meeting in where group Blue would come together with group Yellow and some (site-external) experts to discuss the different ideas from that location and from other locations. The concept from Plant to Plant was designed to create awareness for the Carbon Policy among group Yellow and Blue. Moreover create the opportunity to learn and develop skills for change of behavior towards a sustainable mindset. From the analysis phase guidelines for the concept were created. The concept From Plant to Plant meets these guidelines. From Plant to Plant gives a basic knowledge about the Carbon Policy among group Yellow and Blue. It creates the opportunity for group Yellow and Blue to extend their learning about the Carbon Policy if wanted. From Plant to Plant stimulates the different variables for change in intention. This predicts that behavior should change among group Yellow and Blue.","Carbon; Awareness; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Buzink, S.N. (mentor); Jakimowicz, J.J. (mentor)","2010","AIMS: Monitors mounted on boom?arms, provide the opportunity to position the monitor to establish an ergonomically optimal way. Unfortunately users are unaware of the ergonomic monitor position and often therefore suffer physical discomfort. The aims of the study were to: establish the ergonomic guidelines for the monitor position in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), develop a product that provides guidance where to position the monitor and evaluate this system during surgical procedures. METHODS: To determine the ergonomic guidelines and the requirements for the system, a literature review and observations of MIS procedures took place. A product was designed that supports users to allow optimal positioning of the monitor for respective MIS procedures. To conduct a usage research a functional prototype was built. RESULTS: Based on guidelines for a physical ergonomic work environment, it is recommended to position the monitor, surgeon and operating field in one vertical plane. The monitor height should be adjusted to provide an average viewing angle of 15º. The developed product is a handheld product that can be connected to the monitor. The product displays the current and ergonomic recommended location of the surgeon’s eyes and the operating field. The OR?assistant repositions the monitor until the location of the surgeon’s eyes and the operating field match with the recommended location. The product usability evaluation is conducted by performing the monitor positioning task with the prototype by OR?assistants. The outcome of the usability evaluation shows that positioning the monitors with the product is easy to learn and straightforward in use. 16 times the monitor was positioned using the prototype during MIS procedures. The monitor position was assessed by 10 different surgeons. The surgeons considered the vertical monitor position to be the correct one. In general, the surgeons preferred a lesser degree of gaze down (10 out of 16 settings), (1 out of 16 settings was considered to be positioned to high, 2 were positioned correctly, 3 no opinion). CONCLUSIONS: The product meets the requirements to allow users to position monitors ergonomically optimal. The product supports positioning the monitor to user preferred gaze down angles as surgeons participating in this study in general prefer a lesser degree of gaze down than ergonomic guidelines recommend.","design; ergonomics; monitor; Minimally Invasive Surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Stappers, P.J. (mentor)","2010","Time management is an essential part of every company, and the amount of energy devoted to keeping a business running smoothly can be surprisingly large. To keep track of the relevant factors there are a variety of management tools available, with different focuses and purposes. Companies tend to use a mix of these tools to fit their specific needs, and also use self-created tools such as whiteboards and checklists. Because time management is scattered over many tools, there is limited flexibility to update a project when something changes. The majority is text and numerically based, which makes them slower to update, and means that people cannot gain an overview of their situation without reading a lot. In the case of designers, the complexity of the situation increases. Most tools are suited to businesses with well-structured processes. This doesn’t match with the needs of designers, who have a less structured process. Expert designers tend to work intuitively, so time plans are followed ‘opportunistically’; only for as long as they are of benefit. Task durations are difficult to estimate, since there is great variation between projects. Also, one good idea can change a whole plan, so the need for a flexible tool is even greater. To have such a tool, that was used consistently, would also mean that planning knowledge could be recorded accurately for use in the future. Primary research conducted at Kiss the Frog Productions B.V. (referred to as KTF) confirmed these assumptions, and revealed deeper insights into what planning factors make a project effective and satisfying to work on. Using the results of this study, a prototype was created for a new time management system. This prototype was tested with four design companies to gain further insights for its development. The end result, TimeTrace, is a living, breathing time planning software for design companies, which gives an accurate visualisation of what is happening with all design projects at all times. The default screen is an overview, showing a visualisation of all projects. This screen is used to create popup windows, which extract the relevant information needed for planning activities, by any person at any moment. All visualisations can be directly manipulated to change the plan, without the need to type in a lot of text/numbers. Information is synchronised to update across the whole system. TimeTrace addresses the problems and insights uncovered throughout the project, and in doing so effects changes to three paradigms of current time management processes: Visual not Numerical: unlike most management programs, TimeTrace does not present project data using numbers. All time-related information is represented through visual proportions, and elements such as people and projects are represented through icons and colour codes. This makes it fast to ‘read’ and flexible to adjust. It is also more in keeping with how people perceive the passing of time; as proportions of their day orweek; not numerical figures. Shared Responsibility: the usual management scheme for companies is top-down; project managers make the decisions. TimeTrace encourages managers to benefit from their employees knowledge, by providing a system that can be contributed to by everyone, and ensures that everyone stays informed. Situational Awareness: Plans are usually used to provide a framework at the beginning of a project, and are intended to be followed as closely as possible, and updated when necessary. For designer, this close following of the plan is not a reality, so TimeTrace instead puts the focus on offering continuous situational awareness. Instead of making decisions based on the initial plan, it is possible to make decisions based on the reality of how the project and organisation is running at any given moment. It stays up to date by doubling as a financial system; when tasks are confirmed for financial purposes, they are fed back into the system and used to renew the visualisations. TimeTrace is also a very important record for the company. It stores all past project information, so that it may be of help in making future plans. Information about the usual duration of tasks is offered as suggestions, when a new plan is being made. It also keeps a record of the typical process of the company; by detailing the main phases and sub-phases of a project, project managers and designers are reminded of the full range of the tool box they can draw on for every project.","interface; time management; project management; information design; situational awareness; software; interaction; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Prins, J.F. (mentor)","2010","In general, for transportation of wheelchairs by taxi buses, so called ‘four-point strap-type tiedown systems’ are used for securing wheelchairs. At four points around the wheelchair self-retracting straps are connected to the vehicle floor. These straps are equipped with hooks which can be attached to various points of the basic geometry of the wheelchair. After attachment the straps are tightened. In 2006, LOCOmotion carried out a research in commission of Sociaal Fonds Taxi on the physical workload for taxi drivers for four different restraint systems, including two variants of the four-point-system. It was found that the driver needs to work in positions that are physically stressful for a large part of the time. For all four restraint systems, frequent bending and kneeling is necessary. In long term this will bring health risks. The goal of this project is to do research on the current wheelchair transportation system and develop a wheelchair tiedown and occupant restraint system that improves the usability and working conditions and reduces the physical workload for the taxi driver. Wheelchair transportation can be considered as a system that consists of three main components; the vehicle, the wheelchair and the securement system. In this system, the securement system functions as the link between the vehicle and the wheelchair; it has to connect these two components to each other. The main problem is that there is still no standard attachment point on wheelchairs, like a towing hook on cars. With the consequence that the securement system needs to be very flexible in order to adapt to the large variation in wheelchair types and brands. A central question in the analysis phase was: How to design a securement system that fits to as many different wheelchair types as possible on the one side, and depends as less as possible on standardization on the other side? From the analysis was found that if new standard attachment points are going to be developed, they need to be detachable, discreet and lightweight. Wheelchair geometry from different kinds of wheelchairs was analyzed and it was found that the frame areas near the suspension of the rear wheels offer the best possibilities for attachment points. A range of height and width in which the adapter could be placed is also necessary, because the variation in wheelchair sizes and construction is too large. By means of user observation was concluded that it is desired to secure the wheelchair from a standing position as much as possible and that manoeuvres around the wheelchair should be reduced as much as possible. In the development of a new securement system a gradual market introduction was taken as a starting point. This implies that the new system will be used next to the current four-point strap-type tiedown system. The attachment points on the wheelchair and the vehicle need to be suited for both the old and new system. Five development directions were formulated ranging from short term solutions like optimizing the four-point strap-type system, to long term solutions like an automated system integrated into the vehicle floor. A combination of two directions was chosen: adapters on the wheelchair that provide the flexibility instead of the securement system and securement from the rear side. Three diverse concepts were developed. The concept that consisted of the idea to pin the wheelchair to the ground with two sticks was preferred and has been further developed. The result is a securement system that consists of two separate clamp units that can be clicked onto the wheelchair from the rear side from a standing posture. The clamp units fit into a crosswise airline track that should be installed into the vehicle floor. A lever on each clamp unit can be pulled to secure everything at once. A three point occupant restraint is also incorporated into the design. The final design proposal has been evaluated on different aspects. A strength analysis was performed to evaluate the construction and a functional prototype was built to test the clamping mechanism and the usability of the system. Considering the system was developed from scratch in only five months time, many aspects for further development were found. The usability can be further improved by making actions such as securing the clamps or detaching the clamps easier. The construction should be more robust to make it better resistant to rough usage and stronger to make it better resistant to impact loadings. It should be noted that extensive testing, by means of crash-tests, will be required in order to make judgments about safety with certainty. Nonetheless it was demonstrated that the clamping mechanism is a feasible solution. The comparison to the four-point strap-type tiedown system showed significant reduction of physical workload and application time. The report concludes with different scenarios for future development. This project illustrates a scenario where each stakeholder is only required to take a small step towards a certain degree of standardization. Wheelchair manufacturers should take small and lightweight adapters into account in their development. An additional advantage is that the adapter can be positioned at any height or width. The car conversion companies should apply crosswise airline tracks in the bus interiors. A separate ramp containing crosswise tracks could be retrofitted to existing buses. Crosswise tracks could also be combined with existing floor integrated systems. Other scenarios will illustrate that if stakeholders are willing to apply a higher degree of standardization, the usability of wheelchair securement systems and the working conditions for taxi drivers could be improved even more.","design; wheelchair; tiedown; securement; restraint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this thesis a method to model and identify the force inducing a vibration on the control rods of a nuclear power plant is verified, but could not be validated. The aim of the method is to be able to predict wear in future nuclear power plant designs. This study is based on a study by Bodel [1], and reviews, adjusts and extents its contents. The liquid coolant in a nuclear power plant, flowing passed the control rods induces them to vibrated, wearing them out at the positions of the guide plates. The method aims to model and identify the fluid forces of the liquid coolant, by looking at the dynamic behaviour of a model of the control rod. With this modelled fluid force, predictions can be made on the wear in future power plant designs. To describe the dynamic behaviour of the model of the rod properly, the mode-shapes of the dynamic system need to be mass normalised taking into account the added mass of the water surrounding the model. After the fluid force is modelled and identified it should be validated by applying it to a model which is closer to the real control rod. By comparing the results to the experimental results obtained on this model, the fluid forces can be validated. The results are however, that the experimental mode-shapes were not well mass normalised by the measurement system and the dynamic system in water could therefore not be obtained properly. By using ‘hand’-normalised mode-shapes the study is continued and the method could be verified. Only the modelling of the fluid force needs to be reconsidered, because it can be shown that the way the fluid force is modelled will not give the desired results. The validation of the fluid forces could not by accomplished, because the more realistic model of the control rod does not function properly. Furthermore, a fundamental problem with the method at hand emerges, when using the Polymax algorithm to identify the fluid force.","fluid force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Campanella, M.C. (mentor); Overmars, M.H. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2010","Due to growing mobility in densely populated urban areas, public pedestrian walkways are becoming more and more crowded. Since space in these densely occupied areas is highly valued, the use of every square meter must be evaluated carefully. Microscopic pedestrian simulation models can provide such evaluation. However, fundamental knowledge on individual pedestrian behavior underpinning these models is hardly available. This study focuses on the so-called interaction behavior between individual pedestrians. It comprises the identification of aspects that influence individual interaction behavior, their effects on pedestrian movement and how these effects can be described and predicted. Assessment criteria and pedestrian experiments In unhindered walking, personal walking capabilities determine the intended path in lateral and in longitudinal direction. Walking outside of this intended path in unhindered walking is defined as interaction movement. Also, the passing side and the extent of evasion from the mean intended path are investigated. The effects of the direction of approach (i.e. bidirectional, crossing and overtaking situations), individual gender and motion pace and small groups on these three assessment criteria are examined. Laboratory experiments have been performed to obtain data on individual pedestrian interaction behavior. In these experiments twelve participants are initially asked to walk a length of 20 meters unhindered by other pedestrians. Thereafter, two or three participants are asked to walk simultaneously, in such a way that interaction between them is provoked. This has resulted in 1586 trajectories of individual pedestrians. Analyses on unhindered walking and interaction movements The unhindered trajectories are used to derive boundaries for the intended path in unhindered walking, mean walking paths and mean walking speeds. In addition, a method is presented to analyze the swaying effect in unhindered walking. It has been shown in this study that the observed step lengths and step frequencies are inversely proportional to each other. It is found that individual pedestrians perform interaction movement in 88% of the interaction situations observed in this study. These movements can be interpreted as some gallantry towards other pedestrians. This finding justifies the detailed modeling of pedestrian interaction movements in microscopic simulation models. In the bidirectional situation pedestrians strongly prefer passing each other on the right hand side. In crossing situations, walking in a hurry increases the probability of passing in front of other pedestrians and meeting a small group of two pedestrians increases the probability of passing at the back of this group. The passing side and the direction of approach mainly determine the direction and the extent of evasion from the individual mean walking path and from the individual mean walking speed during interaction. Pedestrians seem to prefer larger lateral evasion in bidirectional situations and larger longitudinal evasion in crossing situations. Men laterally evade more than women and hurried pedestrians laterally evade more than normally walking pedestrians. It seems that hurried pedestrian are either granted ‘right of way’ or that they take the initiative themselves in an early stage of the interaction process. The extent of evasion is larger when small groups are encountered. Implications for pedestrian modeling and recommendations for further research The observations on pedestrians in individual interaction situations differ in a number of issues from observations on individual pedestrians in flows. This indicates that behavioral reactions of individual pedestrians to other individual pedestrians differ from behavioral reactions of individual pedestrians to pedestrian flows. Moreover, it follows from this study that the passing side determines the ensuing lateral and longitudinal evasion. A conceptual model for implementing this into pedestrian models is given in the attached figure. This model differs from other models since interaction movements are determined based on a decision on the passing side instead of the other way around. Furthermore, hurried pedestrians behave significantly different than normally walking pedestrians and this aspect should thus be modeled. Several aspects regarding individual pedestrian interaction need further research. Among these are the initiation moment of interaction movements and the effects of gender, body size and age on pedestrian interaction. These aspects can be investigated with the observations obtained in this study. The effects of multiple individual pedestrians on the individual interaction behavior (i.e. individual behavior within pedestrian flows) were not investigated in this study. To gain knowledge on these effects it is of interest to analyze whether behavioral reactions of individual pedestrians to other individual pedestrians significantly differ from behavioral reactions of individual pedestrians to pedestrian flows.","interaction; pedestrian; behavior; individual; experiment; walking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis is a part of the CLEMPS (Closed Loop Embedded MEMS-based Precision Stage) project. Within this project a MEMS-stage should be positioned using a feedback (displacement) signal with 10-nm accuracy over a 100 ?m range. This thesis investigates if thermal sensing can be used as a reliable sensing mechanism within the CLEMPS project. Lantz et al demonstrated a promising thermal displacement sensor that achieves nanometre resolution on a 100 ?m range [1]. Using this sensor as a basis, five conceptual designs for thermal displacement sensors are introduced, of which one concept operates in vacuum and four concepts operate in a normal environment. Basic analysis showed that each conceptual design is feasible, except for thermal sensing in vacuum. The designs have large variety in fabrication complexity and estimated performance. The behaviour of the sensors is strongly nonlinear due to dependencies of the material properties on temperature. Different thermo electrical models are introduced that quantify the performance of the designs. Those models are used to gain extensive insight in the behaviour of the sensors and to provide comparison between the performances of the different sensor designs. The models are also applied as design tool for investigating the influence of geometric variations on the sensing performance. Only two of the designs are compatible with the available SOI-wafer based processing. These sensor designs were actually fabricated and integrated within an actuated MEMS stage. For experimental evaluation of the general feasibility of thermal displacement sensing, the thesis focuses on the simplest design. An electronic measurement circuit is designed and fabricated that provides the actuator voltages and performs the differential current-to-voltage amplification for the measurement signal. The mechanical behaviour of the stage is experimentally characterized to determine the relation between the actuator voltage and stage displacement. Now, the (quasi-) static measurement performance of the fabricated sensor can be experimentally characterized by actuating the stage at a low frequency, while recording the applied actuator voltage, the resulting individual heater currents and the differential measurement current in xPC. This data is analysed to obtain the sensor performance in terms of offset, sensitivity, nonlinearity, noise and power consumption. The static measurements are repeated on many sensors to investigate the repeatability and influence of geometric variations. The influence of varying conditions in terms of heater supply voltage, environmental temperature and humidity is determined by performing many characterizations on one device using controlled measurement conditions. Also, the dynamic performance is evaluated in terms of sensor drift, frequency behaviour and hysteresis of the device by using supplementary measurements The feasibility of thermal displacement sensing within the CLEMPS is evaluated using the results on the sensor performance for design IV. Using acquired insight, the performance limiting effects are identified and recommendations for improvements are presented.","MEMS; sensor; thermal displacement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-03-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this paper a new friction model for the pre-sliding regime of dry friction is proposed. Current highly accurate friction models that incorporate analysis of the pre-sliding friction regime are all dynamic models. In these models the pre-sliding regime seems to be underdeveloped. The main focus of the models lies upon the analysis of the sliding regime and therefore they are velocity dependent. In the pre-sliding regime frictional behaviour appears to be a function of displacement rather than velocity. Therefore, the proposed model is a static, position dependent model specifically formulated for the pre-sliding regime of friction. Furthermore, the model is formulated in such a way that it corresponds to the physical nature of friction currently assumed to be caused by adhesion. Therefore, the model is a modified Bristle model where clusters of molecular bonds formed due to adhesion are represented as pliable bristles with a maximum deflection and certain stiffness. For parameter estimation and validation of the model, experiments have been performed by means of a measurement setup. In the experiments, values have been obtained for the system’s initial stiffness and the maximum deflection of the bristles. The experiments show that the order of magnitude of the parameters found, correspond to the expected values. The validation experiments point out that the expected relation between the pre-sliding displacement and relaxation displacement could be confirmed. Furthermore, an expected proportional relation between the systems initial stiffness and normal load on the surface could not be invalidated. The effectiveness of the model was tested in simulations of the experimental data and by comparison to simulations made by other models. The results showed that the new model is more accurate and faster in modelling the pre-sliding regime of friction than the LuGre and Dahl model.","Friction; pre-sliding regime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","Biocompatible design","",""

Minimization of final mass over time of flight is sought. Previous attempts of the Mission Analysis Department at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering to solve this problem using conventional methods were unsuccessful. The goal of this research is to investigate alternative methods to model and solve the GTOC2 problem. The assignment has been divided into three consecutive parts. The first part concerns the asteroid selection and sequencing, the second part assesses the phasing characteristics of the selected sequences and the last part concerns the exact trajectory determination. For the asteroids selection and sequencing two methods will be investigated, being the Nearest Neighbor Heuristic and the Branch- and Bound Method. Both methods will be applied to three different search spaces. For the second part, an orbit model based on exponential sinusoids will be developed. Each part of the trajectory between two different bodies will be modeled by an individual exponential sinusoid. Unfortunately, the timeframe of this research and the quality of the results of the second step did not permit an analysis of the third part of the assignment. Nevertheless, an advice can be formulated for future analysis of the GTOC2 problem. Although the best results are obtained by the Nearest Neighbor Heuristic, results also indicate that an improved Branch- and Bound Method will most likely provide better results. The continuous solution method, based on exponential sinusoids, proved to be unable to perform an accurate phasing assessment of a given asteroid sequence.","Trajectory; GTOC; Asteroids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-05","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space missions","",""

Such image quality assessment metrics average the predicted quality across a whole image into a single quality value. To improve their performance, their predicted image quality is weighted with visual attention information: regions in the image that receive more attention are weighted more heavily in the quality assessment. Furthermore, the effect of a quality assessment task on visual attention is investigated via a large scale subjective experiment. The main findings are that 1) people who are looking freely pay more attention to the region of interest than people who are scoring the image quality, 2) applying the visual attention of people who are looking freely to image quality assessment metrics yields a higher performance gain than the visual attention of people who are scoring the image quality, and 3) the predicted image quality in the region of interest has a more positive influence on the overall predicted image quality than the quality in the background.

The aim of this system is to provide real-time feedback to the practitioner about the anatomical structure in close vicinity of the drill bit. Therefore, the system has to deal with in vivo, in situ bone tissue, bone tissue within a living organism that cannot be removed from the human body for analysis. Hence, non-destructive biopsy is desired. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging is able to provide optical biopsy at a high resolution and in real time. With the use of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), e.g. blood vessels, nerves and sinuses close to the drill can be detected before the drill bit does damage to these vulnerable anatomical structures. Silicon process technology offers a promising platform for a relatively cheap Time-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (TD-OCT) system. A first step into the direction of a single-chip TD-OCT system is the development of a thermally excited Optical Delay Line (ODL) or Thermo-Optical Delay Line (TODL). This thesis project is dedicated to the characterisation of the TODL in order to find the voltage excitation waveform that results in a linear variation in effective optical path length. By making use of the models, non-linearites can be compensated and the limited bandwidth can be extended by pre-emphasis of the voltage excitation waveform. Two models are presented, based on the general heat equation for conduction. One model utilizes Fourier analysis to solve the heat equation and is a linear model by definition. The second model uses numerical methods and is able to incorporate non-linearities, such as relations for thermal conductivity, diffusivity and the variation of the refractive index of silicon as a function of temperature. Measurements are conducted to verify the modeling. The linear model has been shown to perform poorly. The non-linear model was able to compensate for the non-linearities mentioned. However, first results showed that the TODL was behaving slightly slower than expected. The non-linear model was corrected for this behaviour by scalling down the relation for thermal diffusivity. The corrected non-linear model achieved a linear variation of the effective optical path lenght over a scanning range of 200 ?m at a line scanning rate of 10 kHz.","optical delay line; optical coherence tomography; non-linear modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Sodoyer, B.R. (mentor); Cimiano, P. (mentor)","2010","Before a shopper converts into a buyer there are a lot of steps to be taken. In each of these steps a portion of shoppers discontinues their purchase and the remaining part finalises the transaction. The conversion ratio is defined as the number of shoppers that finalise their transaction in com- parison to the number of shoppers that start a transaction, expressed as a percentage. Because Adyen handles the payments, it is an important part of the process. Chapter 1 states the main goal of the project as to gather information about the course of the payment sessions of consumers buying at on-line shops and explains why off the shelf solutions like Google Analytics are not feasible. In this chapter three sub-goals are defined. 1. Live data feed for merchants. 2. Data for marketing material. 3. Form a basis for an article. Next technologies that are currently in place are analysed. First the infrastructure of the Hosted Payment Pages (HPP) is discussed in Chapter 2 and how Skins can be used to customise the appearance of the HPP. Finally the difference in the payment flow between the Multi Page Payment (MPP) and One Page Payment (OPP) is explained as well as the information that is currently included in the log files. In Chapter 3 the problem is analysed and the main question for the project is defined as: ”How to measure and present the Conversion Ratio on the Hosted Payment Pages?” To answer this question the process is decomposed in five distinct steps. 1. Log the required data. 2. Make the logs machine readable. 3. Centralise the log information. 4. Store the data. 5. Visualise the data. This decomposition is applicable for a generic logging framework. As such, the individual steps, which are treated in subsequent chapters, start with a generic part and end with a project specific part. In Chapter 4 the flow of events within a payment session is analysed. With this information additional data to be logged, like the IP address of the shopper, is determined to produce rich statistics. Finally the validation of payment sessions through state machines is discussed. Chapter 5 discusses various logging formats ranging from CSV files to directly logging to a database. These formats are compared as how useful they are when read by a machine to detect interesting patterns as well as how readable they are for humans in case of an error. Before a format is chosen, the file based formats are tested on how well they perform when being parsed. An optimal solution is to simultaneously log to a database for pattern recognition and log to CSV in case an error occurs. With the logs available in a suitable format the information has to be gathered on a central system. Chapter 6 considers two possible centralisation strategies that can be used. After the two strategies, file transfer and database replication, have been analysed, they are evaluated with regard to load balance, network capacity and security. Database replication is considered to be the preferred strategy to be used because it spreads the load more evenly over time and the mechanism is built into the database system. Chapter 7 talks about how the data is stored once it is available on a central location. First a generic approach is discussed that can be applied to logging in general where a distinct split is made between the log4j part and the application specific part. Then a conversion specific approach is taken which handles data extension, aggregation and validation. Finally an additional aggregation step is discussed for performance enhancement. As the statistical information is now stored the data needs to be visualised in a intuitive way. First several use case are discussed in Chapter 8. To be able to handle with more use cases a template framework is developed which can contain multiple chart types. Next the statistic types are discussed that enable specific calculations to be performed for a specific statistic and hide the data processing from the templates and chart types. After that the user interface and the structure behind it are examined. Finally the extendibility of the system is outlined together with performance enhancements. Chapter 9 covers software quality and testing. Initially unit tests were developed to test an important building block of the system, the state machines. With the unit tests written a code coverage analysis is performed to see how well code is covered by tests. Because of some imper- fections in the logging, not all logged sessions adhered to the state machines while they were in fact valid. For these sessions to be taken into account some shortcuts were added to the state machines. Regression testing enables these sessions to be used while still preserving the quality of the software by explicitly testing for these sneak paths. In Chapter 10 the conclusions of Chapters 4 through 8, regarding the five distinct steps in the process, are consolidated. After that, conclusions are drawn about the three sub-goals as outlined in Chapter 1. Regarding the live data feed for merchants the project has been successful. Merchants that got a glance of the user interface during development were very enthusiastic about the possibilities the system gives them. The goal of providing data for marketing material also has been met. On multiple occasions during the development, sales employees used the statistical data and its graphical representations as a Unique Selling Point to show Adyens expertise in the payment process. During the project a basis has been formed for a newspaper article, as well as a scientific article, thereby fulfilling the third goal. The newspaper article concerns the conversion ratio of PayPal payments. PayPal does not perform as well as other (localised) payment methods in the Netherlands, while introducing higher costs. A scientific article can be written on the basis of the generic logging framework and the preparations that have been made during this project for this framework. During the process, a broad range to topics was touched but not all could be researched within the scope of the project. In Chapter 11 several recommendations are made for topics that should be investigated further. These topics include the creation of a generic logging framework that can be used throughout the platform as well as system that allows merchants to upload multiple Skins and compare the results. Finally more research can be done on pattern recognition to improve the rate of successfully reconstructed sessions as well as the creation of a generic framework to measure performance throughout Adyen’s platform on multiple levels. In order to be feasible, all of these frameworks should be highly scalable to cope with large amounts of data. They should also be generic enough to be applied on multiple levels, ranging from the application level to a platform level.","conversion ratio; conversion; hosted payment pages; logging framework","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","","",""

(mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor); Soons, F.A.M. (mentor)","2010","Currently there are 20,000 to 40,000 yachts in Kuwait. The majority of these yachts is stored on land because the number of berths in Kuwait is not sufficient to accommodate them all. Besides yachts, there are approximately 1,000 fishing vessels in Kuwait. The facilities for fishermen are not of sufficient quality. To overcome these problems, the Kuwaiti government initiated the development of a master plan for 9 coastal havens on Kuwait coast. Kuwait is located at the northeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordering Saudi-Arabia and Iraq and lies on the northwestern shore of the Arabian Gulf. The emirate covers approximately 20,000 km2 and has a population 3.5 million inhabitants. The coastal havens need to facilitate fishing vessels, yachts, public transport vessels, vessels from the national authorities and incidentally vessels that take refuge in one of these coastal havens. Besides the possible locations of the havens, the demand and need for these facilities is an important aspect. The yachting demand potential gives an indication of the expected development in demand of the yachting industry up to the year 2030. There already is a need for berths in Kuwait at the moment. The master plan accounts for 6750 berths in the year 2030, an increase of 4750 berths in 25 years, and a small increase in the number of fishing vessels in Kuwait. The master plan contains recommendations for the proposed development directions and functions that have to be allocated for all coastal haven locations. The complexity of the concept of a coastal haven lays within the fact that it has to facilitate yachts, fishing vessels and somewhat larger vessels at the same time. The facility must be multipurpose to some extent, but other aspects must be kept separate in order to provide all users in their needs and meet their expectations. The design requirements and criteria are applied to one coastal haven location and are translated into three layout alternatives for one coastal haven location. The layouts are evaluated with two hydraulic models. These models simulate the wave propagation from an offshore data point into the wave conditions within the coastal haven basins. The modeled wave conditions are those that occur only once during the life of the coastal haven. The layout has to be such that it can protect the vessels from these conditions. During the modeling it is concluded that the layout needs to be such that the basins are relatively closed off. The acceptable wave height within the coastal haven is very limited, because damage to the yachts and speedboats used for fishing is not acceptable in a coastal haven.","Kuwait; Coastal haven; Master plan; Nikas; Yachting; Fishing; Port of refuge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-03-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","This graduation report describes the design of a new connection between watch-string and watch-casing. The project was carried out for Kedtrade, and under supervision of the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. Kedtrade sells Kyboe watches; this report is mainly based on the Giant 55 watch; a large colorful watch with a diver appearance. In the current situation it is quite difficult to replace the strap; a T-bar must be unscrewed and removed. The casing is big the screw very small and the risk of scratches is very large. A connection without tools would be appreciated. Several existing connections are examined and have based as inspiration. Important factors for the new design where: avoid unintended release, straps only replaceable when the watch is not worn around the wrist, easily replaceable by the user and no mayor changes in the appearance of the watch. When embellish the watch the risk of damage must be avoided. Several ideas are drawn what has resulted in 3 detailed concepts. The first concept is based on a removable pin fixated in the middle of the strap. The second concept works with squeezing handles placed at the wrist-side of the strap, not visible at the lugs. The third concept has a push button at the wrist side of the strap and is also not visible at the lugs. Finally is chosen for the first concept because of its simplicity and reliability. Weight was also decision-making adding to much weight to a watch that already weights almost 200 gram makes the watch very uncomfortable. By pushing a knob the pin that is placed through the strap and the lugs can be released. A tool that is included when selling a separated strap can be used to make removing of the pin more easy. The tool can be used as key ring. The final design is a safe connection between casing and strap only visible at the wrist side of the watch. This new design makes it easier to sell straps separately because the user can easily change the straps their self. For consumers the Kyboe watch could be more attractive because of the option to change the straps.","watch; connection; strap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","The Delft Geothermal Project is an ongoing study in search for the best way to produce renewable energy from the Delft Sandstone Member. So far, a homogeneous reservoir model, a study of the regional geology and a study of the fluid flow and heat transfer have been made. For these studies, information is used from the Moerkapelle oil field located twelve kilometers to the east of Delft. Because of the oil production there, a wealth of subsurface data is available. This thesis used for the first time borehole cuttings data from the well DEL-03. DEL-03 is less then one kilometer away from the proposed drill site. The aim of this thesis is to discover vertical heterogeneity within the Delft Sandstone Member with a sediment-petrographical analysis. With the use of thin slides of the cuttings of DEL-03 a sedimentary analysis has been made using a polarizing microscope. It goes more deeply into mineralogical content and cement types. Examination of the cuttings with fluorescent light and chloroform proved the absence of residual bitumen, which is a needed for the production of hot water. Also a grain size analysis has been made which was inconclusive. The content of sandstone in the borehole cuttings analysis does not correspond with the results of the spontaneous potential log of DEL-03. Siderite present as cement in these sections is the cause of this contradiction. The siderite cement has a high influence on the porosity and permeability which is also concluded in the petrographical study of thin slides of plugs of MKP-11. Porosity is detected with the use of the software Image Analysis while the permeability is calculated with the Karman-Kozeny equation. The porosities in the upper part of the Delft Sandstone Member beneath Moerkapelle showed relatively high values and therefore a relative high permeability. The results of this thesis can be used, together with the many images gathered, as a database for a heterogeneous reservoir model.","Delft Aardwarmte Project (DAP); cutting analysis; heterogeneity model; image analysis; Delft sandstone","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Applied Geology","",""

The IR drops can be reduced by using large wires which negatively impacts the global routing. Thus to provide proper supply voltages, on chip DC-DC converters are designed. The purpose of this project is to design an on-chip DC-DC converter targeted for System on Chip (SOC).

People with a partial hand defect miss fingers and sometimes part of their hand, they do have a functioning wrist. There are already many types of prostheses on the market, but there is no suitable prosthesis for the target group. The existing prostheses were studied to determine which development direction was preferable. It was decided to develop a wrist driven prosthesis, because of the high amount of remaining and additional tactile feedback. People with a partial hand defect are not able to grasp all objects and perform certain tasks. To gain more insight in the types of grasp the users need most and objects they would like to grasp, patients, therapists and instrument makers were interviewed. The interviews led to the following project goals: 1. Offer a prosthesis for as much patients as possible with various personal preferences and types of defects. 2. Make the appearance of the prosthesis either natural or mechanical and preferably offer both options. 3. Cover as little of the stump as possible. 4. Improve the patients grasping possibilities as much as possible. 5. Sensory feedback of both stump and prosthesis should be as high as possible. First developmental step was the ideation. The ideas were evaluated on the project goals and by the patients, therapists and instrument makers. This led to the decision to go on with the idea of developing ‘low power fingers’. The ‘low power fingers’ were optimized using a morphological chart. Further development resulted in 2 concepts with differences in appearance and working principle. Both concepts were evaluated on project goals by a Harris-profile. ‘The finger alternative’; a bar-driven, non-human appearing design was chosen. This design was optimized into a final producable product. The most important innovation in this phase was the application of Rapid Manufacturing for the production of the fingers. This is a promising technique for prosthetic production, where low batch sizes are common. A prototype was build and was tested by a person with a partial hand defect. The user-test showed the pinch force is around 40% of the pinch force of the human hand. Some adaptations can be made to improve comfort. The final design functioned properly during the test and offers added value to the lifes of people with a partial hand defect.","design; prosthesis; prosthetic; partial hand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design, Master specialisation Medisign","",""

A contextual research has been done in what way people plan their daily lives, how they experience this and how an information service could support them in planning daily life. The research had lead to the design direction: Development of an event calendar service that triggers people to take part in activities. An interaction vision has been defined in order to achieve the goal: triggering people to act spontaneously. From here the concept has been generated, by performing two brainstorm sessions. The user was also involved in the detailing phase, conducting a user test using paper based prototyping.","event; calendar; contextual research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-03-03","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this thesis we present an FPGA software/hardware co-design for the CABAC decoder. CABAC is the Context-based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding used in the H.264/AVC video standard. This standard gives better compression effciency, but with greater complexity and implementation cost. A large part of this cost comes from the CABAC entropy coding. The CABAC coding has a tight feedback loop between the binary arithmetic coding stage and the context modeler stage of the coding process. This means that the video stream has to be coded in a sequential way. We attempt acceleration of the CABAC decoding process in a fashionable way on dedicated programmable hardware. An FPGA implementation of the CABAC entropy decoding process is used in co-operation with the decoding software on a Xilinx Virtex 4 platform. Actual synthesis results show that our approach results in a fast and compact implementation, targeted at the state-of-the-art FPGA devices.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Louter, P.C. (mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor)","2010","Due to the increasing demand of transparency in buildings, it is no longer unusual to apply transparent elements into the bearing structure. Glass is a strong but very brittle material, which means safety is rather problematic should it break. Safety is an issue that has to be improved before glass can be considered suitable for structural elements. Earlier studies have shown that reinforcing glass beams will provide reasonable residual load-bearing capacity, which could provide this safety. Glass fibre is suitable as reinforcement material when the transparency is regarded as important. In February 2009 at the Faculty of Architecture at Delft University of Technology, P.C. Louter designed and tested a laminated glass beam with embedded glass fibre rods. The bonding interlayer consisted of SentryGlas foil, developed by DuPont and often applied for lamination in hurricane-resistant windows. The results were promising and the concept showed high potential for further research. The study of this thesis project is focussed on improving the concept of embedding reinforcement in laminated glass beams.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

An innovation challenge being experienced by Philips Healthcare is tackled by looking closer into the front end process of the company. Based on a literature review and a comprehensive case study; the theoretical and practical views are explored and evaluated. A critical success factors methodology is generated and used to assess the front end innovation process. Eight critical success factors are identified using a contextual innovation management approach. A simple self-assessment tool is introduced to incorporate CSFs in the front end innovation process. The findings are used to provide recommendations to Philips Healthcare to improve its front end innovation process. The contextual CSF methodology and self-assessment tool proposed in this study can also be adopted and used for different settings","innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","TSE","","MOT","",""

The goals of this project are to create a platform aimed at supporting a new iterative game development paradigm, improving collaboration within studios, automating trivial tasks, supporting project management and improving the overall workflow. The solution we came up with is a framework that has a modular design and was built with usability in mind. Different components are created to facilitate the different goals for this platform. Together, these components form a solid framework to further build the Cannibal Game Development Platform on.","collaboration; games; development; cannibal","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wauben, L.S.G.L. (mentor)","2010","In the field of colorectal anastomosis the occurrence of anastomotic leakage is a main problem. The risk of colorectal resections lie within the post-operative complication anastomotic leakage, which is very dangerous for the health of the patient. Anastomotic leakage occurs between 2% and 24% of all patients and mortality rates can be as high as 33% [1-2]. The cause of anastomotic leakage is not clear, but technical insufficiency is considered to be one of them [2]. In this respect, the handwork of the operator (i.e. the way the anastomosis is made) is a crucial factor to minimize the chance of anastomotic leakage. This Master thesis contributes to predicting the likelihood of anastomotic leakage. In this respect, per-operative information of the anastomosis in the operative note will be provided in this thesis as per-operative information is a valuable source for predicting the likelihood of anastomotic leakages. In this respect, the workflow in the OR, the colorectal resection, the way of generating the operative note, the market of surgical cameras and the medico-legal issues have been analyzed with literature and user researches. This analysis contributed to the formulation of the design goal: To design a system that visually records critical moments of the open operation colorectal resection, for physicians on the hospital ward in order to deal with post- operative complications more adequate and may research anastomotic leakage better. The created concept idea is a system where the operator can make per-operative images (i.e. photo or film) of critical events and can add audio comments to these images. Post-operative, the operator will generate a digital operative note with the help of speech recognition software. Finally, the note exist of text embedded with the per-operative images. The conceptualization of this system is divided in six design steps (i.e. tests). The focus of the optimization lies with the two main parts of the concept idea: the type and usage of camera (i.e. endoscope) and the user interface for the note-generating software. The design steps are conducted according to different research methods as among other things tests and observations in the dissecting room and the OR, and interviews. The outcome of these design steps had an impact on the workflow of the operating team and the requirements of the concept idea. This impact was documented in a workflow with requirements scheme. The final concept, DigiNote Production System, exits of five parts: scope, peripheral equipment, local and main hospital server, DigiNote, and protocols. Two scopes can be used to film the anastomosis around: a video scope for hand sutured, high anastomoses and a flexible scope for all stapled and low anastomoses. Furthermore, DigiNote is a software program where per-operative images can be embedded into the operative note to provide more information to the physicians on the hospital ward and to researchers. To conclude, the results of this Master thesis suggest that it is possible to provide more per-operative information of the anastomosis in the operative note. The results of the tests showed the possibility to film the anastomosis and ability of DigiNote to embed per-operative images into the operative note. However, DigiNote Production System is still in the concept phase, more research need to be done in the OR on the usage of the scope and on how to implement the peripheral equipment of the DigiNote Production System in the OR, on the OR department, and at the hospital ward.","Black box; operative note; imaging; flexible scope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""
