(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor); de Vlugt, E. (mentor)","2012","This study quantifies and explores the nonlinearities of human arm responses to large force perturbations while subjects (n=10) performed either a position or relax task. Continuous perturbations with large variations of amplitude levels (RMS values of 2.5, 7.5, 22.5 mm displacements) and pulse perturbations with large amplitudes (average of 16 cm displacements) were applied at the hand by a 2-DOF robotic manipulator. Linear multivariable identification techniques were used to estimate the endpoint mechanical admittance from the continuous perturbations. The admittance is the relationship between force input and displacement output. Reflexive and intrinsic parameters of a 2-DOF linear arm model were fitted onto the estimated endpoint admittance. This model was used to predict the pulse perturbations. In particular, we determined to what extent human arm displacements in response to large amplitude force pulses can be predicted from identification of continuous perturbations with small amplitudes. Results showed that the estimated admittance for the relax task is a factor 18 larger compared to the estimated admittance for the position task. For the position and relax task, the estimated admittance respectively decreased with a factor 1.5 and increased with a factor 3.8 at the largest perturbation amplitude compared to the lowest amplitude. For the position task, this effect probably resulted from adaptation to the perturbation. The nonlinearity observed for the relax task might be well explained by nonlinear muscle properties such as the short range stiffness. On average, model predictions underestimated the peak displacements in response to the pulse stimulus by a factor 1.7. This shows the need to include nonlinearities in models for pulse shaped loading conditions.","nonlinear arm pulse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Tempelman, E. (mentor)","2012","Vietnam’s economy is largely agricultural, with rice being the most cultivated crop. Apart from the rice itself, being the most important food source in Asia, the production also creates a great amount of waste. Currently, this ‘waste’ is simply burned on-site since that is the easiest solution for the farmers to get rid of it. However, the low quality combustion at low temperatures creates polluting smoke and leaves most material only partially burned. As a result, rice waste burning is one of Vietnam’s main environmental concerns. Rice husk has proven to be a valuable energy source for cooking in the rural area’s of Vietnam. With the application of a technique called gasification, an improved cooking stove was developed that can reduce indoor air pollution, which is one of the major health issues in developing countries. Furthermore, gasification reduces the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), and takes away the need of buying the relatively expensive coal that is often used for cooking. This is replaced with rice husk or other biomass, which is easier to access for people in those regions. Moreover, the residual charcoal from the gasifier (also called biochar) is a very good fertilizer and a source for soil restoration. The objective of the project was improving an existing proof of concept in terms of convenience and performance. During a 3 month period in Vietnam, the most important values and parameters of the stove were established by means of applied research. It was determined that the target group would benefit from sufficient cooking power, cooking time, and clean emissions. Observations also assessed that the proof of concept should be improved in terms of safety and convenience. This led to three different concepts provided with a premix-burner, from which one was chosen to be used for the new gasifier-stove design. The detailing included calculating the most important dimensions and specifications of the gasifier stove by analysing the chemical process of gasification. Initial tests with a prototype burner were carried out to check the influences of different parameters. Finally all results were transferred into the creation of 3D CAD model. Using this design as input, an almost identical prototype was made. The success of the project was verified by comparative testing of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emissions , accompanied with a user test and evaluation.","gasification; stove; rice husk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-04-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","DfS","",""

The choice of refurbishment as the best solution for that is investigated. For the needs of the project, a case study was used, carefully chosen to be representative and of common detailing, so the solutions proposed can be implemented to more buildings. The criteria for the refurbishment measures that were investigated were mainly: not extreme costs, comfort for the residents during the construction and the possibility to generalize the solution for more buildings. CAPSOL models were created for the calculation of the heating demand in the exiting situation and the refurbishment solutions. The result of this modeling was that the building has to be fully refurbished in order for it to achieve both high thermal comfort and low heating demand. Passive measures, like second skin façade and closed-off balcony, work better than external insulation, especially if they are south oriented. The greenhouse gas emissions were calculated both form the heating demands and by calculating the embedded energy of the materials used in each refurbishment solution. Again, the passive measures were more efficient because glass and steel are much less environmentally-costly materials than aluminium frames and external insulation. Also, geothermy played an important role in reducing the emissions greatly.","building envelope; facade; postwar buildings; greenhouse gas emissions; thermal comfort; heating demands; refurbishment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Nowadays, people make use of communication networks (e.g. Internet) everyday and expect high quality from the offered services. Providing a good quality of service and optimizing the utilization of the network resources are the main objectives in designing a routing. It has always been believed that traffic demands play an important role in this design because the better the traffic demands are known, the more properly they can be allocated. However, understanding and estimating these traffic demands is not a trivial task. In 2002 Räcke asked himself an important question: ``how important is accurate knowledge of traffic demands for obtaining good utilization of the network?"" This marked the beginning of a new kind of routing algorithms: the demand oblivious routing algorithms or oblivious routing. These routing algorithms ignore the current status of the network when making routing decisions and they only base their decisions on the source, destination of the flows and, in certain cases, some random values. These kind of algorithms have evolved a lot during the last years in three different directions. Nevertheless, according to the knowledge of the author, there has been no study until now that evaluates the performance of algorithms from these three branches. Firstly, this thesis will present a complete and exhaustive study based on the three papers that originated the different kinds of oblivious routing. Then, a framework will be developed to compare these three algorithms under the same conditions and with a range of metrics from theoretical calculations to more practical ones. Finally, based on the results obtained, possible improvements for these families of algorithms will be suggested.","oblivious routing; routing algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Network Architectures and Services Group","","MSc.

(mentor); Sonneveld, M.H. (mentor)","2012","The goal of the study was to explore new possibilities for enriching the user’s television experience. The goal of the study comes from the phenomenon of changing human-product interaction concerning the interaction and experience between user and television. The focus in this study is on a group of young urban professionals who just started their professional careers and have an interest in innovative products. The television as a product has been changed over the years and will be changing even further due to technological innovations. The interaction between user and TV has evolved over the years from a social gathering towards an individual activity in which the user decides what the content is and when it is watched. The social deterioration is taken over by the rise of social media networks. Instead of face to face communication stories, experiences and opinions are instantly shared by means of social media. Media becomes social, and communication is media. Development of other intelligent devices such as smartphones and tablet computers makes the TV a part of a network of interrelated products that have an impact on the context of use of the television as such. Devices are interrelated which enables accessible cross-communication and interaction between devices. Context mapping is used as a method to create a detailed frame of user values, needs, and dreams. The results are used to formulate four different and possible concept directions that all respect the needs of the target group. During this study the concept directions “Focus/Ambient” and “Public/Personal” are explored. The first direction focuses on the TV as an object to focus on shifting into a background element. The second direction explores the possibilities of shifting the TV as a public device towards a personal device and vice versa. Both elements are captured with the Pico concept which is a concept that enriches the user’s TV watching experience by providing background lighting embedded with an intelligent, automated and personalized messaging service related to TV content. The concept is evaluated with the target group using focus groups resulting in recommendations for Vogel’s Products to do research in optimizing the concept for a full acceptance of the targeted group of users. The concept validation showed several valuable elements: a system or product should learn from the user, not vice versa, the product should fit user demands seamlessly, the product should be able to be personalized, and the product should offer the user freedom and control.","gesture control; picoprojector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The surveillance sensor type was a decisive aspect in this conversion, due to stringent requirements on position and velocity accuracy for effective conflict probing. Based on the results it was concluded that, within certain constraints, the envisioned implementation was technically feasible. For the implementation, a system-independent platform is designed with connectivity and data presentation designed independently from MASE. The proposed system architecture comprises a separate, stand-alone computer which captures the ATC display and uses a video overlay to add the conflict probes. To compute the location of the conflict areas, a real-time feed of track information is required, which was available in Eurocontrol´s ASTERIX standard at the Royal Netherlands Air Force Air Operations Control Station Nieuw Milligen.

Laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the influence of grain stress on the sand erosion process. In order to carry out these experiments a high pressure radial flow cell has been developed. Inside this flow cell, oil was injected into a compressed sand pack and produced via a single perforation. During this process the sand pack was scanned using a X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. Experiments were carried out at different confining pressures between 30 and 100 bar, using both oil and water as pore fluids. CT scans have revealed that the erosion process does not change when different grain stresses are applied. However, different erosion patterns were observed for experiments with the two different pore fluids. In both oil-sand and water-sand experiments a cavity was observed at the periphery of the sample. Although it could not be visualised using the CT-scanner, calculations have shown that a “weak zone”, must have developed between the injector and the producer before a cavity became visible.","CHOPS; oil; production; CT; erosion; sand; experiment; weak zone; cavity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering and Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor); Mulder-Pol, M. (mentor)","2012","This study is performed as part of the project ‘Jouw Energie Moment’, which is initiated by Enexis to support the energy transition that is about the start. This project takes place in the ‘Muziekwijk’ in Zwolle, the Netherlands. If one looks at the future energy supply, the expectation is that both the amount of sustainable electricity and decentralised production will increase. The risk of using sustainable sources is that they do not deliver a constant supply of energy. If this is combined with the increase in electricity demand and when the supply is not synchronised with this demand, capacity problems will arise. To solve this problem, ‘Jouw Energie moment’ aims to shift the electricity use of consumers to a different moment in time, and therefore reducing peak loads on the distributions networks. The goal of this study is to deliver an interface design for the energy computer that aims at changing electricity consumption patterns, by using social awareness based incentives. This energy computer uses the medium of a tablet PC, and is fixed in the homes of the future habitants of the ‘Muziekwijk’. In this study, a solution is presented which followed from an iterative design process. The current market consists of multiple devices that enable the user to gain insight in their electricity usage. The energy computer as initiated by Enexis differentiates itself by going one step further, aiming at a permanent behaviour change. Not only in using less electricity, but focussing more or shifting electricity use. To gain most results, this study focused on how to change the behaviour of the women of the ‘Muziekwijk’ by using social awareness based incentives. During the analysis multiple problems were examined. First the interface should find a way to break the current patterns of the user. Secondly, the interface should offer the user the ability to change their behaviour. Also the user’s level of motivation to change a behaviour should be high enough. When the ability and motivation are there, a trigger should be placed to make this behaviour happen. Furthermore the interface should help the user to build a context for his/her own actions by showing what other users are doing and how well they perform, as followed from the definition of social awareness. At last, the interface should follow the rules of persuasive technology. From the analysis key elements were established. The first function of the energy computer is social comparison. The interface enables the users to compare their actions to a self-chosen group, which establishes a social norm. The second function is goal setting, which is combined with the social comparison element to stimulate the users even more. The third function is the introduction of a community, which is based on the self-chosen group. Furthermore the interface functions as a trigger, by sending the user a text message at the right moment. The last function is the one of expert advice. To test the function of a triggering text message in relation to social awareness, a small study has been performed. From this study it became clear that the long-term effect as well as the social component is hard to test in a short time span with people that are unfamiliar to each other. This is a critical remark to the results other previous studies, which also tried to investigate this subject. With the aforementioned elements a prototype of the interface has been set up to perform a usability test. From this test, points of improvement were derived. These points were adapted in the prototype so the final design could be presented. This final design can be used by Enexis to test whether a behavioural change can be seen, by testing the design in the second year of the project ‘Jouw Energie Moment.’","interaction; interface; electricity; energy; design; behaviour change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Bijlaard, F.S.K. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Rodenburg, J. (mentor)","2012","Introduction A tensile-compression ring structure is derived from the spoke wheel principle. The general shape of the ground plan of a regular football stadium, which is more oval or rectangular shaped, is in contradiction with the spoke wheel principle. The goal of the thesis is to investigate the use and attractiveness of the spoke wheel principle for football stadia Research The thesis consists of an analysis and design component. The spoke wheel principle for the use for bicycles and for roof structures have been analysed. By designing a roof structure more insight is gained and conclusions can be made regarding the use of the spoke wheel roof structures for football stadia. Analysis The strength and stiffness of the wheel depends on the amount of ring action in the structure. When a tensile load acts on the ring, the ring becomes compressed and ring action arises. This principle can be applied for roof structures. The more ring action can be provided, the more efficient the roof structure will become and more material will be saved. The amount of ring action in a spoke wheel depends on four key factors: strength of the ring, loads, translation and curvature. To come to a design, the influence of different design variables on the key factors have been investigated. Design For the study of the use of the spoke wheel principle for stadia roof structure, two types of roof structures are investigated: Non-pretensioned spokes In a spatial truss system beam action will play an important role in the total stiffness of the roof structure. By directly transporting the loads to the ring elements that possess sufficient curvature, the ring action is used at full extend. The results confirm that the efficiency of the structure increases. By optimizing each single element in the roof structure, using parametric modelling, a lot of material can be saved. Pretensioned spokes A cable structure is not able to provide stiffness by beam action. The stiffness of the roof structure depends on the amount of ring action in the structure. The results showed that the reference stadium possess not enough curvature to provide an efficient spoke wheel roof by means of a cable structure. Further research is needed to use the available ring action at a greater extend for cable roof structures. Conclusion Research showed that a spoke wheel roof structure is an attractive type of structure for stadia use. The amount of curvature in the roof is crucial whether it is possible to come to an efficient structural design. When there is a lack of curvature a spatial truss structure is able to provide extra stiffness to the roof. Cable structures are very dependent from ring action, it is advised to use this type of structure only for roofs that possess curvature in the complete roof. To increase the application of the cable roof structure more research is needed.","tensile-compression ring; spoke wheel; stadium; roof structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","This project is conducted on behalf of American Today, a Dutch fashion retail company with 59 stores in The Netherlands, Belgium and France. They offer American college style clothing for guys and girls and state that they are “young minded”. Their mission is to make easy comfortable clothing available for students and everybody else who identifies with student fashion and style. My graduation project is about the trying on of clothes within the America Today stores. Many people dislike the process of trying clothes when at a major fashion store. There are several reasons for this discomfort. I enhanced the conventional shopping experience by improving the user experience during the fitting process. This was achieved, not by creating a new fitting room, but by designing a new experience. By making it more comfortable and fun, people will have more of a reason to return to the store and try on clothes. This will in turn lead to an increase in revenue as 67% of all people that try something on in the store end up buying it. To create the new experience the ViP method is used, this resulted in distinguishing 4 different shopping types (See figure/diagram at center of poster). These different types led to 3 new concepts. The concepts are innovative and fit the brand image very well. Concept 1 The interaction vision for type 1 is: “like backpacking through Europe.” This means that he/she likes to stop and look around a lot, thereby trying out different things. To help this person I encourage them to have small fitting sessions on the shop floor. The concept contains a sign to activate people, a hook to let people hang their own clothes on (like a jacket) and a little stool to put some belongings on (like a backpack). By stimulating people to try out “on the way”, it is more likely that people will try out more items. Concept 2 Type 3 prefers to get an honest opinion from other people. To help this person during the fitting process I developed a concept that is focused on asking other “fitters” what they think about their creation in a subtle, spontaneous manner. The concept contains an interactive mirror inside the fitting room that allows you to take a picture of your outfit and instantly send it to the interactive mirrors in the other fitting rooms. The other “fitters” are then able to respond, by choosing from a list of pre-set comments. This concept lets customers get in contact with each other and seeing each other’s creations can lead to impulse sales. Concept 3 Type 4 likes to shop together and finds the opinion of their friends the most important. Their interaction vision is “like going on spring break”. This group experiences shopping as fun and enjoyable. The concept is an America Today Promotion Tour that creates parties at student dorms. In this way the target group gets to know America Today and America Today can observe their target group in their natural environment.","Retail; Design; America Today; Fitting room","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Visch, V.T. (mentor)","2012","Yearly 5.6% of all hospitalization in the Netherlands are caused by improper use of medication. 46% of these hospitalizations (19,000) could be avoided, which could save 85 million euro each year. One of the forms of improper use is medication non-adherence, which means taking the medication not as prescribed (prescribed dosage and moment of the day). The assignment of this project is to design an ICT tool which increases the motivation of patients who have had a myocardial infarction, in order to increase the medication adherence. The tool sHearet is designed, which is an extra feature to Google Plus. The project exists out of three phases: to find the problems regarding medication adherence, designing the tool, and the evaluation of sHearet. The first phase is to research the current situation of the patients and to find different theories about motivation. These results are used to choose a design direction. For the research 36 participants filled in a questionnaire, six myocardial infarction patients and two health care professionals were interviewed, and various articles are used. Important results of the research are: patients prefer to have personal contact, information and the feeling of being understood; patients who are aware and afraid of the consequences are more medication adherent; social support works effectively to change behaviour; and being confronted regularly with their medicines makes it easier to remember to take the medication. With input of the results the following design vision is created: By designing an extra feature to Google Plus for myocardial infarction patients, I want to create health awareness to motivate myocardial infarction patients to be medication adherent. This feature will create interaction through social networking by sharing knowledge and experience mainly between fellow patients, in order to create awareness on their health. The second phase focuses on designing the tool sHearet. It is an extra feature to Google Plus, where myocardial infarction patients can share knowledge and experiences with each other. The functionalities of sHearet are: setting up a goal and filling in results, find and read shared message (which are labelled in different categories), contact an expert or professional of the sHearet help-panel to ask a question, chatting with fellow patients, and adding fellow patients to the patient’s circle. sHearet was evaluated in the last phase by five patients, three health care professionals and three Google Plus users. They have given feedback on the idea of sHearet, their prediction whether it would increase their health awareness and medication adherence, the usability (after using the demo version of sHearet), and feasibility to implement it on Google Plus. The conclusions are that sHearet is useful for the myocardial infarction patients (and relatives). Especially during the rehabilitation period to talk with fellow patients, and to read and share experiences and information. sHearet fits into Google Plus in terms of the look and feel of Google Plus and is feasible. And to increase the usefulness, and the health awareness and medication adherence, information about different subjects has to be placed on sHearet. The prediction of the patients and health care professionals is that sHearet probably can increase the health awareness and medication adherence, but additional research is required to measure this improvement.","social network; medication adherence; myocardial infarction patients; awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2012","Dead code is source code that is not necessary for the correct execution of an application. Dead code is a result of software ageing. It is a threat for maintainability and should therefore be removed. Many organizations in the web domain have the problem that their software grows and demands increasingly more effort to maintain, test, check out and deploy. Old features often remain in the software, because their dependencies are not obvious from the software documentation. Dead code can be found by collecting the set of code that is used and subtract this set from the set of all code. Collecting the set can be done statically or dynamically. Web applications are often written in dynamic languages. For dynamic languages dynamic analysis suits best. From the maintainability perspective a dynamic analysis is preferred over static analysis because it is able to detect reachable but unused code. %Via dynamic analysis all unused files are visualized in a tree map in which you can click the boxes to open them like you open directories in an ordinary file explorer. Also an Eclipse plug-in is developed to reduce the impact of existing dead code to the development process before removing it. In this thesis, we develop and evaluate techniques and tools to support software engineering with dead code identification and elimination for dynamic languages. The language used for evaluation is PHP, one of the most commonly used languages in web development. We demonstrate how and to which extent the techniques and tools proposed can support software developers at Hostnet, a Dutch web hosting organization.","dead code elimination; software maintenance; web applications; PHP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wijntjes, M.W.A. (mentor); Salters, B. (mentor)","2012","Current ""Philips"" practices include development of physical environments in which luminaires can be tested with the user. However ""Philips"" is also interested in virtual prototyping and thus is turning towards identifying a number of features in 3d environments which influence the human perception of realism. This study utilizes traditional psychophysical analysis to investigate the effect of object induced clutter and its connection to the perception of visual realism in 3d renderings. This project goes beyond the identification of pre-perceived common trends and reveals the actual perceptual value of clutter according to the perceived realism that it brings to virtual scenes. This project strives to define and manage clutter and its affect on the sensation of visual realism in renderings. The project begins with the hypothesis that: “The amount of clutter of objects strongly affects the perception of realism in 3d renderings.” During the development of this project this assumption is thoroughly tested and the needed conclusions are drawn according to the findings that are made. The design of the series of tests in the perceptual experiments is governed by the need to create the large sets of images scaling the clutter features as accurately as intended. These sets are comprised of photographs and renderings or only renderings. The software and hardware used to create these images are chosen to most accurately serve the goals of this experiment and create a project environment in which the participants can better focus on the features of the experiments. The project itself is comprised of 3 perceptual experiments. For the first experiment of this project renderings and Tone Mapped HDR photographs are compared and the effect that the number of objects in them has on their visual realism is shown. For the following stages renderings are compared between each other and unlike the first experiment where the focus is on the number of objects these contain items varying in angle and placement. Thus this project includes a total of 4 participant test stages which test the effect of the number of object, the placement and the angle shift which we argue are the 3 features definitive to object clutter. This study concludes that on the basis of the experiments made clutter did not affect realism greatly. Despite the fact that there is a proven small and consistent rise in realism with the rise of the clutter, that rise is not affected by either the number of objects or their placement in the scene but only by the variable of angle shift. Angle shift under the conditions in which this project took place proved to have a greater effect on the visual perception of realism than the other features of clutter. This was consistent over the samples of the last stage, which we believe is the most detail revealing for the entire project. However, the small difference leads us to believe that the perceptual value the angle shift brings to the visual realism of scenes could be even smaller in a none test environment. Thus an overall conclusion that clutter does not affect the perception of realism greatly is drawn. For professional luminaire designers we believe the current project can serve as a demonstration to what the actual perceptual value of clutter is, while still minding the fact that the resources spent in projects are in most instances case specific. For virtual prototyping of luminaires the outcome of this project points towards a defened simplification of the scenes used. As the number of object in the scene does not greatly contribute to the perceptual value of the renderings we believe that 3d scenes can be stripped off objects inside them and thus made quicker, with less skill required and eventually rendered faster. However we stay far from trying to stipulate that adding any objects to 3d scenes is pointless. This is as besides the actual perceptual value some objects in 3d environments obviously also carry other values such as for instance the artistic. These are yet to be quantified. Nevertheless it is arguable if these are of importance to luminaire prototyping. Still, if we believe that this is the case, it is also questionable what objects should be chosen to be most informative for the characteristics of the luminaires and if not chosen by this criteria then in what way are they contributive to the rendered environments and virtual luminaire prototyping.","clutter; virtual realism; computer graphics; virtual prototyping; light design; 3d objects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","DE (Design Engineering)","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The focus for this thesis work is on one of the most important bottle neck of microalgae harvest process: microalgae dewatering, by CFD modeling of the flow and sedimentation separation in Evodos SPT centrifuge. Various microalgae dewatering technologies have been reviewed and evaluated. Compare to traditional conical disk centrifuge Evodos SPT centrifuge provides 10% to 20% energy consumption, removing up to 95% extracellular water and other benefits i.e. mechanical simplicity and process flexibility etc. In the model, the fluid dynamic behaviors of multiphase flow has been considered. In this research a complete 3D CFD model of the Evodos centrifuge consisting of five sub components have been built. The particle behavior for the centrifugation separation is based on DPM (Discrete Phase Model) in Fluent. The result of the 3D CFD model gives a clear overview of the pathline, flow pattern and pressure profile inside the centrifuge as well as separation efficiency on particle sizes. The model has been validated through visual result from algae separation test runs, theoretical equations and starch test run measurements. A test and sample taking with starch solution has also been carried out on Evodos site in Breda. This thesis work laid a good foundation for future studies in the CFD modeling of Evodos SPT centrifuge and similar machines. The future focus should be on optimizing the geometry of the parallel plates, impeller chamber for separation efficiency; understanding the effects and impacts of operation conditions and further develop the multiphase model.","sustainable; micro algae; dewatering; CFD; sedimentation; Evodos; SPT; centrifuge; parallel plate; flow field; flow pattern; discrete particle model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","PEQ","",""

(mentor); De Kruif, J.W. (mentor); Loot, D. (mentor)","2012","For this graduation project the assignment was given to design of a new concept for rear lighting for bicycles of Koga. This thesis describes both the process as the design itself, to give the reader the important insights gained at the process of this graduation project or just a quick but detailed look at the final design. Process The strategy used for the process is an approach based on common design methodology such as the ‘Delft’s Innovation Model’ as teached at the faculty of Industrial Design in Delft. These methods have proved to be very efficient to come up with new designs. Divergation and convergation in each phase creates efficient progress in the design process. The Analysis exists out of three main sections, an internal research, an external research and an synthesis of all the results. In the Internal Research, all the aspects concerning the company itself and where it stands for are researched, in order to obtain a clear view on the company related to the assignment, and conclude helpful directions for the design process. Koga has a healthy history, with strong core values. They want to broaden the targetgroup including more younger people as well, instead of having mainly elderly users for their most sold segments. Product portfolio and current rear lights leave many possibilties for improvement of the lighting, with possible collaborations with several manufacturers. The External Research consists of all the useful aspects related to the assignment that are not directly connected to the company. Together with an Internal Research it can provide a complete overview of aspects, leading ultimately to a logical design direction. The bicycle lighting industry shows gradual developments over the years, main priority stays the safety aspect. The most promising new technologies include light guides which can be used in combination with LEDs. New concepts show innovative positioning and new assistive features. In the synthesis all the previous parts and their conclusions are regarded to conclude a logical and promising design recommendation. This part contains the summarizing of the important and apparent parts of all the subconclusions in the internal and external research. Next to that, an overview is given of a possibility for the expected steps that will happen in the bicycle lighting industry. With the insights together with the projection a clear reasoning will be apparent for the design recommendation. With the design recommendation, a list of specific product demands and wishes can be described that belong to this direction. The synthesis is the means to fluently slide the Analysis phase over into the Idea generation phase. It resulted in a four-point design direction, that reflects on each aspect related to rear lighting. “Create an unique Light Design on base of the use of LEDs, optic Lightguides, and the hub dynamo wiring system. Reach innovation and distinguishment by positioning, form and the possible containment of adaptive and assistive, but functional features.” Within the concept phase three sections are made, the ideation part, the conceptualization part and the concept choice. In the ideation part word brainstorming and topic sketches were used to come to new ideas. It was then decided to use hierarchy, positioning, functions and light design as subjects to divide the main design direction in a subpart with each a clear outcome. This outcome meant for the hierarchy a visual integration, on carrier or fender position. To come to innovative function a tool was created to overview all possible new innovations regarding to rear light design. The best new function that fits that demands and wishes was selected, this is the new innovative function positionlight. With the section light design the latest technologies in light were used to select the use of light guide coupling in a 3D light line element. With this outcome of ideation, the 6 concepts were created. Each was built up from parts that were selected in the previous phase. With an official presentation to Koga, the direction for the Shoulder position on the carrier, with a reversed spoiler shape light line and the positionlight function was selected to continue with. The development phase then continued with the design optimalization. A working prototype proved the realization of the design was possible. The user testing proved that the added function of the positionlight has actual value, for brandrecognition as well as added safety. The position and direction of the cycler with positionlight are more clear to other traffic than without. A final evaluation to the process and the final design took place to take another look at the made the decision, concluding with a satisfying result. Design A design pitch including the details, assembly, cost estimation and final recommendations describes all of the named topics briefly, to give the reader the deep insights and details laying behind the design, and creating the needed overview for one’s interest. The design sketch on the front page partly shows the final design including the light functions.","design; light; bicycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-04-23","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Damage to nearby building could occur if settlements become too large. A reliable damage prediction model is necessary too asses the risks of damage to tunnel induced settlements. A widely used method for damage prediction is the Limiting Tensile Strain Method (LTSM). The LTSM models a masonry building as a weightless, isotropic, linear-elastic, rectangular beam on 2 supports. Although the LTSM is an easy method to use, it has its limitations. For facades for instance the perforation of the wall, which introduces weak spots in the wall and reduces the stiffness, is neglected. In this project the applicability of the LTSM in the case of facades is studied to improve damage predictions in the case of facades. A case study is performed to examine the response of facades in the Daniel Stalpertstraat due to settlements caused by the tunnelling process of the North/Southline. This field data is used to find a calibrated 2D numerical model of the facades. The calibrated numerical model is then subjected to larger settlements to obtain the behaviour of the facades at large settlements. Using linear and nonlinear analyses of the numerical model it is evaluated how accurate and how conservative 4 damage prediction models are. The first two LTSM models were examined: the standard LTSM model with E/G=2.6 and one with E/G=12.5. Based on the findings in the linear analyses also two models based on conventional beam theory were examined for their applicability: portal frame model and Forget-Me-Not model. With linear analyses it is checked how reliable the methods are in terms of strains and deformation under the imposed settlements. With nonlinear analyses the conservativeness of each method in terms of damage is evaluated by comparing the crack with found I the numerical model to the crack width calculated with the damage prediction models. The LTSM with E/G=12.5 gives the best results according to linear numerical analyses results. The LTSM with E/G provided the same curvature and shear distortion as found din the numerical analyses, the strains were approximated with 90%. The Forget-Me-Not model shows the best results according to the nonlinear analyses results. At large settlements this model provides the same results as found in the nonlinear numerical analysis results.","tunnel; settlement; LTSM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

Furthermore the governmental and municipal urban planning bodies suffered from sectoral fragmentation and general lack of resources and capacities. Haiti’s economy is vulnerable; dependent on imports, informal employment and exploitation of the already damaged landscape. This thesis makes a proposal for an urban planning method for the Port au Prince metropolitan region, focused by a viable economic intervention based on the life-cycle of a sustainable building material. It integrates the short-term reconstruction efforts with the long-term development objectives, providing opportunities for sustainable urban development in Haiti. In a joined study of three master’s theses, the production, manufacturing and use of local sustainable building material was identified as an opportunity for sustainable development in Haiti. This potentially addresses all spheres of sustainability: social, environmental and economic sustainability. A database of building materials meeting the requirements was set up. Each thesis then took one phase of the life-cycle of one of these building materials as a basis for further research. In this thesis, the introduction of endogenous manufacturing is used to focus a strategic spatial planning process for the Port au Prince metropolitan region. The manufacturing of two materials was further researched, of which the manufacturing of rice-straw panels proved most promising. The ideal location of manufacturing facilities for these panels was studied via mapping using GIS of relevant indicators. The results from this part of the research were used in the development of a strategic spatial planning approach for the Port au Prince metropolitan region; mapping conflicting land-uses and designing potential spatial outcomes. A detailed collaborative planning approach was developed for one case study. Strategic spatial planning is capable of stimulating sustainable urban development by integrating short-term goals and long-term objectives, especially when a crucial issue like economic development is used to focus the process. When executed as planned, the result is believed to be more than an urban development strategy; the decision making process is altered such that more stakeholders are involved and institutional capacity is build.","Urbanism; Strategic Spatial planning; Haiti; disaster; urban metabolism; resilience; endogenous production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Emergencies","",""

(mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Langedijk, W.P.J. (mentor)","2012","Bridges offer great potential for the use of high strength steel grades (HSS). The main advantages are generally a result of reduced weight and cross-sectional dimensions. Design stresses can be increased and plate thickness may be reduced, resulting in significant weight savings. Reduced plate thickness can also save on welding costs as well as on fabrication, erection and transportation costs. Simplified structural components and construction techniques are often possible, particularly for large structures, and foundation costs may also be reduced due to lower dead weight. High strength steels can be delivered as quenched and tempered (Q&T) or as thermo-mechanically controlled processed (TMPC). In the first case, high strengths can be achieved with minimum yield strength up to 1100 MPa, which can lead to considerable weight savings, while in the second case moderate strengths (min yield strength up to 500 MPa) accompanied with excellent weldability are possible. Especially quenched and tempered high strength steels may offer big weight savings when used for bridges. However, quenching and tempering production method poses limitations to the product length. The most economical and efficient use of Q&T steels is in members stressed in tension where the high strength can be fully exploited, and in projects where dead load is predominant (e.g. long span bridges). In compression they are most effective in heavily loaded, stocky columns or in stiffened compression elements where buckling is not the controlling criterion. Furthermore, hybrid steel girders are more economical than homogeneous girders. Hybrid steel girders are welded girders with different steel grades in flanges and web (usually high strength steel for the flanges, e.g. S550 or S690 and mild steel grades for the web, e.g. S355). Higher steel grades (e.g. S690) are usually applied in steel members and/or in bridge regions with very high static stresses in order to reduce the cross sectional dimensions and plate thicknesses of these members. As a result the overall steel self-weight of the bridge will be reduced leading to a more economical design in comparison to the case where the same (equivalent) design is made out of mild steels (e.g. S355) only. This study aims to present the potential advantages that high strength steels (HSS) have to offer in case of bridges, but also possible disadvantages. Special attention is being paid to high strength steel grades up to S700 (700 MPa minimum yield strength) in quenched and tempered condition as they are expected to offer maximum weight savings. This thesis is divided into two main parts (Part 1 and Part 2): In Part 1, a literature survey is initially performed (Part 1A) based on scientific documentation and relevant sites found on the Internet. Its purpose is to collect information from previous studies, experimental projects and fabricators, utilizing HSS for application in bridges, around the world. Then in Part 1B, a long span (L= 105 m) roadway bridge is chosen as a case study (the ‘Schellingwouderbrug’ in the Netherlands) and preliminary designs for three bridge types are presented (a single box girder bridge, a warren type truss girder bridge and arch girder bridge with vertical hangers). High strength steel S690 with minimum fy = 690 MPa is applied in members with very high stresses (e.g. chord members in the truss bridge) and S355 everywhere else (hybrid design concept). The design criteria that have been studied are strength, stability and fatigue. In Part 2, the preliminary design alternatives are compared on a cost basis (based on calculated steel self-weight and required maximum plate thicknesses) and one is chosen and designed in more detail. It is then checked, by estimating total costs, whether the hybrid design with high strength steel grade S690 will lead to a more economical bridge solution in comparison to an equivalent homogeneous (completely out of S355 steel grade) bridge design. European standards have been used throughout the whole design phase. Comparing costs between the two hybrid alternative designs (for the same bridge type) and their equivalent homogeneous designs, it has been found that the developed hybrid designs (combination of S355 and S690) for the ‘Schellingwouderbrug’, result in significant weight savings in comparison to their equivalent homogeneous (only S355) bridge designs (even up to 65% in some cases). The high price for S690 (currently ?70-75% more expensive than S355) leads to higher material costs (up to 4% higher) for the hybrid designs. Nevertheless, the weight reduction in hybrid designs has a positive impact on the reduction of total costs (up to 6% lower) including fabrication, transportation, erection and maintenance costs.","bridges; high strength steel; hybrid design; economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bokel, R.M.J. (mentor); Icibaci, L.M. (mentor)","2012","The event of the earthquake on January 12 2010 in Haiti has caused in a disaster which has shocked the world. It resulted in an estimated amount of 250.000 casualties and left over 1.000.000 people homeless. From these numbers it is clear that Haiti needs to become more resilient to hazards to prevent in a future repetition of this disaster. A study into Haiti’s history and present day situation shows that the disaster was not a result of a single problem. Multiple problems affect the country and not all can be solved by one research. That is why this research will focus on reigniting the Haitian building industry in a sustainable way by the production and application of building products produced with locally found or grown raw materials. Through this approach jobs will be created, the environmental degradation will be stopped and solid wastes diminished because of sustainable resource management. The choice of which building products will be produced focuses on the applicability within the local building industry which is in turn determined by the materialization of the buildings. The design of the buildings has failed in providing a safe and comfortable environment. The design of the built environment has to be changed into a climate responsive design which is resilient to hazards. We should design with the climate instead of against it. The results of the research will be tested through a design for a high density urban neighborhood of Haiti. The design will be evaluated on specific indicators from the resilience and sustainability theory and compared with the existing situation and another design solution from NGO’s. The evaluation shows that the climate responsive design, with a materialization of sustainable building products, diminishes the solid waste significantly at the afterlife of the building from 40% to only 6%. The design provides in a thermally comfortable indoor climate by the implementation of only passive means. The design has proven to be resilient to future natural and man-made hazards and will prevent in disaster. The research question is whether the Haitian building industry can be used as an economic growth stimulator to develop the country in a sustainable way. If the design of the thesis is implemented to cope with the urban growth of Port-au-Prince over a time period of 50 years, 9.124 housing blocks are needed. The demand for building materials will be immense: nearly 5,8 million ton. This demand will create jobs and increase the purchasing power of Haitians which will increase the wealth. The research proves that there is a huge potential for the building industry to be an economic growth stimulator and develop Haiti in a sustainable way. The development will be even more stimulated through a climate responsive design of the built environment which is resilient to hazards.","Haiti; post-disaster; climate responsive; sustainability; resilience to hazards","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-24","Architecture","Building Technology","","Green Building Innovation","",""

(mentor); Hermans, W.J.A. (mentor)","2012","In Den Haag huisvesten zich drie categorieën organisaties: de Rijksoverheid, de internationale instituten van recht en vrede, en de bedrijven. In tegenstelling tot de eerste twee categorieën, zijn bedrijven minder besproken in literatuur. Verder is de privaat-publieke relatie interessant, en maakt het onderwerp vergelijkbaar met andere steden. Den Haag staat met Amsterdam en Rotterdam in de top drie op het gebied van bedrijfsvestigingen en de beroepsbevolking. Het onderbelichte Den Haag heeft op deze gebieden relatief veel bedrijven in de primaire en quartaire sector, maar doet niet onder in de secundaire en tertiaire sector. In het rapport wordt een periode van de afgelopen ruim twee eeuwen onderzocht. Ontwikkelingen uit deze eeuwen zijn deels terug te zien in de huidige stedelijke structuur. Stedenbouwkundige plannen van gemeenten en huisvestingsplannen van bedrijven hebben een cyclus van enkele decennia. De kennis van het verleden is nodig om de huidige situatie en bijkomende problematiek te begrijpen. Bedrijven hebben steden nodig, en steden hebben bedrijven nodig. Bedrijfshuisvesting staat in een publieke omgeving, en heeft hier invloed op. De gemeente streeft naar een versterking van de economie en de verbetering van het ondernemingsklimaat. Toch stroken de huisvestingsstrategieën van bedrijven en de ontwikkelingsstrategieën van steden het ene maal wel en het andere maal niet. Den Haag is hier geen uitzondering op. Problemen in de stedelijke structuur ontstaan nadat bedrijven willen groeien met de huisvesting, en de situatie mogelijk wijzigt (Vande Putte, 2009b, pp. 35-36). De hoofdvraag die volgt uit deze probleemstelling, luidt: Hoe heeft de huisvesting van bedrijven in Den Haag zich ontwikkeld, en welke gevolgen voor Den Haag zijn te verwachten door de stedelijke ontwikkelingsstrategieën van de gemeente en de huisvestingsstrategieën van grote bedrijven in Den Haag? Vele Nederlandse steden hebben zich concentrisch en rond een nederzetting op een dam of aan een rivier gevormd. Den Haag is aan een duinrand opgericht door graven. Door de strandwallen die evenwijdig lopen aan de kustlijn, is de structuur van Den Haag rastervormig. Dit heeft geresulteerd in wegen die evenwijdig aan, of loodrecht op, de strandwallen liggen (J. Van Rijn, 2011). De bedrijfshuisvesting is ook aan deze structuur gerelateerd (Pols, Van Amsterdam, Harbers, Kronenberger, & Buitelaar, 2009, pp. 28-33). Na de industriële revolutie, de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de crisis in de jaren ’80 zijn grootschalige hervormingen waar te nemen bij de stedelijke ontwikkelingsstrategieën van Den Haag en de huisvestingsstrategieën van Haagse bedrijven. Vanaf de Woningwet in 1901 heeft Den Haag actief de stedelijke structuur gepland. Hierbij was ook de bedrijfshuisvesting opgenomen. Bedrijven groeiden en verhuisden in de 20e eeuw door nieuwe (technische) mogelijkheden en veranderingen in de wensen. Van de conflicten zijn de resultaten over het algemeen niet direct zichtbaar in de stedelijke structuur. Synergiën resulteerden daarentegen veelal in realisaties en zijn daardoor direct zichtbaar in de stedelijke structuur. Kort na de industriële revolutie, de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de crisis in de jaren ’80 is relatief veel bouwactiviteit in Den Haag geweest op het gebied van bedrijfshuisvesting. Vooral de grotere bedrijven hebben een uitgebreide en duidelijke huisvestingsstrategie, en zijn meestal in kantoorgebouwen gehuisvest. In Den Haag zijn de olie-/energiemaatschappijen, verzekeringsmaatschappijen, telecombedrijven en de autobranche sterk vertegenwoordigd (Verberne, 2011). Dit zorgde voor de keuze van de volgende bedrijven om dieper onderzoek te doen naar de bedrijfshuisvesting: AEGON, Nationale-Nederlanden, Koninklijke KPN NV (KPN genoemd), en Royal Dutch Shell (Shell genoemd). Deze bedrijven hebben, op het gebied van hun huisvesting, synergiën en conflicten met de gemeente Den Haag gehad. De wensen van het bedrijf en de mogelijkheden die de gemeente bood, hebben tot een ontwikkeling geleid. Het zijn vier grote, internationaal opererende bedrijven, en daardoor niet representatief voor de gehele bedrijvigheid in Den Haag. Wel kan bevestigd worden de industriële revolutie, de crisis in de jaren ’30, de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de crisis in de jaren ’80 een belangrijke rol speelden voor ook deze bedrijven. De huidige crisis heeft noemenswaardige invloed op de ontwikkeling van de bedrijfshuisvesting van deze vier bedrijven. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de huidige crisis, net als de industriële revolutie, de crisis in de jaren ’30, de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de crisis in de jaren ’80, tot grote hervormingen zal leiden voor de stedelijke ontwikkelingsstrategieën van de gemeente en de huisvestingsstrategieën van de Haagse bedrijven. Vlak voor en tijdens de huidige crisis kunnen al hervormingen worden opgemerkt. De stedelijke ontwikkelingsstrategieën van de gemeente Den Haag zorgen voor een meer bereikbare stad, en een groei van belang en aantrekkelijkheid van de Centrale Zone. Daartegenover zullen functies die extensief grond gebruiken plaats moeten maken voor functies die intensief grond gebruiken. De huisvestingsstrategieën van bedrijven in Den Haag zorgen voor een minder groeiende druk op de infrastructuur. Door de focus op de Centrale Zone zullen de gebieden hierbuiten sneller leeg komen te staan (met goed bereikbare locaties als uitzondering). Voor vervolgonderzoek kan aanbevolen worden om dienstverlenende bedrijven in andere steden te onderzoeken. In Den Haag kunnen industriebedrijven en bedrijven in Scheveningen onderzocht worden. Deze bedrijven hebben andere doelen en daardoor andere gevolgen voor de stad. Een nieuwe visie van de gemeente is samenwerken op provinciaal niveau, waarbij Den Haag deel zal uitmaken van de Zuidvleugel. Hoe de ontwikkeling van huisvestingsstrategieën van bedrijven in Den Haag hierdoor wordt beïnvloed, is een interessant onderwerp voor nieuw onderzoek. De invloed van Het Nieuwe Werken op de bedrijfshuisvesting in Den Haag kan bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling van deze nieuwe visie die vele bedrijven hebben. Ook vragen bedrijven kwalitatief hoogstaande (kantoor)gebouwen, en kan een onderzoek naar wat dit precies inhoud bijdragen aan een gewenste vastgoedvoorraad. Uit dit onderzoek bleek de Centrale Zone een belangrijk middel te zijn van Den Haag voor de bedrijfshuisvesting. Nieuw onderzoek naar de wensen van de bedrijven, in combinatie met de vergelijking tussen de Centrale Zone en een concentrische stadsstructuur, kan de gunstig werkende aspecten aan het licht brengen. Evaluatie van de sturingsmiddelen laat zien dat de sturingsmiddelen van bedrijven het vertrouwen hebben in de gemeente, de flexibiliteit, de beheersvorm, relocatie en centralisatie effectief zijn om de gevolgen op de stad te sturen. Op de manier dat bedrijven hiermee omgaan, kan dit een positief of negatief effect op de stad hebben. Sturingsmiddelen kunnen op eigen initiatief ontstaan, zoals erfpacht, bereikbaarheidsprofielen, functiemenging/-scheiding, toplocaties en Centrale Zone van de gemeente Den Haag, en eigendomsvorm en flexibiliteit van bedrijven. Vertrouwen in de gemeente is een noodzakelijk aspect en een verhuizing van een bedrijf kan eigen initiatief zijn (centralisatie) of uit noodzaak door druk van de gemeente of overheid. Wanneer strategieën mogelijk voor problemen kunnen zorgen, kan bepaald worden welke potenties de situatie heeft. Van de genoemde sturingsmiddelen leiden de meeste tot een verhuizing van het bedrijf, waarmee leegstaand vastgoed wordt achterlaten. Leegstaande kantoren maakt een gebied minder levendig en draagt niet bij aan de leefbaarheid van de stad. Onder bepaalde voorwaarden kan een leegstaand gebouw echter herbestemd worden, of kan het gebied een functiewijziging ondergaan.","real estate; Den Haag; strategie; stedelijke onwikkeling; bedrijfshuisvesting","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Corporate Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor); Vijverberg, T. (mentor); Cozzoli, F. (mentor); Van Prooijen, B. (mentor)","2012","Lake Markermeer is a large and shallow freshwater lake in the center of the Netherlands. The lake was originally part of the Zuiderzee, a sea inlet of the North Sea. The lake is an important ecosystem, especially for water birds. The main problem in Lake Markermeer is the decreasing ecological value. High turbidity levels are believed to be one of the reasons for the alarming ecological state. Wind-induced waves easily stir up the bed sediments due to the shallowness of the lake. Next, a layer of soft mud is present at the bed that is easily resuspended, especially the oxidized top layer. The goal of this study is to discover the effect of crawling and burrowing animals, so called ‘bioturbation’, on the erodibility of bed sediments in the lake. The effect of bioturbation was studied by performing erosion experiments on several mud samples with and without biota. Biota was obtained by sieving the natural top oxidized layer, Tubifex worms and Ostracoda were the main biota found. The defaunated sample was created by by gamma radiation. The U-GEMS microcosm was used for the erosion experiments, a combination of a central suction and rotating disk provides a uniform bed shear stress on the sediment bed. A series of experiments was performed for every sample; erodibility was tested at the start and after a bioturbation period of 2, 4, 6 and 8 days respectively. The results showed that bioturbation indeed increases the erodibility of the mud. Erodibility increased after n days of bioturbation, while for the control experiment, the defaunated sample, erodibility decreased after n days. The results also showed that the effect of bioturbation on erodibility is a function of time, the total eroded mass increases with increasing bioturbation period. The effect of bioturbation on erodibility was shown for the soft mud layer and also for the Zuiderzee deposits, the stronger mud layer below the soft mud layer. Moreover, observations showed that bioturbation increases the thickness of the oxidized top layer. However, the oxic state of the sediment is not responsible for increased erosion and can only be used as an indication for bioturbation history. An important bioturbation mechanism is the production of fecal pellets by Tubifex worms, these worms feed at a certain depth in the black anoxic layer and produce easy erodible fecal pellets at the surface. Another noteworthy observation is the erosion type, decreasing erosion rates were observed for increasing shear stresses, this indicates that erosion is limited by the amount of sediments that is available for erosion. From this research we can conclude that bioturbation is an important mechanism influencing the erodibility of bed sediments in Lake Markermeer. We hypothesize that bioturbation is an explanation for the high erodibility of the oxidized top layer and bioturbation have also enhanced the erosion of the stronger Zuiderzee deposits, thereby creating the soft mud layer. However interpolation to the field is rather difficult, though a causal relationship has been demonstrated, this does not necessarily imply that bioturbation-induced erosion is a dominant mechanism.","Bioturbation; Markermeer; Erodibility; Cohesive sediment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2012","The need to analyze and optimize the large and complex structures, locally and globally, and have knowledge of local and global dynamic, has induced the notion of Dynamic Substructuring. In the course of time several DS techniques are developed from which some are mainly based on experimental routine. They are known as experimental DS and assemble measured and analytically derived substructures in the frequency domain. In order to advance, compare and classify the experimental DS theory and technology a test bed (Ampair 600 wind turbine) is initiated by the substructuring focus group at the Society for Experimental Mechanics. Based on this idea the Engineering Dynamic workgroup at Delft University of Technology has started his program which runs through couple of iterations before the Ampair 600 is completely analyzed. This thesis concentrates on the first iteration in which attempt is done to combine three blades with the hub. The emphasis is on the Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS) in general and Lagrange Multiplier Frequency Based Substructuring (LM FBS) and experimental modeling techniques in specific. First DS is introduced followed by FBS and LM FBS. The LM FBS formulation for both coupling and decoupling are given and typical difficulties associated with experimental DS such as rigid body dynamic, coordinates incompleteness (the lack of Rotational Degrees of Freedom), noise and inconsistency are underlined and some methods are proposed to tackle them or minimize their influences. The notion of interface loading is adopted and applied using a fixture which mass loads and stiffens (rigidifies) the interface. The fixture is a chopped off version of the actual joint. As consequence the joint stiffness and damping are included in the models after removing the fixture by means of LM FBS decoupling technique. To model the Cyclic Symmetric Structures (CSS) two methods are proposed which seems to contribute to consistent and robust experimental modeling. One produces models from measurement data and the other one lumped models. Both construct models which are defined in the local coordinates of the interface nodes. The assembly results of four coupling variants according to LM FBS are given, validated and evaluated. It is shown that using regenerated models, particularly when the structures are too complex, results in wrong prediction of the assembled system. The results of the best two coupling variants are more discussed in details and their eigenmodes up to 185 Hz are indentified and visualized.","dynamic; substructuring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Berghauser Pont, M. (mentor)","2012","Like many other cities in Europe, Wroc?aw in Poland aims to improve the livability of children by implementing sustainable urban mobility measures, but fails to be successful. Due to an ongoing outflow of families from the city to the periphery and region, a vicious circle of an ongoing increase in car use has occured which increasingly threatens the livability of children. Because the travelling distances have increased, many children are not able to overcome their distance constraints anymore, which forces them to travel by car. That is why in this project the need for children to travel by car to school has been measured and reduced, to create a situation in which future measures to improve the livability of children can be effective. The analysis shows that from the 75767 children in the age between 3 and 15 years old that were living in Wroc?aw at the end of 2005, 12573 ( 16,6%) were reliant on the car to travel to school. This means that in case every car trip would carry 1,5 child, 16.000 daily car trips need to be made, which explains the high demand on space for cars in the city. By the implementation of strategic interventions, the amount of daily car trips that need to be made between the homes of children and schools can be reduced with 7.000. This means that many future sustainable urban mobility measures can be implemented effectively. However, to relocate schools and to provide new schools, the precondition needs to be met that housing will be developed in areas where the exploitation of schools is not (yet) profitable. Unfortunately, Wroc?aw’s planned housing development areas are not similar to the areas where development is preffered. The consequence is that many interventions in the spreading of schools, which are mainly responsible for the reduction in daily car trips, in practice cannot be realized. This means that not only the current reliance on the car is likely to remain in tact, but even more important that the future reliance on car use is likely to increase. And thus, future sustainable urban mobility measures are likely to become ineffective as well, which makes it likely for the livability of children in Wroc?aw to remain threatened. To become a child friendly city, Wroc?aw needs to implement an integrated strategy of sustainable urban mobility measures and land use development, which is based on the spatial requirements of children. Because the development of housing in the city has been market driven, the specific demand that children put on their living environment has not been protected. As a result, many housing areas have been developed where children are not able to overcome their distance constraints and therefore need to travel by car to school. To prevent a further increase in the need for children to travel by car, Wroc?aw needs to take a more active role in the development of housing in the city, whereby clear choices need to be made for the location and design of new housing projects.

(mentor); Melles, M. (mentor)","2012","Competitive Memory Training (COMET) Many patients in mental healthcare suffer from low self- esteem. Low self-esteem can increase the severity of a mental disorder and can prevent the patient from recovery. To increase the patient’s self-esteem a therapy, called Competitive Memory Training (COMET), was developed. COMET is used as a therapy in PsyQ, a Dutch mental healthcare institute, for the treatment of anxiety disorders, depressions, personality disorders and eating disorders. COMET aims at increasing the patient’s self-esteem by restoring the balance between the retrieval of positive and negative autobiographical memories. People who suffer from low self-esteem often have a negative memory bias. For those people, negative memories are better accessible than positive memories. Training the patients to retrieve positive memories more easily helps them to increase their self-image. This increases the likelihood for recovery. Panic disorder The target group of this project was people who suffer from panic disorder. Panic disorder patients experience panic attacks, most of the times in crowded places like supermarkets and public transport. During a panic attack, that lasts for some minutes, the patient experiences an extreme fear for physical and mental injuries, for example fear of dying or ‘going mad’. After experiencing the first panic attack the patient develops a fear of getting another attack, which results in panic disorder. Panic disorder has a considerable influence on the daily life of patients. If patients no longer feel confident with leaving the house, social activities and going to work become hard to undertake or even impossible. The patients develop avoidance behavior for situations where it is hard to escape from, for example public transport or supermarkets. This limits them in daily activities and this may results in feelings of isolation. The potential origins of panic disorder are still discussed by the experts in the field of psychology. Potential causes relate to stress, genetics and early development. Because panic disorder patients often suffer from low self-esteem and because they are getting treated with COMET, they will benefit the most from a therapy-enhancing product that helps to increase their self-esteem. Obsessive-compulsive disorder Panic disorders have rather high comorbidity rates. People who suffer from panic disorder often suffer from another mental disorder as well, for example: obsessive- compulsive disorder or depression. Designing a portable product for panic disorder patients may create a risk for obsessive-compulsive behavior, because many patients search for a person or object to hold on to. For that reason this project focussed on a non-portable product that is used in the home environment. This decreases the likelihood the patient feels dependent on the product when leaving the house. Insomnia In addition to the panic attacks, many patients suffer from insomnia. Sleeping problems during the night may increase the severity of the disorder during the day. Because of the sleeping problems patients do not want to go to bed in the evening. This results in a reversed day and night rhythm. Designing a product for nighttime usage helps the patient to experience rest at night. Control theme The COMET therapy asks of patients to choose a ‘control theme’. This theme is a positive autobiographical memory. Categorizing the often chosen control themes makes clear that most of the patients choose a memory that has some relation with relaxation and nature. For this reason grass was chosen as a cue to facilitate the retrieval of positive memories. Research experiments Research experiments were conducted to study the influence of several sensory stimuli on the retrieval of positive memories. Twenty panic disorder patients participated in the experiments. They were asked to experience the olfactory, tactile or visual trigger of grass. Another group of participants was used as control group. The people in this group only received the word ‘grass’. The experiments show that grass stimulates the retrieval of positive memories. From all senses the influence of touch on the valence (value assessment) of the retrieved memory is the most positive. The tactile stimulus and the control group stimulated the vividness of the retrieved memory the most. The vividness of the memories retrieved by the olfactory stimulus was lower than expected. Concluding from all experiments grass is an appropriate cue for the retrieval of positive autobiographical memories and the tactile stimulus delivered the best results for the valence and vividness of the retrieved memory. Thus, the product design is based on the tactile experience of grass. Product design As a result of the research experiments the Rookie is designed. The Rookie is a piece of furniture for the bedroom covered with grass. When placing the Rookie next to the bed, the grass can be touched by the user when lying in bed. Panic disorder patients often have problems falling asleep or they wake up in the middle of the night with an increased bodily arousal. During those tough moments the Rookie serves as a support for panic disorder patients and helps them with the retrieval of positive memories. Hopefully this thesis inspires other designers to make further steps in improving the home environment of mental healthcare patients by designing therapy-enhancing products: in doing so, they can help decrease the patient’s recovery time.","Healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

Since buildings are being built higher and higher, the quest for more accurate information arises. In this study information on 11 Dutch buildings was studied and damping parameters derived from measurements were related to the structural characteristics. Damping ratio expressions were derived. An analytical model of the structure’s dynamic response was developed. Damping was split in four sources to identify the contribution from individual structural aspects.

Many companies have gained competitive advantage through shortening the lead-time. In achieving this, next to the introduction of more flexibility in their own operations, companies are looking for more flexible suppliers. Traditionally uncertainty in supply was mitigated through high inventories. Next to the costs involved in keeping these inventories, they also delay the demand information and thereby create volatility, called the bullwhip effect. That is why various industries have put efforts in lowering the inventories and increasing flexibility. Introducing flexibility in production is rather controversial in the chemicals industry. Economies of scale and low margins nurture the emphasis on plant utilization. This drives ever lower margins, hence an even higher emphasis on plant utilization. The 24-hour operation leaves no flexibility to respond to a changing demand or to compensate for downtime. The company that initiated this research and offered the facilities to perform a desk study and provided the data to build a simulation model is active in the chemicals industry. During the recession of 2008 the company was confronted with a decrease in demand. In 2010 a quick recovery of the market was experienced, accompanied with several assets failing this caused large disruptions in the supply to customers. The reliability of supply was perceived too low at the commercial interface. This made the company look for ways to improve the customer-perceived value of supply. In this report a strategic audit is proposed. The objective of this audit is to align the company’s competitive strategy and operations strategy. The competitive strategy considers the market the company is active in and its value proposition to its customers. In this research this was done though the Industry Trends Analysis and the Customer Value Analysis. The market view was applied, which starts at the market and ends in recommendations for the operations. This audit structured the answering of the following research question: How can chemicals companies delivering to intermediate markets, improve the customer-perceived value of the supply in a cost-effective way? Increasing volatility in the demand on consumer markets makes that requirements of the industries downstream of the chemicals industry include the responsiveness to this volatile demand. As a consequence this also influences the customer-perceived value of the manufacturer’s supply. The commoditization in the downstream markets increases the need for agile operations and make that customers focus more on service-aspects like lead-times. Through a structured survey customers were asked to indicate the importance of, and performances on, supply chain related aspects. These aspects were based on the four guiding principles for supply chain managers: responsiveness, reliability, resilience and relationships and the three of the four elements of customer value: quality, service and timing (cost was excluded to prevent strategic answers). Besides a confirmation of some characteristics of the industry like the low importance of customized solutions and the high emphasis on quality the survey also resulted in new insights. The results especially represent the CASE customers, a segment in which the company wants to grow and where customers on average are smaller and deliver to industries where just-in-time practices are more common. In contrast with Flexibles customers these customers value responsiveness more than reliability. Reliability was valued high and performances where rated high. For responsiveness the importance was indicated to be high, while the performances where rated amongst the lowest. The challenge for the company will be to become less dependent on forecasts and increase the agility of operations while sustaining the current level of reliability. As part of the strategic audit, the competency gap was specified by defining key performance indicators that the company should improve. The objective of the system should be to limit the lead-times, achieve a high order fulfilment rate and keep appropriate inventory levels. The company currently applies a hybrid form of make-to-order (MTO) and make-to-stock (MTS) operations regime. The regime is based on forecasts that are facilitated by the monthly repeated S&OP process. The focus is in the first place on optimizing production, which leads to varying availability of products and a long planning horizon. The delay in information between the complex production chain and demand management makes that inventory levels vary a lot and consequentially order fulfilment is compromised. It is advised to implement the just-in-time (JIT) regime. This regime has the prospect of shorter lead-times, more stable inventory levels which lead to less variation in product availability and thereby increases order fulfilment. The only downside is that this compromises the production capacity used on short term as this is adaptive to the demand, which is counter intuitive regarding the current KPI’s which focus on the occupancy of assets. The prospect is that production capacity is only used for producing the right products at the right time and higher sales margins due to more stable operations. The production processes and assets were successfully represented in a simulation model, which delivered valuable insights for the industry. The chemicals industry is characterized by a bill of materials that decomposes a few raw materials into many finished products. This makes that the chemicals industry has one of the most complex production chains. In this thesis an object oriented representation of the system was proposed. The relations between objects describe the bill of materials, thereby enabling the simulation of the complex production chain. Experiments based on the sales of 2010 and disruptions based on historical data from 2005 to 2011 excluding the force-majeure situations showed that the JIT regime is successful in fulfilling the orders with short lead times and low inventory levels. It is important to note that the sales represent a managed demand. Due to the inflexible capacity this managed demand is considered an important requirement for the system to work. Next to an improved order fulfilment, the model showed that JIT allows lower inventory levels. Finally JIT makes the impact of disruptions more predictable, which enables the company to develop calculated responses to these situations.","just-in-time chemicals supply chain management customer value","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systeemkunde","","SEPAM","",""

In the Eastern Scheldt the connection to the North Sea was regulated by an open storm surge barrier and two compartment dams. These decreased the tidal volume and consequently tidal flats are eroding and disappear under water. The intertidal flats and shoals have two important functions in the basin. Firstly, they are valuable habitat and foraging grounds for wading bird species. A second function of intertidal foreshores is to reduce the wave attack on surrounding water barriers. In front of the Oesterdam Rijkswaterstaat has started a pilot project called “the Oesterdam safety buffer? to find a solution to the erosion problems. This report investigates several solutions for this foreshore nourishment. In total seven different designs have been evaluated in this report. Four different design strategies have been found in a workshop namely, a high dune, a buffer, an equally spread flat nourishment and finally a wave breaking ridge. For all these strategies different profiles have been dimensioned. To model the morphological development of the profiles a 1D morphological model called XBeach has been used. A safety check for the design conditions (1/4000yr) has been done both for the initial profiles, as designed, and for the final profiles at the end of their 50years lifetime. To calculate the overtopping over the Oesterdam the program PC-Overslag has been used. Results showed that all nourishment designs give a smaller overtopping volume of the dam and thus create safety. Final evaluation of the designs showed that a Flat foreshore nourishment combines a solution for nature and safety.","Eastern Scheldt; Oesterdam; sand deficit; foreshore nourishment; safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Managment","",""

Due to differences in sediment properties, sand and mud particles respond different to identical forcing conditions, like short waves and tidal currents. Because of this, sand and mud can get transported to different locations. This process is referred to by sand-mud segregation. Sand-mud segregation can have considerable influences on bathymetry, potential pollution and flora & fauna. It is because of these aspects that predictions on sand-mud segregation are needed. To predict sand-mud segregation, commonly for a practical scenario, a morphodynamic model can be used. Though, modelling a practical scenario often comprises a complex bathymetry and various non-linear processes, that contribute to sand-mud segregation, occur. Because of this, practical sand-mud segregation models are often hard to understand, give little insight in the overall processes and discrepancies with reality are often found within the results. These problems can be overcome by considering a schematized scenario, where only the overall forcing conditions (tidal currents and short waves) are considered, along with a schematized bathymetry and geometry. By considering a schematized scenario of the Amelander tidal inlet system, the large-scale sand-mud segregation patterns can be reproduced. It is found, e.g. in observations from the field and theoretical descriptions, that mud is commonly found in less hydrodynamic active areas (as long as mud is available). Within the Amelander tidal inlet system, mud is therefore found in the shallow intertidal areas, far from the deeper hydrodynamically active areas, like the tidal inlet and tidal channels. The schematized process-based model (a newly developed sand-mud version of Delft3D, which accounts for (non) cohesive regimes, a layered stratigraphy and consolidation lag) also reproduces these large-scale spatial sand-mud segregation patterns, with the schematized process-based approach. By combining the schematized model approach with variations in relative forcing domination (by tidal currents or short waves), various scenarios can be considered. From observations in the field and associated sand-mud segregation theory, one always expects mud deposition in less hydrodynamically active areas. Given the properties of tidal currents and short waves, it is hypothesized that mud is commonly found in deeper/shallow areas, respectively for a relative dominance of tidal currents/short waves. Results from the schematized process-based model support this hypothesis. Mud is transported to deeper areas when short wave domination is imposed, while mud is commonly found in shallow areas for a tidally dominated system. A schematized process-based sand-mud segregation model is able to reproduce large-scale spatial sand-mud segregation patterns for a practical case (the Amelander tidal inlet system). Furthermore, a classification can be set up, relating these large-scale spatial sand-mud segregation patterns to relative forcing dominance (from tidal currents or short waves), which is based on observations, theory and the schematized process-based model.","sand-mud; segregation; simulating; modelling; classifying; morphodynamic; Wadden Sea; process-based model; tidal basins; Delft3D; sediment; transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Harteveld, M.G.A.D. (mentor)","2012","The number of enclosed residential domains (ERDs) in the Netherlands has seen a remarkable increase over the past twenty years. Roughly half of these projects are located in urban areas. This raises the question what the impact of large scale privatisation is on the city. Knowledge regarding the Dutch case is scarce. In particular, the relation between spatial aspects of ERDs and their effect on Dutch cities is a key aspect missing in the body of knowledge. In order to assemble and add relevant knowledge on this subject, this graduation project aims at answering the following question: How can the spatial design of private residential domains enhance the living quality in Dutch urban areas for both residents aswell as the public? The project focuses on the scenario of an increase of private residential domains in urban areas. The project is roughly divided into three phases. In the research part the problem is analysed and tools for analysis and design are developed. This is followed by the design phase in which the tools are applied and a privatised neighbourhood is designed. A large scale scenario featuring multiple ERDs in an urban area is simulated since there is a lack of such cases in reality to study. In order to define the properties of ERDs affecting the city a vision tool is developed considering the juridical, social and spatial properties. An ERD can be seen as a combination of different layers of segregation on top of the built environment, namely the accessibility of the area (spatial and social), the communities (social), the liabilities for the area (social and juridical) and the rights of ownership (juridical). To relate social, juridical and spatial properties of ERDs to future urban design, a literature research regarding the possible effects of an increase of ERDs on the Dutch public realm has been made. This research resulted in three recommendations for designing an ERD area. First, maintain a dense network accessible to the public. Second, the addition of expression of identity in space can have a positive influence on the role of public space. Third, homogeneity of a neighbourhood should be prevented. The quality of ERDs for the dwellers is defined by research on the reasons to live in a Dutch ERD, abstracted from literature research and media analysis of real estate agent advertisements of Dutch urban ERDs. For each layer different choices can be made, each affecting the others. Which properties form the starting point for an urban plan depends on the approach of the ERD project. An urban designer’s approach starts with the built environment, the accessibility and the right of ownership. The liabilities and the community are a consequence of the choices made in the urban plan. In contrast, an urban strategy approach starts with focussing on the social and juridical part. As a result, the built environment and accessibility are a consequence thereof. In order to focus on the effects of the spatial properties the urban designer’s approach is chosen. The design process was a test case of large scale privatisation for residential purposes in an urban area. The location chosen is Rivierenbuurt Noord in the Hague. The first assumption is that in the coming years the municipality will hand over this area to private actors. After that the desired level of accessibility and density in the area is determined with respect to the influences of the surrounding city scape. For further design, the accessibility in the area is set to meet the recommendation of having a dense urban network in private space. The next step is to test the possibilities for the built environment based on the density and the diversity of the neighbourhood. This includes a supply of different living environments, the diversity of resident groups and their possibilities to express identity and a diversity in accessible spaces for the public. The design process is a continuous process whereby choices for one property affected decisions made on other properties. The application of developed tools is a side product of this process. A ‘quality monitor tool’ developed during the research phase is used to compare the design with existing ERDs. The conclusion of this research is: ERDs can be of an added value for both the public and the public in a Dutch city in one urban plan by integrating the qualities for both. New types of living environments created by private residential domains provide new demands on the housing market, without necessarily having a negative impact on Dutch cites. But in order to design ERDs in Dutch urban areas, it is of high importance to decide first what the accessibility plan of the area would be on both publicly and privately ownded space, considering the value of the spaces for the public domain of the city. Living quality in private domains are supported by the input initiators of projects add and the role municipalities have as inspirators and projectmanagers of the privatisation projects. It is also possible to transform current publicly owned space into collectively owned space while adding value for all users. A remark is that the current juridical ownership structures in Dutch law are insufficient to provide large scale longterm privatisation processes at the moment.","privatisation; enclosed residential domains; gated communities; accessibility; public; private; Dutch urban area; segregation; living quality; spatial design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Environmental Design and Urban design / Design as politics","",""

(mentor)","2012","Traditional Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems influence planar vehicle motions to better match these to the driver’s intention. These systems use the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) hardware to generate the needed tire forces. This has a large impact on longitudinal vehicle motions. A second method of altering the front wheel tire forces is Active Front Steering (AFS), which alters the steering angle of the front wheels and therefore has a lower impact on longitudinal motions. A combined braking and AFS ESC system can ensure the braking action is postponed, or not executed at all. Haptic feedback on the steering wheel has proven to be helpful in vehicle control for lanekeeping systems. If a feedback torque can be designed that will achieve the same steering angle change an AFS system would, the benefits of a combined braking and AFS ESC system can be obtained without installing extra hardware. It is exactly such a feedback torque that is investigated in this research. It will guide drivers to the maximum front axle grip to help them achieve their desired vehicle motions. The corresponding steering angle will be selected from a range of steering angles, based on the lateral front axle force that will be generated at that steering angle. To find the front axle lateral force, a Pacejka tire model will be used. The feedback system is tested on a real vehicle. Nine test drivers drove the test vehicle with and without feedback on a circle with low friction surface (skid-pad) and on a small test track to test the effect of the feedback torque on their driving behavior in constant and dynamic circumstances. They were given instructions to follow the tracks as fast as possible, so that the desired yaw rate will be the maximum possible yaw rate and the feedback torque will guide towards the maximum front axle grip. On the skid-pad the feedback controller worked as intended: drivers managed to achieve a higher yaw rate. The analysis of the behavior on the track was hampered by changed circumstances between the tests with and without feedback. The analysis did show that the controller made the vehicle ‘eager to steer’; the feedback torque advised drivers to steer more. This led to quicker corner entries, but slower corner exits. The most noticeable change was found in road position, where the haptic feedback resulted in changed and more constant driving lines. There is room for improvement of the controller: it is recommended to ensure that any feedback torque will not work against steering straight to prevent drivers from problems with exiting corners.","haptic feedback; axle grip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Wever, R. (mentor); Van Leeuwen, R.J. (mentor)","2012","Introduction The central question in this report is: How can Bruynzeel successfully integrate sustainability in its business? Sustainability is generally getting more attention and Bruynzeel’s customers (DIY-chains and expert-dealers) sometimes take inventory of sustainable products or start other sustainable initiatives. Bruynzeel now wants to know how sustainability can be integrated in their business so it can contribute to the company’s results. Integrating sustainability should lead to positive results rather than lead to losses. Three research subjects have been the foundation for composing an advice: sustainability, Bruynzeel and the context of Bruynzeel. Sustainability What is sustainability? The most used interpretation of sustainable development is that from the Brundtlandt commission (1987): a “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. This general definition needs an interpretation for Bruynzeel. Bruynzeel must realize that sustainability is not an attached subject to the company and is time consuming and loss-making. Sustainability is a balance between people, planet and profit. Profit can only be realized on the condition of people and planet. The balance requires a full integration of sustainability, only than can sustainability contribute to profits. Concerning sustainable results, sustainable development should be regarded as making small steps in the right direction that are relative improvements of a certain situation. Sustainability implementation programs have to be tailor-made for each company and each situation, there is no general solution or strategy on how to implement sustainability successfully. It is a combination of the right elements and circumstances. First Bruynzeel need to be clear and of the same mind on the motivation why sustainability has to be integrated. That is a determining factor in finding the right content but also in being successful with sustainability. Than, it must become clear what the steps are that Bruynzeel makes if it applies sustainability. The combination of the SWOT-elements form the basis for a strategy in which sustainability adds value to the company. Bruynzeel The strongest points of Bruynzeel are: its brand name, the expertise in developing and selling quality sanitary and fly-screen products and long relationships with DIY-chains. Its weakest points are an illogical product portfolio, a too little brand awareness of Bruynzeel as a sanitary brand and the lack of formal innovation and product development processes. A research to the motivations for sustainability reveals that there is no agreement at this moment on an ambition level for sustainability. The main drawbacks are priority and the business perspectives of sustainability. The drawbacks are the result of a wrong interpretation of sustainability. The strategy should respond to these counter arguments and reveal a right interpretation of sustainability. Context Bruynzeel possesses a modest position in its context and sustainability does not play a big role in it. The company is too small to put serious pressure on suppliers. Customers of Bruynzeel are few, big and able to choose from multiple different suppliers. DIY-chains raised the bargaining power on their suppliers last year by applying tenders on product categories. Suppliers like Bruynzeel are required to offer additional value and to show vision on product categories in the DIY-chains. Besides that the pressure to lower product prices is enormous. Sustainability does not play a big role in the context of Bruynzeel. Especially in the specific product categories of Bruynzeel sustainability is hardly an issue. Sustainable initiatives of Bruynzeel’s customers are very accessible and focus on compliance, responsibility and brand image. The pressure on Bruynzeel to integrate sustainability is therefore relatively low. It can be expected that coming years Bruynzeel satisfies customer’s sustainability requirements with applying certified wood and applying for BSCI (guidelines for suppliers concerning mainly human-rights and working conditions). However, several stakeholders of Bruynzeel wonder why Bruynzeel is not already engaged with sustainability as it belongs to an A-brand to respond to trends and developments. It can be noticed that many other A-brands are engaged with sustainability and use it as a differentiation tool to respond to the increasing demand to sustainable products, but also to show innovativeness and foresight and to create differentiation. Strategic advice The best way for Bruynzeel to integrate sustainability is to incorporate it in an A-brand strategy. A strategy that focuses on the brand Bruynzeel and the innovative character of the brand. It lets Bruynzeel fulfil to its A-brand aspirations. With this strategy, Bruynzeel becomes a front runner with new innovations and developments and gets a leading role on the markets and achieves a strong differentiation from competition. Besides, Bruynzeel acquires a clear and distinct brand image. People confronted with Bruynzeel should automatically relate the brand to high-quality and innovative sanitary products. To achieve this two subjects need to be adjusted and improved: Innovation and Communication. 1. Innovation If Bruynzeel extends the innovation scope from specific products to the bathroom as a whole, it meets the expectations of an A-brand much better. An A-brand is expected to be innovative, a focus on the bathroom as a whole creates a foundation for bathroom innovations rather than a focus on specific bathroom products does. Innovations of Bruynzeel than have to be categorized in three subjects: Technology, Experience and Sustainability. Basically every new innovation fits one of these categories, but the distinction provides possibilities for a clear brand position towards consumers. Besides, it makes the innovation processes of Bruynzeel more convenient. Technology With technology, Bruynzeel is able to warrant quality and to follow / setup new technological developments. New production processes, but also the application of audiovisual products fit in this subject. Experience The extension of innovation focus to the bathroom as a whole includes an increased emphasis on the experience and perception of a bathroom by users. Colours, rituals, functionality, materials, light and more belong to this subject. Collaboration with other suppliers to realize a wide range of product offers is an important part of this innovation field. Sustainability Sustainability has become one of the three innovation fields and this is how sustainability can optimally contribute to the company’s results. Basically, sustainability imply two implementations: The basic variant of sustainability that is a response to sustainable developments from the context and implies accreditation for FSC/PEFC, the appliance for BSCI guidelines. DIY-chains regard this together with service, reliability and responsibility as sustainability. This way of interpreting sustainability will become more and more a license to operate and is not a differentiation tool. The extended implementation of sustainability implies products and new innovations. This form of sustainability opens up a new solution space for products, creates differentiation from competition and enriches the brand image. Bruynzeel should not only apply for a basic variant of sustainability but make optimally use of it and use it as a differentiation tool. The value of sustainability in this strategy is an intangible value. Sustainability raises the brand image of Bruynzeel and innovative sustainable product concepts prove brand ambitions and create differentiation. Together with the innovations in the two other fields, a strong brand is positioned on the market. 2. Communication Improved communication programs respond to the weak brand awareness of Bruynzeel as a sanitary brand. The brand Bruynzeel is generally well-known, however Bruynzeel is barely known as a sanitary brand. Higher budgets are part of a better brand communication towards customers and consumers. Two results are achieved if Bruynzeel uses an approach in which every product launch is accompanied with an extensive advertising campaign that addresses both the brand and the specific product. The first result is that the brand Bruynzeel is known for sanitary products. The second result is the association of the sanitary brand Bruynzeel with innovative products and increased attention to each innovation. The extended marketing programs also contain an improvement of the brand visibility in DIY-stores. The desired effect is that consumers, from a distance, recognize Bruynzeel products between other products. Conclusion The A-brand strategy elaborates on strengths of Bruynzeel by making optimally use of the department product development which is a competitive feature compared to competitors. Several weak points of Bruynzeel are solved: First, the brand visibility increases and makes Bruynzeel a well-known brand of innovative sanitary products. Besides the portfolio and the innovation process on term will be more structured by consistently applying the innovation pattern. This strategy is also an answer to arguments against integrating sustainability. Exactly by addressing the urging subjects of differentiation and brand visibility the arguments against integrating sustainability are contradicted. In this way, incorporated in an A-brand strategy, the business perspectives of sustainability are positive and simultaneously the priority of it is proven. The biggest benefit of this strategy is achieving differentiation and offering additional value. This is a major threat from the market, but is responded with improved innovation and communication programs. In several years Bruynzeel will reach a major position on the markets and the company has grown due to a decent bathroom innovation program and increased marketing and advertising activities.","Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Strategy; Value Creation; Bruynzeel; Bruynzeel Home Products","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Afvalwater van het stedelijk gebied wordt aan de grens van het grootste probleemgebied (peilvak 9) gezuiverd en kan vervolgens voor de landbouw gebruikt worden, zodat er veel minder zoet water van buiten de polder nodig is. Dit wordt zichtbaar gemaakt in het landschap, zowel op de schaal van de snel passerende treinreiziger als op de schaal van de fietser die alles op zijn gemak kan bekijken. De landbouwproducten worden op hun beurt weer gebruikt in de brouwerij annex café-restaurant, een gebouw waarin de stappen van het brouwproces duidelijk te zien zijn. De schaal van het gebouw probeert zowel aan te sluiten op de schaal van het productielandschap - met een erf als tussenliggend element - als op de schaal van de gebruikers van het gebouw.

(mentor); Van Oel, C.J. (mentor)","2012","Management Summary Background Due to demographic developments the Dutch healthcare market will grow as a whole. The Wmg has ensured that there will be more transparency in this healthcare market. Patients have more insight into the quality of treatments offered by various health care providers. Because of the introduction of integral performance funding hospitals have more financial risk. A hospital is therefore in a larger way responsible for attracting customers and making profit. The discontinuance of the construction regime specifically presents additional risk on the hospitals real estate. Both trends force hospitals to be more profitable and competitive. This means that on the one hand hospitals have to attract more customers and on the other they have to sell more healthcare packets to health insurance carriers at sharper prices. Especially with an continuously growing B-segment. If a hospital is well appreciated among patients the hospital can afford to demand higher prices from insurance carriers because the Zvw made it possible for patients to switch carriers. Environmental psychology The environment of a hospital can influence a patient in different ways. A patient’s expectation can be met or even exceeded. It can improve the mood of staff and patients. And finally, the environment can contribute to a ´healing environment´. Although no patient will be influenced by all aspects of an environment as complex as a hospital, they will consciously and unconsciously use certain aspects in their assessment of the hospital. This assessment will contribute to the way a patient remembers his or her stay. This in turn will affect patient satisfaction and thus the image of a hospital. Discrete Choice Analysis After examining possible research methods it is shown that the Discrete Choice Analysis (DCA)is suited for this research. It is expected that results obtained in such a way will reflect actual real life choices in a better way than directly asking would. For a DCA a product is divided into a set of attributes. For each attribute a number of levels is distinguished. For instance, the surface of a hospital room in m2 is an attribute. The attribute levels can then be 20, 30 and 40 m2. If one now chooses a random attribute level for each attribute one has a choice alternative. A respondent may now be asked which choice alternative from a choice set of two choice alternatives are preferred. Using this way it is not immediately clear to a respondent which attributes and attribute levels are used in a certain choice alternative. As a result the respondent is forced to a selection based on intuition. From the results one can now calculate the relative utility that is associated with the various attributes. Survey The DCA in this study uses 6 attributes, 4 with three levels and 2 with two levels. This gives 34 x 22 = 324 possible room configurations. Tabel 1 shows the attributes that were used in the DCA. With the exception of the number of beds per room with all attributes can be assumed that the preferences go from high to low. Using Kuhlfeld’s (2010) %MktEx algorithm an efficient design of a 36 sets of two alternative choices was made. To limit the time needed to fill out a survey each respondent were ransomly shown 12 of these. After completing the DCA, the respondents were also asked to give a number from 1 to 10 to indicate the importance associated with the attributes. To get a sufficient amount of responses visitors of two hospitals in Amsterdam were asked to fill out the survey on laptops that were set up. This ensured that the responses are as reliable as possible in terms of influences that the environment has on a person and the respondents experience with hospitals. Results and Conclusions The sample corresponds very well with the Dutch population. This gives an indication that the results a high degree of reliability. Table 2 shows the average grades and the corresponding standard deviation of the marks given to the various attributes. Table 3 shows the results of the DCA, the nutswaarde value shows utility value in associated with the attributes and attribute levels.

The patient and their experiences are central in this project. The patients’ experience is shaped by the complete perception of the hospital visit. Therefor research is done on the entire hospital visit to discover the latent needs and wishes. By means of a thorough analysis and hands on research, contextmapping combined with physiological measurements, a better understanding of the UMCU’s patient is generated. By researching the complete experience of the patient, insights are developed on the different phases of a hospital journey. These insights show that the most interesting phases for the UMCU to focus on are the phases of preparation, reception and waiting. A better understanding of the UMCU patient population is realized by means of patient segmentation and results from the research. These insights are represented by four personas. A third result is surfacing the latent needs the patients have during a hospital visit. These needs are: having a sense of control over the process, a feeling of certainty by a predictable structure and being engaged in a personal way. The essence of this graduation project is showing the UMCU how they can improve their services based on the needs and wishes of the patient. The three insights mentioned above form building blocks in doing so. To be able to implement these insights guidelines are developed. These guidelines give direction to the embodiment of the patients’ needs. The embodiment of this product/service system can be done in a variety of ways. This is shown by the development of a solution space. To show how the development of the solutions can be implemented, in a gradual manner, an example case is given. The starting point of the project is to develop a solution for the entrance area. Therefor a roadmap for the design solutions is developed for the reception phase in specific.","hospitality; service design; hospital; user centered; personas; contextmappen; patient journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-04-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Wetenschappelijk onderzoek belicht verschillende aspecten van deze opkomende methode en op internet, in vakliteratuur en in de publieke opinie worden verschillende meningen geuit over de toepassing van BIM. Voor- en nadelen worden beschreven, maar er is nog geen duidelijkheid over welke van deze eigenschappen gelden voor welke actoren bij de huidige stand van zaken. Daarbij is onder kleine partijen een veelgehoord geluid dat BIM voornamelijk kan worden toegepast door grote partijen. De bouwbranche bevindt zich in een crisis sinds de start van de economische crisis in 2008, maar dit zou juist een reden kunnen zijn om te richten op nieuwe technieken en rollen. Dit onderzoek is gehouden onder architectenbureaus met een omvang van 10 fte of minder, die zijn aangesloten bij de Bond van Nederlandse Architecten (BNA), met als doel het verkrijgen van inzicht in de huidige stand van zaken van BIM onder kleine architectenbureaus, inzicht verkrijgen in de toegepaste implementatiestrategie en het uitbrengen van een advies aan de directeuren/eigenaren van kleine architectenbureaus en de BNA over de implementatie van BIM. De BNA-bureaus zijn representatief voor architectenbureaus in Nederland. In the architecture, engineering, and construction industry, the interest in Building Information Modeling (BIM) is growing. Scientific research discusses different aspects of this methodology; on the internet, in journals and in public opinion different views are presented and thoroughly discussed. Pros and cons are posed, but there is no consensus about which parts of the ideal view can be reached in the real building process at this moment. Architects are not convinced about the value and necessity of using BIM, but the economic crisis that influences the economy and the building industry since 2008 could be a reason to reconsider the need for new techniques and new roles of the architect. Besides, a commonly heard note is that BIM is to be used by large parties and it has too little benefits for smaller firms. Knowing that, looking from the point of view of the architect, the question arises whether or not small architectural firms should apply BIM. This research is part of the master course at TU Delft and was carried out in cooperation with the The Royal Institute of Dutch Architects (BNA), the professional organization of architects in The Netherlands. Approximately 1500 architectural firms are associated to the BNA, of which 1300 firms have a size of 10 FTE or less, the research group. The group of firms associated to the BNA is representative for the total group of architectural firms in the Netherlands.","BIM; architectuur; BNA; automatisering; Building Information Modeling; ontwerpproces; integratie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-24","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction Management","",""

The high speed train links main city centers from hart to hart without transfers. Every city has had (or will have) the dilemma of deciding which is the best location for a High Speed Train station. Mobility on rails is acknowledged to be one of the most sustainable means of transportation between cities and towns. Therefore, a railway stations location in a built environment and its degree of accessibility is essential to reach as many travellers as possible. However, the spatial configuration of the local street and road net in railway stations vicinity is seldom taken into consideration. (van Nes and Stolk, 2010). A local area’s degree of vitality has to be spatially supported by a local well-connected and integrated street and road network (Kusumo, 2005).

(mentor); Simonse, L. (mentor); van Erve, I. (mentor)","2012","Sunware is a Dutch manufacturer of plastic storage products for in and around the house. In recent years, Sunware has moved to take up a significant position on the European market for plastic storage products. But within the last years, Sunware is getting a lot of competition from manufacturers of Eastern Europe and Asia. In the interest to keep up their position in the market, and to even strengthen their market position, this project was put on to investigate Sunware’s future opportunities. The scope of this project is to develop a future vision for Sunware. In order to come to new insights for their future vision, Sunware had two main issues that needed to be analyzed: - How will the market, of which they are part, evolve in the coming years? - How can Sunware respond on these changes to remain a prominent player? The first question about the evolution of the market in general in the coming next years is answered by the five strategic directions that came out of the first part of this project. Within this first part, Sunware’s current situation was investigated by performing an internal and external analysis of their current business. This situational analysis resulted into a SWOT, which was used as an input for the strategic synthesis. Within the strategic synthesis, two strategic tools (Ansoff matrix and confrontation matrix) were used in order to come to new strategic directions for Sunware. The result was a strategic timeline on which these five new strategic growth directions were plotted. Four of them are accepted by Sunware’s management board as being interesting for further investigation. Two of the strategic directions will be further investigated by Sunware itself, namely to offer their products online through a known webshop and to expand their current product range with seasonal and holiday related product collections. One other strategic direction will be further investigated by a new intern student. This student will investigate the opportunity for Sunware to enter the Garden segment again with compact storage solutions for in and around the garden. The fourth strategic direction has been further investigated in the second part of this project. The second question about Sunware’s response on this ever changing market in order to stay prominent player is answered by the for them developed future vision for one of the strategic directions that came out of the first part of this project. Within the second part of the project, the strategic direction of Sunware as a designer, manufacturer and supplier of premiums, durable packaging and PoS-material, has been further investigated. This investigation started with a situational analysis of this new B2B business direction, which contained a B2B internal analysis and a B2B external analysis. The insights that came out of this B2B situational analysis were used as an input for the B2B strategic synthesis. This synthesis included setting up a B2B confrontation matrix, performing a portfolio analysis of the most interesting product categories within this B2B-market and interviews with existing and potential new B2B-clients. The insights that resulted from this B2B strategic synthesis were translated into a future vision for Sunware in order to enter this B2B-market with their B2B-services. A practical approach plan for the coming five years was set up in the form of a strategic roadmap, which consists out of four stages, each with their own goals. At the end of this project some recommendations are given towards Sunware’s design team.","Strategic Roadmap; Future Vision; Services; B2B","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-04-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Department PIM - MCR","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2012","A “POS” is an abbreviation of “Point-of-Sale”, meaning the location where a transaction occurs, usually in the form of a checkout terminal or cash-register. They come in different forms ranging from old-fashion electronic cash registers to the more modern terminals complete with touch screen and Graphic User Interface. POS software is most dominant in: Retail industry, hospitality industry, restaurant business and the hotel business. This project focuses on the system that is used in the restaurant business, more specifically: the Chinese restaurants. Chinese restaurant insist on keep using outdated Point-Of-Sale systems because they are reluctant to make large investments. It hampers productivity as they are usually poorly designed and lacking in good usability. The goal of this project was to create a new POS system that will improve the context integration, usability, and closing the gap of cultural differences between employees and customers in a restaurant. The initial area of focus was on the employee as they are the ones affected the most in this situation. For a system that is integral in running a restaurant business, current market POS systems don’t take into consideration the goals and wishes of the employees, management and customers. Each of them have different goals in a restaurant and each of them has different roles which need to be supported. From the literature and field research it is clear that traditional POS systems fail to facilitate these roles and goals. Management has a difficult time keeping an overview inside the restaurant but especially outside the restaurant where social media and off-site user reviews strongly influences the reputation of a restaurant. (Chinese) Waiters lack the knowledge and tools to provide good service to customers because of the language and cultural differences. As for the customers, they want to be treated with good food and good service but lack the means to communicate their choice or preferences well. All these roles need to be supported. The old restaurant workflow was analyzed and a new workflow was introduced that would connect all these roles in a more useful, meaningful and efficient way. Using this as a guide the OmniMenu concept was created. It isn’t a POS system as it is a series of inter-connected systems that keeps track of feedback, statistics, customer/employee data and rewards. This network of supporting systems helps improve in areas of food quality, food choice, service and loyalty. The concept consists of two parts: the core and the modules. The core is the heart of the product, keeps track of all the systems and is usually operated by the employees (i.e. touchscreen PC). The modules are the extensions of the core in the form of Smartphone / Tablet handheld devices or even Web pages. These are used by either customer or employee and display rich media while also granting more (service based) functionality. During synthesis, the area of focus turned from restaurant employee to the customer instead. It seems that improving the conditions for the customer had the most potential and was least explored in Chinese restaurants. If customers were given more control during their visit, service quality would improve and employees would be burdened less. Personalization towards customers isn’t so much human interaction from waiters as it is having the power to reach your goals and wants in a restaurant. A prototype was created to simulate an iPad tablet application that customers could use during a restaurant visit. It housed several features such as: guidance in food choice (using mood associative pictures), personalized menu’s, service controls (for requests, feedback and overviews) and a (point) reward system to encourage loyalty. A user test was done to see what the effects of these features were. One of the surprising results was that the use of mood associative pictures for food selection influenced the participants significantly as it encouraged them to choose new kinds of food instead of their “safe” dish. Service controls were found to be handy and useful. It gave customers tools to receive better service, information and rewards as well as ways to contribute more feedback. The prototype showed good promise during the test and it should be further optimized. Additional recommendation on useful improvements were given in the final chapter.","POS; Restaurants; Employee; Customer; Omnimenu; Mood; Search by feeling; Chinese restaurants; Design; Ipad; Workflows; Roles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-04-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The structure editor suffers from a lack of free form editing and conversions from/to plain text. The Spoofax language workbench, developed at Delft University of Technology, uses a textual editor, which is syntax-aware due to immediate parsing and analyses. In this thesis we describe a migration from Cheetah to Spoofax, which aims to bring the advantages of text editing to the tax-benefit rule modeling language. During the migration, we experienced that current text-based language workbenches, such as Spoofax, require redundant specification of the ingredients for a template-based editor, which is detrimental to the quality of syntactic completion, as consistency and completeness of the definition cannot be guaranteed. We describe the design and implementation of a specification language for syntax definition based on templates. It unifies the specification of parser, pretty printer and template-based editor. We evaluate the template language by application to the tax-benefit rule modeling language and a language for mobile web applications.","domain specific languages; language workbenches; pretty printing; editors; language specification; syntax definition; spoofax","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Software Engineering Research Group","",""

(mentor); Van Kuijk, J.I. (mentor); Van de Wouw, I. (mentor)","2012","This report is the result from an Integrated Product Design graduation project entitled ‘The Next Generation EnergyLight’. It describes the user-centered research and product development process of a new generation light therapy products. Philips EnergyLight currently sells three light therapy products that claim to make you ‘feel more energetic throughout the day, in a natural way’. The product is mainly targeted at people suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD; known as winterdepression) and sub-syndromal Seasonal Affective Disorder (sub-SAD; known as winterblues). The goal of the project was to identify opportunities for a new generation of EnergyLight focused on this consumer group. At the start of the project, an analysis was performed containing a scientific, consumer and market research part. The scientific research consisted of a literature study on SAD, complemented with expert interviews. It was concluded that light therapy is a proven treatment for (sub)SAD, but in order to be effective and safe it should be used properly (correct distance, light intensity, and duration of use) and in a controlled way. However, from existing consumer research, user interviews and a survey, it was found that users often use the product improperly (e.g. the product is used at a too low intensity, too large distance, too short duration or in the evening). The consumer research also indicated several user concerns of the current products (e.g. the bright light is not comfortable and users feel socially embarrassed to use the product) and user preferences for future use (e.g. use at home while having breakfast, using computer or watching television). The market research showed there is a significant growth potential for EnergyLight, although awareness of the products and especially the transition into purchase intent is limited, partly because people think the products are rather expensive and because they are not convinced that the light will help treating their complaints. The total consumer group was subdivided into two main focus areas, represented by the personas ‘Arjen’ and ‘Bridget’. Seven search areas for these personas were indicated as being promising for future product and business developments. From the formulated design brief, several sub-problems were indicated. Three user tests, principle solutions and technical research helped in making decisions on these sub-problems. Ideas were generated by means of brainstorming and sketching, which resulted in the development of four concepts. These concepts differed in their overall orientation (medical or lifestyle) and extended functionalities and intended use scenario. Furthermore, a support path for informing the consumer was proposed, including a software application that could provide a personal advice. Out of the four concepts, the SunSphere concept was chosen as the concept to optimize into a preliminary design, which was further translated into a prototype. The product was evaluated with users, engineers and clinicians. The results suggest that users appreciate the product in terms of design, use scenario and light output. Together with the integration of two light settings and distance sensing the participants indicated that the product has clear added values that are likely to validate the indicated sales price. From a business perspective, the product has the potential to replace the current EnergyLight products and differentiate from competitors by means of aesthetics, light output and additional functions. The user interface could be improved from the prototype in terms of ‘learnability’, because without extended instructions not all functions were clear yet. From the expert interviews it was concluded that the functions and adjustments for stimulating proper use, combined with the software application could increase correct and safe use at home. The SunSphere is a showcase of how the findings from consumer, market and scientific research could be translated into one product. However, several key elements could also be applied (separately) in other future embodiments for EnergyLight. Therefore it is recommended to Philips to especially understand the fundamental elements and rich consumer insights of this project, because these will be valid in most embodiments and propositions for future EnergyLight products.","design; SAD; bright light therapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-04-13","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Conversion into housing is an often named solution, but is hardly ever put into practice because of financial and technical difficulties (location aspects not taken into account). On the other hand, standardization in office design can be seen as an opportunity in making conversion on a large scale more viable: if office buildings are similar in construction, façade systems, dimensions and materialization, modular prefab architecture could offer a solution. If the office structure is considered as a support that needs a new (prefab) infill, this could contribute in making conversion projects time- and cost effective and therefore more feasible. This research aims to explore the difficulties and opportunities that are presented in the building characteristics of the vacant office stock of today, to help define a conversion concept. The result is the design of a prefabricated dwelling unit that has the potential to be deployed in ten percent of the current vacant office stock in The Netherlands.

(mentor); Wolffenbuttel, R.F. (mentor)","2012","Nowadays most of the energy needed comes from fossil fuels such as natural gas (NG). Dwindling stocks of all fossil fuels, including locally occurring natural gas reservoirs, have spurred the effort to both decrease dependence on local fuels and switch to renewable, green energy. The drawback to gas sources like Subsitute Natural Gas (SNG), Biogas or Syngas is that they are too variable in composition to be readily mixed into the existing gas infrastructure. An electrical gas sensor with continuous data output needs to be developed for production safety, burner control and measuring the value of the gas. Photoacoustic infrared absorption (PAS) is a good measurement principle to measure the composition of gas. Three components are essential for a photoacoustic system: a modulated light source emitting light in the spectrum which the target gas absorbs, a pressure sensor, usually a microphone and a photoacoustic cell to hold the sample. In this cell the photoacoustic signal is generated. The PA-signal can be at a resonance frequency of the cell, in which case the cell functions as an acoustical amplifier. The parameter to describe this amplification is the Q-factor. The composition of gas from different sources creates a list of gases that are possibly included in the mixture. The components are classified in four categories: combustible fuel sources, hazardous gases, neutral gases and other gases. For each of these components, Non-dispersive infrared absorption (NDIR), Thermal conductivity detection (TCD) and PAS are considered as sensor principles. The function and requirements of the sensor have to be determined before starting the design and follow from the application of the sensor. This thesis proposes a six step design methodology for designing a PA-sensor. It is a structured approach which tries to divide the process in discrete steps. Because the acoustic behavior of the cell is very important, the resonance profile has to be determined. Analytically calculating the behavior of sound inside the cell is only possible for simple structures. Therefore two methods of acoustic profiling are considered: experimentally and by modelling the acoustic behaviour with the Finite Element Method (FEM) software tool COMSOL Multiphysics 4.1. Measurements were done on different sizes and shapes of resonance chambers in the laboratory. First measurements are performed on simple structures, which show clear longitudinal resonances. Later more complex structures are discussed as well. Measuring gives an good acoustic profile, but to create a large scale model sample chamber takes a lot of effort. Therefore, measuring is useful when verifying a design, but not during the design phase. FEM simulations do not have these drawbacks. Using COMSOL in the design process gives the possibility to do an eigen frequency analysis and a frequency domain analysis. Simulation results are compared with measurements to build confidence in the simulations. Three design cases are discussed. First choosing the position of source and microphone is discussed, then the complexity, meshing and simulation time of the model, and finally excitation by two sources. COMSOL is a good tool to help design the acoustical properties of the sample chamber.","COMSOL multiphysics; PAS; Photoacoustics; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; gas sensing; natural gas; biogas; green gas; sustainibility; COMSOL; Photoacoustic infrared absorption; acoustic resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Manschot, M.A.J. (mentor)","2012","In de Amsterdamse straattaxi-industrie zijn vandaag de dag nog steeds verschillende problemen voor vooral de taxigebruiker te observeren: geweigerde korte ritjes, te hoge prijzen, ongehoord gedrag van chauffeurs. De dieperliggende oorzaken als informatieasymmetrie en marktmacht zorgen er uiteindelijk voor dat de consumenten de taxi negeren en zij deze uiteindelijk alleen gebruiken als zij niet anders kunnen. In opdracht van Taxicentrale Amsterdam (TCA) is er in dit afstudeerproject gezocht naar een tastbaar ‘product service system’, dat beter aansluit bij de belangen van voornamelijk de consument en de taxichauffeurs in het Amsterdam van 2016. Om deze opdracht te vervullen, werd tijdens dit project de ‘Vision in Design (ViP)’-ontwerpbenadering van Hekkert en Van Dijk (2011) geadopteerd. Door een coherentie te creëren in meer dan honderd geïdentificeerde factoren, verzameld vanuit verschillende perspectieven en bronnen in een combinatie van desk- en veldonderzoek, is er uiteindelijk inzicht verworven in de context van het domein straattaxivervoer in Amsterdam in 2016. In deze context zijn er drie sturende krachten opmerkelijk, die elkaar onderling beïnvloeden. Allereerst zien we een markt die volledig bevrijd en gefragmenteerd is. De consument voelt zich uniek, verwacht ook zo behandeld te worden en zal hierdoor ook meer initiatief tonen. Om deze reden trachten bedrijven en individuen elkaar beter te leren kennen. Niet langer kan de industrie voort op de ‘one size, fits all’ aanpak. Binnen deze markt zijn er twee type consumenten te herkennen: enerzijds de ‘prosument’, die online, kritisch en zelfverzekerd is en niet te teveel zal betalen; anderzijds de ‘passument’ die een veel passievere houding inneemt, zich dus niet breed oriënteert en zich vooral laat leiden door adviezen uit zijn netwerk. Ten tweede is er een structuur in de taxi-industrie te herkennen die karakteristiek is voor Amsterdam in 2016. Deze structuur, gedreven door een bepaalde wijze verbondenheid, heeft de vorm van een netwerk. Een netwerk waarin vanzelfsprekend een wisselwerking is; een wisselwerking waarbij men waarde geeft en neemt. Deze waarde kan genomen worden met collectieve en individuele doelen, maar bovenal is het een krachtige basis om waarde te creëren. Deze waarde kan geleverd worden vanuit het volume of vanuit de individuele kwaliteit. De cohesie tussen alle individuele chauffeurs in dit netwerk, vormt uiteindelijk het volumineuze netwerk. Een analogie die deze wisselwerking goed illustreert, is het motto van de Drie Musketiers: ‘Één (geven vanuit de individuele kwaliteit) voor alle (verkrijgen voor het collectieve doel)’ en ‘Alle (geven vanuit het volume) voor één (verkrijgen voor het individuele doel)’. Aangevuld met ‘alle voor alle’ en ‘één voor één’ zijn alle mogelijke relaties gerepresenteerd. Als derde worden beide voorgaande sturende krachten in de context onder druk gezet door het momentele karakter van deze context. De straattaxi-industrie presteert in momenten: klanten worden eenmalig, voor een paar minuten ontmoet en de vraag naar taxi’s is met pieken en dalen. Vooral het leren kennen van de klant om een product op maat te leveren wordt hierbij onder druk gezet. De consument wil uiteindelijk voorzien worden in zijn vervoersbehoefte, de taxichauffeur wil hierin voorzien en TCA laat deze twee bij elkaar komen – elkaar ontmoeten. Door de houdingen van de consument (actief of passief) en de taxichauffeurs (‘alle voor alle’, ‘alle voor één’, één voor één’ of ‘één voor alle’) te combineren, ontstaan er acht type ontmoetingen. Elk type ontmoeting behoeft een specifieke benadering van TCA om deze ontmoeting te stroomlijnen of zelfs te laten ontstaan. Als deze ontmoeting niet plaatsvindt in de gepaste relatie tussen de beide partijen, ervaart de consument de ontmoeting als negatief en zal hij op den duur niet meer terugkeren. TCA dient alle acht de type ontmoetingen te managen om de taxi chauffeurs zo van de best mogelijke exploitatiemogelijkheden voorzien. In de ‘alle voor alle’-ontmoeting met de prosument is het doel de consument vrije toegang te geven tot de taxidienst door én om ze te binden aan TCA - waardoor zij uiteindelijk vaker terugkeren. De taxidienst dient vrij toegankelijk te zijn. In dit geval wordt met toegankelijkheid een combinatie van betaalbaarheid en beschikbaarheid bedoeld, waarbij betaalbaarheid betekend dat de kosten geen belemmering vormen voor het gebruik ervan. Abonnementen kunnen in deze vrijere toegang voorzien. In de meest ideale situatie is het abonnement ‘simpel’ maar ‘compleet’, terwijl de relatie ‘open afgebakend’ en ‘vrijwillig vangend’ is. Op deze manier krijgt de consument exact wat hij zoekt: de taxi. Verder blijkt het belangrijk dat de vrije toegang voorbij het moment gaat, het dient altijd aanwezig zijn. Een ‘verwachtingsvolle’ en ‘herhalende’ relatie tussen de consument en het abonnement van TCA creëert dit. De dienst en de consument bouwen hierbij aan een relatie. Om dit te realiseren dient het abonnement ‘proefbaar’, ‘geduldig’, ‘empatisch’ en ‘kwekend’ te zijn. Daarnaast zou het interessant zijn als de relatie tussen de prosument en de passument ‘meetrekkend’ is, waardoor de toegang voor de passument ook vrij wordt. Dit karakter is gevat in een simpele, maar effectieve dienst voor TCA. Het abonnement maakt de dienst toegankelijk zoals het abonnement van de mobiele telefoon je vrijer laat bellen en het abonnement op een attractiepark je deze parken vrijer laat bezoeken. Voor TCA en haar aangeslotenen zorgen de gebonden klanten voor een vastere bezetting van de taxi – ofwel betere exploitatiemogelijkheden. Binnen het uitgewerkte abonnementenconcept zijn twee iteratieve processen vormgegeven. Enerzijds de iteratie van het gebruik van de taxi, waarbij de consument incheckt met zijn smartphone en vervolgens van A naar B gebracht wordt. Anderzijds de iteratie van het in eerste instantie registreren van hemzelf via de website, waarbij het juiste abonnement wordt gekozen. Maandelijks loopt hij door deze iteratie van begrijpen, analyseren en vergelijken heen, om het abonnement zo goed mogelijk naar zijn wensen aan te passen. De dienst komt met twee verrijkingen in het basisproces om de consument dichter bij de dienst te brengen. Allereerst dienen zij te bouwen aan hun relatie, waarna zij hiernaar kunnen handelen. Dit wordt gerealiseerd door de consument langzaamaan te laten proeven in de proefperiode, door hem te informeren, door hem van abonnement te laten switchen, door hem zijn persoonlijke gegevens te laten vertellen wanneer hij dit wil, door hem taxiritten aan te bieden, door hem te verrassen bij specifieke gebeurtenissen, door hem te vergeven als hij zijn smartphone is vergeten om in te checken, etc. Ten tweede kan de passument meegenomen worden aan de hand van de prosument door bij hem ‘op het abonnement’ te kunnen. Al met al kan TCA extra waarde leveren aan beide geïdentificeerde klantensegmenten door hen te binden via de abonnementendienst. Taxiconsumenten krijgen hierdoor een vrije toegang tot de taxi, terwijl taxichauffeurs een vastere bezetting van hun taxi hebben.","Taxi; Service design; ViP","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Hierbij is er tevens een toevoeging aan het publieke domein van de stad. De Kompasschakel in Scheveningen is typisch zo'n plek waar de relatie met het landschap verdwenen is. Wat opvalt is dat hier de kwaliteit van het openbaar terrein tevens van behoorlijk slechte kwaliteit is. Het bouwblok welke zich in het centrum bevindt vormt een barrière voor omliggende wijken. De publieke domeinen van de haven, de visserswijk en Scheveningen dorp zijn van elkaar gescheiden. Door het openbreken van het blok en landschappelijke kenmerken toe te voegen wordt de algehele fragmentatie vermindert en worden de publieke domeinen weer gekoppeld. De Kompasschakel kan hiermee weer de centrum-/ schakelpositie innemen die het gebied vraagt. In het open terrein wat overblijft na sloop van schuurtjes en garages is plek voor een cultuurcomplex. Er is hier plek voor een buurttheater gericht op de jongeren van de omliggende wijken. Er worden workshops gegeven en theaterproducties opgevoerd. Hiermee wordt de centrumpositie van de Kompasschakel versterkt. De gemeenschap heeft weer een plek om samen te komen en elkaar te ontmoeten. Landschap is in het ontwerp een belangrijk thema. Het gebouw gaat de relatie aan met de nieuw geplaatste duinen. Het gebouw is in, tussen en op het duin geplaatst. Hierbij gaan landschap en architectuur in elkaar over.","Landschap; duinen; cultuur; theater; Scheveningen; publiek domein","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Public Building, Public Realm","",""

(mentor)","2012","“Watch the birdie” Says the photographer to catch the attention of the child for a few seconds. My assignment was to design the “bird”. In this graduation project the photographer, the camera, the child to be photographed and the bird were replaced by the orthoptist, a device to measure angles of cross-eyedness (strabismus), the patient to be measured and the the “eye-catcher”. Strabismus Crossed eyed people can be operated on. The current trend is to perform this surgery in very young children which leads to a demand to also perform the measurement of the angle of strabismus at an early age. My assignment was to design an instrument aimed at children of age group 6 months to 3 years that can draw and keep their attention, and could lead their gaze into different directions during testing. Current method to measure strabismus angles Currently, the measurement of the angle of strabismus is performed manually by an orthoptist. During this test, the orthoptist is responsible for drawing the child’s attention. This additional task of entertaining complicates his work. DAISY- automatic strabismus angle measurement At the faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Delft University of Technology, an instrument is being developed, the DAISY, which can measure the angle of strabismus in crossed eyed people automatically. This method requires of the patient to look in different directions of gaze for about 1 second per direction. In testing adults, this is no problem, whereas in working with young children this can be problematic. The essence of this project was therefore twofold: - To establish how to draw a child’s attention. - To establish how to have a child look into different directions of gaze. The eye-catcher and its functioning The eye-catcher will in the future be functioning together with the DAISY. Because of the fact that the latter is still being developed, it is not yet entirely clear what it’s looks and exact method of functioning will be like. What can be assumed as a basic starting point for the development of the eye-catcher is that a child’s attention needs to be drawn during a period of 30 to 60 seconds of which the child has to be looking at one specific point for approximately one second at a time. Ideally, measurements are being performed in 9 different directions of gaze. The DAISY has to be able to register exactly where the child is looking at. Also of importance is that the eye-catcher needs to be attractive to the child and can’t disturb the DAISY’s functioning, or the other way around. These basic thoughts and considerations formed the basis for my research. Automatic measuring and entertaining The final result will be that both the actual measurement as drawing the attention of the child, can be done automatically in stead of manually using the combination of the DAISY and eye-catcher. Process of the project The final design of the eye-catcher was designed after an in depth process of research of the human eye, spending time with different orthoptists and eye doctors, watching strabismus surgery, in depth study of the development of the DAISY, performing a survey among hundred orthoptists (one third of all orthoptists in The Netherlands), further development of ideas in a creative session and literature research on children in the relevant age group. The design that was made was then tested on the target group. Design of the eye-catcher The essence of the design consists of popular children’s comic book figures that are digitally shown, one after the other, in nine different directions of gaze. Results practical tests with the eye-catcher The main objective of testing was to establish whether the eye-catcher was able to draw the children’s attention. Results showed that the eye-catcher was definitely capable of doing so, as well as directing the children’s attention towards one of the nine directions of gaze and keep their focus there. The nine different directions were not always easy to distinguish. Eye versus head movements towards a stimulus The test results confirmed what is described in the current literature on this matter: a child first draws his eyes towards a certain direction, for example towards the left. Secondly, he will turn his entire head to the left so that he does still look at the same object but his eyes are not turned leftwards anymore.","eye-catcher; attention; young children; strabismus; DAISY; cross-eyedness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Decennia lang was er voornamelijk groei te herkennen, echter in delen van Nederland is een ommekeer merkbaar. Bevolkingsprognoses voorspellen dat met name de periferie last gaat krijgen van krimp (PBL/CBS, 2010). Bewoners in krimpgebieden zullen de gevolgen van krimp ervaren door het verdwijnen van voorzieningen in hun wijk (onder andere buurtwinkels, scholen en sportvoorzieningen), waardoor de afstand tussen wonen en voorzieningen steeds groter wordt. Jongeren die gaan studeren vertrekken naar de grote steden en zullen daar ook blijven, omdat daar werk te vinden is. Toenemende leegstand is het gevolg, waardoor de leefbaarheid in wijken onder druk komt te staan. Krimp omvat niet enkel een vermindering van het aantal inwoners en huishoudens, maar ook de bevolkingssamenstelling is aan verandering onderhevig. Het doel van het onderzoek is om te bepalen in hoeverre herstructurering, zoals het momenteel in Nederland wordt toegepast, effectief wordt ingezet bij het bereiken van het doel van Parkstad Limburg om de gevolgen van krimp aan te pakken. De focus zal daarbij liggen op hoe Parkstad Limburg haar herstructureringsvisie tot uitvoering kan brengen.

Why Businesses in informal settlements run almost 24 hours a day producing just enough to earn a living. Time is money. Goods and raw materials, manufactured by these businesses, are exported worldwide. Local Businesses seem fully integrated in the international trade system. When taking a closer look however, we find these local businesses to be disconnect to the world. Businesses cannot get out of socioeconomic isolation and highly depend on others to access market relevant information. They cannot benefit form the global market. In the mean while mobile phones, Internet and social media bridge distances and connect people all over the world. Upcoming economies and increased specialisation force the global market to expand. What In a world that is becoming smaller and a market that is continuously globalising, there is a perfect fit for a service that makes use of these new communication technologies to connect the unconnected local businesses to a prosperous global market. The service, WeTrade, is built on three components. First a mobile address identifies businesses. Second, a market information platform offers live and online market information and is accessible via mobile phone and Internet. Third a reliable, local office allows businesses to transfer money and enables worldwide transportation. How WeTrade is irresistible and triggers business owners to join trading. It is simple. Demand literally comes to the local businesses waiting to be priced. The platform is informative and allows businesses to explore the global market. Businesses strengthen in number while being member of a cooperation that shares information and responsibility. The service guides businesses trough the process and stimulates and supports them to find their way out of isolation and to be autonomic.

(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G. (mentor)","2012","This executive summary summarizes the graduation project of Sharon-Dewi Stolp, student at Delft University of Technology. This graduation project originates from a frequently asked question by patients recovering from joint replacement surgery of the lower extremity. Orthopaedic surgeon dr. Sewnath experienced at the Vlietland hospital a lot of uncertainty within his patients, concerning the use of their recently operated leg. After a few days of hospitalization, the patients have to enter a car with their new knee- or hip prosthesis in order to get home. They are not yet used to their replaced joint and need instructions from professionals to find out what is possible and to receive a little push to overcome their fear of hurting their recently operated leg. During rehabilitation patients often ask when they will be able to drive a car again. At this moment there is no legislation concerning traffic participation of temporarily disabled or recently operated persons. The responsibility lies with the medical professionals. However, they lack the means of assessing their patients on the fitness of driver related skills. The main objective for this project is to design a rehabilitation device that supports post-operative orthopaedic patients in recovering function after total hip or knee arthroplasty. A series of orthopaedic training devices is designed, consisting out of four different products, to fulfil this objective. The first product is the O.R.T.O.-auto which will be placed on the orthopaedic department of the hospital. With this product patients can set their benchmarks, practice getting in- and out of a car right after surgery and validate when they restored all their driving related skills to a healthy level at a later stage of the rehabilitation phase. When practicing getting in- and out of the car, patients with a hip prosthesis will also make use of the second product; the Ranger-Hip. This device monitors the angle the hip makes and warns the patient when they risk dislocating the joint. After leaving the hospital, the patients can take a training kit with them to their home, consisting out of a Pedal-Box and for people with a knee prosthesis also the Ranger-Knee is included. On the tablet that is provided in the Pedal-Box an exercise program can be followed and extensive feedback is given to the patient. The Pedal-Box is able to train the force exertion, motor control, capabilities for coordination and responsiveness of post-operative patients recovering from total hip or knee arthroplasty. With the Ranger-Knee the patient is able to train the range of motion of the replaced knee joint and prevent scarring of the tissue. With the validation of their restored capabilities, patients will regain confidence in themselves when conducting daily activities. This enables them to actively participate in society again. The implementation of the products by the hospital may result in the creation of guidelines, with which the orthopaedic surgeons are able to assess the patients driving capabilities and provide them with a well-founded advice. This graduation project covers the entire design process. From an extensive exploratory research to the formulation of a design brief, to the development of concepts and to further detailing in the embodiment design phase.

(mentor); Schmehl, R. (mentor); Rixen, D.J. (mentor); Zadpoor, A.A. (mentor)","2012","The kite is modelled with the non-linear finite element method to stay close to its physical properties and represent its full non-linear flexible behaviour. The inflatable beams in the leading edge and struts are modelled with regular beam elements that represent the behaviour to reduce the amount of degrees of freedom drastically. The canopy is modelled with shell elements and uses a coarse mesh to reduce the computation time without losing essential deformation modes. The aerodynamic model of Breukels [7] is used to describe the distributed aerodynamic forces exerted on the kite depending on its deformation. The model is based on the assumption that the kite can be divided into a finite number of two dimensional wing sections. The aerodynamic properties are determined for each wing section from a set of two dimension CFD experiments and distributed over the wing section using a set of weight factors. The finite element kite model and aerodynamic model form a fluid-structure-interaction problem together that needs to be solved iteratively. A solving algorithm is introduced that splits the structural and aerodynamic convergence and uses a load stepping algorithm to stabilize and speed-up convergence. The bridles and tether are modelled dynamically as simple spring-dampers using multi-body dynamic methods. The end of the bridles are connected to the kite at the bridle attachment points. The most important reduction principle is the assumption that the kite reacts quasi-static to the aerodynamic forces, because the inertia of the kite are very small compared to the aerodynamic forces. Therefore the local inertia of the kite are neglected when solving the finite element equations and the dynamic deformations of the kite can be approximated by a sequence of static solutions. The quasi-static fluid-structure-interaction problem returns forces that are exerted on the end points of the bridles in the dynamic simulation. These forces are assumed to remain constant during the period of a time step, eliminating the need to solve the fluid-structure-action problem in the dynamic differential equations. This method greatly reduces the amount of computation time, because the time integration only has to be done for the small number of degrees of freedom in the dynamic model and the fluid-structure-interaction problem only needs to be solved once in every time-step instead of multiple times in the time integration algorithm. All system components were implemented in Matlab and a controller was built to fly several figure eight tests with the model. Results show that the modelling approach leads to a fast and realistic model. A steering input results in dynamics and a real deformation that causes the kite to yaw comparable to real kites and other models. It can be concluded that all the assumptions were valid and led to a model that captures the kite behaviour realistically. The model is a factor 25-30 slower than real time, which is very fast considering the complexity of the calculations and that it was implemented in a non compiled language. The clearly visible distinct deformation modes and non-linear force model make it also a suitable and interesting candidate for further new model reduction techniques. The aerodynamic model has some shortcomings resulting in an overestimation of the lift over drag ratio and is considered to be the main source of uncertainties in the whole model. Replacement with a better model should further improve the model and make it possible to do an extensive validation study. Concluding, the new proposed approach is successful: fast and realistic, flexible in its use, able to model all type of kites, a good candidate for further reduction and can be used for controller design and optimizing studies.","finite element analysis; power generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Nowadays traditional traffic simulation models are becoming more complex and more detailed. Often policy questions do not require this level of details and needs faster answers than can be reach with traditional models. Of course traditional traffic simulation models are necessary for the evaluations of transportation alternatives. It is relevant to have next to these complex models, simpler models, such as quick scan tools. With quick scan tools the effect of measurements/alternatives of infrastructure related projects in the strategic and tactical phase can be calculated. Among other things, there is need for quick scan tools for the acceleration of the reconnaissance phase in the “Meerjarenprogramma Infrastructuur, Ruimte en Transport” (MIRT) projects. According to the Projectdirectie Sneller & Beter there are at this moment no suitable quick scan tools for the MIRTprojects. From these findings the central problem follows that in current practice there is need for suitable quick scan tools for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives. In this thesis the objective is to develop a suitable quick scan tool for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives. To develop a suitable quick scan tool, first the application and requirements of quick scan tools needs to be specified. Policy questions in the phase of mind setting and in the reconnaissance phase can be answered with quick scan tools. The application of quick scan tools is at a high level of time, space and travel behaviour simplification. The policy questions can be mostly answered by the calculation of measures focussed at spatial planning, price policy, mobility management, public transport and the changing and extending of infrastructure. These measures require certain output. Quick scan tools should provide at least information about mobility effects and a quick scan tool distinct from other tools and detailed models by also provide the economic, environmental and safety effects. One of the requirements of a quick scan tool is that it should fit the application. These and other requirements can be divided in functional, performance, quality, output and input requirements and wishes. A quick scan tool differs from detailed models by the short computation time (performance requirement) and the low effort of the end users according to the interviewees. Low effort requires easy applicability and simple input. Other functional requirements are that quick scan tools should at least determine the direct behavioural changes of a measure and be able to assess different alternatives. The quality requirements are transparency, fitting logical transportation relations, no conflicts with traffic flow theory and visualisation reliability of the output. The output should fit logical transport relations and should not be in contradiction with traffic flow theory. Also a quick scan tool should visualize the reliability of the output, because otherwise the tool will be used by the customers like the model can make accurate predictions. One of the output requirements is that a quick scan tool requires a clear visualisation, so a tool can be used easily. Further more simple input and wide support for the input is required. Next to this requirement, the desires of quick scan tools are the connection with existing models and not only calculated the effect on mobility, but also other traffic related effects, such as environmental, economic and safety effects. Developing a new quick scan tool requires the overview of the existing quick scan tools to know the additional value of a new quick scan tool/method. Seventeen tools in the Netherlands and the United States are investigated. All the tools were in conflict with at least one requirement. The ScenarioVerkenner, Quick filter, Fast Simple Model and eventually also the Mobiliteitsscan are tools that meet almost all the requirements except visualisation of the reliability of the output. A new quick scan tool should provide inside in the reliability of the output. The calculation of the measures for mobility management are hard to determine with the existing quick scan tools. Also from the existing quick scan tools, it could conclude that no tool at this moment can calculate reliable travel times and because of this economic effects. Besides a tool that provides insight in mobility, environment, economy and safety is more likely to succeed, because the calculation of other traffic related effects is a large advantage of a quick scan tool compared to detailed models. Also the high level of time, space and behaviour simplification is often missing in the existing quick scan tools. In a quick scan tool methods are used to meet the requirements of a quick scan tool. The methods can simplify the data of time, space and travel behaviour. Time simplification can be done by choosing some time periods or taking the sum of multiple time periods. For the spatial simplification, zone simplification, route, link and node simplification can be used. Simplification exists of the simplification, selection or reduction of data or model elements. Also Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFD) can show the network performance. The MFD is a graph that reflects the outflow of a network compared to the accumulation. Simplified methods can be used to model the travel behaviour; trip generation, modal split, period of day and route assignment. Next to the simplification techniques some other methods can be used in quick scan tools, such as the incremental approach, elasticities, rules of thumps and demand and supply curves. With the incremental approach only the difference between the new situation and the reference scenario will be calculated without using an integral new equilibrium calculation. Another option is to calculated only the effects on roads with a certain traffic condition, such as congested roads. Elasticities and rules of thumb could make assumptions and so less calculation have to be made during the usage of a quick scan tool. With demand and supply curves the equilibrium between price and demand can be calculated. From the application, requirements, existing tools opportunities and methods for the development of quick scan tools or method for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives follow. The high level of simplification can be reached by corridor models. Corridor models are models in which cities/regions are visualized by dots and vectors represent the flows between the dots. A corridor model requires simple input. Another opportunity that will decrease the computation time enormously is spatial simplification based on traffic states. This innovative method offers the chance to develop a quick scan tool that meets the requirements. In this research the method of spatial simplification based on traffic states is developed. With this method the effect of measures that affects the total network or measures that effects changes in a specific area can be calculated. For the calculation of the measures that affects the total network, only the effect of the measure on the amount of trips is required. This can be determined by elasticities. The method works with an approximation of traffic assignment by interpolation between the traffic flows on a link for two assignments. When using the tool the choice can be made to simulate only certain traffic states. With this link categorization the high level of simplification can be reached. For the measures that affect a specific area, on forehand the advisor needs to define this area and assign the traffic from and to the area, so the distribution is known. With interpolation the effect of the measures in the area will be determined. A disadvantage of the method is that measures that affect certain links cannot be calculated, because this requires a new equilibrium. The developed method meets the requirements. The method can be used under conditions for spatial planning, pricing policy, mobility management and the improvements of public transport. A disadvantage of the method is that it requires a detailed underlying model, so it could not be used when little data is available. The model is assessed for spatial planning and pricing policy in the Nationaal Verkeers Model 2.0 (NVM 2.0). The categorization is divided in congested links, critical links or insignificant links. The computation time is less than ten seconds for the calculation of the congested links and 30 seconds for all the links instead of 5000 seconds with the traditional assignment. So the computation time is short and the calculation of only the congested links can be used when visiting a customer and direct results are required. When an advisor is writing a report in the office, the calculation of the other links can also be interesting, but the high level of simplification will be reached by the link categorisation. Certainly the implementation in a quick scan tool will require some extra time to visualize the results. For the implementation of the method in a quick scan tool, some recommendations are made. To calculate also the travel times correctly, another model than the NVM 2.0, should be used. STAQ, the static assignment model of Goudappel Coffeng BV with the calculation of the effect of congestion and spillback, can be used. For a complete suitable quick scan tool the effect of all the measures should be calculated. The calculation of the effect on the link loads can be calculated with the same scripts as for spatial planning and pricing policy. The used linear function works in the NVM 2.0. It could be that another function will fit better the reality. So by the implementation in STAQ, the recommendation is to investigate this function. Also the opportunities for the calculation of measures that affects a certain link should be investigated. Overall the method of spatial simplification based on traffic condition with interpolation is a good basis of a suitable quick scan tool for fast and coarse evaluations of transportation alternatives.","Quick scan tools; Omnitrans; Goudappel; models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport & Planning","",""

An ‘as-is’ project architecture, which represents the system landscape and business processes at the start of the project, and a ‘to-be’ project architecture, which represents how the system landscape and business processes should look when the project finishes, was developed. The goal of the project for which the architecture was developed is to change the system landscape in such a way that it can support the newly developed distribution model. The second part of the thesis focuses on research questions about Enterprise Architecture. The most important goal of this thesis is to describe how Enterprise Architecture can be implemented in an organization like Tata Steel. The Enterprise Architecture approach that Tata has chosen is described, evaluated and improvements are suggested.

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2012","Waag Society is in institute for art, science and technology that tries to bridge the gap between upcoming technologies, society and art. Waag Society is a non-profit organisation which is is only marginally subsidised. Most of their budget comes forth out of project financing. By coming up with new ideas, experiments and initiatives different investors and authorities see opportunities for society and finance their projects. Early 2010 the Creative Learning Lab (CLL), Waag Society’s educational branch, started the AR Lens Lamp project. One of the developers posed the idea of a magnifying lamp – a lens lamp - that replaces the magnification with augmentation. CLL then adopted the idea and analyzed it for the opportunities in education. They came up with an interaction format that combines finger tracking, optical character recognition (OCR) and Augmented Reality. With this combination people can call for digital information based on printed texts. Once the first prototype was built, the concept received a lot of positive feedback from people in education. With this positive response CLL and Waag Society were interested in taking this project a step further and try to take it ot the market. This AR Reading Lamp project worked out the continuing steps, and upgraded the interaction format into a product format. The project started with thorough analyses on the concept, the technology and all the stakeholders. The analyses showed that there are interesting opportunities for the concept, but also revealed that the concept needs to be taken back to the drawing board. There are interesting opportunities in reading education. The Dutch government makes all kinds of budget cuts in education, except for reading education and mathematics. Schools are forced to improve their performance on these subjects and therefore receive extra budgets. The concept of the AR Lens Lamp has the ability to aid the reading skill when it is being developed, and should therefore focus on this opportunity. Especially dyslectics can benefit a lot from multisensory support during the development of their reading skill. With this clear focus, the original AR Lens Lamp concept was taken back to the drawing board. The synthesis phase investigated a diversity of means to present digital content on to printed text. The diverging process showed where the core of the concept is: the interaction with the book. With direct competitors like tablets and smart phones, the AR Lens Lamp should keep the focus on the original source: the book. This led the development of the AR Reading Lamp. The AR Reading Lamp augments paper-based reading by projecting digital information directly on to printed text. It is a device that can be hooked up to a computer or future tablets. These devices run the software. When the user reads a text and does not understand a word, he or she can simply point out that particular word and receive projected digital support. The camera - that is placed next to the projector - scans the text through OCR and registers the position of the finger with a finger tracking algorithm. When the indicated word is present in the support database the user will receive the digital support.There are different levels of support possible. Depending on the challenge (developing the reading skill, dealing with a reading disorder or simply creating more reading fun) different types of support can be provided. The first user test showed that children who are developing the reading skill, react best to animated support that establishes a visual character-sound connection. This means that the software highlights the characters that are being pronounced by the audio support. The AR Reading Lamp uses the metaphor of a reading lamp. The concept design communicates this metaphor by refering to the traditional “bankers’ light”. This type of reading light was one of the first electric lights that was specially built to serve the purpose of reading. Its characteristic shape is so strong that it is still used in current lamp designs. The AR Reading Lamp thankfully adopts this shape to house the important components and express its liability. With the deliverance of a concept design, a software architecture, the hardware setup and two prototypes this project succeeded in translating the AR Lens Lamp into the AR Reading Lamp product format. Further steps however, still need to be taken in order to take this concept toe the market. To validate the concept a new research needs to be conducted on the long-term effects of this concept. This project can also find a partner in Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) LuminAR project. This project shows quite some overlap with the AR Reading Lamp and it is interesting to see how these two projects can complement each other.","Augmented Reality; Finger Tracking; Optical Character Recognition; Spatial Augmented Reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Simonse, L.W.L. (mentor)","2012","Project:#001 is a company that develops custom-made private label merchandise, promotional products and accessories that reinforces other companies in the mobility market. They have an expertise in textile and polymeric fabrics and they have a strong vision in how a brand is supposed to be translated into products. Due to difficulties in their current market, the company decides to explore the possibilities of developing an own branded product line of accessories for the automotive aftermarket, which results in three main objectives for this project: 1. determine a potential market for the company to introduce their own product line 2. develop the new brand identity 3. develop a strategy to implment the new product line. First a thorough company analysis was performed to discover the company’s potentials. The company is strong in brand translation and user-centred design. They have an expertise in designing carrying systems and garments from textile and polymeric fabrics. They have access to a network of producers in Asia. They are a small team that is flexible and fast. However, they have no experience in the business-to-consumer market, which relates to marketing and retail. The company resources are limited. Secondly the current brand values were discovered through internal interviews and analysis, which can be concluded through their beliefs. “Branding is design” “Design is more than simply printing a logo on a standard product” “Project:#001 is about design, development and production” “We reinforce brands”. To determine a potential market, an external analysis was performed on the automotive aftermarket. This involved interviews with different experts in this field and a quantitative online user research. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the automotive accessory market was a saturated market where the company will not be able to retain sustainable growth. Therefore further analysis was performed to seek out new opportunities, this included a fair trade visits and an interview with an expert. This resulted in three high potential search areas, “Mobility mix”, “Urban electric mobility” and “Smart textiles”. In the end, it was determined that the “Urban electric mobility” holds the highest potentials for the company to develop a product line on short-term. Subsequently, this new search area was further analysed, which resulted in two markets that were interesting for the company to enter on short-term, the electric bicycle market and the electric scooter market. Also it was determined that the young urban commuters in these markets were interesting for further exploration. A new brand development method was introduced, the human-centred branding model. This method is based on the brand relationship theory and focuses on the research of the internal brand context and the external brand context, which are subsequently combined to form the brand promise. The internal brand context was formulated through creative sessions with the organisation. This research involved context mapping methods, such as cultural probes and creating collages, to discover tacit and latent knowledge from the participants. In the end, meaningful insights were discovered, which were clustered and combined into clear diagrams, explaining their values and beliefs and giving anwers to the following questions: why do they do what they do? How do they do it? What do they do? The external brand context was formulated through an extensive user research, which was also based on context mapping methods, involving cultural probes and interviews. This research served multiple purposes, 1. discovering which user group the company should target 2. discovering insights to define the external brand context 3. discovering user needs that are important for product development. Based on the discovery of the insights, the external brand context could be formulated through the same diagram which explains: why do they do what they do? How do they do it? What do they do? Afterwards, the insights from the internal and external brand context were combined to explain the brand relationship. From here the brand promise is developed, explaining in relation to the users’ values, why the organisation do what they do, how they do it and what they do? Furthermore, a brand mantra is formed to summarize the brand promise and serve as guidance and inspiration for the organisation, “Meaningful Urban Traveling”. From the internal brand context a meaningful brand name and logo was designed in collaboration with the organisation. The brand was named “Mioti” which is the acronym for Meaningful Innovations Of Textile Inspirations. Furthermore, brand communication was visualized to translate the internal brand values, beliefs and future vision into strong visuals and understandable and inspiring messages. From the user research a target group has been defined through personas, which are the young professional, male and female. Also user needs were uncovered during the research, these are “Urban convenience” “Weather- and impactproof” “Secure and in sight” “presentation” “feel safe”. These needs were combined with the company’s expertise in developing carrying systems and protective garments to create a map of opportunities to be used in the product development. Also from the company analysis, potential products from the portfolio has been selected to indicate which expertise they can leverage from when designing the new product features. Finally an implementation strategy has been developed for the development of the new product line, involving a brand positioning plan, a product road map and the marketing mix. The strategy describes a differentiation strategy that focuses on a niche segment to avoid direct confrontations with existing competitors. Three important differentiation areas are, 1. product quality and design, 2. branding, 3. convenience and service. Furthermore, a key strategy for the company to create entry barriers against new entrants, is through partnerships with developers of electric mobility. By developing own branded products, the company will be able to put their ambitions in branding into practice without intermediaries. Designer(s) will work more efficiently, since they have to put less efforts in developing new products while reaching a wider audience. Lastly, there will be lower risks that stakeholders will perform backward integration compared to their current business.","brand development; brand communication; context mapping; implementation strategy; roadmapping; textile; electric mobility; urban commuters; product line","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-04-02","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

In the annual report on “Climate change and sea level rise in Viet Nam” MONRE has proposed 3 scenarios of sea level rise in the next 100 years viz. 60 cm (low emission scenario), 75 cm (medium emission scenario), 100 cm (high emission scenario). This study is implemented these 3 scenarios on 2 case studies of 2 sea ports: Nam Du deep sea port with researched structure is jetty structure and Tien Sa sea port with researched structure is breakwater. The thesis focuses on the impact of waves and sea level rise on these two types of structures. The objective of this report is to better understanding of how the hydraulic structure(breakwaters and jetties) be impacted by the rising sea level and waves in that SLR condition in the future; answer the question whether the designed structures are stable and functional enough to sustain with SLR. By the results from study, some conceptual recommendations will be proposed to account SLR in the future design. The results of this report shows that jetty structures are not touched by extreme maximum waves in 3 SLR scenarios. The structures themselves are designed included 30 cm of SLR and high enough for water not to transmit to the deck. However, Tien Sa breakwater is unstable if the sea level rises in next 100 years. The structure was not well designed enough to sustain with rising sea level and higher wave conditions. The solution for repairing is ballasting the caisson breakwater to 1m thickness or another proposing conceptual design is enlarging the caisson toe to 6m length to ensure the stability.","sea level rise; Vietnam; Port construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
