(mentor)","2016","High-order numerical methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics have undergone significant fundamental developments over the last two decades owing to combined efforts from the applied mathematics and engineering communities. Even though low-order numerical methods are still the standard in industry, the increased requirements of engineering applications have led to significant scientific interest in developing efficient and robust numerical methods. Applications that would benefit from high-order numerical methods include Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), Large Eddy simulations (LES), Computational Aero-Acoustics (CAA) and vortex dominated flows. The objective of this thesis is to successfully implement and validate a fifth order traditional WENO scheme in a finite volume framework, for a solver currently being developed in the Aerodynamics group of TU Delft. A detailed literature study of classical numerical schemes has been performed along with a study of the traditional WENO schemes. The quality of results using the fifth order scheme is studied for a variety of test cases to study the shock capturing ability of the scheme. Implementing the finite volume WENO schemes includes the calculation of numerical flux at cell faces using Gaussian quadrature formulas. The effect of varying the number of Gaussian quadrature points while calculating the numerical flux is investigated. Also, the effect of the approximate Riemann solvers on the quality of results is studied by implementing four different Riemann solvers and studying the results for different test cases using these Riemann solvers. The test cases are governed by the inviscid Euler equations and deals with flow in the compressible regime. They involve shocks, other discontinuities and often also complicated structures in the smooth part of the solution which tests the design of the schemes to be non-oscillatory at the discontinuities and still gives a high order of accuracy in the smooth parts of the flow. Convergence tests of the error for test cases using the linear advection equation is used to study the order of accuracy of the scheme using different number of Gaussian quadrature points. The tests clearly show that the order of accuracy remains the same irrespective of the number of quadrature points used. This result is important as it allows simulation run with just one quadrature point which is less expensive, and saves memory. This result is highly relevant while running test cases for LES where very fine grids have to be used. WENO schemes have been considered to be too dissipative for LES in their traditional form. This is indeed true as seen by Kelvin-Helmholtz type small scale vortices (which are characteristic of high Reynolds number flows), even in the test cases using the inviscid Euler equations, due to the inherent dissipation in the schemes. However, this could be seen as motivation for using the WENO schemes for Implicit LES where no explicit sub-grid scale models are used to represent the unresolved scales. The different Riemann solvers exhibit different levels of dissipation and recommendations are made for the choice of Riemann solvers according to the application.","CFD; numerical schemes; WENO; Riemann solver; Finite Volume","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Heijman, B. (mentor); van der Meer, W. (mentor); Bakker, M. (mentor)","2016","The increase in salinity of groundwater is a global problem (Van Weert et al. 2009). In the west of the Netherlands, seepage of saline and brackish groundwater into layers of freshwater increases the salinity in polders and around drinking water wells (Grakist et al. 2002, Olsthoorn 2008). Systems like PURO and the Freshkeeper abstract brackish groundwater and turn it into drinking water. In both systems, the salty groundwater is desalinised with a reverse osmosis membrane and the leftover brine with a high salt content is injected in a deeper layer with saline groundwater. A too high salt content will result in precipitation of crystals like calcium carbonate, which can clog the injection well. To prevent clogging, the production of freshwater should be balanced with the supersaturation of the brine. In addition, inhibitors can reduce or even completely hinder precipitation from supersaturated solutions. This research looked at the effect of the degree of supersaturation of calcium carbonate on the precipitation and clogging in a porous medium with a series of column experiments. In addition, it looked at the inhibition of calcium carbonate precipitation by humic acids with batch experiments. A Literature research and modelling with Phreeqc in combination with Python supported the experiments. Whenever the grains in the column were cemented together with calcium carbonate that has filled the pores, a clear decrease in the hydraulic conductivity could be observed. Both cementation and a decrease in hydraulic conductivity were found in the top of the column only. The presence of calcium carbonate crystals can trigger the precipitation of calcium carbonate from a metastable solution. In the growth models of Plummer et al. (1978), Schagen et al. (2008) and Wolthers et al. (2012) the rate of precipitation is linearly related with the surface area of calcium carbonate crystals. Column simulations with those models hence show that with more calcium carbonate seed crystals present in the column, the location of precipitation shifts more to the very start of the bed. Following the equation of Carman-Kozeney, precipitation focused on a short distance is much more disastrous for the hydraulic conductivity than when the same amount is distributed over a longer distance. Also, in radial flow, clogging close to the injection well will require a much higher pressure for injection than clogging further away from the well. Both the results of the column experiments and the equation of Carman-Kozeney show that a clear exponential increase in hydraulic resistance can only be observed after a period where calcium carbonate has already been precipitating. It can make the effect of precipitating calcium carbonate on the hydraulic conductivity deceiving: this relationship between conductivity and decreasing porosity together with the precipitation rate and increase in surface area accelerating each other, make that during the initial period of precipitation clogging is unnoticed. At relatively low SIcalcite’s – observed in column experiments with SIcalcite’s of 1.0 and 1.23 and calcium carbonate seeds – the presence of calcium carbonate seeds could trigger a metastable solution to become unstable. When there were no calcium carbonate crystals present, experiments with an SIcalcite of 1.0, 1.14 and 1.23 remained metastable – yet, during one contradicting set of experiments without calcite seeds and an SIcalcite of 1.14 precipitation and cementation did occur. Hence, the soil characteristics are crucial for the stability of a metastable solution. The dominant precipitationprocesses at those SIcalcite’s are growth and 2D-nucleation. These processes both rely on the presence of calcium carbonate. Nucleation becomes more dominant at higher values of SIcalcite, when the solution is no longer metastable. In the column experiments with an SIcalcite of 1.5, the dominant processes were homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. In addition, crystals that were found prior to the sand bed, show that homogeneous nucleation had also taken place. Consistent with the column experiments, the upper limit of metastability that was found in the batch experiments also lies somewhere between an SIcalcite of 1.0 and 1.5. Humic acids can inhibit the precipitation of calcium carbonate at high enough concentrations. Homogeneous nucleation in solutions with an SIcalcite of 1.5 was delayed, the rate was reduced and the final total precipitation was less in presence of 5.35mgC/l or more. 5.35 mgC/l Of humic acids also inhibited nucleation in solution with an SIcalcite of 2.0. However, only a small reduction of the final total precipitation could be observed. At lower SIcalcite, no nucleation had taken place (SIcalctie of 0.5) or no clear trend could be observed among different concentrations of humic acids (SIcalcite of 1.0).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Dielectric shimming is proven to be very useful in increasing the homogeneity of the 𝐵1+ field in high field MRI. Current optimization and design techniques for dielectric pad parameters are slow. The goal of this thesis is to find a fast and accurate pad design and optimization technique. Two new techniques are proposed. The first, a method that simply uses inspection by solving the forward problem in a relatively fast way. The other proposed technique follows a more analytical approach to find the optimal permittivity and conductivity of a pad in a couple of iterative steps with a Gauss-Newton method. This last technique uses a new proposed approach to predict the phase of the 𝐵1+ field in a direct fashion. These techniques provide fast and accurate simulation results for a two-dimensional abdominal body slice placed in a 3T MRI scanner for different pad scenarios. From these results it can be concluded that both proposed techniques generate comparable pads, which are able to increase the homogeneity of the 𝐵1+ field. A comparison between the two techniques is made. The Gauss-Newton method provides a fast, robust and accurate optimization technique for large scale problems, but offers less flexibility and insight to the data compared to the method via inspection. The flexibility of the method via inspection and the insight it provides is shown for different scenarios (pad location, multiple pads, pad shape, pad thickness), where the effect of the optimal permittivity and conductivity on the homogeneity of the resulting 𝐵1+ field is simulated. Even the maximum allowed SAR can be incorporated in this pad optimization technique.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Circuits and Systems","",""

Topology optimisation allows for efficient material distribution, and thus a reduction in weight. Topology-optimised floors are typically regarded as being difficult to produce, however, and cost too much to be considered in building designs. In order to reach a compromise between a low self-weight and low production costs, two features are included in the optimisation process. First, manufacturability is directly incorporated in the optimisation, rather than afterwards. Secondly, the highly malleable vacuumatic formwork system has been used as a premise. Its advantages may cause the formwork costs to be reduced considerably when producing floor slabs.","structural optimisation; topology optimisation; vacuumatic formwork; concrete; floor slab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

As the conducted case study showed, many variables come into play when implementing new technology. Specific within IT is the implementation complexity at the back-end; large new software applications often need to be embedded into the existing IT landscape of the client. This landscape is a complex infrastructure of various IT processes and systems. During implementation of new software, changes in one area of the landscape can have major consequences for IT processes on the other end of the infrastructure. The party responsible for maintaining the IT landscape is the Operations department of the client’s organization. This department has the responsibility of keeping the current system stable. A challenge within innovation is the conflicting mind-set between Development and Operations; one is in favor of change, while the other strives for stability. During the innovation process, stakeholders from both the Business and IT Operations should become involved to contribute their knowledge and function as a Champion within their organization to generate support. The knowledge boundaries that exist between the different disciplines should therefore be addressed by applying the right boundary object. This has resulted in the following design statement: ‘To design a work method that supports collaboration between Business, Development and IT Operations and creates a shared vision for the innovation process.’ This challenge has been addressed by designing three facilitated sessions that can be held during the innovation process. ‘SPARK’ is an ideation session, where opportunities and product ideas are generated and a shared vision is created. ‘MONITOR’ is a risk assessment session, where the impact of the innovation on the IT landscape of the client is discussed and a shared roadmap is created. ‘CHECK’ is a frequent risk management session where the majority of risks are exposed and to define concrete objectives to address these. To overcome the knowledge barriers between the three stakeholders, the sessions make use of Lego Serious Play (LSP) and Innovation Roadmapping. While LSP provides the stakeholders with the means to express themselves and observe complex innovation challenges from different angles, Innovation Roadmapping aligns the objectives between the different parties.","Innovation implementation; Information Technology; Knowledge Boundaries; Innovation Roadmapping; Lego Serious Play","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Khalafvand, S.S. (mentor)","2016","Altered flow and mass transfer patterns are thought to play an important role in the early onset of atherosclerosis. A disturbed wall shear distribution and the prevalence of hypoxic (low oxygen tension) are specifically believed to be atherogenic factors, which can function as a positive feedback on the development of atherosclerosis. In this work, blood flow and oxygen mass transport have been modelled in stenosed arteries and numerically evaluated, to better understand the atherogenic processes that contribute to this development. Three stenosed geometries have been considered: one with light (31% asymmetric area reduction) stenosis and two with moderate stenosis (56% area reductions, one of which asymmetric, another axisymmetric). Two different rheological models have been created for blood. In the first, blood is assumed to be Newtonian; in the latter, the Carreau-Yasuda model is considered to account for the shear thinning effect of blood and to reproduce a more physiologically accurate rheological model, after which the two models have been compared. The simulations mimicked the flow conditions in large arteries, with Re = 300 and using the velocity profile of the internal carotid artery for transient simulation runs. Results show that wall shear stress (WSS) and Sherwood profiles are highly dependent on stenosis geometry, although certain characteristics are found for all stenoses. First, a region of increased wall shear stress can be found proximal to the stenosis throat, usually followed by a low shear region distal to the stenosis throat. Wall shear stress magnitudes can reach 10 to 20 times the Poiseuille value depending on the geometry and the length of the stenosis. Second, the Sherwood profile in stenosed arteries follow the same characteristics, although asymmetric stenoses can lead to more complex patterns at both the diseased and healthy wall of a stenosed artery. One particular asymmetric stenosis geometry caused significant hypoxic regions just distal and distolateral to the stenosis throat, with Sherwood numbers as low as Sh = 1:37. This might indicate that oxygen transport to the wall is fluid phase-limited in these aforementioned regions. The lowered oxygen transport through the artery wall can lead to a change in wall permeability which has been linked to an early onset of atherosclerosis.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","ChemE/Chemical Engineering","","Transport Phenomena","",""

As the current safety codes have changed over the years, not all structures fulfil the current safety requirements, however replacement of the bridges brings undesirable high cost with it. Therefore alternative ways are sought to demonstrate the safety requirements. One way to do so is by proof loading, during which the structure is loaded in a controlled way. During proof loading stop criteria are used, which are measurable parameters that indicate the condition of the structure during the proof loading test.

(mentor); Kenjeres, S. (mentor)","2016","Bachelor project part of the double degree bachelor in mathematics and physics. Calculating the temperature field in the presence of vegetation has many practical applications, such as the study of urban heat islands, but much research still needs to be done in this field of study. The objective of this paper is to describe and test a model, which takes into account the cooling effect of transpiration of vegetation. To this end, first, the velocity field is modelled by the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations, with the turbulent behaviour represented by the k-ε turbulence model. The model of Katul et al. is used to account for the vegetation dependence of the air flow. Subsequently, the Reynolds averaged thermal energy equation and the simple gradient diffusion hypothesis are used to describe the temperature effects. In order to account for the cooling from transpiration of vegetation a sink term of the Reynolds averaged thermal energy equation was derived. In this derivation dimensional analysis was performed on the cooling power, approximated by Blocken et al. and Rahman et al., and other relevant properties. The finite volume method is used to discretise the differential equations. In this paper the simulations have all been performed within the same domain. This domain is defined by Liang and is a box shaped area, in which a forest is planted of non-uniform leaf area density. The first two simulations test whether the model without transpiration effects produces feasible results. Measurement data of the streamwise velocity showed good agreement and measurement data of the turbulent kinetic energy, which is a measure for the turbulence, also showed reasonable agreement. The results showed that, even without the thermal sink term active yet, the temperature field is affected significantly by the presence of vegetation. The following two simulations test the performance of the numerical simulations. The reference grid was changed to contain double the amount of control volumes and half the amount of control volumes and the results conclude that both the velocity and the temperature are grid independent. The turbulent kinetic energy is slightly dependent on the chosen grid. The values of most properties on the faces of the control volumes were approximated by the central differencing scheme, but for the convective terms the upwind differencing scheme was used. The values of the convective terms were also approximated with the quadratic differencing scheme. These schemes show similar results in the middle of the domain, but at the boundary the quadratic differencing scheme shows some fluctuations which are not realistic. Further research is needed to explain this phenomenon. In the last simulation the thermal sink effects resulting from transpiration are implemented. Results show that the area in front of the forest is not affected by the sink and that the region inside the forest is most affected by the its implementation. The maximum temperature difference, with respect to the results without transpiration effects, was about 7.1 °C, which shows that the effect of the sink is extensive. The results of this simulation seem intuitively correct, however, it would be an excellent subject for future research to test these results against measurement data. Another interesting subject for future research would be to experiment with different expressions of the thermal sink term to see how this influences the solution.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Physics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis studies the impact of reinforcement detailing on the behaviour of a reinforced concrete structure. Using a retaining wall as a case-study, the performance of two commonly used alternative reinforcement layouts (of which one is wrong) are studied and compared. Reinforcement Layout 1 had the main reinforcement (from the wall) bent towards the heel in the base slab. For Reinforcement Layout 2, the reinforcement was bent towards the toe. This study focused on the reinforcement details used in the D-region, and on how it impacts the capacity, joint efficiency and failure mode of the structure. First, a literature review is carried out which focused on the behaviour of corner joints from experimental works available in literature. Next, a strut and tie model of the D-region is made. From the strut and tie model, the opening moments acting on the structure subjects the re-entrant corner region to a concentration of tensile stresses, while a compressive stress field acts concurrently with transverse tension within the core of the joint. The internal forces within the D-region are evaluated, and the required steel areas computed. Afterwards, ATENA FEM software is used to model the structure, and to study the impact of the alternative reinforcement layouts on the capacity and behavior of the structure. Some aspects of the structural behavior studied include the stress and strain distribution in the concrete, crack width, crack pattern, steel stress and strain distribution etc. The results obtained from the FEM analysis was sensitive to bond model defined in the material model. When perfect-bond was assumed in the FEM analysis, Reinforcement Layout 1 attained a joint efficiency of 72.4%, while Reinforcement Layout 2 achieved 88% joint efficiency. In his experimental works on similar details, Nilsson (1973) had obtained a joint efficiency of 60% for Reinforcement Layout 1, a range between 82% to 102% for Reinforcement Layout 2. The disparity between FEM result and experimental result for Reinforcement Layout 1 occurred because perfect-bond was assumed in the FEM model. With cracking playing prominent role in this structure, perfect bond assumption is not valid, and some slip is inevitable. To verify, a bond-slip relation is used to model the structure, resulting in 62% joint efficiency for Reinforcement Layout 1, and 82% joint efficiency for Reinforcement Layout 2. These values obtained with bond-slip model are much closer to experimental values than those obtained with perfect bond. The reinforcement layout used also had significant impact on the joint behavior. In Reinforcement Layout 1, the reinforcement (tie) from the wall was not properly anchored in the nodal region in the slab. The compressive stress field (i.e. inclined strut) was observed to flow past the bent part of the reinforcement without much interaction. The force transfer between the inclined strut and the tie was not effective. Also, wide cracks occurred along the inclined strut from the action of transverse tension (caused by the opening moment). These cracks which further weakened the strut. This detail had a diagonal tension cracking failure mode. For Reinforcement Layout 2, a clearly defined nodal region exists. A CTT node formed allowed for effective force transfer (at the node) between the concrete and steel. Furthermore, the bent part of the reinforcement crossed the path of the inclined strut, and helped to control crack width. The reinforcement also provided confinement to the inclined strut which further increased its strength. This detail prevented diagonal tension cracking failure, hence the higher capacity it achieved. Failure was by crushing of concrete along the joint – slab interface, after formation of a wide vertical crack extending from the re-entrant corner downwards into the slab. Adding a diagonal bar, placed 45° around the re-entrant corner, helped to control this re-entrant corner crack, thus ensuring that over 100% joint efficiency is achieved. In conclusion, Reinforcement Layout 1 is a poor detail. Though common in practice, a node is not properly formed in this detail, thus force transfer capacity between concrete and steel is not effective.","detailing; struts and tie; node; retaining walls","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

The primary objective of this study is to develop a non-isothermal wellbore simulator to model steady-state fluid flow (such as production from, or injection to, a reservoir) and the associated heat flow. Starting from an existing numerical well bore flow model in MATLAB, this work aims at implementing a coupled flow-heat transfer well bore model. To solve the governing differential equations in each interval of the well, a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used with a standard MATLAB function that integrates the pressure and temperature gradient equations simultaneously. The surrounding formation temperature and the flowing fluids thermodynamic properties are updated in each well depth intervals to account for changes in heat-transfer rate between the wellbore fluid and the formation. Model validation has been performed by running four field examples. In all cases, the model results are in good agreement with the field data.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Over the years gradually flight management systems have been added to airplanes which reduce pilot workload and increase safety. These systems however do not provide an adequate response when in an emergency situation the aircraft loses all thrust. A system that creates glide trajectories to airports that are reachable would enable pilots to focus their attention on stabilizing and regaining control in an in-flight emergency situation. The objective of this study is to develop such an emergency flight system that can generate glide trajectories from the position at which the emergency starts to all reachable runways. By first determining the maximum range of the aircraft, a footprint is defined in which the reachable runways are identified. To reduce risk on board as well as on the ground, the trajectories generated must be balanced between flying over populated areas effectively increasing the risk of loss of life on ground or avoiding populated areas possibly increasing the risk of losing control of the aircraft by having to be airborne for a longer period of time. The trajectories to all reachable runways are ranked based on several airport and runway quality factors and are presented to the pilot to choose from. The trajectories are generated by an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm which is commonly used in robotics for path planning. In this research it is investigated if it can also be applied in the field of aeronautics for the purpose of an on line emergency trajectory planner. In a test scenarios, trajectories are generated by several ADP variants and compared with a benchmark trajectory created by the A* algorithm. This algorithm generates optimal obstacle avoiding trajectories providing certain conditions are met. The ADP variants that provides the best result is chosen to generate the trajectories for the emergency trajectory planner in a scenario in which the aircraft has to generate trajectories to the reachable airports in the footprint. From the results it could be concluded that approximate dynamic programming can successfully create trajectories to all reachable airports in the footprint. It however proves less suitable to create trajectories on line in emergency situations because the time the algorithm needs to create trajectories is too long to be able to implement it in emergency situations.","Emergeny Trajectory Planner; Approximate Dynamic Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-29","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","","",""

Well known turbulence models | i.e. the k-epsilon and k-omega SST model | are used and compared in their performance against each other and a set of experimental data. The formal research question is ""What models are available for the simulation of vertical axis wind turbines and what considerations should be taken into account to most effectively obtain the power coefficient of those turbines?"" The results show that the 2D k-epsilon simulations approximate the experimental data the closest, but that the difference between the simulations and the experiment in the k-omega model can be explained by the simulations being 2D and the experiment being 3D. To improve the results and verify that a 3D simulation indeed does produce better results, another study should be conducted in 3D when more computation power is readily available. As to what considerations should be taken into account: Meshing determines largely how long a simulation will take and to what accuracy a result can be calculated. The sliding mesh method should be used to decrease calculation time, so that the mesh does not need to be recalculated every time step. The orders of the different variables should be set to second order accuracy for the pressure p, the momentum, the turbulent kinetic energy k and the time derivative. The second order calculation of these variables results in a significant increase in accuracy of the simulations relative to simulations conducted in first order accuracy. For further improvement a research could be set up that involves both the experimental and the CFD part. That way the practical limitations to building a wind turbine could be modelled in the simulations, possibly resulting in even better synergy between the measurements and the simulations.","CFD; Simulation; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; Optimization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","ChemE/Chemical Engineering","","Transport Phenomena","",""

The environmental forces that act upon the jacket during the installation are based on an irregular wave field. 2000 Seeds were required her in, to find out that the maximum DAF values of the crane cable has a Weibull distribution. In order to reduce computational time, only 50 simulations per wave condition of interest are done, from which an insight is gained into which wave combinations should be handled with extra care. Those with a wave period of 4 to 5 seconds showed resonant behaviour with the waves, resulting in un-acceptable slack and causing the load cable DAF values to exceed the maximum allowable value of 1.3. For significant wave heights of 2 meters, wave periods longer than 8 seconds showed tolerable DAF values. Synchronization of the jacket’s vertical oscillation with the waves showed to be an important initiator of high DAF. Since the initial oscillations are caused by slamming and the jacket's eigen-period is affected by the heave added mass, these two phenomena are very important.","jacket slamming; Offshore installation; suction bucket; time domain; MATLAB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

This thesis focusses on a new approach to simulate the electric current through these molecular devices. We followed the approach of Hod [17], which is based on the time propagation of the density matrix and adds a driving term to the Liouville-von Neumann equation. We have implemented this approach into a computer code to see whether this could correctly simulate a time-dependent transport problem. The setup for the simulations is a molecular junction, which is modelled under the tight-binding approximation. For appropriate damping rates, the simulations produced a steady-state current in close agreement with the Landauer current. An optimal damping rate was found, but the steady-state current is rather stable with respect to the choice of the damping rate. To simulate a time-dependent problem, we reproduced the results of Napitu [9] who modelled a molecular pump with the more traditional Keldysh Green’s function approach. To this end, our simulations do not match the traditional approach for this time-dependent setup. The reasons for the differences are still unclear. Finally, the driven Liouville-von Neumann equation has been checked with the Lindblad conditions. These turned out to be satisfied in the limit of infinite leads with equilibrium occupation. Intuitively we do not expect the driven Liouville-von Neumann equation to be in the Lindblad form without taking a limit and we have not succeeded in doing so. Although we have successfully reproduced Hod’s results, the results for the pump are still inconclusive. The disagreement with the results obtained by Napitu [9] may be due to a difference in the model or in the method used. This leads to recommendations for future research.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","QN/Quantum Nanoscience","","TN-TW","",""

(mentor)","2016","Liquefaction may have large inﬂuence on performance of anchored quay walls and is important to include in seismic design. Design codes provide evaluation methods that provide hardly any insight in the actual development of excess pore pressures and the don’t consider soil structure interaction. There is a need for tools that include these aspects, since performance based design principles are more often adopted in earth- quake engineering. In this research effects of excess pore pressures on dynamic earth pressures and dynamic behaviour of an anchored are investigated. Different evaluation methods are analysed on their performance. Initially prescribed pseudo-static methods in design codes are applied, followed by a dynamic analysis using ﬁnite element model PLAXIS. After a broad literature overview of available pseudo-static methods and sensitivity analysis. A case study in Akita Port is adopted where two similar anchored quay walls were both hit by the Nihonkai Chubu Earthquake in 1983. One quay wall survived the seismic event, the other suffered severe damage. Damage was related to occurrence of liquefaction in the backﬁll. Pseudo-static- and dynamic analyses are applied to assess both structures. Performance of both analyses is evaluated and effects of liquefaction are investigated. Pseudo-static analysis of the quay wall without liquefaction are, after reduction of the seismic coefﬁcient, rea- sonably in correspondence with observations. Active earth pressures are well predicted, while passive earth pressures are overestimated. The relatively simple method is however suitable to give a ﬁrst indication of failure/non-failure of the structure. On the other hand the pseudo-static method is not capable to realisti- cally include effects of excess pore pressures. Large stiffness differences between layers lead to exaggerated bending moments and displacements, again passive resistance is overestimated. Since Mononobe-Okabe is a limit equilibrium method, it is not well able to capture progressive failure. By performing a dynamic analysis, using the ﬁnite element model PLAXIS, insight is obtained in the actual soil structure interaction. The Hardening Soil small strain (HSsmall) constitutive material model is adopted to model the static and dynamic behaviour of soil not vulnerable to liquefaction. A calibrated dynamic cal- culation lead to reasonable accurate for the case without liquefaction. Bending moment distribution and displacements are in line with observations. Different earthquake motions lead to relatively large spread in displacement of the structure, less differences are found for bending moment distribution. To include effects of liquefaction the user-deﬁned UBC3D-PLM constitutive material model is assigned to potential liqueﬁable layers. Liquefaction resistance depends on the type of soil and on the stress state of the soil. By calibrating the UBC3D-PLM model a reasonably accurately prediction of the onset of liquefaction can be obtained for the considered stress state. Performance of the model deteriorates for variation of the stress state, especially for initial static shear stresses. Therefore a calibration method is developed to get around this limitation. Initially zones with a speciﬁc stress state are identiﬁed around the structure. Subsequently the model is calibrated to accurately predict the onset of liquefaction for each considered stress state, leading to a calibrated model parameter set for each zone. After adopting all parametersets for each zone a calibrated dynamic calculation is performed of the system, leading to reasonably accurate results of the development of excess pore pressures around the structure. Calculated displacements and bending moments are in line with observations in the ﬁeld and the failure mode is well predicted. Insight is gained in the development of excess pore pressures in time at different locations. Leading to the conclusion that the UBC3D-PLM model is capable to reasonable accurately evaluate liquefaction and corresponding effects on an anchored quay wall. Finally link is made between the followed procedure and applicability of this procedure for performing a dy- namic analysis including liquefaction for one of the anchored quay walls in the Eemshaven in Groningen. Important aspects that are typical for Groningen are the location of the bedrock and corresponding transla- tion of the earthquake motion and characteristics of the motion.","Liquefaction; Dynamic analysis; Plaxis; UBC3D-PLM; HSsmall; Anchored quay walls","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Mampaey Offshore Industries is currently developing an Intelligent DockLocking System (iDL), an automatic magnetic mooring system. A promising design case for iDL is ship to ship mooring in the port of Singapore. Ship to ship mooring operations are abundant and the port of Singapore is known as progressive and well willing to adopt innovativemaritime solutions. Applying iDL mooring instead of conventional mooring techniques could increase safety of mooring procedures, decrease mooring time, decrease mooring labor intensity and improve mooring operability. To achieve these goals, iDL has to withstand environmental conditions as they appear in Singapore. The aim of this thesis is to investigate if the current iDL system is able to execute ship to ship mooring operations in Singapore and if not, what improvements to iDL should be made. The following design case is defined: A 110m LNG Carrier (LNGC) is moored using iDL to a 290m Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU). Several environmental conditions have been investigated and it is concluded that above wind, wave and current loads, passing vessel loads are most critical in this ship to ship mooring operation. Hence, the following design load is defined: A 320m container vessel passes by at a distance of 100m with a velocity of 10kts. In order to incorporate the non-linear passing vessel forces, a 2 body coupled 12 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) time domain model is created. In this model iDL is implemented as an uncoupled 3 DOF spring damper system. After evaluating force and motion behavior of the current iDL, it turns out that the system in its current state is incapable of withstanding the impact of a passing vessel. Both iDL force and motion limits in surge and sway are exceeded. To improve force and motion behavior in sway, the iDL sway stiffness, damping and pretension are optimized. Pretension turns out to be the key parameter. A pretension of 125 kN is just high enough to maintain fender contact during the entire passing vessel motion, which results in minimumsway forces and motions. Secondly, optimum surge spring and damper coefficients of iDL are studied. Two types of optima can be determined. In case the surge spring coefficient of iDL is 500 kN/m (or higher), quasi-static motion behavior is obtained. Both surge motions and forces reach a minimum. A second minimum is found when iDL behaves as a purely damped system in surge. In case the LNGC is moored to the FSRU using iDL as described above, the resulting maximum iDL surge and sway forces are 120.5 kN and 131 kN respectively. If in a future system sufficient magnetic capacity is present to withstand these loads, iDL proves to be a feasible mooring solution.","passing vessels; dynamic mooring; time domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-07-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor); de Pater, C.J. (mentor)","2016","In hydraulic fracture modelling, fracture geometry along with the net pressure distribution in the fracture are the parameters the values of which are sought to be predicted away from the wellbore. In current industry standard fracture modelling packages, fracture dimensions are obtained from equilibrium height growth simulation models that are based on linear elasticity equations. Due to simplifying assumptions made in these pseudo 3D lumped models, there is considerable discrepancy between the model predicted fracture geometry and the ground truth as revealed from tiltmeter and microseismic fracture mapping techniques. Not only is the geometry different, but the observed fracturing net pressure is also higher. From numerous mapped field cases it has been established that the fractures are more contained than what is modeled.The lumped models that are commonly used for real time pressure matching and diagnostics have the advantages of faster computation and can also be trained to adhere to mapped microseismic results using field specific coefficients. Coupled simulation models that use discretized grids are computationally intensive but can give more accurate results since they incorporate more of the relevant physics that affects fracture propagation. The use of effective stress as the propagation criteria rather than the stress intensity factor approach from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics introduces the pore pressure effect into the simulation. The pore pressure effect on effective stress and its relationship with fracture net pressure has been qualitatively observed from both field and experimental observations. The pore pressure effect is thus surmised to be an important factor that affects fracture growth and this study seeks to investigate that hypothesis. An analysis of more than 400 datafrac injections performed in clastic reservoirs and spanning a wide range of geological ages and depositional environments were studied to establish a relationship between observed net pressure and the effective stress in the reservoir. Synthetic geomechanical cases that represent underpressured, hydrostatic and overpressured reservoirs were built using the range of fracture design parameters from the database. An additional high effective stress case was built to appraise the upper limits of effective stress as observed from the treatments. A planar explicitly coupled 3D fracture simulator (Frac3D) based on an effective stress criterion and which uses cohesive element nodes near fracture tip was used to simulate fracture growth for the synthetic cases. The numerical results obtained from this FEM – FDM coupled simulator established that the pore pressure effect is indeed a significant parameter. The fracture dimensions were seen to be more radial with depletion and longer when overpressured. The net pressure increased with depletion and fracture width was highest in this case. The high pressure high effective stress case resulted in higher net pressure than the depleted case and this was indicative of the dominance of a high closure stress over the pore pressure effect. In direct comparisons with the lumped model the Frac3D simulator predicts higher net pressures and more contained fractures whereas the lumped model tended to understimate net pressure and overestimate fracture dimensions. Based on comparison of the Frac3D results and the field fracture treatment analysis, this thesis establishes a empirical correlation between fracture net pressure and effective stress for datafrac injections. The comparison between the synthetic simulations and the Frac3D simulations presents conclusive evidence that lumped models based on linear elasticity are inadequate in representing the pore pressure effect. The obtained correlation may be applied as a pressure matching parameter for datafrac injections prior to using other parameters in the general fracture diagnostics workflow. The pore pressure effect also serves as an explanation for fracture containment in the absence of vertical stress contrast.","fracture containment; hydraulic fracturing; simulation, net pressure; pore pressure; effective stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","In 2002, several mooring chains of Girassol Off-loading buoy which was installed offshore Angola ruptured just after 8 months of service. A new failure mechanism called out-of plane bending(OPB) fatigue in mooring chain links was identified in addition to tension induced fatigue after a series of experiments. Currently, there are no models in literature which can comprehensively explain OPB mechanism in mooring chain links. Models to explain OPB mechanism are required to calculate OPB stresses in chain links for fatigue damage evaluation. These models need to be ""simple"" and ""adequate"" in the sense that it should idealize the complicated geometry of chain links while giving accurate predictions of OPB stresses when subjected to rotation and tension, at a fraction of time used by solid finite element models or full scale experiments. The research carried out in this master's project deals with development of such models to explain OPB mechanism in mooring chain links. In this thesis, a new interlink stiffness model is developed to describe the nonlinear hysteritic relationship between OPB moment and interlink angle. The interlink stiffness model is then applied to a system of chain links using two different methods: a physics based approach and a semi-empirical approach. Each of these methods present a new approach to idealize a system of chain links. Then, a case study is presented in which a methodology to calculate OPB stresses for one sea-state is described. This methodology follows a de-coupled approach in which results of coupled floater-mooring analysis are taken as an input for the simplified models of chain links. To verify this methodology, a comparative study is performed at the end in which coupled floatermooring analysis is carried out with and without including the interlink stiffness of chain links.","mooring chain; out of plane bending; hysteresis modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Now, the two divisions Consumer Lifestyle and Healthcare will be integrated into one company focussing on solutions that help consumers to be more healthy in their daily lives. This realignment raises questions for those business groups that have no obvious relation to health, for example: How should a Philips vacuum cleaner empower a family “to be healthy and live well”? To help answering this question, it is useful to have a closer look on health: According to the World Health Organisation WHO, health is not only about our physical state, but also includes mental and social well-being. This expands the solution space with interesting opportunities that need to be explored. The relation of health, well-being and cleaning In a qualitative session with seven health-conscious young parents it was found that the relevant factors that make a life to be perceived as healthy are spending time with one’s family, to pursue and reach personal goals, to offer children a harmonious environment to grow up in, to be able to relax and maintain a sense of freedom in one’s decisions. The daily floor cleaning is seen as a chore that can contribute to the harmony at home, and it gives people a sense of achievement and happiness when the cleaning is done. However, this happens at the cost of valuable family time, and it causes stress which stands against one’s need for tranquillity. Due to the daily repetitive ‘Sisyphean’ characteristics of cleaning, people feel pressured and violated in their autonomy. Regular vacuum cleaners are not designed for frequent use From an interaction design perspective, the reasons for these negative traits can be related to a mismatch between the requirements of the use context and the design of regular vacuum cleaners: There is a high barrier to start cleaning due to all the steps necessary to set up the device (getting it from storage, unrolling cable, plugging it in). This is perceived as exhausting, annoying and disproportionately time consuming. The motivation to clean is low, because the cleaning conflicts with what we see as pleasant: spending time with family, hobbies, leisure or exercising. Cleaning in the living area, especially underneath the dinner table is frustrating because these obstacles disrupt the flow of cleaning. These practical, behavioural and emotional problems were addressed in an interaction and experience vision. Interaction and Experience Vision The interaction of vacuum cleaning should be casual, fluent, uncomplicated around obstacles and physically engaging, so that cleaning with the new design feels pleasant, joyful and make the user feel self-confident. The intended effect of this is that the anticipated effort is lowered, so that the user is motivated and able to start cleaning easily. After an extensive conceptualisation, in which three concepts were prototyped and evaluated with consumers, a final design was developed. Final Design: 360° The final design is an lightweight, agile, battery-powered stick vacuum cleaner that can easily get into the most tricky spaces. To allow the interaction to be fluent, the 360° freely slides over the floor. This gentle motion feels engaging and pleasurable, giving the user full freedom of movement, preventing disruptions of the cleaning flow and are engaging and fun. Key improvements of the 360° In an extensive user test of the 360° it was found that: There is no barrier to start anymore, emotionally nor practically. Users feel encouraged and optimistic. The sweeping movements are perceived as joyful. The ability to deal with obstacles prevent feelings of annoyance. In the end, users feel confident about the upcoming cleaning. While the 360° is not going to be radically life changing, it has shown to make a small contribution to one’s quality of life. It gives consumers confidence and a feeling of being capable of coping with the daily stresses of life. Lastly, people have more time for other activities that they value higher and more beneficial for their well-being. Recommendations This led the author to recommend Philips Floor Care to adopt a positioning that holistically involves both well-being and having a beneficial impact on consumers’ physical health.","Design for Well-Being; Positive Design; User experience; Floor Care; Design for Effect; Philips; Interaction Qualities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-07-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Aesthetics","","","",""

(mentor); de Smit, A. (mentor)","2016","The travel industry has changed a lot since the 1800’s - from ox-wagons, to horse and buggies, to trains and eventually, to airplanes. However, even with the current technology available, suitcases today still mostly focus only on material and structure changes when it comes to improvement. This may improve ergonomics and reliability of the suitcase itself, but it does not aid the user in the process of packing nor informing him/her about the items within the suitcase. By crossing the analog boundaries and entering the digital realm, it gives much possibility in the area of innovation. The result of this project was a concept design of a content aware luggage system, which consists of a technology embedded suitcase and a connected app. NARUS, the content aware luggage, succeeds in providing the user with a more efficient packing and travel experience through the use of cyber-physical systems. The main features of NARUS are: Packing List Generation Item Tracking Virtual Access The “Packing List Generation” feature shortens the planning and packing time for users by automatically extracting data from the user’s flight and hotel information and then generating a packing list based on the user’s previous preferences, duration, weather, and etc. This allows the user to confidently pack, without the unnecessary hassle of spending extra time looking up weather information and calculating how many outfits to bring for the trip. The “Item Tracking” feature uses the cameras embedded in the suitcase and object recognition to check items off the packing list and to remember the contents that were packed for the trip. The feature gives users’ peace of mind that they did not forget anything and that they will not forget anything on the way back. This feature also gives an estimate of the current weight of the suitcase as the user packs. The third feature, “Virtual Access,” allows the user to virtually look into their suitcase with their app. This is done through the 3D depth sensing cameras in the suitcase. This virtual access feature allows the user to travel more confidently and conveniently by giving the option to quickly look on their app to check for items and their location, without opening the physical suitcase. If the user is travelling with more than one suitcase, this feature also allows the user to virtually find things in a suitcase first, preventing them from opening multiple suitcases unnecessarily. User tests show that using this app before looking for an item in the suitcase led to significantly shorter search times.","suitcase; smart luggage; content aware","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","IPD","",""

Though significant effort has gone into understanding this complicated fluid-structure interaction problem, major challenges remain in modelling and predicting the response of such structures. The work presented in this thesis applies the modal approach to do motion reconstruction of the riser VIV from experimental data at first and then performs some analyses to the riser VIV response based on the reconstructed result. In the first part of the thesis, the modal approach is classified into the frequency domain method and the time domain method according to the types of the measurement data. Two systematic frameworks to do motion reconstruction are built for these two methods. Besides, two factors probably leading to the reconstruction error are proposed. One is using the strain measurement to identify the low modes VIV motion and the other one is unreasonable choice of participating modes. In the second part of the thesis, the riser VIV motion in ExxonMobil VIV test is reconstructed using the frequency domain method and that in the second Gulf Stream VIV test is reconstructed using the time domain method. In the reconstruction process, several problems are needed to be solved, such as the choice of time window, filtering data and the choice of participating modes. And the accuracy of the reconstructed result is verified using the extraction method. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the reconstruction errors induced by the above two facors. In the final part of the thesis, some key parameters are extracted out to show the effects of external conditions, e.g. current profile, current speed and strake coverage, on the VIV displacement magnitude and response frequency of the riser. Besides, three methods are provided to identify the travelling wave in the riser VIV response.","VIV test data and modal approach; motion reconstruction; vortex-induced vibration; long flexible riser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","QoS (Quality of Service) control is an important concept in computer networking as it is related to end user experience. End-to-end QoS guarantees, in particular, can give firm guarantees to end hosts. Unfortunately, it has never actually been used on the Internet since it was deemed too complicated. With the emergence of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow as its most popular standards, we have an opportunity to re-introduce the QoS control concept. The centralized nature and programmability of OpenFlow allow more flexible and more simple QoS control. In this thesis, we propose an end-to-end bandwidth guaranteeing model for OpenFlow. The primary design consideration of the model is to allow QoS flow to send more than its guaranteed rate. To further maximize the overall network utilization, best-effort flows are allowed to use any unused bandwidth in the network. Bandwidth borrowing concept is employed to achieved this. To ensure that it will not affect the guaranteed bandwidth for the QoS flows, we analyze the reliability of the bandwidth borrowing concept in Linux HTB, which is used as the underlying mechanism of OpenFlow queue. From the simulations, we found that the borrowed bandwidth is returned instantly when a QoS flow requires the bandwidth. Thus, it is possible to guarantee bandwidth and maximize bandwidth utilization at the same time. We also explore the possibility of using OpenFlow meter table for traffic aggregation. The aggregation only puts overheads in the first switch, but no other complexities added in the subsequent switches. Therefore, it solves the scalability problem which commonly associated with end-to-end QoS guarantees.","Quality of Service; Software-defined networking; OpenFlow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Telecommunications and sensing system","",""

(mentor)","2016","Io, the innermost Galilean moon of Jupiter, is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. Its volcanism is driven by tidal foces, which are in turn sustained by the Laplace resonance between Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Tides have significant impact on a body's characteristics. The liquid ocean underneath Europa's icy surface is sustained by tidal heating. Similarly, tidally-heated exomoons may be able to support life well outside the habitable zone. Tidal forces influence the orbital evolution of a body. Consequently, the orbital evolution also affects the tidal evolution. Thus, it is important to understand how tides drive the Jupiter system and how sustainable the tidal heating that Io experiences is. Additionally, the interior structure of both Jupiter and Io are not very well understood nor constrained, but govern the orbital-tidal evolution via the Love number k2 and the quality factor Q. The orbital motion and tidal evolution of the Jupiter system was modelled. For this, existing TUDAT functions, for example for third-body gravitational acceleration, were combined with new tidal acceleration models. To enable long-term stability and fast computation of the integration a 4 th -order symplectic integrator with Wisdom-Holman split was applied. This type of energy-conserving integrator has limited applicability in the case of small dissipative forces, but requires fewer force evaluation than, for example, a Runge-Kutta integrator of the same order. A variety of reasonable values for k2 and Q have been tested, as well as extreme cases. It was found that the tides raised on Jupiter by Io have a negligible effect on the evolution of the system. On the other hand, the tides raised on Io by Jupiter profoundly impact the evolution of the inner moons. Over the course of five thousand years, Io migrates inwards by several thousand kilometre. In doing so, Europa is brought into a closer orbit as well, to retain the resonance. Similarly, the eccentricity of both Io and Europa decreases, which in turn reduces the dissipated tidal energy and -heating. With Io being in spin-orbit resonance, tidal forces due to tides on Io are not readily applied. Multiple variations of analytical expressions of tides on Io have been evaluated. The results of this thesis provide a qualtiative assessment of the evolution of the Jupiter system and of the sustainability of Io's strong volcanism. The insight gathered on the modelling of tides and their effects on spin-orbit-resonant bodies in particular will benefit future work on the evolution of moons in the Solar System as well as exosystems.","Io; Jupiter; tides; orbital evolution; orbital stability symplectic integrator; Love number; quality factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-22","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","MSc Spaceflight","",""

(mentor)","2016","Aircraft concepts with high aspect ratio wings have been investigated more extensively in the recent past, as such configurations would reduce the induced drag significantly. At the same time, the high aspect ratio challenges the wing’s aero-structural stability (flutter). Therefore there is a need to perform aero-structural analysis already within the conceptual design phase, preferably in an automated fashion to enable the execution of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). This study has investigated methods to directly incorporate flutter speed predictions as constraints in an automated optimization process for conceptual design of aircraft. The computationally expensive flutter calculations have been modelled using different surrogate models (SM) to reduce calculation time in the automated design process. The combination of different surrogate and design of experiments (DOE) methods have been investigated and compared. Each combination of SM and DOE provides an indication of the trade-off between computation time and precision. The MultiFit software tool, developed by the Netherlands Aerospace Centre, was used to set up the different SMs. Artificial neural networks have shown the best capabilities in representing the behaviour of the flutter speed. Furthermore, surrogate-based optimization (SBO) methods have been able to find the same optimum design point at lower computational cost compared to the classical (non-surrogate) multidisciplinary feasible (MDF) MDO architecture. In an attempt to reduce optimization time even further, an adaptive surrogate modelling approach has been incorporated in the surrogate-based optimization method. The proposed method starts with a small DOE to create an initial SM. Then, an SBO is performed on this model. The value of the resulting optimum is recalculated using the complete multidisciplinary analysis and this new design point is then added to the DOE. A new surrogate model is created and an SBO is performed using the earlier found optimum as a starting point. This process is repeated until the process converges. The case study in this research has shown that adaptive surrogate-based optimization can be an efficient method to find the optimum of the objective function at a low computational cost, although more advanced enrichment and convergence criteria are recommended to improve the algorithm.","Mutlidisciplinary Design Optimization; MDO; surrogate modelling; SBO; surrogate-based optimization; strut-braced wing; flutter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

The goal of this research is to create a market share model that is able to detect the airline attributes that show significant impact on market share in the markets before and after liberalization. The generalized linear model (GLM) method with logit link function was chosen to create the airline market share model which is a novelty in the academic body of knowledge. The market share model is applied to the case study of the Azorean archipelagos that was liberalized in 2015.

When comparing the situation before and after liberalization for the return market between Ponta Delgada and Lisbon, the impact of frequency per day was found to increase due to liberalization whereas the impact of the constant decreases. Also, the importance of the ticket price was higher after liberalization which supports the findings in literature, that liberalization triggers more competition and results in higher pressure on price.","market share model; GLM; generalized linear model; fractional response variable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Aerospace Transport & Operations","",""

(mentor)","2016","Glass has become one of the most popular and complex building materials used today, because of virtually unlimited aesthetic options, combined with outstanding performance. The growing interest of contemporary architecture to use glass in large façade surfaces raises technical issues. In order to propose reliable engineering solutions in glass constructions, understanding the failure mechanisms is vital. The vast majority of the occasional failures of glass panes in facades are caused by other factors than the loads allowed for in design codes. Thermal breakage is one of these reasons. Glass in the vision and non-vision areas of a façade expands in response to the heat of the sun. Internal thermal stresses are developed when glass is subjected to variations in temperature across its area. The edges of the glass are encased within the rebate of the frame and are therefore protected from the direct heat of the sun, they heat up more slowly and expand less. If the temperature difference between the main area of the glass and the edges causes the development of stresses that exceed the glass strength, the glass may crack. This is referred to as thermal breakage. Thermal actions are simplified in literature and the standards and fatigue of a glass is not accounted for. Only simple façade configurations are taken into account, while they are non-applicable to double skin facades. Current literature is not detailed enough, finite element software studies need to be used to examine the temperature difference in glass façades and the induced stresses. The hereby MSc thesis explains the principle of thermal fracture and gives an awareness toward recognizing this type of failure and preventing its occurrence. In order to reduce the risk factor in thermal calculation methods, standards and software used in the industry were examined as part of a literature review. The practice of different calculation methods is elaborated for French, British, Belgian and European standard. The focus of the study is on analyzing the glass behavior under solar radiation with experimental procedures, examine and compare with previous numerical investigations and estimate the magnitude of thermal stresses calculated with different methods.","glass; breakage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Technology and Physics","",""

A chain consisting of n magnetic iron atomswith spin 2 has been examined. The spins of the iron atoms in the chain have been treated quantum mechanically. The spins of the atoms in the chain are governed by the time independent spinHamiltonian. A method has been developed to find the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian live in a 5n dimensional Hilbert space. The eigenstates and eigenenergies of the chain have been used to predict the inelastic tunneling current that would be measured during an inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy experiment. Furthermore, the eigenstates have been investigated for ’spin waves’. Note that these ’spin waves’ are not waves in time, but wavelike ’motions’ in Hilbert space. Results show that the current increases when the voltage increases. The differential conductance exhibits a jump if a state transition occurs. A system with a high temperature has a higher current and the current starts increasing for lower voltages than a system with lower temperature. Changing the position of the STM tip changes the interaction with the chain, resulting in different state transitions to occur. The influence of the location of the STM tip is the same for symmetric atoms in the chain. Increasing the number of atoms in the chain causes more jumps in the differential conductance, but the jumps are smaller. Decreasing the number of atoms causes less jumps in the differential conductance, but the jumps are bigger. The eigenstates are superpositions of z-basis elements and wavelike ’motions’ occur in the eigenstates.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","QN/Quantum Nanoscience","","Theoretical Physics","",""

With no cure yet available, patients undergo therapeutic rehabilitation for alleviating some of the SCA symptoms such as poor coordination of gait, eye, speech and hand movements. Understanding biology of the disease, especially of the cerebellar neurons involved, would help in finding treatments for SCA. One of the challenges of this research is related to the efficient differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into mature cerebellar neurons. Tissue engineering approaches involving novel biomaterials platforms may help in directing differentiation of pluripotent cells. Although researchers are able to generate the cerebellar progenitor cells (CPCs) from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), it is still unclear how these neurons develop and mature on various biomaterial platform. In this study, the effects of substrate and dynamic culture conditions on the in vitro differentiation, dendritogenesis and functionality of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC)-derived cerebellar progenitor cells have been examined both qualitatively and quantitatively over a culture period of 15 days. Differentiation and dendritogenesis of the CPCs were assessed by immunofluorescence at specific time points over the culture period, while the functionality of the differentiated cerebellar neurons has been assessed by recording electrophysiological activity. Viable and functional neurons were found on both Laminin and Matrigel substrate. However, Matrigel as a substrate enhanced cerebellar neuronal differentiation and resulted in extensive dendritogenesis as compared to Laminin substrate. Differentiated neurons revealed varying spontaneous intrinsic firing activity.

It is desirable to encapsulate the inhibitors before incorporation into the coating in order to provide a smart release only at specific conditions (acidic and alkaline pH in this case). ALD and MLD are processes to deposit conformal thin films with atomic and molecular level control, which leads to excellent step coverage and conformal deposition on complex micro- and nano-encapsulate structures. In this project, ALD and MLD process in different conditions were applied to three environmentally friendly inhibitors, namely 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT), Ce(NO3)3 and Li2CO3, which present high protection performance against corrosion of aluminum alloys. After MLD and ALD, coverage of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Leaching of coated inhibitors in solutions was studied by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis). Finally, the encapsulated inhibitors were incorporated into epoxy coating and applied on Al substrate. Inhibition efficiency was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results demonstrate that for the lithium carbonate, alumina shell can be formed in the surface via ALD process and a reduced leaching can be observed in the case of coated Li2CO3; healing effect can be observed in the encapsulated Li2CO3 doped coating, indicating the feasibility of this encapsulation concept on lithium carbonate. For the cerium nitrate, the inhibitor was coated with organic coating via MLD process but not well coated via ALD process; reduced leaching was not observed in this case and healing effect was not observed, neither. Organic shell can be well formed in the surface of 2-MBT, but the coating was not stable enough in solution to reduce leaching of the inhibitor; inhibition efficiency was not increased by doping the encapsulated 2-MBT into epoxy coating, possibly due to the reaction between shell material and epoxy coating.","corrosion inhibitor; encapsulation; atomic layer deposition; molecular layer deposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","With the depletion of traditional energy sources, the usage of renewable energy alternatives has increased over the past years. Among them, wind energy is considered as one of the most economical and environmentally friendly alternatives, and is seen as one of the main sources of energy in the future. A very promising field in the area of wind energy is offshore wind energy. Its currently high costs in comparison with onshore wind energy are forecasted to decrease in the coming years. Moreover, an acceleration in the deployment of the offshore wind industry is expected not only in Europe, but also in other regions such as Asia and America. With such development, which is also linked to an increase in the capacity of the turbines, one topic that has only been recently addressed is the effect of earthquakes on offshore wind turbines (OWT). There exists no clear guideline on how a seismic analysis should be performed in the design of OWTs as their dynamic behavior is far more complex when compared to regular buildings. Several authors have studied this topic and have found that aspects such as the aerodynamic damping of the turbine, the higher order mode influence or the soil-structure interaction should be taken into account, as they have a significant influence on the response of the turbine due to earthquake loading. However, there is a general lack of knowledge on how to include these aspects in the analysis, especially in combination with regular OWT design loads. Moreover, it is still unknown if earthquake loading could actually become design-driving for OWT design, which is currently governed by wind and wave load cases. This thesis aims to fill this knowledge gap by addressing all the aforementioned questions, up to a certain extent. As a first approach into getting an insight on the effect of seismic loading on OWT design, a linear finite element model of an OWT monopile was developed. This model accounts for the soil-structure interaction by using a set of distributed linear springs and dashpots to model the soil stiffness and damping, respectively. Moreover, these springs and dashpots are used to apply a set of ground motions (as displacements and velocities), which were selected and matched to a target response spectrum, and were subsequently calculated for different depths by using shear wave one-dimensional ground response analysis. The developed embedded monopile model was coupled with 4.0 MW wind turbine model using BHawC; the existing Siemens Wind Power in-house code for wind turbine nonlinear analysis in the time domain. This code combines elasticity and aerodynamics in order to calculate the loads induced on the turbine components due to different load cases, while accounting for its different operational states and the changes on the turbine dynamic properties because of them. Moreover, it also models features and systems that are present in the actual Siemens wind turbines to optimize its power production while minimizing the structural damages. Initially, a flexible soil-pile model was assumed along with relatively stiff soil conditions. It was found that the response is dominated by higher order eigenmodes during the earthquake event, and first order tower bending modes after it has passed. Moreover, a large influence of blade modes was observed along the whole height of the support structure, but particularly at the upper part (tower top and blades), where significant differences in the response were noted between both tower directions (fore-aft and side-side) and different modeled operational states. When comparing the results with the actual turbine design loads, it was found that the tower top and the blades (in the edgewise direction) could become design-driving if earthquake loading is present. Due to the influence of the soil properties in the overall system, two additional soil cases (medium and soft) were subsequently considered. It was found that the soft soil led to the highest load due to an amplification of the response in the frequency range in which the turbine was mostly excited. The effect of the ground response analysis could also be observed, as the response was further amplified for frequencies close to the fundamental frequencies of the soil deposit. Furthermore, new analyses were performed with variations in the model such as the soil damping, the soil-pile model and the ground response model. It was found that the way the soil is modeled can have a large impact in the design loads, particularly regarding the choice modeling approach taken for the soil-structure interaction (the spring and dashpot coefficients), albeit the choice of the dashpot coefficients alone did not have a significant influence on the results. Moreover, it was found that modeling the monopile as a single discrete spring and dashpot system through its equivalent dynamic impedances can lead to an important underestimation of the loads, which can be compensated by applying the actual monopile displacements and rotations induced by the earthquake loading, to account for the kinematic soil-structure interaction. As a main outcome of this study, it was concluded that earthquake loading can in fact become design-driving, particularly at the upper portion of the turbine due to the influence of the higher modes. In this context, it was highlighted that aspects such as the blades and the different turbine operational states should be included in the analysis, as they have a significant influence on the results. The importance of an accurate soil identification and modeling, along with a proper choice of ground motion time series were emphasized. Finally, recommendations for future research were given , particularly regarding the inclusion of aspects such as non-local soil-pile interfaces, soil nonlinearities, wave loading and frequency domain methods in the analysis.","offshore wind; seismic analysis; soil structure interaction; aero-elasticity; monopile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Nowadays an elastic design is applied for reinforcements with sheet pile walls, while for an anchored sheet pile wall for plastic design a redistribution of forces can take place in structure and surrounding soil which can lead to material savings. To have a deeper insight in this behaviour a full scale test is planned. In this master thesis the important variables that determine the magnitude of the bending moments in the sheet pile wall, size of the failure plane, magnitude of the load and other variables that are of importance have been studied.

These tools are required only at detailed design stages of a project. For the preliminary phase, however, a much simpler (yet reliable) 3D model can improve and speedup the design process. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop two different finite element models of an offshore wind turbine and compare their dynamic responses. In order to assess the extent of non-linearities in the environmental interactions arising due to structural motions, one model included the non-linear models of soil, hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads (called NLIM henceforth) while the other used linearized expressions for modelling them (called LIM henceforth). The soil was modelled as a series of non-linear (and linear) elastic springs using p-y curves. The conventionally used Morison's equation was compared with MacCamy and Fuchs' equation for modelling the hydrodynamic loads on a large diameter pile. It was found that the MacCamy and Fuchs' equation is a better way of modelling the hydrodynamic loads on submerged cylinders than Morison's equation as it takes the wave diffraction effects into account. Several load cases were defined and the models were subjected to these load cases to check whether they are able to capture the physical behaviour of the OWT. The modal decomposition technique was used for reducing simulation time. It was found that the model(s) adequately captured the physical behaviour of the OWT till a wind speed of 20 m/s. Its side-side plane physical behaviour needs further investigation for a constant wind speed of 24 m/s. The LIM and the NLIM compared well for most load cases. For the side-side plane responses, however, the LIM developed a phase lag. A strong coupling was found between the motions (rotations) in fore-aft plane and the motions about the yaw axis. The structural velocities were found to be very small to influence hydrodynamic drag terms. Also, the defections of the pile in the soil were found to be too small suggesting that p-y curves do not capture the non-linear behaviour of soil accurately. Finally, a damping matrix resulting from the linearised aerodynamic forces was used for calculating the modal damping ratios related to different modes. The results were compared to the literature, with addition of side-side and yaw damping.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Naval vessels are designed to remain operational in severe conditions, sea-state 6 or higher, and have to maintain a minimum forward speed in these conditions. These seakeeping conditions may result in severe impact loads on the bow of the vessel, called slamming. Sonar domes are often used at naval vessels to detect objects under water and are located at the forefoot of the vessel. The sonar dome used by the Royal Netherlands Navy is a composite structure connected under the steel bow structure of the vessel and is filled with water. Slamming and other seakeeping loads at the composite sonar dome have to be transferred to the steel bow structure through the composite and water inside the dome. Slamming loads have an impact type of character, which is described as a sudden quick increase of the load and with a short duration. Previous research has shown that neglecting the loads at the dome structure results in a serious underprediction of local structural response of the bow of the vessel. Besides that, little is known about the load transfer from the dome towards the bow structure. First, the dynamic response of a fluid filled composite sonar dome is studied. Different load types are applied at the sonar dome model to study the influence of the internal fluid on the response. Second, the effect of the loading transferred from the sonar dome on the stress levels in steel bow structure is studied. Slamming loads at the dome structure do not result in a highly dynamic response for the considered design. The rise-times of the loads have a relative long duration compared to the lowest natural response period of the sonar dome. The rise-times observed in the studied seakeeping conditions is in general much longer compared to the natural response periods of the dome. Including the internal fluid in the dome results in a reduction of the deformation and stresses of the composite shell. During seakeeping loading the pressure in the internal fluid rises, resulting in a pressure load on the bow structure above the dome. The reduction of internal pressure due to the outflow of water from the dome to an expansion container seems to be rather limited The presence of a sonar dome results in additional loads at the bow structure. These loads are a force at the dome flange and a pressure load on the bow structure above the dome. This leads to an increased stress level of the structural elements directly above the dome. It is concluded that the contribution of the internal pressure within the dome to the stress levels of the bow structure is most relevant. Vessels without a sonar dome do not have a deck in the forefoot of the vessel that is loaded by a fluid pressure. It is concluded that the loads from the sonar dome should not be neglected in a structural analysis of the bow structure.","sonar dome; slamming; FSI; ship structures; dynamic response; impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Science Ship & Offshore Stuctures","",""

(mentor); van Heur, R.J.H.G. (mentor)","2016","Poor oral care for the elderly is seen as one of the most pressing problems in our current health care system. Poor oral health can leads to pain, frustration, problems with eating, underfed elderly, problems with speaking and low self-esteem. Additionally it increases the risk for pneumonia, diabetes, organ infections, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers. Many studies show the poor oral health of elderly in care institutions, in the Netherlands as well as worldwide. In the Netherlands 50-70% of the elderly in institutions has poor oral health1. Elderly with their own teeth had worse oral health than elderly with (partly) false teeth. The number of elderly that keep their own teeth has been rising for years, and is expected to keep doing so. Consequently it is expected that the number of elderly with poor oral health will continue to rise1. The main reason why oral care is currently not performed properly is that nurses and caregivers think that brushing the teeth of the elderly is difficult. Tooth brushing was mentioned as the worst task to perform in elderly care2. The reasons why tooth brushing is seen as a hard jobe are: difficult under high time pressure, oral care is perceived as dirty work, nurses are afraid to hurt the elderly, lack of feeling for it and lack of patient cooperation1. To solve these problems a new oral care product is designed that uses a novel, inventive way of tooth brushing. The product uses a new way of actuation as well as a novel brushing method. The new method enables all teeth to be brushed at the same time, therefore enabling faster and easier brushing. In the case of normal tooth brushing, one tooth is being brushed for four seconds. In the case of this product the teeth are envisioned to be brushed all at the same time for ten seconds, thereby creating a significant time reduction.","oral care; elderly; toothbrush","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-07-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The method should be effective in material removal and ensure perfect adhesion of the organic coating to the carbon steel surface. In this study, a well-established grit blasting method of the surface preparation is compared to the several pulsed laser treatments in terms of the resulting surface properties (cleanliness, roughness, surface energy, morphology, and microstructure) and their relation to the dry and wet adhesive performance of the steel/epoxy system. The cleanliness of the surface was measured in terms of the density of salt contaminants. A Stylus method was used to determine the surface roughness and the surface energy was measured by a sessile drop method. Morphology, chemical composition and near-surface microstructure resulting from the surface treatment were determined by SEM/EDS. Adhesion characteristics to epoxy coating were investigated in terms of pull-off strength and resistance to cathodic disbondment at 65°C. Coated substrate behaviour immersed in a 3,5%NaCl solution was evaluated by OCP/EIS and coating delamination was studied by the means of SKP in 90% relative humidity. It was shown that the multiple-pass high power laser treatment at low speed can improve the adhesion of carbon steel to liquid epoxy coatings compared to samples treated with grit blasting by better mechanical interlocking. Laser melting and solidification altered the near-surface microstructure and resulted in grain refinement. Cracking of the oxide scale was observed in the area of laser beam overlap. Standardised tests reported excellent dry and wet adhesion of laser ablated surfaces. High cleanliness, roughness, similar (to the liquid epoxy) dispersive to polar ratio of surface energy components, and the composition and uniformity of the oxide scale after treatment were identified as properties that contribute to good adhesion of an epoxy to the ablated surfaces.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)","","Corrosion Technology and Electrochemistry","P91180",""

(mentor)","2016","The stability of subaqueous slopes is often studied to determine the probability of failure of hydraulic structures. Slope failures have been widely studied to increase the understanding of this complex failure mechanism. However, after a failure it is often hard to figure out the type of failure mechanism: static liquefaction or breach flow. Densely packed soil show dilatant behavior when its subjected to shear, and therefore its stability is temporarily guaranteed. The slope gradual loses grains, which may initiate turbidity currents. This current can be accelerated over the entire slope, until far downstream the flow decelerates (decreased gravitational force and the bed friction) and settles eventually. 1D-equations are derived from conservation of mass and momentum along slopes, which results in an adaptation with respect to the equations of Mastbergen (2013) in the model HMBreach, namely the system is extended to non-stationary conditions. The 1D equations are the framework of the numerical model: BreachFlow. A first order upwind scheme is applied and the transition equations from Eke, Viparelli, & Parker (2011) form the boundary at the breach. This boundary provides initial conditions of thickness, velocity and density and are based on breach height, like in HMBreach and therefore change when the breach retrogrades in time. Due to the chosen numerical scheme hydraulic jumps cause errors when super critical flows decelerate and become sub-critical. Therefore, sedimentation cannot be modelled and the final slope is not found. However, several time steps at the toe of the breach can be modelled and provide information about the development of the breach height, which is important for the initial condition at the first grid point. In conclusion, with BreachFlow is not yet possible to model the entire final slope, when the breach height reduces to zero. However, it is compared to HMBreach/HMTurb and Retrobreach a promising model, which is easy to adapt to different parameters (including profile) and more accurate regarding the calculation of three variables instead of one (transport of sand). Future work should be based on the implementation of a higher order explicit scheme or even an implicit scheme, in order to model the sedimentation. Then the model can be compared to several case studies including tidal flat of Walsoorden (Van den Ham et al, 2015) in order gain insight what type of mechanism occurred and what parameters correspond to the final slope and retrogressive length.","breaching; erosion; retrogression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In order to calculate the fatigue damage in a wind turbine for many different scenarios, fast simulation tools are of interest. While the dynamics of a wind turbine structure can often be linearized without significant loss of accuracy, a TMD may accompany nonlinearities that cannot easily be discarded. In this work, the nonlinear dynamics of end-stops are studied, which have the purpose of preventing the TMD body from colliding with the tower walls. The resulting problem consists of a multiple degree of freedom structure containing end-stop nonlinearity, subject to hydrodynamic external loads carrying many harmonic components. While time-integration techniques exist that can handle such problems, a frequency domain approach is sought in this work as an alternative, to improve the simulation speed. A harmonic balancing technique has been implemented with an existing finite element model of a wind turbine, and was found to be a promising alternative to time-integration for calculating the internal dynamic loads in the turbine.","nonlinear structural dynamics; numerical methods; tuned mass dampers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","As the world move towards knowledge based economy, it becomes increasingly important to understand and value intangible assets of a firm. In order to understand these intangible assets, it is important to understand their value generation ability. In other words, one way to know these intangible assets of a firm is to understand their efficiency in value creation. A. Pulic, devised an firm efficiency measurement called value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). This index looks beyond the traditional accounting method and calculates overall resource utilization efficiency of a firm. This efficiency index in turn, reflects on the intellectual capital of a firm. VAIC as described by A. Pulic, is made on three efficiency components human capital efficiency (HCE), structural capital efficiency (SCE) and capital employed efficiency (CEE). Since the publication of VAIC methodology, researchers have tried to understand whether this efficiency index of VAIC correlates with traditional firm performance like its market valuation (M/B) and return on equity (ROE). A good correlation between VAIC and dependent variables like M/B and ROE will help investors (stakeholders) to understand intellectual capital of a firm. This understanding of firm efficiency can help an investment firm or an investor to make better investment decision. In this thesis, a multilinear regression approach was adopted to investigate correlation between independent variables like (VAIC,HCE, SCE and CEE) and dependent variables like market valuation (M/B) and return on equity (ROE). In addition, two moderating variables (age of firm and size of firm) were also explored. These variables were selected because of learning effect theory ; as firm grows old (age of a firm) or increase in size (market valuation) they undergo learning effect, which should be reflected in their efficiency. In order to empirically investigate, one needs to define the scope of the research to a specific industry and country. The main research question of thesis is "" In the context of US biotech firms, what is the relationship between firm value efficiency and traditional financial parameters ?"" VAIC, M/B and ROE data from 53 biotech companies was collected for 2011, 2012 and 2013. Results of linear regression analysis did not indicate any relationship between VAIC and M/B. However, it exhibited moderately positive relationship between VAIC and ROE (for year 2011 and 2012). A multilinear regression analysis between components of VAIC (HCE, SCE and CEE) and dependent variables was conducted. Here, only HCE exhibited moderately positive relationship with ROE, while M/B did not exhibit significant relationship with any of the VAIC components. Low positive correlation between ROE and VAIC was due to extreme negative data points which distorted the relationship. Hence, for future research it is important to screen the firms in detail and only include the firms that are beyond start up and development phase. In other words, include firms that have at least one product in the market. Practical relevance of this research is to leverage the knowledge of correlations discovered in this research . A software or mobile app can be designed by using the results discussed in this research to screen and shortlist equities for investment. Hence, an application/software like this can guide people without financial background to make investment decisions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","","",""

The transportation of ore and waste to the dumps could be either done by conventional trucks or by a truck trolley system. The economic analysis for stage S3 shows that the truck trolley system can increase the CPV by 9.0% from -173.9 Me to -158.2 M€. In stage N7 the CPV can be increased with 14.8% from -332.0 M€ to -282.9 M€. The sensitivity analysis shows that the results are mostly dependent on the diesel price, followed by the capital expenditures, maintenance costs, and the electricity price. The dependency of the availability of the trolley trucks is non-linear, but it is not likely that the availability will be lower than the current case. The transportation of ore from crusher K315 should be done by a conveying system. Although the designs are not optimal yet, a big difference can be seen between conveying systems and a truck trolley system. The truck trolley system is by far the most expensive with a CPV of -186.8M€, while the CPV for a conveyor tunnel is -74.8M€ and the CPV of an in-pit conveyor is even better with -67.8M€. The results are most dependent on the maintenance costs, followed by the capital costs, availability of the system, and the electricity price. The truck trolley system allows a CO2 reduction of 28% in stage S3, and 36% in stage N7. A total of 1.59 Mt of CO2 can be saved. These results are really promising, especially because of the world’s need to reduce CO2 emissions. The costs can be significantly reduced by using a truck trolley system for the transportation of ore and waste to the dumps. An in-pit conveyor should be considered for the transportation of ore from crusher K315 to the processing plant.","material handling; truck trolley system; conventional truck haulage; in-pit crushing and conveying; reduction of carbon footprint; trolley assist; haulage simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This paper presents the mathematical modelling and design of a flat plate photoreactor with a fixed film photocatalyst to degrade phenol. Phenol was used as target pollutant as it is one of the most studied contaminants in photocatalysis and it is present in many of the wastewater streams containing pesticides, drugs, and dyes which cannot be treated with conventional wastewater technologies. To model the photoreactor, first a Zero Reflectance Model assuming no energy absorption or scattering by the fluid phase was used to compute the rate of photon absorption. Interest was also placed on determining the effect of the photocatalytic film thickness on both the internal diffusion and the rate of photon absorption. Afterward, the material balance of the pollutant was computed considering convection, diffusion, and a Langmuir Hinshelwood type of kinetics to describe the degradation of phenol. As the reaction just takes place at the bottom of the reactor, external mass transfer limited the overall phenol degradation. Therefore, several reactor heights were investigated to diminish external mass transfer limitations and determine the optimal photoreactor dimensions. For instance, for a throughput of 50 liters per day and assuming 10 hours of sunlight, to reach 95% phenol conversion the photoreactor height should be below 0.45cm, which corresponds to a photoreactor length of approximately 25 meters. In contrast, when the reactor height was diminished to 0.1cm, the required reactor length to reach 95% conversion decreased to 10 meters.","advanced oxidation technologies; heterogeneous catalysis; photocatalysis; titanium dioxide; mineralization; fixed film; flat plate photoreactor; phenol; photocatalyst thickness; Langmuir-Hinshelwood; diffusion; diffusion limitation; local rate of photon absorption; conversion; residence time","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","ChemE/Chemical Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Oil reserves are expressed as the total amount of economically and technically producible oil. Total oil consumption is increasing (per capita it remains more or less the same) but it has no unambiguous influence on the remaining reserves due to new discoveries. However, increasingly sophisticated recovery methods are used to produce oil i.e. enhanced oil recovery methods. A recently proposed enhanced oil recovery method is by injection of low-salinity water in completely oil-wet reservoirs, which leads to more water-wet behavior and “consequently” to improved oil recovery.<br/>This report will focus on the effect of wettability on the recovery efficiency. Based on the papers by Lomeland, Ebeltoft and Thomas we derive so-called LET relative permeability curves that only depend on irreducible water saturation. This is possible by using the irreducible water saturation dependence of the residual oil saturation, end point relative water permeability and the sketched behavior (Lomeland, Ebeltoft and Thomas) of the other six parameters. Admittedly this is a gross simplification, but it grasps the essence of the relative permeability behavior and makes it possible to study the recovery in terms of two parameters viz. the irreducible water saturation and viscosity ratio as opposed to eight relative permeability parameters and the viscosity ratio. High irreducible water saturation is both indicative of pore size heterogeneity and water-wet behavior. We use the theory of Buckley-Leverett to construct recovery curves for 1D and 2D displacement and various mobility (M = displacing fluid mobility / displaced fluid mobility) ratios. We solve the 1-D equations both analytically (using fractional flow theory) and numerically. For the numerical simulations in 1D and 2D we use COMSOL 5.2©. The simulations show that water-wet behavior is conducive to stable displacement, however, low recovery at breakthrough, whereas intermediate oil-wet behavior is more unstable but conducive to high ultimate recoveries. Completely oil-wet behavior leads to less stable displacement and low ultimate recoveries.","Relative Permeability; COMSOL Multiphysics; Buckley Leverett; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Wettability; Low salinity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor)","2016","The replication of the behaviour of frozen soils has been studied for decades. Many attempts have been undertaken to either develop new constitutive models or to improve already existing models to simulate the behaviour of frozen materials. To handle the challenges of ground freezing, cold regions engineering and periglacial processes, it is vital to understand the mechanical behaviour of frozen soil. Knowing that field studies, large scale laboratory tests and centrifuge modelling offer good insights, they are however expensive and time consuming activities to undertake. A numerical modelling approach is therefore necessary. The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), in collaboration with Plaxis bv, developed a new numerical model to tackle the afore-mentioned problems. The aim of this new approach is to provide a reliable design tool to assess the impact of climate change and changes in temperature in general on a variety of engineering problems. The constitutive model requires several parameters of which quite a few are not very common to geotechnical engineers. Furthermore, to analyse frozen soil and the behaviour when phase transition occurs, specific properties have to be taken into account which are not determined in standard site investigation and soil lab testing campaigns. This brings the need for a simplified method to determine such properties based on data that is commonly available, such as the particle size distribution. The idea is, as an initial estimate, to correlate this data to the soil freezing characteristic curve and the hydraulic properties of partially frozen soils. Therefore, a practical approach to obtain crucial properties of frozen soil such as the soil freezing characteristic curve (SFCC), the freezing/melting point of a soil-water system and its hydraulic conductivity by means of limited input data is developed. Different models and empirical equations are combined to provide a closed formulation which can be used in computer simulations to account for moisture migration in partially frozen soils. Input data such as grain size distribution and dry bulk density suffices to obtain the aforementioned properties. Further consideration of the pressure dependence of the freezing/melting temperature of water/ice even allows accounting for the phase change point depression and thus the phenomenon of pressure melting. The model is appropriate not just to represent qualitatively the SFCC of different soil types, but also to provide conformity between the model prediction and measured data of many soil types having a log-normal grain size distribution. This user-friendly approach is tested in the geotechnical finite element code PLAXIS 2D. Although some correlations and default values can be provided, laboratory testing is inevitable in order to provide the complete set of necessary soil parameters. To calibrate some of the most difficult ones, namely the Barcelona Basic Model (BBM) parameters, the idea is to use oedometer test results. The temperature-controlled oedometer test requires equipment which is less sophisticated than a temperature-controlled isotropic compression test. A shorter testing period makes it possible to save time and money. An optimisation approach for identification of material parameters in elasto-plastic models for unsaturated soils, like the BBM, using the results from suction-controlled oedometer tests is developed by Zhang et al. (2016). The same approach, reformulated for the constitutive model for frozen and unfrozen soil, is explained in this thesis. This optimisation approach allows to simultaneously determine parameters governing isotropic virgin behaviour as well as unloading and reloading behaviour. A number of simplified real life applications are presented in this thesis. They demonstrate the correctness of the model's theoretical implementation and its correct representation of the behaviour of frozen soil found in nature. Temperature gradients under uniaxial compression are applied on a frozen sample, and show that the hardening modulus and the uniaxial compression strength increase as the average temperature and the thermal gradient decrease. Another boundary value problem investigates the pressure melting phenomenon and shows that high confining pressures cause the melting of ice crystals due to the reduction of the phase transition temperature. Two freeze-thaw cycles of a clay sample are simulated and provide information on the ability of the model to simulate the ice segregation phenomenon (frost heave) as well as the thaw settlement behaviour. Furthermore, three more practical applications are presented. First, a pipeline is installed in an unfrozen trench and subsequently cooled down by the streaming of a chilled fluid. The onset of frost heave may potentially cause many engineering problems, like cracking of pavements and the fracturing of the pipeline. It is therefore of particular concern in highway and pipeline engineering. The second application comprises a foundation on frozen soil subjected to a warming period. Settlements due to the thawing of ice enclosed in the frozen soil layers accumulate and should be considered when designing embankments and building foundations on permafrost. Finally, an application of artificial ground freezing is considered. A tunnel is constructed with the use of freeze pipes in order to stabilise the soil during excavation. The soil is frozen by means of the installed freeze pipes. Watertightness and an increase in strength of the soil are achieved. Once the soil has frozen sufficiently, tunnel construction can take place. To sum up, many essential features of the mechanical behaviour of frozen and unfrozen soil can be captured with this new constitutive model. The dependence of stiffness and shear strength on temperature are among of these. Furthermore, two main features, namely frost heave and thaw settlements, can be simulated. These phenomena play a key role in designing in, on and with frozen / unfrozen soil and may cause significant engineering problems. Three conference papers for two different conferences have been submitted and reflect my research results. However, all that glitters is not gold. The investigated constitutive model cannot fully capture all the effects influencing the behaviour of frozen soil. The non-incorporation of cyclic and time-dependent behaviour represents one of a few shortcomings.","cold region engineering; frozen soil behaviour; THM modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Timepix chip detectors, being quantum area pixel electron detectors, provide greater incident particle energy specificity and are less noise sensitive than traditional integrating electron detector systems. Moreover, the charge sharing properties of the Timepix detector provide a potential opportunity for superresolution, increasing the effective detection resolution beyond the 55 μm pixel pitch and improving transmission electron microscope imaging. However, little is known about the trajectories and corresponding observed tracks of 300 keV electrons --- as typically used in transmission electron microscopy --- in silicon. The goal of this project is to generate simulated 300 keV electron trajectories and emulate charge carrier transport and Timepix pixel function to obtain a set of pixel tracks resembling those observed during irradiation of a Timepix chip detector with 300 keV electrons. Simulated electron trajectories were obtained using Geant4; subsequently, charge sharing was simulated using an energy deposition--to--pixel distance power law approximation (qpixel ∝ Δxpixel-3). Using a Gaussian Fano noise approximation, an optimum correspondence of Gaussian peak fit sigma to peak position ratio was found at a simulated Fano factor of 0.0915. This optimum simulated Fano factor is within 25% of Fano factors obtained in prior ab initio Fano simulations. Additionally, both observed and simulated pixel track signal intensities were added together aligned by peak signal pixel, in which a pixel charge carrier threshold was applied to all individual pixels in each simulated pixel track. At a pixel charge carrier threshold of +4.0 × 104 e to each individual simulated pixel tracks, the ratio between peak pixel row and column signal and the bordering pixel rows and columns is equal for both observed and simulated cumulative tracks. Yet, observed cumulative track tails contain more signal compared to peak level than simulated cumulative track tails; this effect is well explained by the non-linearity of Timepix pixel response to incident charges. These results indicate that it may be feasible to accurately recreate Timepix 300 keV electron pixel tracks using computer simulations; still, more in-depth research towards scattering of 300 keV electron tracks in silicon and towards resulting charge carrier production and transport is needed to ascertain whether superresolution transmission electron microscope imaging is in any way feasible in Timepix chip detectors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","ImPhys/Imaging Physics","","","",""

(mentor); Van Kuijk, J.I. (mentor)","2016","This study presents the development of a future vision and service proposition to improve the experience of international travellers when using public transportation in the Netherlands in a user-centred way. The focus is set on international travellers, who arrive at an airport in the Netherlands. Purchasing public transportation tickets in the Netherlands is a hurdle due to OV-betalen, which refers to different varieties of electronic payment in public transportation in the Netherlands. International travellers, who are most frequently first time users of the system, do not know how to acquire an OV-chipkaart (electronic public transportation ticket), what travel products to select and in general make more mistakes throughout their journey, because they do not have established routines like domestic travellers. This is a significant challenge to the Netherlands, as according to a study commissioned by NBTC Holland Marketing, “inbound tourism is a major growth industry within the Dutch economy”. In this study the third main complaint of visitors to the Netherlands is the lack of user-friendliness of public transportation, and it is suggested to improve the smartcard and payment options for travellers (the first is regarding information provision for travellers in general and the second concerns too high process for services). If the Dutch public transportation system provides a better service, not only the travellers benefit from the improved service, but the Netherlands as a country can largely benefit from the travellers. Travellers would have a convenient access to the whole country (as most inbound tourists only travel to Amsterdam) meaning that tourism would spread in the Netherlands. In this project, the TU Delft cooperates with Connexxion, GVB, KLM, NS, RET and Schiphol Group. The study’s approach focuses on the human, societal, technological and business aspect of the product-service system. The project emphasizes the human aspect; therefore the desirability of the product-service-system and the users’ needs and perspectives are prioritised. However, the expertise of the project partners is also fundamental during the process as it provides insight on the feasibility and viability of the proposed solutions. Future Vision: The Dutch public transportation is one system, ran by multiple operators, that cooperate in the backend to provide transparent and unified information to facilitate the usage of the system to its customers in the frontend, in areas, where they do not compete. Service Proposition: Improving infinformation provision and offering a homogenous array of tickets and payment methods it is essential to better the system and the experience of international travellers. To achieve this, the public transportation operators have to share certain touchpoints (such as a website, an app, the interface of ticket vending machines or staff), as well as cooperate to homogenize ticket names and payment options. In order to do so the operators should share a platform to provide information and facilitate ticket purchase. There are basic requirements that must be taken into account when developing the vision and service proposition: • Accessibility of information: Travellers should be able to access information about public transportation throughout travel phases (before, during and after usage), contexts of use and touchpoints. • Transparency of information: Travellers should have an overview of the available possibilities within the public transportation system in terms of transportation modalities, time of travel and price to travel. • Clarity of information: Travellers should be able to understand the information provided to them in the languages available, the terminology used and the design of the different touchpoints. The proposed service is based on a platform for payment in public transport, shared by the public transportation operators. It is embodied by a more digitized system, which also offers alternatives and back-up options to the digital services and a balance between self-service and service personnel. Ultimately, the future vision and service proposition focus on the users’ needs and are technologically feasible. Certain organizational changes must take place in order to make the proposition viable. The following recommendations establish steppingstones towards improving the experience of international travellers when using the Dutch public transportation system: • Cooperation amongst PTOs: It is imperative that operators work on the service of transportation as a unity, because they currently share a system, but do not always share their services in terms of providing information, assistance or tickets that build up the system. • Include all stakeholders in the process: Further stakeholders, such as tourism organisations, airports and passenger airlines, can positively contribute when developing solutions to improve the experiences of international travellers. The stakeholders share contexts and in some cases the touchpoints that travellers use and interact with. • Have a user-centred mind-set: Without travellers and their need of mobility, there would be no necessity of providing public transportation. The impact that the PSS design has on users is critical to provide a better service and also impacts the technological, business and societal aspect of the system. • Improve the accessibility of information throughout the system: Public transportation is a service designed for everyone in society, hence it is crucial to optimize information accessibility for everyone: different types of travellers, throughout different travel phases, in different contexts of use, that interact with different touchpoints must be able to access information. • Unify information provision: Unified information will avoid that confusing or misleading information is provided, as well as information overload. The information should be transparent and give enough knowledge to the travellers to make the best choices concerning their trip and their preferences. The PTOs and other stakeholders should facilitate the link for their shared platform to the users. • Simplify and unify ticketing & payment: Although the Dutch public transportation system shares one payment system (the OV-chipkaart system), the individual PTOs have different product types and ticket names. Simplifying the ticket range, unifying the product range and providing a wide range of the same payment methods throughout the system can make ticket selection and acquisition better for international travellers. Guided by these recommendations, a more user-centred and user-friendly public transportation service can be developed. Improving the public transportation system will benefit the users, the PTOs and other stakeholders, as well as the Netherlands as a whole.","OV-chipkaart; usability; service design; public transport; people in transit; user centred design; international travellers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The increase in complexity of geotechnical problems demanded for more advanced physical modelling and instrumentation approaches. Physical modelling under normal gravity (1g) or in centrifuge has been an important instrument to overcome various scale issues that govern soil related experiments. However, limitations in the size, especially for the centrifuge modelling, introduce boundary effects within such problems which can lead to misinterpretations in the results during the design phase. These boundary effects have been a topic of interest for many years in physical modelling and examined to different extent for various applications. Three broad categories of methods - namely comparison with empirical correlations, numerical methods and experimental analyses - exist to identify them. The present thesis contemplates an experimental analysis to investigate the effects of lateral boundaries in small scale testing of a shallow foundation in a centrifuge box by varying the lateral distance between the strip footing and the wall of the strongbox at 1g condition. A series of tests performed under constrained and free field conditions are compared at similar effective stress levels, as quantification method, for recognizing hard mechanical boundary effects. These comparisons are focused on the pre-and post-peak stress-displacement response recorded during the penetration of a shallow foundation in dry uniform sand. Besides, advanced image analysis techniques are implemented to monitor the evolution of strains at the lateral borders and relate these observations to the mechanical behaviour of the foundation. It was found that both tools complement each other because they can record the soil response in terms of bearing capacity and deformation during the soil-structure interaction. The main goal of this master project consisted in studying soft boundaries as a compensation measurement of the identified boundary effects. Therefore, soft layers of thin rubber with 3, 6 & 9mmthickness and a modulus of elasticity in compression of approximately 0.3 MPa, were installed at the lateral walls of the strongbox to allow extra compressibility of the surrounding soil; and mitigate the effect of boundary closeness. Hence, by superimposing the load-displacement profiles obtained with the soft and hard conditions, a progressive reduction in the boundary effect was observed as the thickness of the soft pad increased. This reduction was also evident when the volumetric and shear strain fields near the lateral boundaries were compared with the use of image analysis. The physical model interfaces located between the hard lateral boundaries of the strongbox and the soil specimen were also evaluated for different roughness. Its objective was to investigate the contribution that smooth and rough interfaces had over the results. Thus, a smooth surface represented by latex membrane and silicone grease was shown to mitigate boundary effects when simulating a constrained condition. On the other hand, a rough interface simulated with sandpaper produced a greater penetration resistance of the foundation due to its high interface friction angle. Lastly, the role of relative density in influencing the boundary effect was briefly examined and the results obtained suggest that for a ratio between the length of the strongbox and footing width (L/B) ~ 4 is sufficient to avoid boundary effects when having samples with RD < 50%.","Geotechnical engineering; Physical modelling; Soft boundary; Shallow foundation; Particle Image velocimetry; Shear strain; Volumetric strain; Sand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","","",""

However bone ingrowth is not always accomplished. Implant micro/nanotopography can be used to enhance bone ingrowth through cellular interactions. Therefore, processes to generate controlled topographies on titanium substrates are needed. The goal of this study has been to develop a method for patterning titanium in the submicron to nanoscale. The desired patterns included pits and pillars with diameters between 30 and 700 nm, a disorder (deviation from the square arrangement in a random direction) of 0 to 75 nm, and an interspacing of 300 nm and 900 nm. To achieve this goal, the electron beam lithography process has been explored. With this process, an electron beam is used to write the pattern on the resist-coated titanium substrate. Then, the pattern is transferred into the titanium. The optimum dose for writing the patterns on the positive and negative resists has been determined experimentally. For pattern transfer, reactive ion etching, and ion milling were used, either directly onto the resist mask, or through a hard mask. The resultant topographies have been evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. The results of this study indicate that the use of hard mask, in combination with the optimum dose, and reactive ion etching conditions, generates titanium pits with 320 nm and 700 nm diameter. For pillars, further optimization of the process steps is needed. With the resist mask and ion milling, pillars of 245 nm and 545 nm in diameter with heights of 50 nm and 100 nm respectively could be obtained. In this study, a new electron beam lithography process has been developed for patterning titanium in the submicron to nanoscale. The process offers control of pattern features in these scales, this enables easy change in pattern design, and ensures pattern transfer into titanium. Therefore, the processes are considered feasible for generating patterns relevant for guiding mesenchymal stem cell fate. Previous research offered precision control into polymers, or patterns with less control into titanium.","Bio-nanopatterning; Biomaterial; Nanopatterning; Nanotopography; Electron Beam Lithography; osteogenic differentiation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); van Gelder, C.R.J. (mentor); van der Ven, P. (mentor)","2016","The Netherlands are protected against extreme high waters from the sea by an ingenious system of barriers. One of the most famous ones is the Maeslant barrier in the New Waterway near the port of Rotterdam. This barrier however, is subject to discussion, as it might not function as intended, because of the following reasons. It has a very low reliability regarding closing. Furthermore, because of the sea level rise, it is expected that the barrier should close much more frequently, causing more nuisance for navigation. Therefore a different solution is put forward by Spaargaren c.s. Namely to close off the New Waterway permanently by means of a barrier, consisting out of a pumping station, dewatering sluice and a lock complex. The latter one is further elaborated on by making a feasibility study for it. First of all, the best location is chosen for the barrier, which in this report is the location near Rozenburg, just east of the Maeslant barrier. Because of the high demands regarding both navigation and flood safety in combination with the uncertainty in these demands for the future, there is a need for a sophisticated design for the lock complex. This is done by first considering the boundary conditions for different (initial and adaptive) scenarios for both sets of requirements (navigation and flood safety). For navigation a larger vessel is taken into account in the adaptive boundary conditions. For flood safety, the adaptive boundary conditions results in a higher water level of about 1 meter to be retained, mostly due to a larger sea level rise. It turns out that the boundary conditions regarding navigation have a way larger impact in the design choices of the lock complex than the boundary conditions regarding flood safety. The above boundary conditions are used to create an overall solution for the barrier. 4 locks are needed (in case of an initial design): one large lock for large seagoing vessels, one mid-sized lock for smaller seagoing vessels and two for inland going vessels. When looking at the adaptive requirements, another mid-sized lock should be added. For the large lock, different principal solutions are developed that also take the adaptive boundary conditions into account. First of all, an adaptive design of a lock head is considered by making the head modular. This makes it possible to place a larger gate in the head later on. It turns out that this is probably not cost-efficient. The second proposed solution is to use a retaining wall in combination with a relieving floor for the chamber walls of the large lock for seagoing vessels. The relieving floor will decrease the horizontal soil loads on the soil retaining wall beneath it, which is structurally beneficial. This relieving floor will be combined with a longitudinal filling system. A longitudinal culvert over the length of the lock is placed on top of the relieving floor. Filling and emptying will be done using openings in the floor of the superstructure. The load on vessels during levelling of the lock are determined for this system, which is the main requirement that determines the filling time. It turns out that this option results in much faster levelling times compared to other levelling systems. Levelling could be done a factor 3 faster than filling through the head. It is concluded that the longitudinal culvert in combination with the relieving floor can compete with conventional filling systems. Furthermore, it fits in an adaptive design approach, because even with a wider lock, faster levelling times are possible. However, there are still some considerations to be made regarding this solution. A thorough cost-benefit analysis should be made. Besides of this, the hydraulic computations should be validated by means of a scale model or computational fluid dynamics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic structures and flood risk","","51.932,4.21572"

In order to have a better understanding of the excitation system faults and prime mover faults, validated diesel generator model and parallel diesel generator sets model are built. By simulating many kinds of faults and normal operations, the performances of healthy and faulty generators are concluded. By analyzing these performances, boundaries between healthy and faulty generators are found. According to the boundary analysis, the CDG simulation block is built and tested. According to the aims of this master thesis, The CDG is designed for the commercial use. Therefore, the validation of CDG is implemented. There are three steps to finish the CDG validation. The first step is to build a two parallel generator sets setup. The second step is to build validated generators and CDG model for the setups. The last step is to transfer the CDG simulation block to PLC program and test CDG PLC program on the setup.

The goal of integrating Fuzzy Logic in Particle Swarm Optimization is to be able to overcome some of the classical disadvantages of the algorithm. Particle Swarm Optimization has been traditionally criticized for the complexity to set the acceleration constants of the algorithm and the low exploration capabilities of the algorithm. In this thesis work, it is proposed a new implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization that avoids the complex setting procedure of the acceleration constants of the algorithm, while aiming at improving the exploration capabilities of the algorithm. In this thesis work it is also analyzed a novel Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation of the problem of optimal sitting of distributed generation in distribution networks implemented in DER- CAM, a tool developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The results of the two models are analyzed and contrasted against each other for a real case study of an islanded microgrid located in the north of the U.S. Results obtained in the case study depict the differences between the two analyzed approaches to solve the problem. It is found that over and under estimations of voltage magnitudes in high and low loading scenarios of distribution networks have the potential to impact investment decisions in distributed generation capacity for the linear formulation of the problem. Also the models analyzed depict the synergies between renewable energy technologies and thermal generators to increase energy savings while maintaining the operation limits of the grid.","Distributed Generation; Investment Planning; Microgrids; Distribution Networks; Optimization; Particle Swarm Optimization; Linear Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Reinders, K.J. (mentor); Kleinjan, A. (mentor); Jommi, C. (mentor)","2016","Organic soft soils pose technical challenges in construction industry due to their extraordinary compressibility and deformability, which is an issue of particular relevance in the densely populated Netherlands, of which more than half of the land surface is covered by such soft soils. Uncertainty and variability in settlement predictions for constructions on soft soils are large, however: in the order of tens of percent. Therefore this research was performed, reviewing and validating one-dimensional settlement prediction methods for organic soft soils, in particular peat, with focus on long-term settlements. Special interest for validation concerned relatively unknown and uncommon, but seemingly simple and easy to use, empirical settlement prediction methods or compressibility parameter correlations. The main goal was to designate the best performing 1D settlement prediction method with an optimum balance between accuracy, usability and time investment, taking also into account the soil parameter determination including preceding sampling and testing procedures. This goal was met in part based on thorough literature review of seven different settlement prediction methods or models: Terzaghi, Buisman, Koppejan, Bjerrum, Fokkens, De Glopper, Den Haan (a,b,c- Isotachs), and in part based on subsequent validation of the latter four of those methods. Validations were performed on the basis of soil test data and field measurements, collected in the course of three actual field research or construction projects in the Netherlands. The literature review additionally comprised a critical review and comparison of different soil compression test methods: incremental loading (IL) oedometer, constant-rate-of-strain (CRS) and K0-CRS tests. Furthermore, previous studies regarding the reliability of settlement predictions, addressing many error sources including sample disturbance, were reviewed and summarised. In one case, soil compressibility characteristics had to be determined from raw IL and CRS compression test data, for which various methods of soil parameter determination were studied and performed. This includes in particular the determination of the preconsolidation pressure, for which four different methods were applied and mutually compared: Casagrande’s method, Butterfield’s method, the work-per-unit-volume method [Becker et al., 1987] and the pore pressure method. The main conclusions from the settlement prediction methods validations are that the soil compressibility parameter correlations and the method of Fokkens are best to be disregarded for use in engineering practice because of their unreliability or their considerable practical limitations. Of the remaining settlement prediction methods, the a,b,c-Isotachs model theoretically provides the most sound and versatile description of soil behaviour upon compression as well as unloading. However based on the data available and the results obtained, the Bjerrum model yielded the most accurate results in practice, with final settlement estimations for a more than 350 years old dike within 12% of the actual settlement.","settlement; creep; consolidation; subsidence; soft soil; organic soil; peat; oedometer; constant-rate-of-strain; CRS; K0-CRS; sample disturbance; preconsolidation stress; Fokkens; De Glopper; Bjerrum; Den Haan; abc; isotachs; D-Settlement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

This is done with the Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) that consist of a superconducting film embedded in a resonant circuit, so that photons falling in will change the resonant frequency.

(mentor); Doerr, C. (mentor)","2016","The emergence of Apple’s Macintosh computers’ popularity introduces new threats and challenges for the security on the Mac. For a long time, OS X security has benefitted from the popularity of Microsoft Windows. The threat landscape for the Mac is rapidly changing as the marketshare of the Mac is approaching 15%1. Malware on Apple’s OS X systems emerges to be an increasing security threat that is currently solely countered with ancient anti-virus (AV) technologies [18]. Current AV technologies pose a performance overhead on the entire system and have an inherent delayed effectiveness, due to their signature based detection [15][31]. In addition, current malware uses many forms of obfuscation to prevent detection by AV technologies, redering AV technologies useless against advanced threats [15][31]. Consequently, the need for more advanced detection and prevention techniques of malware is increasing. Detection of malicious behaviour instead of malicious signatures, ought to provide a more advanced form of protection. A system call is referred to as the request and service of specific, basic, functionality provided to applications by the operating system. This Master thesis answers the research question: “Is it possible to detect malicious behaviour per- formed by malware, based on monitoring system calls?” Presented is a novel, generic, behavioural detection and prevention mechanism for malware on OS X based on system calls. System call traces can be used to describe the behaviour of processes [11]. Much effort was put into the development of a kernel module that bypasses kernel security mechanisms and rewires one of the operating system’s core functionalities; system call handling. The rewiring of system call handling provided the ability to log all of the system call invocations performed by processes running on the monitored system. A significant amount of OS X malware and benign applications were executed in a monitored environment of which system call traces were collected. Based on analysing heat map visualisations and manual sequential analysis of the system call traces of both malicious and benign processes, anomalies in the malicious traces could be observed. Subsequently, several mali- cious system call patterns and detection rules were extracted providing detection of malware on OS X. The most successful defined pattern is constructed around the executions of Unix shell processes per- formed by malware. It is shown that this detection pattern results in a 100% detection rate of all malware possible to obtain for this thesis. Even advanced malware in an infected OS X application, known as OSX.KeyRanger.A, was detected using this method. In order to evaluate the False Positive Rate (FPR) accurately in real world scenarios, three different user profiles were defined. Applications distributed via the Mac App Store do not generate false positives. In case of the developer user profile type, the FPR increases to 20%. Applications responsible for the false positives feature a cross-platform nature, such as MATLAB, R, LaTeX and interpreters for scripting languages. A conducted survey under Mac users verified these conclusions. However, the number of false positive generating benign applications is very limited and whitelisting solutions provided can reduce the FPR in this developer user profile.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

To measure the strength of our case against the match, we use likelihoodratios. We diﬀerentiate between two diﬀerent situations: the probable cause case, where we already suspect our match and DNA testing tells us that the proﬁle case and our suspect’s DNA matches, and the database match case, where we ﬁnd a match by comparing our case proﬁle to the DNA proﬁles in our database. We pose the question: which one of these situations is more incriminating for our match? The controversy around answering this question is called the database controversy, which is based on the fact that the chosen set of hypotheses, even when logically equivalent, changes the answer of this question. We show that this controversy is not really a controversy by using posterior odds instead of likelihood ratios. Familial searching is not as straightforward: we discuss two methods for ﬁnding relatives of a case proﬁle in a database. One of those is the conditional method, where we look at the minimum subset of members such that the sum of their prior probability times their likelihoodratio is larger than that of the whole database times a factor. The other is called the proﬁle-centred method, where we look at the members in our database that have a likelihood ratio larger than a certain treshold. We discuss theoretical eﬃciency (the probability that a family member is included in the subset when it is present in our database) and interpretation, but also model these methods in a simulated database. We look at the probability of detection when a relative is present in our database, and look at the typical size of our subsets for certain eﬃciencies. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and there is no clear answer on which method is better: this should be decided on a case by case basis.","bayesian statistics; DNA; familial searching; database controversy","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Statistics","",""

(mentor); Breedveld, S. (mentor)","2016","Nowadays around 50% of all patients diagnosed with cancer are treated with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy uses ionizing beams to irradiate the tumour. This radiation damages and destroys cells, such that it is impossible for this cell to grow and divide. When the tumour is irradiated, the surrounding healthy tissues gets damaged as well. The goal is to destroy the tumour cells, while saving the healthy tissue as much as possible. Radiotherapy is a multi-objective optimization from a mathematical point of view. The different organs are the objectives and the dose in these organs must be minimized. Decreasing the dose in one organ influences the dose in all other organs. This gives an infinite range of optimal solutions. Clinically, such an optimal solutions does not exist. We are searching for a clinically desirable solution which is a good compromise between all objectives. To find clinically desirable solutions, the Erasmus MC has developed Erasmus-iCycle, an algorithm for automated multi-objective radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Unfortunately, configuring this algorithm is highly time-consuming, as the essential information only known by the physicians is not explicitly available. However, this information is present in existing treatment plans of previously treated patients. This project focuses on extracting that knowledge to configure Erasmus-iCycle, so it can treat new patients in a similar fashion. The aim of this project was to develop a method which uses knowledge of previous patients and reproduces this input to validate the feasibility of the method. In this thesis a number of methods is discussed, the advantages and disadvantages are compared. The conclusion we found was that the best method to solve this problem is the simplest method. This method brings us very close to the old solutions, it is simple to implement and the computation time is very short.","radiotherapy; multi-objective optimization; multi-criteria optimization; Pareto optimal; Reference point method; treatment planning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

These can be used as standalone tools, but also integrated into code reviews, build processes, or continuous integration. ASATs can be configured by their user and report a list of warnings for each rule that has been violated by the analyzed code. While some research has been performed regarding ASATs, little is currently known about the correlations between use of ASATs and other properties of projects or their communities, or about the extent to which developers solve violations reported by ASATs. In this thesis, we attempt to answer these questions by obtaining information about a large number of relevant open source projects hosted on GitHub. We found that the usage rate for ASATs is relatively low, while ASAT usage can be associated with several positive changes in other properties; in general, popular and successful projects are more likely to use ASATs. Furthermore, projects that use ASATs typically have a more active community, and receive more contributions. The amount of warnings generated varies between projects, but projects with large code bases tend to have fewer warnings. When looking at the types of warnings reported, not all categories are equally represented; violations of Style Conventions are most common. We also found that warnings of different categories are solved at different rates; warnings with more impact on maintainability were solved faster, while warnings with little impact on correctness or maintainability were left unattended for longer.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Science","IN5000",""

(mentor)","2016","Structural vibrations are a known cause of damage to offshore structures and equipment. A Cutter Suction Dredger (CSD) is a dredge vessel known to vibrate heavily during operation. Primary cause of these vibrations is the cutting process, performed to cut and excavate soil from the seabed. A component prone to damage is the cutter ladder, a component of the CSD used to position the cutter head at the seabed. Cutter ladders are known to suffer from failures including large cracks in the structural members, of which the cause is sometimes unclear. Current methods for developing a cutter ladder involve detailed quasi-static finite element modeling for strength analysis and sometimes modal analysis to identify natural frequencies and mode shapes. Structural vibrations due to dynamic loading are usually not taken into account. In 2015 Boskalis performed extensive vibration measurements on its Taurus II CSD, hereby setting the stage for research into the dynamics of cutter ladders. By taking a closer look at dynamics of the cutter ladder, a cause for structural damage might be identified. This thesis therefore aims to investigate the vibrations of a cutter ladder as a possible cause for damage. In order to obtain knowledge about the dynamic behavior of the cutter ladder in operation, data obtained during the vibration measurements were investigated using operational modal analysis. This investigation gave further insight in how to approach the development and validation of a vibration model. A vibration model using finite beam elements was developed to take a closer look at the characteristics of the cutter ladder structure. This vibration model was obtained through simplification of a detailed plate-element model, which was developed in an earlier project. The dynamic characteristics of the obtained vibration model where validated to the detailed plate element model by comparison of modal analysis results. It was chosen to update the vibration model using the measurements obtained on the cutter ladder, as it was hereby possible to investigate the influence of dynamic parameters on which uncertainties exist, such as the water added mass surrounding the structure, the damping and the stiffness parameters at the boundary conditions. Use was made of the transmissibility of vibrations between the locations where measurements were obtained. Measured transmissibility was compared to modeled transmissibility, as in this manner it was possible to look into dynamic behavior of the cutter ladder, apart from the external loading. The model was updated by varying various dynamic parameters on which uncertainties existed, including water added mass, damping and stiffness parameters at the boundary conditions. Investigating the data obtained during measurements showed that the forced vibrations caused by the cutting process dominate the dynamic behavior in the cutter ladder. Natural vibrations of the cutter ladder were found to be minor. Updating the model revealed that the water surrounding the structure has a significant influence on the dynamic behavior. In vertical direction, a quantity of water close to the weight of the cutter ladder itself had to be added to have the vibration model meet the design parameters. Quite an amount of structural damping had to be added too, for which the cause is again sought for in the water surrounding the structure. Using transmissibility functions as design parameters was found to yield accurate results, especially at the sections where no external loading was introduced. It is recommended to continue investigating the influence of the forced vibrations on the fatigue life of the cutter ladder on a more local scale, as this might provide new insights for future cutter ladder designs.","dynamics; offshore; dredging; vibration measurements; finite element modeling; operational modal analysis; modal analysis; model updating; transmissibility functions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Railway crossings are one of the most important and vulnerable components in railway network. Nowadays, due to intensive use of the track together with higher train speeds and heavier axle loads, more and more problems associated with crossings are reported and it is continuing to be an important factor limiting its service life. In this MSc thesis, a realistic 3D finite element (FE) model of the crossing panel is developed to analyse the stress state arising from the impact event and, providing recommendations on how to effectively mitigate the impact loads. The scenario which is simulated and studied in this report is that of a train wheel passing a railway crossing in the facing as well as in the trailing direction. Prior to the FE modelling, first, 2D-geometric contact analysis is performed calculating all the contact properties at the wheel-rail interface. The obtained contact properties are then used as guidance during the FE modelling to implement adaptive mesh refinement at the running band of the wheel in order to get accurate solution of the rolling contact stresses. From the FE simulation results, high impact forces can be observed in the transition zone of the crossing. The detailed surface and subsurface stress analysis reveals that these forces generate high contact stresses subsequently causing yielding of the materials and intense plastic strain accumulation. Verifications and validations are carried out to examine whether the results from the FE model are correlating with the reality. From them, attention has been paid to minimize undesirable effects of the boundaries and to verify the convergence of the solution. Besides, the response of the FE model is validated against the field experiment of the axle box and the crossing nose accelerations. Thereafter, a parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of some interesting case studies on the magnitude of the impact loads. In this regard, a comparison of the contact properties utilizing elastic and plastic material models showed conformities as well as discrepancies in the stress state for these two material models. Besides, several cases studies have been carried out on the vertical substructure stiffness variation and geometric design modification of the crossing panel. From this it can be concluded that the investigated case studies provide interesting opportunities to reduce effectively the impact forces on the crossing. Moreover, a comparison between facing and trailing direction has managed to identify the impact force behaviour for these two different operational conditions. So in short, the FE model is thus capable to solve the wheel-crossing contact stress problem at the crossing and it is flexible enough to examine the influence of design modifications on the impact force and its resulting stress state under different operational conditions.","wheel-rail interface interaction; 2D geometric analysis; 3D explicit FEM; railway crossing; transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","When a patient is diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments is possible. About half of these patients is treated with radiotherapy. This is a multi-disciplinary field of research, where mathematics, physics and medicine come together. In this thesis the focus will lie on prostate cancer. One of the main problems with this type of cancer is that the organs in the stomach area move, mainly due to volume changes of the bladder. During the treatment, the same treatment plan is used for several weeks, but since these organs move, this plan is not optimal every day. The goal of this thesis is to find a way to make fast optimal plans with the reference point method, such that a new treatment plan can be made every day. The reference point method is used in multi-objective optimisation where the solution obtained is always Pareto optimal. This means that no objective can be improved without worsening at least one other objective. This is due to the fact that the objectives are conflicting. An objective is for example the mean amount of radiation in the rectum. For the reference point method a reference point and an increasing direction of the reference path are needed. Most of the times it is also necessary to add indifference curves. In those cases a sensitivity parameter is needed as well. The goal is to find a good method to choose these values, such that equally good treatment plans can be calculated with the reference point method as with the time-consuming fullmethod, iCycle. Several options for choosing a reference point are discussed. First, the reference point is based on the clinically favourable solutions (iCycle solution) of different scans from the same patient. And then the reference point is based on the iCycle solutions fromscans of different patients. The conclusion was that it is best to use the iCycle solution of the planning-CT of the same patient or the mean of iCycle solutions from other patients as reference point. This is also convenient in practice, since almost no prior data for a specific patient is needed in the treatment planning process and the outliers have little influence.","radiotherapy; reference point method; iCycle","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Mathematical Physics","",""

(mentor); Detournay, E. (mentor)","2016","The amount of mineral and energy resources in conventional reservoirs has been drastically diminished in recent years. This has led to the development of techniques to reach reservoirs which are not easy to access and, more specifically, where boreholes with complex geometries need to be drilled. Directional drilling allows to accomplish such complex boreholes. Although this process is not new to the industry, its complex dynamics have been responsible for the development of both numerical models and closed-form models in terms of delay differential equations. Such models can be used to predict the evolution of a borehole or to develop control strategies. Current state-of-practice control methods are basically open-loop techniques, where an operator has the task to steer the drilling system while trying to follow a reference for the borehole trajectory. This usually generates undesired behavior such as borehole spiraling and kinking. In order to provide a way to avoid these undesired effects, novel control strategies need to be designed to improve the directional drilling process. In order to improve the performance of this type of processes, some efforts have been made to propose a control strategy. One of the most recent approaches makes use of the model developed by Perneder and Detournay (PD) at the University of Minnesota, which describes the three-dimensional evolution of the borehole, with a set of nonlinear delay differential equations. The proposed control strategy implements a state-feedback controller to this model; hence it relies on availability of full-states measurements, which are not available in practice. The goal of this thesis project is to extend this controller design making use of only local measurements of the orientation of the bottom-hole assembly. This is accomplished by including an observer in the control structure. Furthermore, the proposed controller design is robust against parameter uncertainty. The approach taken considers initially the case where the bit does not exhibit the so-called bit walk, simplifying the controller design. The effectiveness of the resulting robust output-feedback control approach is illustrated on realistic drilling scenarios.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","Mechanical Engineering Track Control","",""

(mentor)","2016","Lung tumors are heterogeneous entities consisting of distinct intra-tumor regions with different biological characteristics. Currently, the only means to explore and analyze these distinct intra-tumor regions is to inspect several image acquisitions. From these, per-voxel functional tissue parameters, representative of tissue properties, are extracted. This results in a high-dimensional imaging-derived feature space. However, the exploration and analysis of tumor heterogeneity based on the derived imaging data is a complex and time demanding task, due to its multi-modality and high dimensionality. Visual Analytics techniques can help optimize this process. Views based on dimensionality reduction are a common strategy to offer insight in high-dimensional feature spaces by constructing low-dimensional representations of the initial high-dimensional data. There is a great range of dimensionality reduction techniques. For this reason, we have to find the most suitable for visualizing and analyzing lung cancer imaging data. To this end, we selected and evaluated those who according to our opinion meet our visualization requirement. This requirement is the preservation of the local structure of the data in the low-dimensional representation, as an indication of intra-tumor regions being grouped together in the high-dimensional space. For the selection of the examined techniques, we evaluate them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The qualitative evaluation is performed by visually inspecting the low-dimensional mappings, while the quantitative by applying specific metrics. The best performing techniques are introduced in an existing visualization framework [1] and their anatomical coherence is examined. However, additional functionalities are introduced, hereby enhancing its exploratory value. Side-by-side comparison of multiple low-dimensional projections and automatic clustering on the embeddings are added in the tool. The proposed tool is evaluated by our collaborating clinical researcher with three real patient cases. Overall, the tool provided promising results, making easier the identification, inspection and hypothesis generation for intra-tumor regions.","lung; cancer; medical; visualization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Graphics Group","",""

(mentor); Verleg, R. (mentor)","2016","The carbon fiber industry is nowadays developing new grades of fibers that combine the high mechanical performance of carbon fibers in composites with more attractive cost structure. These developments are in the direction of heavy tow carbon fibers with tow values ranging from 50 to 60K. Using heavy tow carbon fibers reduces the cost structure of a composite part, compared to light tow fibers ranging from 3 to 12 K, by lowering the cost price of the fibers and the handling cost in manufacturing the composite component. The cost of heavy tow carbon fibers is approximately one-half the cost of conventional low tow carbon fiber. Additionally, the total cost of a carbon fiber reinforced composite(CFRP) part can be decreased by using fast curing resins systems like unsaturated polyester resins, resulting in even faster button-to-button production costs. Unsaturated polyester resins have not the as high properties as for epoxy resins but are lower in cost. The properties of heavy tow carbon fibers are however less than that of light tow fibers. So the properties of the heavy tow CFRP with polyester resins must be improved. The fiber manufacturer is developing new grades of sizings to increase the adhesion with these resin systems. Next to that, the unsaturated polyester producers are developing new resin systems to improve the compatibility with carbon fibers. By increasing the properties of heavy tow CFRP using polyester resins, the total cost of CFRP parts could significantly be reduced. Lowering the total cost of carbon composites means that the limiting factor of using this material in a lot of sectors will diminish. Sectors which could benefit from this are for example the automotive, wind turbine and infrastructure sectors. In order to assess the potential of high tow carbon fibers with unsaturated polyester resins, a study is performed. The fiber-matrix adhesion can be assumed to be directly linked with the mechanical properties of CFRP. Sizings have a great effect on the fiber-matrix interface strength. Within this study the effect of 6 different sizings on the static and fatigue properties of heavy tow CFRP were evaluated. From static and fatigue tests it can be concluded that the sizing do have a significant effect on the fiber-matrix interface fatigue strength of a CFRP. These results are verified by electron spectroscopy and DMA measurements. A sizing is selected which results in the best static and fatigue properties of CFRP made with polyester resin which could compete with CFRP made with epoxy resins. This means that heavy tow carbon composites made with polyester resins have a high potential in wind turbine, automotive and infrastructure industries. This study forms a basis for further research about the applicability of these composites. It is recommended to perform a dedicated feasibility study of polyester resin with the sizing selected in this study and to look what commercial products can be made.","CFRP; sizing; unsaturated polyester; fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-12","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace structures and materials","","","",""

(mentor); de Boer, M. (mentor)","2016","Sequential turbocharging is a technique where multiple turbochargers are connected to an engine. These turbochargers are switched in sequentially. The manufacturers of engines with this system claim that the part-load and transient performance is better in comparison to engines with a single turbocharger. These claims and other effects in these engines are not well documented in scientific literature. The motivation for this research assignment is the application of the Pielstick PA6B V20 STC on board of the Indonesian navy SIGMA corvettes. The sequentially turbocharged engines have been selected for this design, based on the operating envelope of the engine. At low speed, the sequentially turbocharged engines are able to deliver more torque than a normal turbocharged Diesel engine. Based on the operating envelope, the sequentially turbocharged Diesel engine is able to deliver similar benefits that are normally present in gas turbine and electric motor propulsion systems; high torque at low speed. However, DSNS prefers the use of Diesel engines for their robustness and available maintenance support. The design decision for a sequentially turbocharged Diesel engine during transient and low load operation is evaluated in this report. The TU Delft Diesel B model has been adapted to model the sequential turbocharging strategy. This has resulted in two different models, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. The first model is the Simple STC model; this model gets its name from the simple implementation in Simulink. It is able to reproduce the trends of a sequentially turbocharged engine. The Simple STC model is of the same complexity as the TU Delft Diesel B model, both in application and in computational load. The drawback of this model is that it does not correctly model the transition when the sequential switching occurs, but this error is only present for a few seconds. The Full STC model also gets its name from the implementation in Simulink; in this model the full gas exchange of the sequential turbochargers is modeled. This model is a significantly more complex model than the Simple STC model, both in application as well as in computational load. However, it does provide the possibility to model each turbocharger separately and as a result the transient switching effect is modeled more accurately. Both models have been thoroughly tested in a test-bench environment, both for steady state and transient analysis. The results have proven that the characteristics of a sequentially turbocharged engine are modeled correctly. It was proven that for the sequentially turbocharged engine, there are significant benefits for having two different turbocharger modes. Under steady state conditions, the mass supplied to the engine is of better quality in terms of mass flow and pressure for each of the different turbocharging modes in their respective working regions. This increased quality of air supply leads to lower temperatures, lower fuel consumption and higher available power for the same power rating. The Simple STC model has been applied in a model of the complete SIGMA corvette to simulate acceleration tests and to test new control strategies. This has provided insight into the limits of the engine-propeller-hull interaction during acceleration. The propeller and ships ability to absorb power are limiting the engine's available power when the results are analyzed in the operational envelope. It has been proven that the engine needs to ramp-up in speed almost instantaneously to utilize the full available power. The engine is not able to ramp-up that fast due to the dynamic interaction of the engine and turbocharger. When accelerating the engine it was found that at higher acceleration rates the turbocharger does not spin up fast enough and as a result the air excess ratio decreases during acceleration; this phenomenon is also known as turbo-lag. The maximum acceleration limit is determined to be 12.8 [rpm/s] which results in a minimum air excess ratio of 1.5. An alternative control strategy based on a minimum air excess ratio has been analyzed but this method did not result in a good control alternative. It did however give some insight into the maximum possible acceleration limits and provides a basis for future research into alternative control strategies.","diesel; diesel engine; marine diesel engine; marine propulsion; turbocharger; turbocharging; sequential turbocharging; advanced turbocharging; mean value first principle simulation; diesel engine simulation; STC; MVFP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Mechanical Systems Integration","",""

The uniﬁcation would mean the elimination of the need of different optimisation techniques for different stages of the landing. Using convex optimisation, convex guidance is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global-optimum of the design space. This study analysis the convex guidance algorithm in depth and establishes the magnitude of the errors introduced by simplifying assumptions. Subsequently, the performance and robustness of convex guidance is investigated in a full guidance, navigation and control loop. It is found that convex guidance can practically be used for a pin-point Lunar landing. However, the combination of a large discretisation step with a zero-order hold function for the optimal control proved to be an ineffcient solution for optimising the spacecraft’s attitude. A linear control function proved to greatly reduce the attitude control effort, and requires far less computational effort than reducing the discretisation step of convex guidance. Therefore, it is recommended to at least use a ﬁrst-order function for the control vector. Furthermore, because no attitude dynamics are modelled by convex guidance, large attitude discontinuities can occur during the landing, and no initial- or ﬁnal-boundary attitude conditions can be imposed. Carefully tuned controllers can deal with these discontinuities without upsetting the system, but deviations from the optimal trajectory cannot be avoided. Therefore, a future study is recommended into expanding convex guidance with angular rate limiters to improve the robustness of the algorithm.","Convex Guidance; GNC; Lunar landing; Moon; convex optimisation; convex programming; trajectory optimisation; fuel minimisation; Extended Kalman Filter; Quaternion Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-01","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

The heart of electrical protection system is the relay which senses abnormalities and commands the switches to break the circuit during a fault. Hence, optimization of protection parameters has gained paramount importance to ensure optimum system protection. Induction motors are employed in a majority of the industries. Failures in motors due to undetected stator inter-turn faults are a major concern in industrial applications. Such an event perturbs not only the electrical network but also the production process due to unplanned shutdowns. Although modern day numerical relays offer advanced protection to motors with a wide range of functionalities, turn-turn fault detection at incipient stage proves to be an uphill task. The imbalance due to turn-turn fault draws the attention of protection engineers to focus more on the negative sequence protection. In most motor protection failure cases where a possible turn-turn fault in stator has occurred, either the relay fails to detect the fault at an incipient stage or false trips, disrupting the process. This leads to a conclusion that the settings of protection relay parameters especially those of negative sequence are not accurate for stator turn-turn faults. This thesis concentrates on (i) Simulation of stator turn-turn faults in ATP-EMTP MODELS to generate COMTRADE files (ii) Dynamic testing of the relay for negative sequence protection at various inter-turn fault severities using Omicron secondary injection. Finally, an ideal setting for negative sequence protection, taking into account of current transformer saturation and errors, is suggested for the induction motor under consideration and the results are presented accordingly.","ATP-EMTP; negative sequence protection; COMTRADE; Omicron; inter-turn faults","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor); de Vries, L.J. (mentor)","2016","Over the past decades, the trade of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been increasing. Firms export LNG to serve new markets, and serve markets where higher premiums are offered. Firms import LNG in order to diversify their import portfolio for reasons of security of supply and to capitalise on global price differences. Because of the increasing LNG trade, more import terminals are being built across Europe. Several scholars have contributed to research on the vertical coordination of parties on the LNG value chain, mainly studying motives for increased vertical integration based on transaction cost economics. While this purely economic approach yielded empirically confirmed results for vertical coordination trends, they could not suffciently explain the presence of a wide variety of market parties at regasification terminals in Northwestern Europe. From a selection of strategic management frameworks, dynamic capabilities theory was selected in order to study strategic motives of firms that, complementary with transaction cost economics, could fully explain the witnessed coordination patters. A in depth empirical analysis of the Northwest European LNG market is used as a case study. In Northwestern Europe, integrated, tolling and merchant project models of regasification terminals exist. At tolling terminals, the shareholders have a facilitating role, whereas the firms involved in merchant terminals perform both trading and facilitating tasks. From a value chain perspective, the integrated and merchant models are quite similar in the sense that gas trading firms own assets further up or down the value chain. This clearly separates these project models from tolling terminals, where the ownership lies with a firm that does not trade at all. Although owners of tolling terminals play an important facilitating role for the trading activities of other companies, they can hardly be called integrated themselves, as their activities at the terminal do not link any mid- and downstream activities from a value chain perspective. From a transactions cost perspectives, it is expected that firms trading with the highest frequencies are the most likely to be terminal owners, as this allows them to capitalise on the transactions costs of capacity acquisition. Subsequently, this is not in line with the presence of tolling terminals, as the owners of these terminals do not trade LNG. Application of the dynamic capabilities theory unveiled the motives of the shareholders at tolling terminals. While the shareholders at merchant and integrated terminals were found to be large oil & gas companies, for whom the construction of regasification terminals is a logical step in order to connect their value chains and reduce their transactions costs, the owners at tolling terminals were generally TSOs with government mandates. These TSOs have a unique set of capabilities combining local relational resources and a wide experience in the transport and handling of gas. Furthermore, their strategical motives are to increase gas import possibilities for local traders and energy companies who want to integrate up the value chain to reduce their transaction costs. By investing in LNG infrastructure TSOs provide possibilities for such firms to import LNG without bearing large investments cost with the accompanied risks. Thus, a combination of transaction cost economics and dynamic capabilities has provided a coherent explanation of variety of market parties and coordination trends at downstream LNG.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation","","SEPAM: Energy & Industry","",""

(mentor); Semsar-kazerooni, E. (mentor); Ploeg, J. (mentor)","2016","Nowadays, traffic congestion on highways is still an increasing problem, in the Netherlands and worldwide. Hence, there is an increasing societal demand for innovative solutions for this problem. Preferably, these solutions also contribute to the reduction of fuel consumption (and hence emissions) and higher traffic safety. This has raised the interest in the development of automated highway (platooning) systems. If vehicles would drive together in a platoon with small inter-vehicle time gaps of well below one second, the road capacity of existing roads can be increased significantly. Moreover, due to the lower aerodynamic drag, especially for truck platoons, the emission can be reduced. Driving safely at very small inter-vehicle time gaps, however, requires vehicle automation in both longitudinal and lateral direction, due to the limited reaction time of a human driver. Most research activities regarding automated vehicle platoons focus on the longitudinal control of a vehicle, and less research has been performed on the aspect of lateral automation. This is one of the main motivations for this work to focus on the development of a lateral controller for cooperative vehicle platoons. For the lateral control, a vehicle following control strategy is proposed, in which the design strategy is based on vehicle path following rather than direct vehicle following. The former approach shows better tracking performance based on numerous research studies. For the control design, a linear vehicle model is used and the error dynamics of a vehicle with respect to a reference path, generated by a preceding vehicle, are derived. A static output feedback control law is designed in combination with a feedforward controller based on the control input of the preceding vehicle which is obtained through wireless inter-vehicle communication. As a result of the vehicle following control strategy, the lateral dynamics of the individual vehicles are coupled through the cooperative control law. Therefore, string stability in the lateral direction should be taken into account in the controller design, as well. In literature, lateral string stability has been achieved for direct vehicle following control methods, but this concept is not well developed in the scope of lateral control methods for vehicle path following, in the scope of platooning. In this work, a method has been developed to analyze the platoon dynamics in the frequency domain, where the lateral control of each individual vehicle is based on the proposed vehicle path following control method. Marginal lateral string stable behavior is obtained for the designed control strategy, evidenced both in the frequency domain and in time domain simulation. Finally, the control algorithm has been implemented and tested using two Toyota Prius III vehicles. Different lateral maneuvers, such as a lane change maneuver, are performed both at low and high speed. The experimental data validates the analytic results and shows that the lateral dynamics of automated vehicle platoons can successfully be controlled using the proposed vehicle path following control method.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","","A16.026.274",""

It could reduce their functionality or even cause death (Boyé, 2015). It is important to find the cause of these falls to improve falls prevention. A research was set up to find the problem areas within one’s home. This resulted in a variety of design directions: lighting, help with bending over, extension of a chair’s balancing point and redesigns of existing products to fit the target group better. The direction for this project is lighting for nightly transfer. A set of experiments resulted in a list of requirements regarding lighting characteristics for seniors. Important requirements are keeping the light source out of sight, avoiding bright reflections on the wall, placing the lights in the middle of the wall at an angle of 45 degrees, improving contrast, using an illuminance between 5 lx and 15 lx and a colour temperature of 2000K. The design is a system incorporated in the entire route from bedroom to toilet and is controlled by a sensor system and remote control. Installation has been made as easy as possible with surface adhesives and a guide showing all the details. The final stage of this project is a concept design, with all requirements incorporated and tested with elderly people. For this project the design and requirements were tested to use at nighttime. However, the design and its requirements are applicable to daytime situations as well. A darker day due to bad weather or darker areas in the house such as staircases could use this type of lighting as well.

(mentor); Detournay, E. (mentor)","2016","Due to the exhaustion of conventional reservoirs of oil, gas and mineral resources over the recent years, the need to drill to unconventional, hard-to-reach wells has increased. Directional drilling techniques allow to drill the complex borehole geometries necessary to reach those wells. In practice, boreholes drilled with a directional drilling system often show undesired spiraling behavior. A large amount of research has been performed in the past to model the directional drilling system, in order to understand the causes of these unwanted effects. However, current models generally are based on many greatly simplifying assumptions, such as ideal contact of the stabilizers. With ideal stabilizer contact, the stabilizers of the directional drilling system always remain in contact with the borehole wall. However, the diameter of the borehole is generally larger than the diameter of the stabilizers in practice, thus resulting in non-ideal stabilizer contact. In this research, a hybrid model of a two-dimensional directional drilling system is derived, by taking non-ideal stabilizer contact into account. The BHA dynamics are described by a two-stabilizer distributed model. Combining the BHA model with a model for the kinematic relationships and bit-rock interaction, results in a borehole propagation model. The borehole propagation model is transformed into a delay differential state-space model, subject to a complementarity condition. By analysis of this hybrid model, an explanation can be given of the effect of non-ideal stabilizer contact on the occurrence and stability of the (quasi-)stationary trajectories. Furthermore, numerical simulations provide insight in the limit cycling behavior of the directional drilling system. These limit cycle are believed to be closely related to borehole spiraling, and thus the presented model provides more insight in these oscillating effects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The wind energy industry in order to find stronger winds, has to go further offshore and move into deeper waters where bottom founded wind turbines cannot be deployed anymore. This is the main reason why floating wind turbines have been studied extensively in the past years. In the case of regions with cold climates, ice loads become significant and have to be taken into account when designing an offshore structures like an offshore wind turbine. As soon as this strong background on ice is founded through extensive literature study, a set of existing measurements of level ice from the “ARISE” expedition that took place in Antarctica in East 2003 was used in order to formulate a random varying thickness ice field. This is achieved by constructing a tool which based on the spectrum from the existing measurements, a new random varying ice thickness floe is generated. An existing model that considers constant ice thickness floes was updated in order to account for varying thickness fields. This was accomplished by modelling the ice floe as an Euler – Bernoulli beam of varying cross – section. It is noticeable to mention that ice fails in an arc shaped wedge. An FEM numerical model was implemented in FORTRAN that accounts for the variations in thickness. Moreover, beam elements of different widths were used in order to build up an approximation of the arc shaped wedge. By coupling the FORTRAN code with the aeroelastic code HAWC2, the effect of the varying thickness ice field is compared with the constant ice thickness floe. The results obtained generally revealed a decrease in the ice loads when a varying ice field is considered. Moreover, it is observed that the varying ice thickness field introduces a more dynamic effect on the structure, especially for the low drifting speeds. As soon as aerodynamic loads are also included, then it is also noticed that the combined wind and ice loads, give rise to frequencies different from the ones only the ice loads excite.","offshore wind energy; spar floating wind turbine; iceloads; response analysis; level ice; varying thickness; FEM; Euler-Bernoulli beam theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Conductive polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) have been used extensively to enhance the sensitivity, versatility and biocompatibility of electrochemical- and biosensors. Both their electrochemical stability and their mechanical properties make them highly suitable for applications that require sensors to be implanted in the body for longer periods of time. In addition, they provide great opportunities for nanostructuring, due to the inherently bottom-up nature of electropolymerization from monomer solution, by which the active surface area can be increased. In this project, various conducting polymer nanostructures were created on planar metal and polymer electrodes using templatefree electropolymerization methods. Several methods, all template-free and performed in aqeous environment, were used. The most succesful method, because of its versatility, simplicity, controllability and its potential to create high surface area structures, relies on reduction of the polymerization current in steps. This promotes heterogeneous growth of polymer in later steps, creating nanowires and hierarchical structures. After the formation of nanostructures on gold and PEDOT planar electrodes, the changes in electrochemical characteristics were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry, by measuring the changes in their interaction with a well-known redox couple, hexacyanoferrate(II) and -(III). The results show that modification of gold electrodes with conducting polymer nanostructures has strong effects on charge transport and may significantly increase the sensitivity of a sensor based on this platform. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirms that all created nanostructures decrease charge transfer resistance and diffusion impedance to some degree, and some decrease them by orders of magnitude. Adding nanostructures to PEDOT electrodes is less effective, with only polyaniline nanowires demonstrating an increased sensitivity and decreased diffusion impedance. In addition to this method being a simple, cheap and controllable way to increase the active surface area and sensitivity of electrochemical sensors, there are several other advantages of using it to modifiy electrodes. The electropolymerization process lends itselfwell to effective immobilization of bioreceptors on the surface, and because of the large surface area of the nanostructures, the number of accessible binding sites can be increased, increasing the sensitivity of the biosensor. This stable immobilization, as well as the electrochemical stability of the polymer itself and mechanical properties that match those of soft tissue better than those of more conventional electrode materials do, make it possible for sensors to operate inside the body for longer periods of time.","conductive polymers; electropolymerization; biosensors; nanomaterials; electrochemical sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Micro & Nano Engineering","MNE 2016.031",""

This results in meta-materials, which are future materials tuned to the needs of the user. To change the Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus, most current designs exploit mechanisms and hinges to obtain the desired behavior. However, this leads to non-linear material properties and anisotropy, especially for large strains. In this work a method is proposed that makes use of specially curved leaf springs (ideal springs) in a planar lattice. The spring characteristics directly determine the Young’s modulus, furthermore is the Poisson’s ratio designed to be zero. These properties are isotropic and linear up to large compressive and tensile strains. The spring designs may not only be used in a lattice, but also could be used as ideal springs or zero free length springs in the field of static balancing.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Popov, M. (mentor); Ndreko, M. (mentor)","2016","An ever increasing interest in renewable energy sources (RES) in order to reduce global carbon emissions and alleviate problems posed by climate changes has lead to dramatic increase particularly in offshore wind energy projects. Several different projects are currently being executed and so many are being planned for the future. The location of wind power plants is increasingly going farther away from shore with more and more challenges and opportunities. With the increased distance to shore, HVAC (High Voltage Alternating Current) transmission is consequently becoming impossible to be used as a result of increase in cable charging currents with distance. As such, HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) transmission is becoming the only alternative to transmit power from far offshore wind power plants to shore. Two ways of doing this; point-to-point connection and multi-terminal connection. Multi-terminal connection offers dramatic improvement in flexibility, security, reliability of power supply, and with current advancement in power electronic control, offers so much. Thus, a multi-terminal grid connection is the subject of this thesis. The most important issue for multi-terminal grids has been it's controllability. Two most important controllable parameters in multi-terminal grids is voltage and power with voltage being more important as IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistors) switches are still very sensitive devices. Beside, controlling voltage entails controlling power as they are both dependent on each other. This Thesis proposes a new computational-based control philosophy for the direct voltage and active power control of a VSC (Voltage Source Converter) based multi-terminal offshore DC grid. The limitations of the classical control strategies to HV-MTDC (High Voltage Multi-terminal Direct Current) grids were studied and in particular direct voltage droop control strategy. The main drawbacks of classical voltage droop control is its difficulty to reach power reference set-points and does not ensure a minimum loss profile in the event of contingencies. The proposed strategy is capable of addressing these weaknesses by combining the advantages of the droop controller such as robustness and exceptional ability to compensate for imbalance during contingencies, and the advantages of the constant active power controller which has the ability to reach easily power set points. Thus, the direct voltage droop control strategy and constant active power control strategy were combined, simultaneously solving the drawbacks of each. The advantages of the new Fuzzy controller is the reduced computational effort, the high degree of flexibility, limited influence of topology or the size of grid, and the near zero percentage error. The control strategy is demonstrated by means of time domain simulations for a three terminal VSC-based offshore HVDC grid system used for the grid connection of large offshore wind power plants. Furthermore, a high level controller in the form of an optimal dispatcher was implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer to form a complete hierarchical control system - The fuzzy based strategy is used at the local layer and an optimizer/scheduler at the upper layer. The Optimizer optimizes for losses and provides optimal reference set points to the fuzzy-based controllers. The optimizer also checks regularly the available wind power and when it changes, it defines new set points. It uses the new information on wind generated to recalculate set points and return all nodal power fixed terminals to pre-disturbance levels. However results of the GA optimizer in comparison with traditional Newton-Raphson method do not show considerable improvement in reducing losses as expected and this was confirmed by similar works reported in literature. Finally, simulation results are presented in order to demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed control strategy in meeting all the design objectives. No deviation in power or voltage from the references, no influence of topology, configuration, or size. Hence, there will be no need for a secondary corrective action to alleviate the deviations.","HVDC; VSC; MTDC; knowledge-based control; fuzzy control; genetic algorithm; transmission system; offshore grids; HV-MTDC; hierarchical control; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy (ESE)","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

The development of cheaper, non-invasive imaging techniques has gained a lot of attention in the bio-medical sector. Cheaper imaging techniques are not only interesting for the developed countries, but specially for developing countries. I aim that further development of the of a scanning technique based on the proof of principle demonstrated in this report can provide a cheap technique for the detection and localisation of tumors. The technique can be made cheap because its main physical components are magnetic nanoparticles and magnets, both of which can be produced by cheap processes.The measurements done for the experiment have been done with an Ipad, which demonstrates that no high sophisticated measurement tools are required to build the proposed technique.","tumor detection; particle detection; magnetic nanoparticles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Microelectronics","","","",""

Meanwhile, Philips Lighting is looking for solutions that offer more than mere functional light in an increasingly LED-based industry, to give retailers a competitive advantage over their rivals. This project was set out to explore connected applications for Philips that take their value proposition beyond lighting and aim to make the physical store relevant again. An ‘outside-in’ analysis of the market revealed a major transformation in fashion retail, where the biggest players are globally rolling out RFID infrastructures to track their assets on an individual level. Prominent fashion retailers employ RFID technology to keep their inventory accuracy as high as possible using hand-held readers. To be able to have an optimal ‘On-Shelf Availability of their merchandise, and to be able to offer their customers a true ‘Omni-Channel’ experience, this inventory accuracy is absolutely essential. During this project it was discovered that a new asset tracking technology is on the verge of a breakthrough. Under the radar, retailers are experimenting with ceiling mounted RFID readers, which allows them to track their individual assets in real time. Based on this discovery, a demonstrator was setup in a mock-up fashion store in one of Philips’ research facilities. This demonstrator encompassed a setup of RFID hardware and integration software of multiple companies and was able to show the possibilities of ceiling mounted RFID technology. The top use cases were validated and it appeared that indeed the ‘On-Shelf Availability’ and ‘Omni-Channel’ experience were the most valuable benefits for retailers and shoppers. Because Philips Lighting wants to be able to offer a connected lighting grid in the ceiling of its customers, it will be interesting to look for possibilities to integrate ceiling mounted RFID sensors with luminaires. If Philips is able to offer retailers a ‘Digital Ceiling’, capable of identifying and localizing individual clothing items, it truly has developed a proposition beyond lighting. The proposition has been proven and a solid foundation was laid to design a profitable business model. The first steps have been taken to collaborate with other companies to learn more about developing asset tracking solutions. It is recommended that Philips dives even deeper into the RFID playing field, in order to become dominant in the market of Fashion Retail IoT.","IoT; fashion; retail; omni-channel; Philips lighting; item intelligence; asset tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The determination of the material thickness and quality, prior and after transfer, is accomplished through optical contrast, Raman spectroscopy and AFM. The transferred material that remains suspended on top of cavities forms devices (mechanical resonators) that are subsequently analysed by laser interferometry and AFM (central indentation) in order to find the in-plane tension and the Young’s modulus of the h-BN. The characterisation includes a study of the temperature dependence of the resonance frequency from 3K to room temperature. The possible applications of these devices range from pressure to temperature sensing for instance.

A new modeling technique was applied to two salt-cored anticlines, the Jbel Amsittene and the Imouzzer anticline, combining remote sensing geological and structural data, integrated in a 3D structural modeling environment (Gocad). This allows for the extraction of the thickness distribution for the identification of pre-Alpine locations of sediment depocenters. Further, the tectonic history of folding, using 2D section balancing (Move) and 3D unfolding and strain analysis (Gocad), is investigated. In a small field study, the large scale modeling results are compared to small scale field observations. Salt and folding mechanisms in the context of the geological setting and history are discussed and their impact on Jurassic to Early Cretaceous sediment pathways are outlined. The expression of folding on the sea-floor and the impact of the presence of pre-orogenic anticlines on the Alpine folding processes are debated. The results suggest Early to Middle Jurassic salt activities potentially initiated by pre-orogenic exhumation in the hinterland and subsidence towards the offshore, resulting in a hydraulic head gradient causing salt flow. Another scenario are pre-orogenic phases of tectonic shortening or salt flow by increased thermal activities. The topography that was created certainly controlled the sediment distribution of passive margin sands into the offshore basin. Jurassic salt mobilisation also had an impact on the Alpine-folding process which might have resulted in a connection of smaller isolated salt diapirs leading to a variety of strike orientations of folds in the basins.","Morocco; Western High Atlas; Structural Modeling; Salt Diapirism; Basin Geology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","",""

The analysis determines the contribution of each control activity to project success and, based on comparison and matching of results, proposes a redefinition and re-clustering of the most important control activities in a new framework. The result is a framework composed of 98 project controls clustered in 8 control areas, namely Planning, Governance, Accountability, Performance, Outcomes, Solution, Uncertainty and Stakeholders. In order to better understand the applicability of the new framework across industries, three interviews were conducted with practitioners. Since the results from the interviews have not provided a strong level of assurance on the applicability of the new framework, an improvement is suggested based on the re-clustering of project controls. The new framework is intended as a contribution to existing theories on project control and may be used for future investigation.","fit-for-purpose; project controls; control framework; success criteria; success factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Composite grid-stiffened and lattice structures have been the focus of an increasing amount of research over the past decades, mainly because of their excellent structural performance. Most of the previous and current research focuses on analysis, manufacturing, and optimization of the base structure. Although more and more is becoming known about grid structures, methods for introducing loads mid-panel are scarce. With some applications requiring hundreds of attachment points, the potential impact of the attachment points is significant. Therefore, development of an efficient attachment method can allow grid structures to be used in an increasing number of applications. Recognizing the state of the art, a new concept for in-panel attachments is developed, which adds a laminate patch between the ribs of the structure to allow traditional fastening methods to be used. To analyze this concept, a rapid analysis method is constructed which makes use of several analytical methods and a fully parametrized finite element model to predict the strength of the attachment point. The feasibility of the concept and the used analysis method are validated by destructive testing of multiple test samples, and correlating the obtained data to the model. Resulting from the observations, several improvements are made to the model. Although some issues in the base structure are identified in the process, the feasibility of the novel attachment method is shown.","Fiber-reinforced polymer; composite; lattice; grid-stiffened; attachment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

In the last years the increasing complexity of modern aircraft, however, has led to an immense demand for collaboration of different manufacturers in order to stay competitive. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in establishing effective supply chains and ensuring not only internal quality, but also applying existing quality management principles and instruments on the whole supply chain. In order to contribute to the recent developments in the emerging research field of supply chain quality management, this master thesis follows a twofold approach by first, reviewing the current state of the art and pointing out the derived best practices and, second, conducting a case study at the Airbus Single Aisle fuselage production, hereby analyzing the industrial processes and making recommendations on how to improve the existing Airbus processes. The in-depth knowledge acquired during the case study helps to understand how the aeronautical industry strives to fulfill the authority requirements and customer expectations in terms of product quality and how the existing quality management methodology is applied and expanded into the growing supply chains of aircraft manufacturers. In addition, the developed methodology and the identified factors for effective supply chain quality management as well as the weaknesses and strengths of the applied processes provide a foundation for further research within this field.","supply chain; quality; management; aerospace; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

(mentor); Koolwijk, J.S.J. (mentor)","2016","As part of the participative society, the government introduced the Social Support Act 2015 ( Wmo 2015). The Social Support Act 2015 has as main objective to foster independent living as long as possible with care at home . Research by Janssen and Moors (2013) show that many elderly retain control over their own lives and be prefer independent living as long as possible. This need appears fundamental and is supported by the Wmo 2015 and promoted by the government. In practice the Wmo 2015 means that if the elderly need support, they will not get an indication for living in a care facility. This increases the pressure on the demand side significantly . Because of declining health such support is necessary. Within the participative society the government appeals to the social environment and expect more autonomy from the elderly. Unfortunately living independently as long as possible, possibly with restrictions, does not necessarily mean that the current housing and habitat is suitable. Often, the house should be adjusted in time to get customized home care or assistance. Moving is not an option where the elderly have a preference to stay in their own familiar living situation and environment. It is expected that thereby greater demands will be made on intergenerational help. Society must remain critical to autonomy of the elderly and also take into account the extent to which intergenerational help can be more responsible. The influence that living independently in the current home has on the health and well-being of older people should also be taken into account. Research by Pastalan (1999) and Kielhofner (2002) to place attachment, shows there is a relationship between objective aspects and the perception of these aspects of housing and the attachment of older people to the place where they feel at home . This research also shows that elderly people from urban areas in several European countries, despite cultural differences and individual variations , experience the feeling of home in one and the same way. The government encourages the elderly for longer independent living and independence in their own home outside of the healthcare institutions. Autonomy and call upon the social environment to be able to live independently puts pressure on elders their health and well-being and their social environment. Also, there is uncertainty about the extent to which factors weigh in the feeling of well-being among the elderly. These factors directly affect the autonomy and the ability to live independently for as long as possible . There is uncertainty about the extent to which previously examined factors weigh in the sense of health and well-being among the elderly. These factors directly affect the autonomy and the ability to live independently as long as possible . A better understanding of the relationship between housing characteristics, the health and well-being of elderly people living independently, the provisions and factors that facilitate autonomy of elderly is essential. This study responds to this social demand and aims to provide practical insights and recommendations around welfare requirements for elderly people who want to live independently as long as possible. By providing insight into what is necessary and desirable for the elderly to live independently, handles are being offered to government and housing associations for concrete steps that can facilitate this issue of the elderly. Furthermore, this research responds to current developments in society by integrating cultural aspects in the debate about the independence of the elderly in their own home . In addition to the social relevance, this study also contributes to the existing academic literature by introducing the cultural dimension. This study is the first in which cultural aspects are integrated into already developed theories surrounding welfare requirements of elderly people who want to live independently as long as possible. With this an additional nuance is added to this field of research on the housing needs of (future) elderly and offered facilities by the government and with this direction to further research in this field is being provided. Based on the idea that the elderly want to live independently as long as possible, the question arises as to where the balance lies between the attachment to the home and the extent to which the property affects their health and well-being for older people from different cultures in the social rental sector. This question is central to this investigation. The research involves conducting expert interviews and distributing surveys among respondents throughout the country with an emphasis on The Hague, Rotterdam and Amsterdam. This population is divided into two groups called Facebook (youth population) and social rent (elderly population). Data from this survey are collected and processed with SPSS. On basis of this research can be concluded that factors such as attachment to the home, the extent to which the house facilitates independent living, the degree to which one feels to have control over the living conditions, the experience of the general well-being and age affects the perception of health by the elderly. If the health of the elderly decreases the dependence on others and therefore need to receive intergenerational help increases (ExCtrlBeliefs: β = 0.18). In addition, the degree of autonomy within the home will decline (MeaningIndepend: β = -0.41) just as the attachment to the home (Hattachment: β = -0.13) and the overall well-being (WRQoL_GWB: β = -0.23). As age (Age: β = -0.13) of elderls increases, a normal family home without life-extending adjustments will not be sufficient to facilitate the elderly in their daily activities (ErgonomyInHome: β = -0.12), and this will have a negative impact on their health and well-being. Well-being is largely determined by the degree to which one is satisfied with the living conditions and the degree of independence. More than with health, well-being is determined by internal/ subjective factors play a rol, whereas in health external factors do. Women experience less well-being than men (Gender: β = -0.18), which probably has to do with strong feelings of loneliness among older women in relation to men. We see that when factors such as health (EQ.5D_Sum2: β = -0.23), autonomy in the home (IntCtrlBeliefs: β = -0.29), satisfaction with the house (Hsatisfaction: β = -0.20) and the feeling of independence (Independent live: β = 0.17) decrease, well-being will also decrease. Now we know that independence contributes to well-being, the question remains what factors underlie autonomy. The regression analyses shows that satisfaction with the home, the emotional value attributed to the house and the extent to which the house facilitates autonomy have positive contribution here. It is notable how the degree of well-being also contributes to the degree to which one is able to relay on one selves at home. Autonomy already turned out to be important for the level of general well-being, but appears to be in a reciprocal relationship to well-being: well-being is also one of the factors enabling independence. Independent living is possible if the house allows older people to carry out their daily activities (ErgonomyInHome: β = 0.27). This increases the satisfaction with the house (Hsatisfaction: β = 0.20), the emotional value attributed to the house (Affective Meaning: β = 0.15) and autonomy within the home (MeaningIndepend: β = 0:33). In short, if these aspects to increase in value, the perception of independent living will also increase. This will result in an increase in well-being (WRQoL_GWB: β = 0.20) among the elderly. It can be concluded that receiving intergenerational help has a significant correlation with health and independent living. This means that if the health decreases the need for help increases. Another significant relationship defines that if the well-being of the caregiver increases, the need to provide care grows. The government needs to respond better to the well-being of caregiver by offering facilities to support the increasing need for care. This can range from providing financial compensation up to arranging for leave via legislation. On the basis of future research one could specify more precisely what facilities are needed for caregivers. The study shows that there is a significant difference between Dutch and ethnic minorities with regard to their attitude to providing intergenerational help. For ethnic minorities, the providing of intergenerational help is deemed more important than Dutch. The largest difference was found in the Dutch and Surinamese respondents. Interestingly, the need to receive intergenerational help, however, is independent of the cultural background. Where ethnic minorities in this case attach more value to providing intergenerational help, the native and ethnic minorities elders experience the same need of receiving intergenerational help when their health deems it necessary. So there is no relationship between culture and the value contributed to independent living. Stimulating the construction of generation homes, where residents of all ages can live in one (service) apartment and help each other when necessary, can significantly contribute much to solving the issue of caregiving. The cultural factor can be used to respond to other societal issues. The introduction of the civil society has had considerable impact on society in general, and as such, also within healthcare sector. This research offers recommendations to the government and housing corporations regarding the civil society. More specifically, recommendations are focused on the collaboration between municipalities among themselves and between municipality and local housing corporations. The civil society can be seen as a direct consequence of the increasing pace and scope of diversification of the cultural society. The prominent role of culture and cultural differences in current sociocultural issues that are high on the political agenda in several European countries, is also a clear indication of this development. The current issue of refugees is a striking example in this regard: refugees are becoming more and more part of our society, necessitating structural solutions concerning housing and employment. To reflect and to do justice to these societal developments and the need of more insights regarding the role of culture, this study takes on a cultural perspective that explores the influence of culture on factors that underlie the desires and possibilities of independent living. In addition, recommendations are offered regarding potential contributions that can be delivered by the government in this regard. This study furthermore confirms the assumption that ‘culture’ is an essential element of the current society which cannot and should not be neglected nor underestimated, which emphasizes the need to gain more understanding of the role of culture within different fields of research. This research furthermore provides hands-on insights and recommendations with respect to welfare requirements of elderly people who wish to live independently as long as possible. The elderly who intend to live independently should be offered the opportunity and should be provided with support and facilitation that allows them to realize this demand. This study aims to shed more light on this topic by exploring the conditions that are necessary and desirable for elderly people to live independently, and additionally offers guidance regarding ways in which the government and housing corporations can facilitate in this respect. As argued before, this study delivers a contribution to the academic body of knowledge by offering scientific insights based on the prerequisites of welfare/wellbeing and independent living of (future) elderly people in suitable homes. In addition, this research displays the current balance of factors that are of relative importance regarding welfare/wellbeing and independent living, as well as investigating the role of culture in this field. To our knowledge, this study is the first in which cultural aspects are acknowledged within the complex field of forces between wellbeing and housing characteristics. As a result, new insights are offered and fertile ground for further knowledge development and future research is created, besides potentially giving a new impulse to the political debate on this topic.","Wmo 2015; mantelzorg; place attachment; zelfstandig wonen; welzijn; gezondheid; welbevinden; cultuur; woningcorporatie; gemeente; overheid","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The Zechstein carbonates are an established petroleum play in North-West Europe including the Netherlands. Several undrilled Zechstein buildups have been identified around the Elbow Spit High in the northern part of the North Sea with GIIPs ranging from 1 to 109 m3. Since only few wells penetrate the Zechstein carbonates in this area, little information is known on productivity potential. Analogue studies of the Zechstein-2 Carbonate Member helps to understand the carbonate plays and increases the success rate of a potential drilling program. 20 gas fields in the Drenthe province in the Netherlands, with cumulative reserves of 57x109 m3, have been successfully producing from Late Permian Zechstein level for over more than 60 years. The objective of this study is to decrease the uncertainty of well and reservoir performance around the Elbow Spit High and other prospects through an analogue study of the Zechstein-2 Carbonate Member in the Drenthe province. The Zechstein-2 Carbonate Member varies highly in production behavior. Generally, porosity increases from basin- towards platform-facies and consequently reservoir quality improves towards platform facies. Porosity in basinal and distal slope facies tend to be very low (0-5%) and fracture networks become a main controlling parameter on reservoir quality. Predicting these fracture networks is viable for a sustainable field development. Due to the distinction between matrix and fracture porosity, corresponding fluid storage and conductivity characteristics these reservoirs can be classified as dual porosity reservoirs. Typical naturally fractured reservoirs show two distinct decline rate periods with a constant flow period in between. In this report, decline curve analysis from available production data is used to model the production decline and estimate reservoir parameters. The Warren & Root dual porosity model for constant pressure production is used to estimate the matrix-fracture storativity ratio, inter-porosity flow and reservoir size. Most Zechstein-2 Carbonate Member wells show a very high initial flow rate, fast decline and a moderate linear decline until the end of the lifetime. Platform facies reservoirs with high porosity are the best potential candidates for exploitation because of the high initial flow rates (27.000 m3/day per meter of reservoir) and largest connected gas volumes (9x109 m3). They do not show a direct correlation to the fracture networks although flow rates increase when placed nearby large open faults. Low porosity reservoirs (distal- to proximal slope facies) are highly dependent on the fracture network present. Initial flow rate per meter reservoir and cumulative gas production decreases to 3.500 m3/day per meter of reservoir and 2x109 m3, respectively. These wells show an increase in initial flow rate and connected gas volumes with increasing distance to the nearest open fault. The present-day principal stress in the Drenthe province is mainly parallel to the extensional open fracture trend and has probably contributed to their preservation. Consequently, knowledge on structural deformation history and present-day stress fields is compulsory for field development of low porosity carbonates. Wells should be drilled perpendicular to the maximum principle stress to encounter the highest open fracture density.","Zechstein; NE Netherlands; decline curve; production analysis; dual porosity model; carbonates; fractures; ebn; Warren & Root","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Airlines are subject to external events that may disrupt their day-to-day operations. These disruptions lead to additional costs for crew, fuel, aircraft, maintenance and a loss of passenger goodwill. Therefore, each airline has an Airline Operations Control (AOC) department that is responsible for disruption management. The problems faced by AOC can be highly complex and decisions have to be made under severe time constraints, economic pressure and various uncertainties. In addition, slacks in the schedule and availability of standby resources affect disruption management. To address this research question, a simulation model is developed which reflects the ontology of an AOC and its environment. Scenarios that have designed by industry experts are selected from the literature that represents a real-world disruption. Subsequently, a vast amount of qualitative data has been gathered that describe the socio-technical system in terms of uncertainties the controllers face, the tasks they perform and their interactions. By structuring the interactions and by conceptualizing the uncertainties into conditions and parameters, a model is designed that expresses both quantitative and qualitative aspects of AOC and it operating environment. The model is implemented into an order-sorted predicate logic software environment that is able to describe temporal properties. Model evaluation is done using a case by case approach in which for each case, condition sequences and parameters are selected. By conducting sensitivity analysis, the impact of the size of slacks, availability of standby resources and uncertainties on direct costs, utilization of reserve resources and passenger goodwill is determined. Subsequently, the implications of these factors on the decision-making process are analysed. For instance, evaluation of the results show that a lack of information to overcome an uncertainty could result in extra (unnecessary) tasks to be performed by other controllers in the decision-making process and it could result in deployment of costly recovery strategies.","airlines; airline operations control; decision-making processes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Transport & Operations","","","",""

In this thesis, we describe how we have built a photovoltaic emulator that is digitally controlled by a Simulink model. The model contains the typical characteristics of a PV array and is optimized with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a Buck-Boost converter. The output signals of this model will communicate via the Modbus communication protocol to a programmable AC/DC-converter. This converter will provide a configurable power output to the household grid, simulating realistic day-to-day conditions of a typical PV panel.

(mentor); Den Besten, J.H. (mentor); Van Woerkom, P.T.L.M. (mentor); Klein Breteler, R.F. (mentor)","2016","In structural analysis, multi-axial loads are often treated as a superposition of individual load com- ponents. Although this proves to be sufficient for static analyses, for dynamic and especially fatigue assessments, this sometimes leads to extreme overestimation of loads. In turn this results in highly over-dimensioning of structures to prevent failure due to fatigue. To provide a means for multi-axial testing, a load cell is designed, for measuring combinations of both forces and moments up to excitations of fe = 30 [Hz]. As the load cell is intended for validation of theoretical and experimental research, its accuracy must be as high as reasonably possible. Therefore, the question to be answered is how a load cell is created such, that it measures three forces and three moments independently and at a high accuracy. The load cell consists of a steel hollow circular cross-section, with flanges and a bolt-hole pattern at both ends. The transition to the flanges is smoothed with a varying wall thickness to reduce stress concentrations. The external dimensions and geometry are dictated by the experimental set-up of the first tests after calibration and by the required fatigue properties. The load cell is instrumented with 32 strain gauges, connected into 8 Wheatstone-bridges. Additionally, 32 Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are applied to the outer surface and another 14 FBG sensors are applied inside the load cell. Calibration of the load cell is performed for tension and compression only, Fz = ±1000 [kN]. The acquired data is analysed using both a linear and non-linear regression models, based on a maximum likelihood analysis. This data is used to define and assess the sensor sensitivity, non-linearity and the uncertainty (as a quantified direct pendant for accuracy). The results show a non-linearity in Fz measurements of less than 0:3% and an uncertainty of less than 0:4%, for the full working range of Fz = ±1000 [kN]. The tests show incredibly small transverse sensitivities, confirming good isolation of separate load components. For full commissioning of the load cell, however, further calibration of other load components is required. The results indicate as well that the accuracy of individual FBG sensors is met by strain gauges, only if applied in full Wheatstone bridges. Additionally, strain gauges show changing sensitivity and increasing non-linearity with increasing excitation frequencies, whereas FBG sensors appear unaffected. The immunity to electrical noise, the linear response and the sensor size make the FBG sensor a very promising measurement technique, which may be applied in many research areas. Further research to application and connection methods for FBG sensors may yield even higher accuracies and a means for quick application and testing.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor); Loeve, A.J. (mentor)","2016","In some types of endovascular surgery on the aorta, a catheter needs to be placed in a renal artery to enable renal artery stenting. Therefore, a catheter and a medical guide wire are maneuvered through the vascular system and placed inside the renal artery. In one in eight patients, the renal artery is angulated ≤50°, which could cause the catheter and the guide wire to deflect from the renal artery in direction of the heart. In the case that deflection leads to retraction of the catheter and guide wire from the renal artery, new attempts should be made to access the renal artery. The associated risks with the placement of a catheter and a guide wire are: embolization, subintimal dissection (18% of the renal artery stenting attempts) and prolonged intervention time and fluoroscopy. To prevent the foregoing problems, this project was dedicated to the development of a medical guide wire that comprises of a distal segment, from which its rigidity could be controlled and varied. A concept of laced cylinders was designed that consisted of four segments: a Variable Rigidity Segment (VRS); a shaft; a locking system and a handle. The VRS was made from a stack of cylindrical structures with curved contact surfaces between the structures. The curved contact surfaces enabled bending of the VRS because the structures were essentially rotated over one another. The cylindrical structures were stacked upon the shaft of the laced cylinders concept. Compression of the cylinders was realized by a pull wire, which ran on the inside of the laced cylinders concept from the most distal cylinder to the proximal side of the concept—where the pull wire was attached to a handle. By pulling the handle, the cylinders in the VRS were pressed on the shaft and thus the rigidity of the VRS was increased. A demonstrator of the laced cylinders concept was manufactured, which comprised a stack of 50 cylinders with a diameter of 7 mm. The stack of cylinders enabled omni-directional bending, wherein the rigidity in the stack of cylinders could be altered—without inflicting movement. Based on the experiments that were done on the demonstrator, was determined that the rigidity could be altered between 3-22 GPa, as a function of 3-21 N tensile force on the pull wire. To put the rigidity of the demonstrator in perspective; 22 GPa was half the rigidity of a commonly used stiff Radifocus guide wire (Terumo corp., Tokyo, Japan). The feasibility and functionality of the demonstrator, has shown the potential of the laced cylinders concept and has advanced the creation of a variable rigidity guide wire. Concerning rigidity control, the friction force between the cylinders was found to be the primary parameter and essential for estimation. The estimations on rigidity in the demonstrator correlated highly (R=0.98) with the experimental rigidity. Although the results were obtained with few measurements (n=3), the high correlation indicated that the estimator in this project was a good tool for determining the rigidity in the variable rigidity segment. However, more measurements are required for proper validation of the estimator.","medical guide wire; variable rigidity; catheterisation; rigidity control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Ortt, J.R. (mentor)","2016","BRICS countries are considered to be five countries with important roles worldwide. These countries nearly account for half of population in the world, with economic growth exceeded the growth of industrialized countries. Therefore, these countries become an interesting target markets for all sorts of technologies, including sustainable technologies. One of the prominent issues related to sustainable technologies is the high level of carbon emission, one of which is a result of transportation sector. Electric vehicles are perceived to be a solution to reduce carbon emission from transportation sector. With high population and high economic growth rate, BRICS countries also contribute to the global carbon emission. It is then interesting to see if electrical vehicles could be adopted in BRICS countries. Hence, this research aims to identify barriers to adoption of electric vehicles in BRICS countries and investigate how companies deal with these barriers. For further understanding, this research discusses the relationship between barriers and strategies. This research also investigates the relative importance of barriers and strategies based on the case study to identify if the companies have similar or different perspective on the barriers and strategies. This research is conducted in three steps; first step covers the current literature of barriers and strategies in general, using the literature of barriers and strategies for new high tech products as well as barriers and strategies for sustainable technologies. The second step covers the current literature of barriers and strategies in BRICS countries. Both steps generate the pre-specified list of barriers and strategies that are used for the third step, which is the case study to investigate whether the barriers and strategies from the list are occurred and if there are other barriers and strategies. The case study covers three different companies from three different countries, which are Nissan in South Africa, Mahindra Reva in India, and Renault in Brazil. The outcome of this research is the total 13 barriers, which are Production system; Complementary technologies; Network; Demand; Institutional; Technological; Natural resources and labour; Social, cultural, behavioural, and psychological; Macro-economic; Accident or events; Infrastructure; Financial; and Undesirable societal and environmental effect. It is discovered that demand, institutional, and infrastructure barriers as the most important barriers from the three companies’ perspective. Moreover, this research also result in the total of 15 strategies, which are Demo, experiment, and develop niche strategy; Top niche market strategy; Pilot project strategy; Lobbying strategy; Redesign niche strategy; Dedicated system or stand-alone niche strategy; Hybridization or adaptor niche strategy; Knowledge development’ Geographic niche strategy; Market research; Explore multiple markets niche strategy; Financial aid strategy; Establishment of standard strategy; Network creation strategy; Development of infrastructure strategy. It is discovered that lobbying and development of infrastructure strategies are the most important strategies to support the adoption of electric vehicles in BRICS countries. Lobbying strategy is important to get government support in order to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. The development of infrastructure is also important in order to provide the customers with sufficient public charging stations and eliminate range anxiety. The relationship between barriers and strategies are also discovers during the case study phase of the research. Specific strategy is implemented to tackle specific barrier, but more supporting strategy could also be implemented to gain more benefit or higher impact. However, the amount of resource dedicated for the supporting strategies might be less than its main strategy. Furthermore, one strategy could also be implemented and overcome more than one barrier. For example, lobbying strategy to get government support can overcome both demand and infrastructure barrier, depends of what kind of advocacy or lobbying done by the companies. It is also discovered that barriers can change overtime, depend on the current situation of the companies as well as the countries. Country that imports their cars might not experience technological and production system barriers, but once the production is established within the country, these barriers might occur and possible to be the most important barriers. Moreover, changing macro-economic situations could also result in different perspective of how macro-economic pose as a barrier in the country. It is understandable that in countries with unstable macro-economic condition, companies will consider macro-economic barrier to be important. However, once the macro-economic condition is stabilized, it is possible that the company will consider the macro-economic barrier as not exist. Macro-economic condition also affects government’s support for adoption to electric vehicles. The three countries investigated experience difficult macro-economic conditions; hence adoption to electric vehicles is not considered as top priority by the government, resulting in limited support from the government in adoption to electric vehicles within the countries. Lastly, findings in this research can be important for both managerial and academic perspective. For managerial perspective, this research can serve as a tool in deciding when to enter the electric vehicles market in BRICS countries as well as what kinds of barriers to be expected in the countries. This research could also serve as a tool in identifying appropriate strategies to be implemented in order to overcome the barriers. As for academic perspective, this research offers several possible further researches in relation with this field of research, such as government’s point of view and strategies for adoption of electric vehicles (or other sustainable technologies) in developing countries, investigation for dynamic nature of barriers which then would affect the changes in strategies, collaboration of triple helix industry – government – university to accelerate adoption of electric vehicles in developing countries, and comparison study between developed and developing countries to serve as a knowledge and learning possibility for developing countries.","barriers; strategies; linkages; electric vehicles; BRICS countries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values Technology and Innovation","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This graduation project is executed for the company Diaro. Diaro is a small silver foundry company which produces (intermediate) products for jewellers using investment casting, 3D modelling and printing. Diaro is eager to find a solution for the problem that silver clasps for jewellery break down relatively easy. This is caused by the fact that if the clasp has an internal spring, the spring will either wore out, or corrosion will occur because the spring is not made of a precious metal. When the clasp does not have an internal spring, but a locking mechanism that uses the elasticity of the material itself, this causes also a failure. Silver is a soft material and is therefore very sensitive for wear and tear. Only slight wear and tear can already cause a locking mechanism that uses elasticity to malfunction. To find a solution for this problem, the objective of this graduation project is to design a clasp made of silver of which the locking mechanism does not make use of an internal spring or the elasticity of the material. The design has to be suited for investment casting, while this is the production technique Diaro uses to produce the jewellery products they make. The design vision for the new clasp design: The new clasp that will be designed should be easy to unlock but at the same time should be trusted to stay locked when wearing and unlock easy in unsafe situations without breaking the closing mechanism. The form of the design has to be neutral, so it will fit as many style types of jewellery as possible. Furthermore, the shape has to enable casting as the best way to produce it. The mechanism that is used will not use of an external spring (this is a requirement which is set by the company). There is a preference to design the closing system of the clasp in such a way that no other materials than silver will be used. The clasp should also give a feeling of uniqueness to the user when they wear it. Important factors for the design: • Easy to use: the user can easy lock and unlock the clasp using only one hand; • Reliability: the clasp can be trusted to stay locked properly when wearing the jewellery; • Trustworthiness: the user trusts the clasp to stay locked, and is certain about the clap being properly locked; • Investment casting is the most suited production technique to produce the clasp; • The design is suited for mass production: production costs allow to sell it for a realistic price. The workings principle that is applied in the final design which keeps the clasp locked, uses a path that has a pattern with such complexity that is allows a user to lock the clasp easily using only one hand and is at the same time complex enough so the clasp will not follow the pattern by itself when the clasp is worn. The final design consists of a ball which has a diameter of 8 mm. Around this ball runs a spiral pattern. A pin with a small ball of 2 mm on the end. The spiral pattern has a starting point through which the ball of 2 mm fits. When the ball is put through, the user can start following the pattern by moving the pin around the big ball. The clasp is proper locked when the pin arrives at the top of the big ball, this is the end point of the path.","Investment casting; clasp; Jewellery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Products become increasingly interactive. These intelligent objects respond to user activity, particularly in a visual way. This report presents a research trough design project, on how to use video to design the interactive behavior of highly innovative products. It focuses particularly on designing products with a ‘skin’ made from the Light.Touch.Matters material (LTM). LTM is an innovative material with the unique potential to cover products in a flexible ‘skin’ that has great sensitivity and that communicates back with local color changes (light). Through interviews, insights were gained on the problems that LTM developers encounter. The most important insight has been that it is hard for designers to see the full potential of LTM. A major problem is that they do not have the means to conceptualize and present their ideas: They cannot make quick prototypes with the complex material and ‘still’ design representations (i.e. images) do not make the interactive behavior experiential. As a result, the dynamic aesthetics are not fully explored and developers are not on the same page. Simultaneously, a literature study had been done to gain insights from the current practices for designing future interactions. The conclusions of this study clarify what can be learned from current design practices and what should be done differently. All insights have been used to define a design goal and an interaction vision. Via an iterative exploration, specifications are developed for a tool that simulates (in video) dynamic changes in light and color. Then, a design approach had been created to give form to the tool. A pilot test has led to the final format: Chameleon, a workshop for designers and material scientists. Its purpose is to support designing the interactive behavior of products made with LTM. Chameleon is your canvas, tool box and guide to visualize the interactive appearance of a concept. At its core there are three steps: MAKE, PLAY and AWAKE. The workshop is highly iterative, e.g. you can see directly how a certain idea plays out. It can be held spontaneously, preferably in early stages of product development. A user test with design students confirmed that a workshop alike Chameleon could be of great value within design projects. However, the workshop can only be of success of the video compositing tool at its core is well developed.

(mentor)","2016","Optimization of drilling fluid properties is an essential part of cost effective drilling operations and process safety. Currently fluid properties are measured and optimized manually by human engineers with different skills and experience which might lead to nonoptimum drilling fluid properties that deteriorate its functionalities. Automated drilling fluid management is still at an early development stage. Several vendors are actively developing automated skids to measure drilling fluid properties in real time [1] [2], and several authors also have published scientific work on the use of the real-time measurement as a component of automated control systems that dose mud additives automatically to meet the mud specifications or setpoints defined by human engineers [3] [4]. During the well planning stage, the design process of mud specifications is carried out by engineers checking several scenarios using well planning software and their experience to come up with drilling fluid specifications. When hole cleaning and/or borehole stability conditions change during the actual drilling process that warrant updates or changes of drilling fluid properties, the specifications are updated in an ad-hoc manner, relying on the skills of human engineers. This thesis focusses on the development of a model-based optimization module for drilling fluid properties to help engineers in the planning and drilling phase to automatically derive drilling fluid specifications that meet the hole cleaning criteria, and satisfy the downhole pressure requirement and constraints set on the operating ranges of drilling parameters. The optimization framework will use proxy models derived from well hydraulics software that predicts cuttings concentration and downhole pressure as a function of the drilling fluid properties. Three objective functions for the optimization module are given as examples in this thesis. The first two objective functions deal with the hole cleaning criteria while the last one is a cost function that combines the cost of hole cleaning and downhole pressure management. The optimization module has been tested on a case study based on real field data. Given an objective function, multiple constraints, and proxy models, the module takes only a few seconds to find the optimum mud property values and drilling parameters such as flow rates, rotary speed and rate of penetration. A benchmark with the field data shows that the optimum drilling fluid properties and parameters result in significant improvement of the hole cleaning state while the downhole pressure requirement and constraints on the drilling parameters can still be satisfied. When a cost function is defined as a combination of hole cleaning and downhole pressure management, the module also gives a quantified benefit of the trade-off between maximizing hole cleaning and minimizing losses. Since this module can perform optimization very efficiently compared to the ad-hoc processes done by human engineers, this module may be of significant value for operating units to use in the planning and drilling phase and also in the future as an outer optimization loop for automatic drilling fluid control systems.","drilling fluid; automation; optimization; density; viscosity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Dalen, K. (mentor); Lu, T. (mentor)","2016","The Ampelmann system is an active motion compensation system that can compensate the vessel motions in six degrees of freedom. The Ampelmann, together with the attached gangway, makes it possible for people to transfer between a vessel and offshore structures safely. The Ampelmann system has been designed in the early stages based on a set of static load cases. For design and analysis related to fatigue life estimation, system operability and control improvements, it is necessary to obtain more insights in the structural dynamics of the system. With the earliest system approaching a lifetime of 10 years, fatigue lifetime is of high importance and forms the main goal of this study The main function of the Ampelmann gangway is to serve as a bridge for people transfer between the ship, where the Ampelmann system is placed on board, and the offshore structure. Ampelann utilize various types of gangway in the market. This will be focus primarily on the most widely used gangway (G25), which consist of a Main Boom and a telescoping T-boom. The transfer deck in which gangway is attached to is assumed to be rigid. To asses G25 for fatigue, first dynamic behavior under certain loading must be determined. In general the gangway in operation experiences various load conditions, which have to be taken into account. However, in this only the load condition under steady wind velocity, base excitation and rotation of the gangway under applied torque is considered. The T-boom cross section, dimension as well as weight are different to the main boom. The gangway as a whole consist of three parts: the main boom, overlapping T-boom in the main boom and the T-boom. The gangway is modeled as a step or segmented Euler-Bernoulli beam to describe the dynamic characteristic. The dynamic characteristics are the mode shape and natural frequency in its vibrating plane. Since the gangway is a ’U shape’ like beam, the offset of the shear center will cause coupled effect between bending and torsion in its relevant vibrating plane. A one dimensional Finite Element Beam model is implemented to determine the structural vibration characteristic and the dynamic behavior under external loading. From experimental data the damping ratio was determined and the free vibration decay between the one dimensional model and experiment was compared. It was found that the period of vibration and the static deflection of the model is slightly higher than experimental data. The dynamic behavior of the gangway under constant wind velocity was investigated. The results show that for high wind velocity the gangway is highly damped due to the aerodynamic damping in the model and also appears that bending displacement damped out faster than the torsional displacement. Two models were used to describe the dynamics of the gangway under base excitation, the first one being a sinusoidal model and the second model being a pulse excitation. The sinusoidal model is used to describe when the Ampelmann system is in non-compensation mode where the base dynamics are dominated by wave-induced vessel motions, while pulse excitation describes the system in compensation mode where the dynamics are dominated by the hexapod reaching its workspace limits. No coupled motion is expected in this case since the shear center lies on the vibrating axis. The results in sinusoidal model shows that the steady state is rapidly reached and less abrupt oscillation is observed when compare to the pulse excitation model. Vibration of the gangway during operational cycle (Luffing, Slewing and Telescoping) were also investigated without the wind loads and base excitation and later used to determine the fatigue life of the Ampelmann system. During telescoping motion of the gangway is was observed that the period of vibration decreases and increases when the T-boom is retracting and extending respectively. The fatigue life time analysis was done according to the stress life approach and rainflow cycle counting was used to obtain the number of stress cycles. The results show that the Ampelmann gangway can withstand up to 〖10〗^6 operational cycles. However, it should be emphasize that during operation external loadings is always present. Thus, the fatigue life time of the gangway will be lower than the expected number of operational cycles.","finite element; dynamics; beam theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Induction heating is used to heat offshore pipeline field joints to a required temperature for application of anti-corrosion coatings. The objective of induction heating is to obtain a uniform surface temperature of typically 230 ± 10 °C in a time-span of minutes. The desired temperature profile of the field joint, also known as heat profile is usually obtained in an systematic experimental approach by fine tuning of the coil geometry and power settings. The experimental approach contains many individual experiments which is time and resource consuming, especially whenever a complex geometry (a collar) is present in the field joint. For the experimental approach, Heerema Marine Contractors mainly relies on know-how about induction heating provided by subcontractors. In future, development of deep water oil fields will result in high operational flow line temperatures. This development increases the performance requirements for anti-corrosion coatings, leading towards increased requirements for more equally heated field joint surfaces. The challenges of uniform surface heating of collars, the dependence on subcontractors and the future developments are the motivation for this research project. Heerema Marine Contractors has the ambition to improve control of the induction heating process, to be able to deliver good quality flow lines required for future developments. The objective of this research project is the development of an induction heating prediction model based on understanding of the underlying physics. Modelling of induction heating is a complex field of engineering which only gained interest since the 1990's due to major improvements in computing power of PCs. Little knowledge is available in literature about development of an accurate induction heating prediction model. Therefore it was decided to use a systematic approach in which a prediction model was developed from a basic cylinder model by various steps into a full-scale model including a complex geometry. Firstly, material properties were obtained. Literature and analysis of Maxwell's equations showed that accurate evaluation of material properties and its temperature dependence is a key towards accurate predictions of the induction heating process. Secondly, a basic model was developed based on a simplified geometry of the field joint. Due to limited time and resources it was chosen to perform frequency-transient analyses. Therefore non-linearities in magnetic fields were linearised. This model was verified by use of a semi-analytical equations and found to be suitable for further development. After verification of the basic model, the model was used to model small-scale geometries including collar. It was concluded that hysteresis losses can have a significant contribution in high frequency induction heating and must be taken into account in modelling to obtain accurate temperature predictions. A simplified method was introduced to account for hysteresis losses in linearised magnetic fields. After validation with high frequency experiments, the model predicted for 90% of all data within ±10 °C of experimental data. The largest offset with respect to experimental data was considered to be the minimum achieved accuracy. The accuracy was Tpredicted = Tmeasured ± 13 °C. The small-scale model was used as basis for a full-scale model in which a typical offshore pipeline field joint was modelled. Due to high magnetic field intensities it was concluded that saturation in the magnetic flux density has a significant effect on the induction heating process. The model was validated by use of experiments. Two validation steps were included: first without collar and second with collar. The model predicted for 88% of all data within ± 10 °C of experimental data based on a field joint without collar. Based on the largest offset with experimental data the accuracy of the model was Tpredicted = Tmeasured ± 15 °C. For modelling of a field joint with collar, accurate results could only be obtained in validation for a limited range of the magnetic field intensity due to non-linear limitations in the solver technique. The required accuracy of ±10 °C was too ambitious for the model developed in the thesis project. However, the limitations can be overcome when a full time-dependent solver would be used, which results in long simulation times. During small-scale experiments it was observed that the induction heating process is very sensitive and therefore repeatability of the induction heating process is limited. During full-scale experiments for the validation of the model, large temperature deviations on the field joint were observed on positions that should have had an equal temperature. The precision of experimental measurements was limited, since deviations up to 11 \degree C were present. Therefore it was concluded that further development and validation of an accurate prediction model is limited by the experimental precision. The research project was the start of a greater project within Heerema Marine Contractors, in which the model developed during the thesis project can be further developed for optimisation of coil design. For further development it is recommended to improve the experimental methods to obtain validation data. A second recommendation is accurate determination of material properties of the alloys used in the field joint. Furthermore a time dependent solver should be selected to improve the non-linear magnetic relationship simulations for high magnetic field intensity around the collar.","induction heating; field joint; modelling; offshore pipelay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","After a visit at a revalidation center in The Hague a design goal was established: Providing motor neuron disease (MND) patients with upper arm functionality to improve their quality of life. MND patients gradually lose function of their muscles, even their respiratory muscles. It has a severe impact on their own life, but also the lives of friends and family. The project involved the company Adjuvo Motion, a company that focuses on robotic rehabilitation of the upper extremities of post-stroke patients. A 4C analysis was done, which covered both the company’s internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as the external world in which the product would be placed. This analysis was concluded by a SWOT analysis, which helped to generate a direction for future product development. This direction was modularity. A patient that is not able to move his hand does not require a full exoskeleton, only one for the affected area. An MND patient and a physiotherapist were interviewed, which lead to the insight that the support of activities of daily living (ADL) is the most relevant design focus to regain some quality of life. Additionally, being able to partake in social interactions was also shown to be relevant. A design vision was devised, which served as the foundation for the ideation phase: “I want patients to be able to regain independence by allowing them to perform activities of daily living. But I don’t want to stop there. I want people to be able to retain the social values that are accompanied by arm movements. I want to accomplish this in a user friendly way.” After a brainstorm session with a group of six master students, it was concluded that an exoskeleton has the most potential to accomplish the design vision, as it allows the most versatile functionality that can closely mimic the human arm itself. The architecture of the exoskeleton has been covered in depth, revealing many potential technologies that can be used, including the electroencephalography (EEG). This is the measuring of electrical brain activity. The MND patient’s brain remains unaffected, allowing the EEG technology to circumvent the affected areas to generate the desired movement. The Emotiv EPOC was identified as the most valid candidate to do the EEG measurement with. Multiple concepts were created, which were evaluated using the weighted objectives method. With this method, the concepts are evaluated by looking at wishes for the concepts. Via an online questionnaire, ALS patients provided their input on what wishes are more important to them than others. The chosen concept provides elbow and hand functionality by using electric motors that pull cables, which are connected to the arms and fingers. A prototype was created, which supported elbow flexion and extension and it was controllable with the Emotiv EPOC. To validate the concept, three user tests were conducted, including one with an MND patient. The MND patient was able to control the prototype just by the thoughts of moving his arm. A successful result, although the research also showed a few points to improve for the final concept. The final concept is the Exoten, named so because it is more like an external tendon, than like an external skeleton. The Exoten consists of two arm modules, a waist band and an EEG baseball cap. The waist band contains the rechargeable battery, the electric motors that reel in the cables and the micro-controller. The Exoten currently supports the elbow movement and a gripping motion, but it also allows for future expansion of functionality. In its current state, patients would be able to perform some of the ADL, but also gain a new way to show affection to their loved ones. The arm modules can be worn beneath clothing, which is beneficial to its comfort and its accuracy. The proof of concept is there, but it requires several future steps to become a reliable product that the target group can use: - More user tests to verify and improve the concept further. - Work together with Emotiv to create a reliable and integrated EEG device. - Include more stakeholders such as health care professionals to validate the product proposition","EEG; Exoskeleton; MND patients; Quality of life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Beuth, L. (mentor); Wobber, E.D. (mentor)","2016","The material point method (MPM) is a meshfree mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian method which utilizes moving Lagrangian material points that store physical properties of a deforming continuum and a fixed Eulerian finite elementmesh to solve the equations of motion for individual time steps. MPM proved to be successful in simulating mechanical problems which involve large deformations of history-dependent materials. The solution on the background grid is found in MPM by a variational formulation. The integrals resulting from this formulation are numerically approximated by using the material points as integration points. However, the quality of this numerical quadrature rule decreases when the material points become unevenly distributed inside the mesh. It is common practice in MPM to adopt piecewise linear basis functions for approximating the solution of the variational form. A problem arises from the discontinuity of the gradients of these basis functions at element boundaries leading to unphysical oscillations of computed stresses when material points cross element boundaries.Such grid crossing errors significantly affect the quality of the numerical solution and may lead to a lack of spatial convergence. As a remedy to these problems, a version of the MPM making use of quadratic B-spline basis functions is presented.The C0-continuity of their gradients eliminates grid crossing errors. Hence, a more accurate reproduction of physical quantities such as stresses and velocity is obtained. Using spline interpolation allows to more accurately approximate integrals, which enables the use of a coarser mesh. This in turn results in lower computational effort. To improve spatial convergence, the use of a consistent mass matrix instead of a lumped one commonly used with theMPM is suggested to project velocities from material points to the grid more accurately. Explicitly solving the linear system is avoided by using Richardson iteration. Improvements in terms of higher accuracy and rate of convergence are demonstrated for 1D benchmarks involving small and large deformations. In particular a vibrating bar and a column subjected to loading are considered. This master project has been carried out in the period from October 2015 until July 2016 with support and in collaboration with Deltares, a Dutch research and consulting company that is developing MPM software to simulate geotechnical problems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Numerical Analysis","",""

Addis Ababa is one of the fastest growing cities in Africa: the number of inhabitants is rising fast. More and more people from the countryside move to the capital. This puts a lot of pressure on the city and causes several problems. One of these problems is the shortage of affordable housing. People are struggling to find a place to live in humane conditions. The number of slum settlements is growing. In order to give people a place to live with improved living conditions, a new type of affordable housing is needed. In 2006 the Integrated Housing Development Program was launched to create more affordable housing (Keffa, 2014). Informal settlements are destroyed and replaced by condominiums. Also in the outskirts of the city areas are cleared from farms, villages and greenery to be replaced by condominiums, large apartment blocks. Large groups of people from the inner city are moved to these new areas, such as Yeka Abado and Legetafo Area. However, the condominium neighbourhoods raise questions and bring along new problems: they differ from the original compound and countryside structures.The system of the condominium neighbourhoods needs critical reflection and improvement. Program, basic infrastructure and human scale needs to be taken into account. To critically reflect and find methods to improve the current condominium neighbourhoods, research on several elements of both the condominium neighbourhoods and slum settlements is needed. The elements of research on the slum settlements will focus on ‘general’ aspects of slum settlements, while the research on the condominiums neighbourhoods will use Legetafo Area as a case study. Part of this research is comparing condominium neighbourhoods in the outskirts of the city with (successful) condominium neighbourhoods in the city centre and the original compound structure currently found in the slum settlements. Using the themes of boundaries, scale, proportion, proximity, density, social spaces, building technologies and income generation, will contribute in forming a design proposal. The design has been developed in trying to provide an alternative design within the condominium neighbourhoods to improve living conditions and create a good functioning and mixed neighbourhood that provides the base for a strong social structure.","Urbanisation; Addis Ababa; Affordable; Local Materials; Humane Conditions; Social Structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Global Housing: Cross-cultural Methods and Positions / Addis Ababa","","9.043124, 38.873807"

This is done by examining the application of regression methods to make early faults detection possible. The simulations are performed using historic process data from a crude distiller unit at the Shell Pernis Refinery. Datasets representing both normal and faulty operations are taken from two different subsystems of the crude distiller unit. The output datasets have irregular sampling times that are larger than the input variable datasets so this potential problem is solved by using a linear interpolation to estimate the missing values in the output datasets. The processes in the subsystems are modelled using finite impulse response (FIR) models. Five different regression methods are used to identify these models. This report concludes firstly that the ordinary least squares and ridge regression methods can be used to construct accurate out-of-sample prediction models of key process variables; and secondly, that this can be done without prior process knowledge or extensive process specific analysis.","process monitoring; predictive analytics; big data; industrial process; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor); Dijksterhuis, C. (mentor)","2016","Road safety is a prime concern in modern society. Statistics on traffic accidents show that articulated vehicles are overrepresented in fatal accidents. A third of all accidents happen during a vehicle maneuver with small lateral displacements: on-center handling. Stable guidance and handling behavior of the vehicle is mainly determined by its chassis, the vehicle dynamics and the steering system which needs to be reliable, predictable and to give the driver good steering feel. Defining steering feel is difficult because it is a subjective matter, but it is clear that good steering feel is necessary for safe vehicle control and an important element to driver experience. Next to the steering system mechanism and architecture the steering system parameters are important for truck driver steering feel. Mechanical systems will degrade over the life time of usage. Steering system imperfections are defined as the steering system parameters that change over lifetime. This study has been a first attempt to investigate the influence of the steering system imperfections on truck drivers steering feel during a simulation study. The first time used Mobile Truck Driving Simulator (MTDS) is validated by using earlier research, interviewing truck drivers, recording truck rides from the view of the driver, measuring dimensions, using employment guides and let professional drivers run test drives on the simulator. The study started with an explorative research on six steering system parameters that show a large degree of degradation: column bearing friction, bevel box friction, hydraulic cylinder friction, king pin friction, free play in the system and the tie rod stiffness. Professional truck drivers were asked to track the moment when the system does not show realistic steering feel anymore. During every test run one of the six steering system parameters is constantly changed using a predefined threshold tracking method resulting in general feedback and mean values of that particular parameter. The experiment resulted in three parameters which were varied in the main experiment: column friction, king pin friction and free play. The first objective of the main experiment was to find out how the three different steering system imperfections affect the steering feel of professional truck drivers. Steering feel is approached by a combination of four elements: general experience of handling, steering system, realism and steering system acceptance scale (SAS) based on the usefulness and satisfaction of the system. Professional truck drivers drove different test runs and completed a questionnaire. The increase of column friction, king pin friction and free play significantly influenced the evaluation of steering feel by the subjects. The second objective was to find out how the three steering system imperfections affect the objective driving indicators of professional truck drivers. Increasing the column friction results in an proportional increase of steering effort and driver burden. The increase of king pin friction to the first value results in an increase of steering effort, driver burden and steer jerk an increase of free play resulted in different steering reversal rate, an increase of steering business, steer rate, steer jerk and steering steadiness. This study shows the large impact of degradation of steering systems on driver experience and driver workload. No conclusion can be drawn on the driving performance regarding driving an articulated vehicle with a degraded steering system.","steering feel; steering system parameters; articulated vehicle; truck driving simulator (TDS); questionnaire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

Engineering and Policy Analysis at Delft University of Technology. Electricity storage is often portrayed as the solution for the challenges that an increasing capacity of intermittent generation brings. If the electricity storage facilities are to be introduced in the grid by private investors though, just like any other asset, they require a business case. This study is part of the DNV GL StRe@M project whose goals include the modelling of the economic feasibility of electricity storage facilities in future German electricity grid scenarios from a price-taking investor’s perspective by comparing costs and revenues. The two revenue streams considered in the StRe@M project come from the spot and reserve market, and this study focuses on modelling the latter for Germany. This thesis also provides a cost and revenue framework to assess the revenues from both markets and the resulting profits. First a qualitative study maps the German reserve market and the characteristics of its products to identify opportunities for electricity storage and the impacts of regulation thereon. Next a quantitative model is designed to assess the revenue potential of the future secondary reserve market by forecasting its demand and price levels. The modelling scope is limited to the secondary reserve (energy) market (named aFRR in Germany) only because of its relative market size, the low number of participants and data availability. A bottom-up approach was tried by looking for a quantified relation between (1) historical time series of forecast errors for load and solar and wind generation and (2) system imbalances or activated aFRR directly – a positive causal relation which often appears in literature. As no quantified relation could be found an alternative top-down stochastic approach then used the historical probability distribution of activated aFRR in 2015 to establish a stochastic function for aFRR demand in future scenarios up to a few years, preserving the properties of the historical probability distribution. An effort was made to scale this stochastic function for an increasing renewable penetration but no workable scaling could be obtained. The future prices to accompany the forecasted volumes were determined from a regression analysis on historical aFRR price time series. Regression components included the aFRR volume and the spot price. The design of the cost and revenue framework, used to process the potential revenues from the spot and reserve market, was based on comparing samples of a stochastic reserve market revenue with a deterministic spot market revenue and aggregating this into a distribution for the profit. To conclude the first dispatch and profit results of the StRe@M modelling are presented for a German electricity scenario in February 2020 with an 80 percent RES share, which should be used with great caution. The modelled lithium-ion battery technology and variable-speed PSH show positive profits on average, but the fixed-speed PSH does not. The main limitation of this model is the lack of the scaling effect for renewable penetration, for which a scenario analysis is probably most suited.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA)","","Erasmus Mundus Joint Master program of Economics and Management of Network Industries (EMIN)","",""

(mentor)","2016","A flap actuation system, the Controllable Rubber Trailing Edge Flap (CRTEF), for distributed load control on a wind turbine blade had been developed in the period from 2006 to 2013 at DTU. The purpose of the project is to optimize the structural design of the flexible part of the CRTEF based on a realistic blade section geometry in order to meet the objectives and the constraints of the project. The objectives include the deflection requirements and the energy efficiency, while the constraints include the bending stiffness of the structure, the local shape deformations, critical material strength, and manufacturing limitations. With the inspiration from the literature review, an arch model with arches forming concave on the flap surface and enclosing the voids to be pressurized is supposed to result in the bending movement of the flap when pressure is applied on the voids to straighten the arches. The model was designed using SolidWorks for the parameterization of the design and ANSYS Workbench for the static structural Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations. The built-in parametric optimizer of ANSYS Workbench, Direct Optimization of Design Exploration, was used to optimize the design with the parameters of the geometry. The surface pressure loads during operation of the turbine with the flap installed were evaluated with XFOIL and included in the simulations. The model was developed first by qualitative analyses to have a reasonable preliminary design, and then by parametric optimization to have the final design. The parameterization of the design was improved on the way of optimizations, in order to expand the design space to solve the problem of stress concentration, so that it covers the design with the acceptable material safety factor. With the consideration of surface pressure loads during operation of the turbine, the optimum design fulfills the requirements for flap angle of 15 degrees and -15 degrees with the actuation pressure of 0.428 MPa and 0.386 MPa, and the material safety factor of 1.58 and 1.71, respectively. The design also meets the objective for energy efficiency by the lower actuation pressure than in the previous project and by the small volume of the voids. Besides, the constraint of the bending stiffness is fulfilled with the deflection of less than the flap angle of ±5 degrees when the turbine is operating without the actuation pressure, and the constraints of the local shape deformations and manufacturing limitations are also fulfilled. With the results of the thesis, the model could be manufactured and tested first in the laboratory and then on the wind turbine. In conclusion, the results of the thesis contribute a robust design in the area of smart rotor with significantly better effect and efficiency.","flap; wind turbine; distributed load control; rubber; trailing edge; structural design optimization; parametric optimization; pressure actuator; smart rotor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

First, it introduces a model for geometric pressure loss in horizontal pipe junctions with arbitrary amounts of in-/outlets, under assumption of steady-state, incompressible, single phase flow and no wall friction. The model is shown to be in agreement with experimental data via another model. Second, the junction model is incorporated in a pipe flow network model under the same assumptions as the junction model. The resulting pipe flow network model is compared to a pipe flow network model in which pressure loss due to junctions is neglected. The results show that for long pipes L 600 m the addition of junction pressure has negligible influence on the total static pressure drop in the network. However, for L < 600 m the influence is bigger than 10%.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Multi camera surveillance systems is a hot topic in computer science, artificial intelligence and security management in general. While cameras used to be low resolution analogue devices, nowadays they stream high definition images and come equipped with the processing power to reason about their environment. The field covers a wide variaty of researches from streaming large amount of data to reasoning about the behaviour. In this thesis we will address the problem of cooperation and task delegation within a distributed 3rd generation visual surveillance system. Multiple intelligent cameras will work together to solve the problem of detecting, tracking and analysing the behaviour of cars in a closed environment. As video surveillance systems growmore complex, the computational power distribution and data communication become a more important issue. Traditional centralized systems are no longer cope with the scale of processed data and inventive system designs are required to efficiently analyse the images at real time. The proposed system takes an hierarchical agent based approach to visual surveillance and distributes tasks over multiple intelligent cameras, while aiming for an equal distribution of computational demand of each camera. The tasks delegation applies an hierarchical model of agents and performs the analysis on the first layer of agents, which has all the required data available. The bottleneck of processing power demand and data stream within the global process is avoided by reducing the information resolution for each layer. The design concept of the hierarchical multi-agent approach to visual surveillance is tested in a simulated environment, which will only indicate the potential of object detection and tracking in real life environments. The main contribution of the research is to show the potential of applying the task delegation design method in distributed visual surveillance systems to achieve the scalability demand.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Science","",""

This research area is called phylogenetics and the visualisation of the ancestry is displayed with the use of phylogenetic trees or networks. Generally, the phylogenetic networks are not known completely or with certainty. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that can construct large networks from smaller ones. It is possible that the data used for the algorithms is faulty, which can result in contradictions in the data. In order to still be able to construct a network, some of the data has to be disregarded. The algorithm discussed in this report will have as input data a set of binets: small phylogenetic networks with two leaves each. If the binet set contains contradictions, it is not possible to construct a large network that is consistent with all the input binets. This report will discuss several of the possibilities to decide which binets to omit. Even if the data does not contain any contradictions, the ultimate network can still be uncertain. It can occur that more than one network is able to explain the given data and based on the data alone it is not possible to determine which is the correct one. If this is the case, it is still possible to retrieve some certain information about the correct network from the data. For the case of binary, level-1 networks, a proof will be given that all the possible networks constructed from a complete binet set will contain the same number of reticulations (for example hybridization events).","phylogenetic networks; binets","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Optimization","",""

(mentor)","2016","Since the 19th century, the effect of the urban environment on the quality of life has been increasingly researched by spatial environment related disciplines. The discipline of urban planning has particularly focused on the negative values and the discipline of heritage on the positive values of the existing urban environment. Over the years this relationship has developed into a cooperation that aims at a right balance between preservation and progress within development projects. However, it still appears difficult to determine the right balance due to the lack of knowledge about the subjective values the urban environment contains. Within this research an exploration of the perception process shows that people turn their complex urban environment into a simplified scheme to become able to understand and easily act in it. The formation process of that scheme, which includes the fact that it takes time and effort to enlarge as well as to adjust this scheme, reveals that the less familiar a place is, the more disoriented and therewith uncomfortable people will feel. This means that in order to develop an urban design that will enhance life quality as good as possible, the subjectively most distinctive environmental elements should be conserved. Together with the fact that the objectively poor environmental elements should be enhanced up to contemporary standards in order to enhance the quality of life, this implies a right balance between preservation and progress. It implies a balance per single environmental element, due to the fact that each one of it will have a subjective as well as an objective value. A balance between preservation and progress based on these two principles will thus enable the urban designer to create urban designs that will not just enhance the appearance of the place, but that actually improve the quality of life at the location.","quality of life; urban environment; progress; preservation; subjective value; environmental scheme","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor); Vrijland - van Beest, E. (mentor)","2016","The project starts with the initial assignment of NightBalance BV. This medical start-up has patented technology that is able to reliably determine the position of a person while sleeping or lying in bed. In order to expand the company, they are actively looking to employ their developed technology in new markets. They decide to design the framework for a new product in the decubitus market. Decubitus is a skin injury that comes as a result of local starvation of the skin due to constant pressure. It is mostly related to impaired mobility, either due to reduced sensory perception, injury or other medical conditions. The pressure ulcers that form can escalate from innocent spots to open wounds and present a real health hazard to the already weak patients. Decubitus is preventable by repositioning patients at intervals. This simulates the unloading of the skin healthy people do by nature. If neglected decubitus develops and the consequences for all parties involved are great. The patient’s quality of life drops substantially and the caregivers have a more difficult job. The treatment of decubitus is relatively expensive compared to the prevention, as it creates wound that cannot be cured quickly. In the analysis phase both literature and field research are conducted. Literature about the mechanics of decubitus, its scale and its financial footprint. Field research to discover the context of decubitus. An observation is conducted in a long-term healthcare facility and diverse experts from the industry are consulted. Also included in the analysis phase is market research. Among others is an industry trend analysis, a market segmentation analysis and a potential competitor analysis. This project developed a concept with NightBalance technology that aids caregivers in nursing homes with the prevention of decubitus by facilitated repositioning of patients through sleep positioning monitoring. The technology of NightBalance lends itself for automation of parts of the preventative process. The chosen target market for this concept is long–term care as it has high decubitus figures and a large quantity of patients. From ideation two idea directions are developed into visual concept. These concepts later merge as they share too much properties and can be combined into one. The final concept is a multi-part system that consists of a sensor module and a connectivity module. The sensor module is attached to the chest of the patient and monitors bed positions over time. It automatically plots the correct repositioning for nurses and it logs movement of the patient –both his own and caregiver induced - into reports. The sensor module also provides caregivers with a single metric (a shade of colour on a display) that provides the status of a patient at a glance. The connectivity module supplies the sensor module of communication abilities. The connectivity module connects to the Wi-Fi, LAN and the nurse alarm. This to provide remote bed monitoring and alarm in emergencies. The concept is evaluated with a caregiver from the field and is well received. Critical remarks are placed with some aspects such as the nurse alarm integration, the practical implications of a glanceable red metric to patients and its work load reducing efficacy. Final part of the project is the development of a business plan. The problem is briefly introduced with the concept as a solution. The market is proven to be of a large size and a retail strategy is developed. Both a distribution chain and a commercial roll-out plan are presented. Final aspect of the business case are the financial numbers. With the estimated calculations the business case proves to be an attractive proposition with an investment or roughly EUR 2 Million that yields a profit of EUR 19M in 10 years time.","Business Case; Strategic Design; Decubitus; concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

The NPR advises a combination of two methods to calculate the seismic bearing capacity of shallow foundations. In order to find out if this procedure is legitimately suitable for the situation present in Groningen, a literature study was done. This showed the method doesn’t take into account the fact that foundations in Groningen are often embedded. In order to make a comparison, a finite element model was created to recreate the situation that exists in practice, which was then compared to the results obtained by the NPR method. This comparison showed that the embedment of the foundation improved the seismic bearing capacity for dry and saturated sands. For clay materials, there was no improvement. The results also showed that the limits for seismic bearing capacity are not achieved under the current design values. The NPR method has potential, but can’t be applied in its current form. However, bearing capacity failure is not the only problem the earthquakes cause. It is recommended to do more research regarding effects such as liquefaction, cyclic softening, soil and structure inertia, and resonance in the area.","earthquakes; Groningen; seismic bearing capacity; foundations; waves; wave propagation; hardening soil; hardening soil small strain; PLAXIS; Deltares; numerical calculations; finite element calculations; NPR; soil structure interactions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","The primary purpose of this research was to gain insight into the impact of the reallocation of hangar capacity on the delivery performance of base maintenance operations at KLM E&M. In order to accomplish the research objective, general KPI's used in aircraft maintenance organisations were identified, of which the delivery performance of the maintenance operation was considered to be the most dominant performance indicator. While the delivery performance is influenced by a dozen variables, the variables regarding the resource Ground facilities were focused on. The selected variables are: Interference of operations, Platform capacity and Amount of tow movements. A case study has been performed whereby the current states of base maintenance operations at Hangar 11/12 and Hangar 10 were carefully observed by unobtrusive measurements of all aircraft ground movements and parking locations. The current states were combined to imitate the future state. The analysis of the combined current state revealed that the reallocation of hangar capacity induces a lack of platform capacity, interference of operations between engine-runs and rearranging aircraft, and additional tow movements. The reallocation of hangar capacity comes with a reduced delivery performance of base maintenance operations for customer aircraft, because 88 hours of customer aircraft could not have been serviced at the desired moment during the measuring period of two weeks. The interference of operations was not critical for the delivery performance after slight adjustments in the timing of operations are made. The lack of platform capacity is heuristically solved with help of several proposed scenarios. The platform utilisation was decomposed into: necessary KLM aircraft, waiting aircraft and customer aircraft. The recommended scenario accommodates as many of the customer aircraft as possible on the platform, next to the necessary KLM aircraft. All waiting aircraft will be displaced to 6 additional assigned buffer positions at E&M territory. The additional buffer positions must be assigned to the area of the former Hangar 9, the platform of Hangar 10 and the platform of Hangar 14. The amount of additionally generated tow movements causes the probability to require an additional tow truck, but this primarily depends on factors yet to be investigated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transport Engineering and Logistics","","","",""

An infrared camera (Flir A35) was used for a more comprehensive approach towards the inspection of a storm sewer pipe, by identifying abnormal thermal finger prints (due to lateral connections) along a flume. The illicit connections were simulated by discharging warm or cold water through several types of lateral connections (variation of diameter, intrusion, depth, etc.).

Defective motor skills resulting from neurological diseases have severe negative effects on quality of life. Subjects have to relearn the skills to move their affected limbs. Research is currently done with multiple techniques to accelerate these relearning processes and to acquire motor skills at the end of their rehabilitation. With the assumption that relearning and learning have similar cortical processes, the focus of research in this field and in this thesis is on the learning process. Although a lot of research has been done, there is no clear-cut answer as to how this improvement in learning has been established. With system identification, a deeper look into the behavior during the experiment can be achieved. A tracking task in the form of a racing game has been made, where the goal was to collect as many coins as possible. The coins were shown on the screen as a multisine stimulus, combining higher and lower frequency curves to follow. During this racing game, the score and performance were quantified to monitor the improvement of the motor skill. All participants practiced 120 game sessions, equally split between two days. All results were compared between day 1 and day 2, between the start of both days to the end of both day and between the start of the first day and the end of the second day. A significant improvement of the performance was found in the increasing number of coins hit in all three comparisons. System identification showed no significant improvement in the magnitude of the gain of the participants, indicating that the participants did not improve on following the amplitude of the coins as realized from the middle of the road. Participants did improve significantly on the phase-lag during the experiment, by reducing the phase-lag of their movements with respect to the target coins. In contrast with previous research, the analysis of electrical brain activity did not show a change in the learning process.

This model focuses on change brought about by webpage owners/administrators who can affect the link structure of the network by adding or removing hyperlinks from their webpage. First a basic model will be proposed in which the probabilities for adding and removing links are equal for every page. This results in highly random behaviour. In order to more realistically model the situation, the model is extended so as to take into account the activity level of each webpage and also on what basis decisions are made. The objective extended model assumes webpage owners/administrators are rational in making decisions in the sense that the probability of creating a link to a page with high PageRank is more probable than one with a lower PageRank. Removal is respectively less and more probable. The subjective extended model uses the number of inlinks of a webpage to calculate the probabilities. Pages with a high number of inlinks are more likely to get noticed. Both extended models use the number of outlinks as a reflection of a webpage’s activity level. Based on the extended models a number of tests are devised so as to see what activity leads to what change and to be able to pick the best strategy for consolidating one’s PageRank.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","New flexible teaching methods for robotics are needed to automate repetitive tasks that are currently still done by humans. For limited batch sizes, it is too expensive to teach a robot a new task (Smith & Anderson, 2014). Ideally, such flexible robots can be taught a new task by a non-expert. A non-expert is a person who knows the task the robot should perform, but does not have experience in programming a robot. A powerful method that would allow for flexible robotics without the use of an expert is inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). IRL aims to learn the cost function out of demonstrations, this cost function is subsequently used to learn a policy which realizes the desired task. Current implementations focus more on the IRL algorithm itself and assume that there are enough demonstrations available and the quality of these demonstrations is also close enough to the optimal behaviour (Doerr et al., 2015). Whilst actually these demonstrations are very expensive and non-optimal. This thesis focuses on the effect of the quality of input demonstrations on the performance of the learned trajectory. Furthermore, how imperfect demonstrations still can be used, without lowering the performance of the learned trajectory. The first hypothesis is that the performance of the resulting trajectory depends on the average performance of the input demonstrations and the quantity of the input demonstrations has less of an effect. The second hypothesis is that by adding a ranking to the demonstrations, created through the preferences of non-robotic experts, the performance of the learned trajectory would be better than the average performance of the input demonstrations. The preferences of the non-robotic expert are collected through a crowdsourcing experiment. The preferences of the non-robotic expert are used to create an overall performance measurement. This overall performance measurement is used to obtain the sequentially order of the input demonstrations but also to evaluate the final learned trajectories. The results validate the first hypothesis. The average performance of the input demonstrations is determining the performance of the learned trajectory. The second hypothesis could not be confirmed. The results did not show any improvements in the performance of the learned trajectory when the ranking based on the preference of a non-robotic expert is added. It could be argued that the input demonstrations were too similar or the cost features used in IRL are not specific enough to create different cost functions and therefore create differently performing trajectories.","robotics; reinforcement learning; preference learning; inverse reinforcement learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Structural ship design is gradually changing from the use of rule-based design methods to more rational-based design methods. The rational-based design methods are entirely based on structural theory and computer-based methods, while the rule-based design methods are formed by prescriptive rules from classification societies. In rational-based design methods structural analysis and design optimisation are combined to create the optimum structural design, in both weight and costs. This thesis explores a rational-based design method to be used for the design of large composite ships, including the interaction between hull and superstructure. The created design method is a multi-level design method, divided in the simulation of the global structural response and the design and analysis of local substructure panels. The global structural response of the ship is simulated by a two-dimensional finite element model. On the local level, the substructure panels are assessed by separate failure mode analyses. Here the load cases of the panels are based on the global structural response and minimum pressure requirements. The chosen distinction between global and local design gives both an efficient as an accurate design method. Part of the design method is implemented into a rational-based design tool. The verification of the rational-based design tool shows that a minimum amount of elements in both length and height direction in the finite element ship model is needed to get accurate results with respect to analytical calculations. The design tool is consequently used on a specific ship design of a mine countermeasures vessel. The worst case static wave scenario is created for both the sagging and hogging load cases. The global static analysis provides an accurate simulation of the ship in equilibrium condition and the stress distributions can provide valuable insights about formed stress concentrations. The effective and non-effective hullsuperstructure interaction can be implemented, but further improvements in the design tool are needed to analyse the interaction in more detail. A comparison with an existing rule-based design tool is made to check a specific ships structural design. Here the results from the rational-based design tool show that the structural design is insufficient, while the results from the rule-based design tool do not. This is the case even though the load case in the rule-based design tool is more conservative then in the rational-based design. This shows the relevance of rational-based design methods in future ship design. Overall the design tool has shown an accurate simulation of the ships global structural response and the detailed local failure mode analyses provides the stiffness and strength state of the substructure panels on the local level. Implementation of the remainder of the design tool is needed to complete the design and analysis of large composite ships, including the hull-superstructure interaction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

These are considered one of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth. This MSc. thesis examines the role of P. oceanica in protecting the coast from storm impacts. Prior studies are based on flume experiments that focused, almost exclusively, on examining the effect of P. oceanica on wave hydrodynamics in shallow waters and under mild conditions. Here, field data recorded during high wave activity periods in intermediate water over P. oceanica meadows was investigated. An assessment of the effect of P. oceanica on wave dissipation was conducted based on spectral analysis. The data analysis confirmed the effectiveness of P. oceanica meadows in reducing wave energy. Additionally, the spectral evaluation provided further evidence of the spatial distribution of the vegetation-induced wave energy dissipation, and showed that the dissipation rates were greater under the more energetic conditions. The skill of the process-based model XBeach at predicting dissipation due to flexible vegetation meadows was evaluated. Existing drag formulas from the literature and used by XBeach either underestimated or overestimated wave dissipation within the model. After calibration, quantitative comparisons between measurements and model results showed that the storm impact model XBeach was successful at reproducing the effect of P. oceanica meadows under high energetic events. Additionally, the implementation of a time-variable drag coefficient dependent on the Keulegan-Carpenter number was evaluated. This module did not significantly improve the accuracy of the results for the simulated scenarios. However, the drag effect of natural aquatic vegetation meadows is still poorly understood and field data is scarce. Therefore, it is recommended that future investigations continue experimenting with the variable drag coefficient module of XBeach; by testing different setups the use of the process-based model XBeach may give a better insight into situations where the drag coefficient might be important to consider. In light of climate change and other anthropogenic influences, it is important to consider the potential implications of the functional extinction of P. oceanica. To estimate what this might entail in terms of wave energy impact on the coast, a non-vegetated scenario was simulated with XBeach. For the setup simulated, the results indicate that the wave energy would start increasing from further offshore and, consequently, the wave energy reaching the coast is predicted to be up to 40% times higher. The latter emphasizes the role of P. oceanica as an implicit coastal defence of the Mediterranean coasts.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

This report investigates the interferences to the CDR digital signals caused by both co-channel and adjacent-channel FM signals, and proposes solutions to combat such influences. Besides an introduction on the CDR and FM broadcasting standard, a literature investigation and a theoretical analysis has been given concerning the FM interference to the CDR digital signal and existing solutions [2]. A new acquisition algorithm is implemented to realize mode detection and synchronization for the hybrid signal. Two FM interference removal methods have been proposed and studied in simulation. An energy detector is introduced to select the best FM interference removal method in run time. The different CDR modes have been added to one existing CDR simulation chain. And the receiver performance in each mode has been studied in the AWGN and TU6 multipath channel conditions. The complete simulation chain will be used for future product development. The proposed solution has reached very good reception performance against co-channel FM interference in commonly used CDR modes. For the adjacent-channel FM interference, if we can detect and select the better removal method in real time, the performance degradation can be controlled to a limited SNR increase under the AWGN channel.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications and Sensing Systems Track","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A group of islands will be constructed in the lake Markermeer to act as nature reserve for birds, called the Marker Wadden. These islands will be constructed out of soft clay, dredged from the bottom of the lake. Building with soft cohesive soils, also referred to as mud, is still a largely unknown territory. Traditionally, sand is used for land reclamations although mud is abundantly available in many coastal areas in the world. This discrepancy is due to the predictable behaviour of sand deposits as opposed to the behaviour of mud deposit layers. One of the largest uncertainties of the Marker wadden, and of all projects involving large mud deposits, is the amount of consolidation that the mud layer experiences after deposition. In order to improve understanding of the consolidation behaviour of a mud deposit, and the possible scale effects, three experimental test are executed, analysed and compared. One large-scale test consisting of three bulk containers are designed to mimic the actual field conditions. A Seepage Induced Consolidation (SIC) test is performed by Deltares, which is believed to be state of the art , but a rather expensive laboratory test. And finally, simple settling column tests are performed in the laboratory of Boskalis Environmental. All tests are executed with mud from the same sample collected from the borrow pit for the Marker Wadden project. The main objectives of this thesis read: Analyse the correspondence and differences between consolidation behaviour derived from small scale laboratory experimental tests and large scale tests that are representative of the field. Determine if simple settling column tests can accurately predict the consolidation behaviour of large mud layers and eliminate the need for more advances and expensive tests like the SIC test. The large scale container test is designed to represent field conditions as closely as possible. Inside the containers bed and water levels are measured, the pore water pressures are continuously monitored, and a density profile is derived with a core sampler. The consolidation behaviour of soft mud beds can be described by the equation of Gibson et al. (1967) accounting for large deformations of the soil. To solve this equation the relations between permeability (k) and void ratio (e) and between void ratio and effective vertical stress (σ’z) need to be known, these are also called the constitutive relations: k=A_k e^(B_k ) e=A_p 〖σ_z^'〗^(〖- B〗_p ) With Ak, Bk, Ap and Bp material specific, empirical coefficients. The Seepage Induced Consolidation test, executed by Deltares, directly derives the constitutive relations from measurements of the permeability and applied load steps. For derivation of the relations from the settling column tests, the fractal method of Kranenburg (1994) is applied, enabling empirical derivation of the constitutive relations from observations of the bed elevation in time by applying the method of Merckelbach and Kranenburg (2004). The derived constitutive relations from each test (column and SIC) than serve as input parameters in the numerical model DELCON. This model is a one dimensional finite strain consolidation program allowing for large deformations of the soil (Sittoni and van Kesteren, 2012) according to the Gibson equation. The method of Merckelbach and Kranenburg, as well as the model simulations with DELCON, are based on a mud fraction only and do not account for sand. From the soil core samples of the containers it could be concluded that the sand fraction almost completely segregated. This segregation was also observed from the settling column tests, however, not from the SIC test soil sample. This most likely caused the permeability of the SIC soil sample to be higher, and therefore not representative of the container tests. Because of this assumption, it is hypothesised that the column tests are likely to perform better than the SIC test, in predicting the consolidation behaviour inside the containers for this particular research. The experimental test performance is very sensitive to the resemblance of the soil characteristics for the field conditions. Since the derivation of the constitutive relations from the column tests (method of Merckelbach and Kranenburg, 2004) and the simulation in DELCON, are based on the mud fraction only it is likely that the column test perform well for soils that contain very little sand or for soils that show almost complete segregation. In both cases the consolidation behaviour would be characterized by the mud fraction only, just as the method of Merckelbach and Kranenburg (2004) and DELCON require. For soils that contain sand, and incomplete or no segregation occurs, the SIC test are likely to perform better because the constitutive relations are derived from direct measurements and does not correct for a sand fraction.","mud; consolidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The Ribbon would allow users to upload Excel workbooks and retrieve the analysis results from within the Excel environment. First, a two week research phase was conducted. During this research phase, it was established that Visual Studio 2015 would be used for the programming environment, and to use Windows Installer for the deployment of the Ribbon. The design is based on a separation between the functionality of the Ribbon and its presentation. This design decision was made so that the functionality code could easily be reused for new versions of Excel. Only the presentation would have to be modified. The implementation conforms to the design, and relies on background processes. These background processes allow the Ribbon to run in the background without blocking the Excel environment. The testing of the product is based on unit tests, where all classes are tested individually after every new functionality. The performance of the add-in was also tested with Excel workbooks of various sizes, where the upload time and the analysis time were separated. The findings of these performance tests was that the PerfectXL web application is the biggest bottleneck in the performance of the Ribbon. The final product conforms to the client’s needs and requirements.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","","TI3806",""

(mentor); Eisemann, E. (mentor)","2016","To find out if AR can be used for building flood scenarios in an application that uses optical see-through glasses the problem was first split up into different sub problems: user localisation, world creation and water level tracking. User localisation allows the user to walk around in the scenario. This is done using a combination of marker based tracking and IMU data. The location of the user is calculated by looking at the absolute position of the marker and the relative distance to it. Markers are the main source for calculating the position of the user. However, when no marker is visible, the IMU is a more prominent source. The acceleration and velocity are combined to calculate displacement over a time span, which can be combined with the last known position of the user to calculate the new position. Due to the fact that multiple sources can indicate different user positions, the predictions get combined in a Particle Filter, which calculates the most likely user position by looking at the given predictions and the standard deviations of those measurements. The final result gets smoothed to remove outliers. The result is a steady current position of the user which allows the user to walk around. To allow the user to build a scenario which can be flooded a combination of buttons and hand gestures is used to place and modify objects in the scene. The user can select and place objects such as buildings, street lanterns and garbage bins to create a world. Once objects have been placed they can be modified in the following ways: the object can be scaled, making it larger or smaller, the object can be rotated and finally the user can relocate objects. Furthermore, the user is able to save and load created worlds. To simulate a flood scenario two stepswere required to be completed. Firstly, an invisible plane was added to the virtual world which hides points that are below the plane. Secondly, the water level of the camera feed has to be tracked. Blocks were painted below the marker which were used to track the water level. This was done with an algorithm that uses the input of the marker’s location in the frame and data from the blocks and using that information calculated the water level. The steps of the algorithm are gray scale conversion, rotation, cropping, blurring, segmentation and counting segmented blocks respectively. Future work that can be done is a different, more accurate algorithm for marker tracking. Secondly, the different algorithms for the steps of the Particle Filter can be changed and improved. Finally, when a different algorithm is implemented for marker tracking, the algorithm for water level tracking can be combined with the rest of the project, allowing real-time flood simulation. It is recommended that the Meta SDK is best avoided because, despite the fact that is has a lot to offer, is not suited for an application in this field. Having solved the three sub problems resulted in the answer to the question can AR be used for building flood scenarios using optical see-through. The conclusion is that with the current state of AR, AR is not yet suited for this. The field of view on which objects can be displayed is too small which does not give a realistic visualisation of objects bigger than your hand. Secondly, calibrating the glasses properly for every user is something that still is and still has to be improved since not all users experience the projected world as an addition to the real world. Consequently, the virtual world looks like a floating screen instead of an addition to the real world.","augmented reality; Meta1; training; world builder","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

This interactive system based on motion tracking aims to entertain people using projections by motivating them to move around, explore and, most importantly, interact with each other. To begin this project, after defining and analyzing the problem, research was done on the subject of interaction design to discover more about how people could be attracted and encouraged to participate, how to detect people, interactive systems that already existed, the necessary hardware and how to generate fun and attractive graphics. To ensure a fluent development of the project, the development process was established beforehand describing all tools used for collaboration, planning and general organization.

These results can be used in a simple forecasting model, enabling better insights in the precipitation. The results show a high correlation coefficient between Eurasia and China with 51% of the precipitation in China being of continental origin.","moisture recycling","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) is a challenging field of research that, without making use of reference images, aims at predicting the image quality as it is perceived by the human visual system (HVS). Many NR-IQA methods have been proposed over time but recently proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches, through their powerful feature learning capabilities, have outperformed all previously existing NR-IQA methods. But these CNN based approaches are perceptually incorrect in assuming distortions to be homogeneously distributed across images. They operate on very small image portions while considering all of them to have identical perceptual quality, whereas in reality, different parts of an image, based on their structure and content, could bear different perceptual quality. Further, these approaches utilize shallow CNN architectures which render them incapable of taking advantages offered by the deep CNN architectures. To improve upon the limitations of existing CNN based approaches, we conducted a design space exploration of CNN’s and proposed a suitable CNN design for NR-IQA task, that operates on bigger image portions and employs a deeper architecture. The proposed design achieves the state of the art performance on LIVE and TID datasets. We further provide informative visualization of features learned by the proposed CNN design, which shed light on its internal working while promoting further understanding regarding the nature of image quality.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Every biological aspect of a create is described in the DNA. The DNA consists of very long strings that contain every biological information. Because these strings are very long, finding the right piece of information is a tough job. Fortunately, we have developed multiple ways to do this more quickly. Radiation hybrid mapping is such a method, it creates a map that shows us the locations of some essential pieces of information. We create a map with the help of the traveling salesman problem. The traveling salesman problem is a mathematical way to describe the desire to find tour through a set of places of minimal costs. The problem is not easy to solve, but many methods have been developed to make the search for the optimal solution easier. Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson constructed a combination of algorithms that solves the traveling salesman problem quickly in most practical efforts. With their technique we can construct the radiation hybrid map. Finally, there are many factors that determine the success rate of the map. With the right adjustments, we can create some large maps with a fairly good success rate, but doing so appears to be quiet difficult.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

By this way the process became more important than the product creating unconventional ways to deal with matters of context and program.

I would like to support those in search for creating understanding for one’s own situation, understanding the landscape of death and understanding how to relate to it in one’s own way. Inviting those people to face their destiny instead of tucking it away. I found meaning in the truth. The truth that could offer consolation and that could shatter the stigma around death. Finding one’s own truth, by undertaking a personal journey. A journey through the five phases in the process of grief: isolation, depression, bargaining, anger and ultimately acceptance. I gave each of these phases a spatial translation and gave them a place on a linear path. A path in which architecture functions as a narrative. A path that emphasizes one route out of many and defines the narrative voice, pointing at one particular way to see the building: as a journey, a journey towards acceptance. My proposal is an attempt to help (bereaved) individuals in their personal process to find truth in case of death and therefore find a way to accept death and have a relation with it. My design acts as a catalyst in this transformation. It offers an ‘out of the everyday experience’; a journey towards acceptance; a voyage of discovery. I merely offer a place of departure. Would it only be to give one a hint in the right direction. To show one how such a journey feels by recreating a similar route with the help of architectural means. A labyrinthian experience with a spiraling structure, a transcendence from dark into light, a transition from low to high. I propose to do this beautifully. Using beauty as an instrument in order to create acceptance, curiosity and serenity. Beauty makes people more willing to undertake the journey with an open mind. It helps bringing one in the relaxing state one needs to be at the start of the route.

(mentor)","2016","The Earth Wind and Fire system (EWF), designed by Ben Bronsema, is a system that creates natural air-conditioning. This is designed for office buildings and the open floor spaces that come with such a function. On the moment of writing this paper, a large portion (7.28 million m2) of the office buildings are structurally vacant in the Netherlands. A building is structurally vacant if it is not used for three or more years. Next to this there is a need for dwellings. The research will look into the EWF system itself, first by explaining it and secondly by trying to adapt it so it can be used as a heating system. This is done by a literature study and by consulting Ben Bronsema. Combining the findings of the research will generate a system to apply the EWF system to the mentioned transformation, which will result in apartments with natural air-conditioning and possibly a Nearly Zero Energy Building. Hilde Remøy, a researcher at the TU Delft, has done much research about transformations of structurally vacant office buildings to apartments in the Netherlands. The goal of this research is to delve into those transformations, and specifically into transformations from structurally vacant office buildings to apartments, and see if the EWF system is applicable, and if needed, how to adapt it so it can be applied. The transformations will be used as a case study to see what is generally common in such transformations and where possible problems/chances lie for the EWF system. The use of this system on apartments will result in a reduction of carbon emissions. This is in line with the need to reduce the carbon emission according to the agreement with the EU, which is 20% lower than the total carbon emission in 1990.","structurally vacant office buildings; natural ventilation; office redevelopment; stacked dwelling; NZEB; earth, wind and fire; Ben Bronsema; zero energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Architectural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Jumelet, D. (mentor)","2016","This study describes the stability of rock on a mild slope (e.g. milder than 1:6) under wave loading. This is done because an increasing number of situations occur where mild foreshores are protected from the wave and currents. The empirical stability formula, designed by VAN DER MEER [1988], is not valid for these kind of slopes. Nonetheless, an extrapolation of this VAN DER MEER [1988] formula is currently used to design for these mild slopes. Recent research shows that an optimisation is possible as the extrapolated VAN DER MEER [1988] formula seems to overestimate the erosion. This research tests XBeach-G on mild slopes to verify its applicability as a design method for mild slopes. XBeach-G is a process based 1D numerical model, designed to model the physics occurring on mild gravel beaches. To verify the potential XBeach-G as a design tool, some of the VAN DER MEER [1988] tests are reproduced and the occurred damage is compared to two sediment transport formulas, the VAN RIJN, [2007] and NIELSEN, [2006]. Because the VAN DER MEER [1988] tests are executed on relative steep slopes, the slope angle is changed to more mild slopes. The observed trend is analysed on several hydrodynamic and morphodynamic parameters, such as the velocity, the acceleration, the shear stress and the sediment transport rate. Beside the slope, several other parameters such as the stone size; the phase lag angle and layer thickness are changed as well. A comparison of the test results to the formulas show that neither of the two formulas are able to predict the trend of damage levels as is found in the tests. The NIELSEN, [2006] formula gives unexpected results for steeper slopes, and the VAN RIJN, [2007] formula for mild slopes. This report proposes to use the VAN RIJN, [2007] formula for steeper slopes and to use the NIELSEN, [2006] formula for mild slopes. (milder than 1:6). Considerable attention should be given to the calibration factors in the NIELSEN, [2006] formula as these have a significant effect on the formed erosion. The model functions well enough for less detailed erosion profile estimations. The overall erosion depths and profile do not deflect that much and can be used for more dynamic profile descriptions. Because there is not a lot of data for comparison, it is recommended to do additional tests to verify the observed results. The test programme should focus on the point of incipient motion for coarse sediment under an angle. Both formulas are designed for horizontal sandy beds. Adjustments have been made to use them for rocks on slopes. Further research should focus on these correction factors as these do not yet seem to be correct","Xbeach-G; rock protection; mild slopes; gravel modelling; Van der Meer (1988); Van Rijn (2007); Nielsen (2006); sediment transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The study includes an analysis of the operability and an estimation of the design requirements of an iDL for crew transfers.Currently, a fender system is used for this purpose. This connection relies on friction forces between the vessel and turbine and as a result the fender can start sliding without notice. This induces safety hazards and damage to the fenders. These problems can be solved with an AMMS. A frequency domain model is derived and used to simulate the dynamics of the CTV and its connection to the wind turbine. After optimizing the characteristics of the iDL system, the technical feasibility is determined by examining the maximum probable movements that are allowed. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the required maximum magnet strength. The results of this study indicates that an AMMS is able to limit the motions within the allowable values, while the required structure and amount of magnetic force seem achievable on a 2610-Damen vessel. The results look promising, however, more comprehensive research is recommended. Firstly, a time-domain analysis can be used evaluate the transient behaviour of the system and possible non-linear behaviour. Finally, it is recommended to manufacture a prototype to evaluate the assumptions, about the friction coefficient and airgap of the magnetic connection, taken in the study.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","","",""

The final product we delivered during this project has basic versions of these systems implemented as a modern, responsive web-application. It is far from production ready, but it is demo-ready for potential customers, and of good quality to form a strong foundation for creating a production-ready platform. We recommend that for further development, the focus should be in four directions: the matching algorithm, the compliance module, user testing and non-functional requirements as maintainability and scalability.

This thesis elaborates on finding a cost-efficient way of implementing a telecommunications channel between a measuring node and a data-server, together with forming an energy-efficient power supply system that powers a system over a cable of 60metres. The cellular network is used as the main method of transmitting data between a node and a server. To be able to connect to the cellular network, the SIM5320E chip has been implemented into the system, featuring access to both 2G and 3G technologies, which is controlled by sending AT commands. These commands are sent automatically by a C++ program, which is executed each time the module is turned on. The system will return to sleep after successful data transmission. Data communication is done through the use of theHTTPS protocol, but in the future CoAP might be a better alternative to reduce the energy needed per transmission by reducing the amount of bytes added to the data packet. A power circuit has been designed that supplies each component of the groundwater-analyzing sensor system with the right voltage. For energy efficiency, a rechargeable Li-ion battery rated at 3.6V is combined with a solar cell to make sure the complete system is supplied with a steady power stream and can work autonomously for at least two consecutive years. A power-over-bus system is implemented to provide the subsystem at the end of the cable of 60 metres. Theoretical research is done on the matter of information communication and the use of the network technology LoRa. The information communication research points out that different protocols such asMQTT and CoAP reduce the amount of bytes necessary to successfully transmit data. Due to the research on LoRa it has been discovered that the usage of LoRa could greatly reduce energy costs and nullify yearly costs and would be a possible improvement in the future. Other possible improvements in the future besides using a different network technology such as LoRa are improving the error detection of the control program and reducing energy consumption during transmissions by e.g. using a different protocol.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electrical Engineering","EE3L11",""

Due to the great set of possibilities (strength, stiffness, density, heat resistance, electrical conductivity), the material is often used (Lower, 2009). Many plastics are designed to be used only once, being thrown away after the use. However, thrown away is not away. Plastic is the type of waste that will last forever. Currently only five to ten percent is recycled of all the produced plastics (source: http://www.5gyres.org/the-plastic-problem/). As mentioned by Eriksen et al. (2014) there are around five trillion pieces of plastic floating in world’s oceans, out of which eighty percent, originates from the land (Jambeck et al., 2015). The plastic breaks down into smaller pieces by the sunlight (Moore, C., 2014) and releases toxins. All sorts of organisms living in or off the sea mistakenly take in plastic debris and microplastic for food. This results in the often toxic waste to enter our food chain (Plastic Soup Foundation, 2016). The goal of this project is to find an application for plastic waste materials that changes the perception of waste into valuable and looks at motivations for people to do something with waste. The thesis shows the design of a material application and a service around recycling Polyethylene bottle caps. The project assignment is self-formulated, in collaboration with Elvin Karana. The Material Driven Design method (Karana et al., 2015) was applied for the design of the material application in which the unique material qualities come forward. The material focus of Polyethylene was determined through talks with experts about the safety of melting the material. Insights in the material qualities of Polyethylene were generated by several tinkering experiments and user studies. These experiments showed the unique qualities of the arise of wonderful patterns that surprise people, when different colors of caps are mixed, and showed the semi-transparency of the material. The combination of both qualities give the material a magical appearance when light shines through and shows the stratification of the material. Material Benchmarking proved that the combination of the discovered material qualities was not applied by others. The associated meanings of the material, natural, unique, personal and beautiful, were evoked during the user studies. Different ways of motivating people to do something with waste were explored, by mapping existing solutions and their motivational strategies. The fun aspect of collecting, the size and availability in many different colors, encouraged to focus on Polyethylene bottle caps. The vision aimed at surprising people with the material, combined with light. Experiments with the material were done to investigate how the element of suprise can be enhanced. The Design phase is divided into the design of the service and the material application. The service implies the collecting and processing aspects of the material. For the service, several ways of collecting bottle caps were tried out. The experiences were translated into stories. The enthusiasm and dedication during the making process was tested with a workshop. People liked to create something out of plastic bottle caps. They associated the experience with baking. The processability of the material by hand was tested with a set of experiments. It was discovered that processing by hand (with an oven and some basic kitchen tools) is possible as long as the dimensions of the material are kept small. In this way mixing the material and creating patterns is possible, considering the short cooling time and thus processing time of the material. The requirement of small dimensions, encouraged to decide on a modular application, that consists out of multiple plastic plates. A creative session and brainstorm with a group of students was executed to find applications for the material with light. The ideas were translated into three concept and tested by prototypes with using artifical and natural light. Different connection methods for the material were explored. A product and a service was developed: The Plastic Bakery. The product, Tipi Table lamp, is a lamp shade that consists out of four plastic plates, four sticks, a piece of cord and an elastic band that can easily be assembled. A ledlamp is used as a lightsource. It does not become warm and has a long lifetime. The product can either be bought or made yourself during a workshop. By processing yourself, the transition can be visible from bottle cap to new material. People can select a theme, based on nature, with the aid of a menu and collect the specific caps. They can melt the material inside a mold and mix it with spatulas. People can add sprinkles and create a message with a stamp. The material can be made flat by using one’s body weight. Both concepts were evaluated. The product was evaluated during the exhibition of Future Materials and the service during a workshop. The material application surprised people and was seen as beautiful. It is managed to create something valuable out of plastic waste. People liked the activity of making during the workshop and could express themselves. The short cooling time of the material worked against the joy of making. A set of recommendations is presented that suggests further research into the cooling time and thus processing time of the material, together with the safety of melting plastic for DIY purposes.","material experience; material driven design; experience design; design with waste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design Aesthetics","Design for Interaction",""

(mentor)","2016","The goal of this project was to develop a personalized adaptive game for use at the dentist or other dental treatment settings. Before the project started, a prototype game utilising the Unity game engine was alreadyavailable. The game’s purpose is to make dental treatment more comfortable by playing it during the treatment.Our goal for this project was to transform the existing prototype game into a personalized, adaptive versionof the game. The game experience should vary on the type of player who is playing the game, e.g. withrespect to the difficulty. Furthermore, the game should be playable by a very broad audience: from non-gamers to hardcore-gamers, and from young children to the elderly. To achieve this, we developed a game prototype that uses gameplay characteristics of the player to construct a model representing the player using a set of parameters. This player model is used to construct level generation parameters, which in turn are used by a level generator to generate an appropriate level. To determine what techniques were required to build the game, we conducted research on serious gamingand investigated several methods for player modelling and PCG in games. We found that it is important to keep a player engaged during a serious game in order for the game to have an optimal effect. We also discovered that using an event based player model construction method was the best option for this game. Finally, we chose to use a chunk based level generation mechanism to keep the level generation both varied and easy to control. The game has been tested twice. The first time, at a dental practice with patients of a dental hygienist. The patients found that the game was indeed distracting them from the treatment. The second time, the game was tested at the International Festival of Technology (IFoT) in Delft. Around 40 people played the game and most indicated that they enjoyed the game. However, people were divided on whether the game was challenging. We designed a player model and used it to generate suitable level generation parameters. Also, a controllable level generator was created to facilitate the adaptive experience. The system structure is flexible and allows easy addition, deletion, or modification of system components.","PCG; player model; flow; adaption; distraction; dentist; serious gaming; personalization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Bachelor Computer Science","",""

By defining the elemental factors needed to support a society at neighborhood level this research paper studies the needs, effects and alterations needed in the current system of Amsterdam Nieuw West. A general study about the different renewable possibilities is the result followed by a more in depth and location specific possibility framework. The research is focused on what is to believed are the four basic products streams that support a society, being Electricity, Thermal energy, Water and Food. All with their own streams, implementations and barriers are then analyzed in a location specific way. Followed by potentials supporting these product streams for this specific location. These possibilities can than later be used in a following design. While all streams show in different stages of their processes potential to become sustainable an integrated approach is believed to be the best solution given the fact that these systems are highly interconnected with each other. Conclusion is a design in which the largest potentials of the research are gathered and combined to create the highest sustainable value for this location.","sustainability; MFA; self-suficiency; renewable energy sources; Amsterdam Nieuw West; energy; potential; material; flows; streams","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Graduation Studio","",""

Many studies are researching the political, economic and social aspects of migration neglecting the spatial dimension. However immigrants regardless of their background or their final destination occupy space in the urban fabric. The communities of immigrants face the continuous pressure of segregation while the urban fabric changes due to their agglomeration. The latter fail to support immigrants’ needs while at the same time conflict between them and locals arise. This research, started with an international comparison between three case studies (Athens, Paris, Stockholm) and then a deeper understanding of the socio-spatial phenomena in the case of Athens. Main focus is the relationship between the urban structures and the daily systems of locals and immigrants and the mitigation of the frictions that exist between them in a local level. The final product, located in the municipality of Athens, is composed by strategic actions and flexible urban structures that can adapt to the new circumstances while providing ways for alleviating the social and structural decay. It is a localized, actor based strategy that can help in the integration of immigrants and the development of the municipality of Athens.","immigration; super-diversity; daily system; Athens; international comparison; spatial strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-10","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

Older people have an increased risk of chronic diseases. It is therefore very important to look at the specific thermal and physical requirements when designing for elderly, so that the building can contribute to the health of the elderly. Another problem that we are facing in the Netherlands is the early postwar building stock which no longer meets today's requirements. They are often too small and consume too much energy. The housing blocks in the Airey strip in the western garden cities of Amsterdam are one of many examples of housing blocks that no longer meet the needs of today. The addition of a greenhouse to the existing buildings would be a possible solution to meet the needs of the elderly, while improving the current state of the Airey strip. This leads to the following research question. How to transform the Airey strip into elderly housing with optimal thermal and visual comfort for this group, with the use of a greenhouse? This project will provide and answer to this question, by looking at the demands and wishes of elderly, the advantages and disadvantages of a greenhouse for elderly and by looking at effect on the visual and thermal comfort of nine configurations of the Airey building with an addition of a greenhouse.","existing building stock; greenhouse; elderly housing; Airey system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering","","","",""

Currents have been measured of 1.2 m/s while, based upon tidal and storm predictions, currents of only 0.7 m/s were expected. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the origin of these higher currents, taking into account the physical oceanography at this location. We find that these high currents measured in August are forced by baroclinic currents. Stratification was present at a measurement ship, 32 km northeast from Gemini. In addition, satellite imagery shows Gemini to be located in a region with fronts, between warm water from the Wadden Sea and colder water from the North Sea. In fact, a tidal mixing front is formed on top of the already established saline stratification [Van Aken, 1986]. The origin of fresh water is found to be from sluices discharging onto the Wadden Sea. Prior to the period with high currents a pulse of fresh water is discharged onto the Wadden Sea. Followed by the lowest winds recorded in 2015, an optimal climate is formed in which fronts can travel offshore. This is supported by the satellite imagery. In addition, density-induced currents are calculated based upon the mathematical model of Heaps [1972]. The analysis if the data suggests that density driven currents of 0.4 m/s are generated in August, which combined with the tide can give 1.2 m/s currents.","Physical oceanography; North Sea; Density driven currents; Baroclinic currents; Fresh water currents; Remotely sensed SST imagery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","",""

A REPL is an interactive programming environment that takes single expressions, evaluates them and prints the result(s). REPLs facilitate exploratory programming and debugging and are therefore a nice addition to Spoofax. Two contributions have been made. First, a functioning REPL has been created, comparable in features to those of popular programming languages such as Python and Haskell.Second, changes have been contributed to Spoofax that have been integrated into the main repository. To successfully complete the project, extensive knowledge needed to be gained of the conceptual ideas behind programming language implementations, and of the Spoofax API implementing these concepts. Despite having faced significant challenges during the start of the project, the most important goals as set forth in the problem description have been achieved. Therefore, the project team is still satisfied with the end result: while not all requested features have been implemented, it has been shown that it is possible to create a functioning REPL for any language defined in Spoofax, requiring only additional configuration to a language definition.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

Many models have been proposed in the past which aim to predict this cyclic deformation accumulation for specific or general purpose. One of the most advanced models available is the ""High-Cycle Accumulation (HCA) model"" byNiemunis et al (2005) [1]. Although very promising, this model is as of yet rarely used in Dutch geotechnical engineering practice. One of the possible reasons for this is the lack of understanding and availability of the model. This thesis has the aim to overcome these problems by gathering relevant information on the HCA model, implementing it in Plaxis 2D finite element software and inspecting the capabilities of the resulting FE routine. After gathering the information on the model from literature, it was concluded that the model has great potential and is themost extensively validated model available. However, there are also some boundary conditions for which the model fails to predict the deformations correctly. The model also requires a vast number of advanced laboratory tests to be carried out in order to compute the model parameters. The implementation of the constitutive equations in Plaxis 2D was performed successfully and was verified for a single-element type case. When applying the FE routine to a boundary value problem, numerical issues arising from the finite element calculation kernel conflict with the sensitivity of the HCA model to the state parameters, resulting in a severe over-estimation of accumulated settlements. A sensitivity analysis was carried out, which shows that the model is highly sensitive to the parameters of the hypoplastic model (which is used in the initial calculation phase of the FE routine). It is concluded that for the HCA routine to be used in Plaxis, the numerical issues should be investigated and possibly a numerical interface should be designed. The high sensitivity to the model parameters, combined with the vast amount of required effort (and cost) to compute these parameters for a sand sample make the model less favourable for practical design applications.","cyclic loading; strain accumulation; granular material; sand; shallow foundation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

Subsequently, this data needs to get uploaded to a server located in Delft. When designing the control system clear requirements and interfaces were set. From these demands numerous considerations were taking into account resulting into using two LPC1768 microcontrollers to control the whole system. One stationed underground acting as slave and one stationed above ground acting as master. These two microcontrollers communicate with each other by two differential drivers using the RS-485 standard. The development and implementation of the written programs were done on the mbed IDE, which was provided by the used developers board.

In order to reach this goal by 2050 different parts are being designed for additive manufacturing production processes. For example fuel engine nozzles, door hinges and seat belts. Fokker Aero Structures, Materialise NV and the faculty of Aerospace Engineering want to take a next step by developing a 3D spoiler demonstrator representing a group of aircraft spoilers, ailerons and flaps. The 3D spoiler demonstrator consists of a pre-consolidated CF laminate skin with an additive manufactured rear structure fitting in the wing of the aircraft. The rear structure is additive manufactured using the fused deposition modelling, abbreviated as FDM, technology and bonds to the pre-consolidated CF laminate skin by the principle of autohesion during additive manufacturing of the rear structure. Autohesion between the two polymers is dominated by pressure, temperature and time. Obtaining good shear strength at the interface, between the pre-consolidated CF laminate skin and the additive manufactured rear structure, is the first step in the design of the 3D spoiler demonstrator. By using an experimental additive manufacturing set-up the influence of the joint surface temperature, influenced by FDM working parameters, on the shear strength is investigated.","additive manufacturing; thermoplastic; preconsolidated laminate; autohesion; filament","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity & Composites","",""

(mentor); Stijntjes, M. (mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor)","2016","Introduction. Ultrasound is known for cheap, fast and non-invasive diagnosis of numerous injuries. Sport-related injuries in the ankle joint and rehabilitation after surgical intervention are badly diagnosable using traditional ultrasound. Bones surrounding the surface of the articular cartilage blocks the ultrasound pulse and hides the talar surface where most injuries occur. Ultrasound wave propagation shows potential to be used in cheap, fast and non-invasive diagnosis of the cartilage regeneration after surgical intervention. The proposed technique uses a transmitter to send a pulse into the ankle joint whereas a transceiver records the propagated pulse on the other side. The recorded ultrasound wave contains information about the size and location of a lesion in the articular cartilage. Aim of this study is to collect the boundary conditions needed for ultrasound wave propagation through the ankle joint and quantify background noise, system noise and minor deviations of the transceiver on the recorded signal. Finally a novel coordinate system is proposed for the reliable recording of a propagated ultrasound pulse. Methods. Three sets of experiment were performed. Experiment 1 aimed to develop a procedure for consistent recording of an ultrasound wave propagated through the ankle joint. Using traditional ultrasonography the angle of the lower leg and the location of the transmitter and transducer was selected. Experiment 2 aimed to quantify the influence of background noise, system noise, and minor deviations of the transceiver on the recorded pulse. Influence was expressed in the normalized root of the mean square error (NRMSE) and the normalized mean cross correlation (NMCC). Using a robotic arm, displacements up to ±0.5 mm and rotations up to ±0.5° were made from the initial position. Experiment 3 aimed to test a novel coordinate system for the reliable recording of the propagated pulse in multiple recording sessions. Results. All three experiments were successful. The procedure resulting from experiment 1 is: angle of the tibia must be 73° relative to horizontal, ultrasound transmitter must be positioned on the posteromedial portal, and the ultrasound transceiver on the anterocentral portal, the forces of the probes on the skin must not exceed 15 Newton. This procedure has successfully been used in experiment 2 and 3. Experiment 2 quantified the background noise in the system to be white with a maximum value of -158 dB. System noise expressed in the NRMSE was between 0.2% and 4.9%. NMCC was between 0.9994 and 0.7147. Influence of displacements of the transceiver was up to a NRMSE of 5% and a NMCC of 0.6941. Rotation influence expressed in the NRMSE was up to 13%, NMCC was 0.7010. The novel coordinate system tested in experiment 3 repeated the recording with a NRMSE up to 34.1% and a NMCC as low as 0.2050. Conclusion. Background and system noise of ultrasound wave propagation through the ankle joint has been quantified. The influence of minor displacement and rotations of the transceiver on the recording of the propagated ultrasound pulse have been quantified. It provides us with knowledge of the position error needed to reproduce the results. Increased signal transfer between the transmitter and transceiver is needed for better signal analysis and assessment of the cartilage diagnosis. Ultrasound wave propagation through the ankle joint is possible and could be a new area of diagnosing and monitoring cartilage damage or regeneration.","osteochondral defect; ultrasound wave propagation; sensitivity analysis; cartilage regeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

The game that has been selected for this purpose is StarCraft. StarCraft is called the `next challenge in AI development' by Google. To create a multi-agent system (MAS) for StarCraft, a connection is needed from the programming language GOAL to the game. During the research phase, we evaluated existing solutions and chose an API to work with. Additionally, the current MAS-project was researched. One of the biggest challenges encountered was the performance of the system. Because of the large number of agents present in the game, the agents became unresponsive. This issue was overcome by optimizing as much as possible and collaborating with the client to find solutions. We used an agile development methodology together with test-driven development which enabled us to quickly prototype the system and identify bugs as soon as possible. There were many unexpected concurrency issues due to the API in conjunction with GOAL. These issues were solved by sacrificing some performance for robustness, with careful considerations not to hurt the system. The final system that was created connects GOAL to StarCraft and is tested using a variety of unit test and coverage frameworks.

(mentor)","2016","In recent days, the products and services provided by banks have moved to the digital domain more and more. Since most people rely on these services in their day to day lives, availability and reliability are very important in the success of a bank. In an effort to increase automation in this regard, ING Bank wants to employ machine learning to predict failure and alert a response system which will then try to put the system back into normal operation. To achieve this a better understanding of the intricacies of the interaction between system prior to and during failure is required. By creating an interactive way of visually playing back the event logs that describe the interaction between these systems we provide a first step in this understanding. Currently a lot of ING systems log their events to a database called TracING. These logs include a lot of information which is described in more detail in subsection 4.2. Logs extracted from this database are transformed into a report of metrics in the format of an interactive HTML page, where they can be visualised through time. Furthermore, some static metrics are also generated such as charts that showcase event success and failure for various durations. The initial focus of the project was to implement the machine learning prediction, but due to lack of classifiers in the provided data, the focus shifted towards visualising the data. Because of this, simple feature vector creation and a support vector machine have also been implemented as a basis for future work. Based on our work ING will expand the visualisation and, when additional data with more classifiers has been obtained, finish the machine learning prediction and alert system.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""
