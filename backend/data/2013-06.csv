(mentor); Sebastian Bihs, H. (mentor)","2013","The sediment transport module of REEF3D is used to calculate the scour and the deposition pattern for abutment, pier and contraction under constant discharge and for pier under waves. The time development of scour for all these cases is also observed. To this effect, the Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations are solved in all three dimensions, making it fully three dimensional. The location of the free surface is represented using level set method. The eddy viscosity in the RANS equation is determined by the use of the two-equation k-? model and k-? model. Using the conservative finite-difference framework on a structured-staggered grid, convective terms of RANS equation is discretized with the fifth-order WENO scheme. The pressure gradient term in the RANS equation is modelled using Chorin´s projection method on a staggered grid. For the implementation of waves, the CFD code is used as a numerical wave tank. For the representation of the moveable sediment bed, the level set method is used. Kovacs and Parker and Dey formulations of bed shear stress reduction due to the sloping bed is implemented along with the sand slide algorithm to take care of erosion of individual bed cells. In the first case, the numerical model results are validated against the experimental findings of the abutment scour study done at Politecnico di Milano, Dept. I.I.A.R., Milan, Italy.. This test case is used as a benchmark for validation of the sediment transport module of REEF3D. The effect of the grid size, the turbulence model, the time discretization scheme, the formulations of critical shear stress for the sloping bed and porosity was observed and compared against the experimental results.. In the second configuration, the numerical model is used to predict the scour pattern around a circular pier. The scour pattern around the pier is compared against the experimental data of the hydraulic laboratory of the Technical University Darmstadt. The performance of the turbulence model and the formulations of critical shear stress for the sloping bed was observed. The numerical model is then tested for predicting a general contraction scour. The result is compared against the physical experiments of the contraction case conducted at the laboratories of the BAW (Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute), Karlsruhe, Germany. For the above mentioned three cases, a constant discharge at the boundary is used. The numerical model in the above configurations predict the general evolution (geometry, location and maximum scour depth) and time development of the scour hole accurately. In the final configuration, 3D local scour around a vertical pile under waves is modelled. The numerical result is first compared with theoretical observations and then validated against the pier scour experiments conducted in the Department of Hydrodynamics and Water Resources (ISVA), Technical University of Denmark by Sumer and Fredsoe. The effect of the variation of the sediment time stepping with the decoupling of the hydrodynamic and the morphodynamic time step is tested. The numerical model shows good agreement with the experiment and theoretical erosion and deposition pattern. The de-coupled approach for the simulation of hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes is found to be a reasonable assumption.","Sediment Transport; CFD; REEF3D; Numerical Wave Tank; Abutment; Pier; Contraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","COMEM","",""

To respond adequately to these changes, a better way of cooperation is necessary. Cooperation will lead to comprehensive and sustainable solutions for the future developments. To reach this goal, consensus must be secured between different stakeholders that have different disciplinary backgrounds, different values and maybe contradicting stakes. Good interdisciplinary cooperation processes requires a vision, commitment, and the goal to reach an optimal and sustainable spatial plan. This plan should minimize the impact on the environment, while guaranteeing social and economic viability, now and in the future. Sharing expertise and knowledge will lead to know-how on how to avoid or quickly solve regularly recurring conflicts in the future. It remains difficult to combine two or more academic disciplines into one activity. Every specialist acts from its own expertise, experience and insight. Communication instruments are used to get interdisciplinary cooperation started. This led to the following research question: What role can the design play in an interdisciplinary debate? With the sub-research question: How can urban, technical and natural developments and stakes be united in one integral spatial design? The dynamic and complex IJssel-Vechtdelta is dealing with high uncertainties about future developments. I developed a design for this region that touches on multiple disciplinary-related interests and used this design as a vehicle to start an interdisciplinary debate with the stakeholders involved. The interdisciplinary discussions led to a series of adjustments of the design.

(mentor); Hombergen, L.P.I.M. (mentor); Hobma, F.A.M. (mentor); Roelofs, M. (mentor)","2013","Recently, in the construction industry a shift is taking place from conventional contracts models, in which the client has the responsibility for the (re)design of an asset, to integrated contract models in which the role of the client is much more limited. Further, in integrated models for road infrastructure, projects are contracted for the whole life cycle of the road; and more design freedom is given to the contractors of the project; also, private investors finance those projects more and more; and finally, those contracts tend to be negotiated for longer terms. The DBFM contract is such a model. DBFM stands for ‘design, build, finance and maintain’ and since 1999 this contract model has been increasingly applied by the Dutch government because it is believed to deliver value for money. However, this new type of contract is said to be (relatively) inflexible. Not only in the Netherlands but also in the United Kingdom, where similar types of contracts (DBFO) are administered by the English equivalent of Rijkswaterstaat, the Highways Agency. Usually, DBFM and DBFO contracts, in which O stands for operate, have a term of about 15 to 30 years. Inflexibility of the DBFM contract is believed to be a problem for the public sector client, such as Rijkswaterstaat or ProRail, who is worried that public resources are tied up that could also be used elsewhere. It is worried because it is unknown whether the DBFM contract can put changing circumstances, which by definition exist as the project’s context is dynamic, into effect. This is particularly an issue for changing circumstances in the long term, because the longer the contract runs the more uncertainties there are at the outset of the project. In literature is suggested that flexibility of the DBFM contract is provided by the change procedure. This is a mechanism in the DBFM contract through which both physical changes in the asset and changes in the contract’s terms can be made. These changes can be initiated either by the client or the commissionee. Therefore, in this research is investigated what flexibility is offered by the change procedure in the DBFM contract for Dutch transportation infrastructure projects that have been issued the completion certificate. Moreover, as it is observed that it is unknown how the interests of the main actors in the DBFM project play a role in making changes and in flexibility, this is studied too. The central research question is: What flexibility is offered by the change procedure in the DBFM contract for Dutch infrastructure projects and how do the interests of the contracting parties and the financiers of DBFM play a role therein? The research objective is to propose recommendations for improving the DBFM approach of infrastructure projects. To reach that research objective the project has been divided into three phases. Phase 1 is the literature study, on basis of which an analytical framework is established. It includes 4 propositions (see below). In phase 2, which is divided into three parts, respectively changes in case projects are identified and characterised by means of a case study research (2a); the interests of the contracting parties and the financiers are analysed (2b); and the experience with flexibility of DBFO projects in England is assessed (2c). The projects that were selected for the case study research are three road projects, namely the A59, A12 motorways and the N31 highway, and one rail project, the HSL-Zuid. These are 4 Dutch transportation infrastructure projects which have reached the projects’ completion date, which means that the commissioneehas finished realisation and now has to ‘exploit’ the asset2. Finally, in phase 3 by means of an analysis of the data the research question is answered and the recommendations for improving the DBFM approach is presented.","DBFM; flexibility; changes; infrastructure; Netherlands; contracts; DBFO; Rijkswaterstaat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, the customizing freedom of Open Building System is only limited in the form of façade and interior. Other decision levels such as structure, programme and capacity have not been discussed. Starting with observation of undergoing urban transition in Amsterdam Sloterdijk -one of the typical pure business districts in Netherlands, through tackling one of the most critical issues -the mismatch between supply and demand in building market-which considered as the primary cause for the office vacancy and urban mono-function, via the reflection on architectural position in this situation, through the formulation of objective and research question, via the reference to urban planning evolution, and eventually reaching the destination of a definition for Hyper-open Building System and its reflection on architectonic, this research document is trying to develop a building system, which can achieve a set of goals including the individual autonomy in decision-making, interchangeability in typology, evolvability in architectural quality and efficiency in design construction process. As a technical guideline for subsequent design, the research document will be concluded by a catalog of architectonic criteria and an optimized building prototype. And by using the criteria, a set of existing vacant office buildings around Amsterdam area will be evaluated in order to get the general idea about the current building conditions and transformation potentials. On the other hand, the design project chose a specific vacant office building to transform by applying the Hyper-Open Building System. More specifically, after the redesign of support construction, individual users are invited to the design process. Through the interface, users can customize the size of their unit based on predesigned modularity according to their personal requirement. Besides, for dwelling users, they also have the possibility to change the interior layout. Additionally, users can also define their front space and customize the backside façade.

(mentor); Nijhuis, S. (mentor)","2013","The area around the Maashaven in Rotterdam South is short of larger recreational public space, which is a drawback to attract starters and young families to this socially segregated area. Like in many other Northern European cities, the harbour currently divides successful and the deprived neighbourhoods and awaits a new function now the previous industry and trade dominated relation between city and river disappears. Therefore in this thesis it is investigated how inner city former harbour bays can function as public space in order to stitch disassociated districts into a continuum and to strengthen the relation between city and river. This question comprises hypotheses: that water can function as public space and that creating public space is a valid strategy to reconnect disassociated districts. Four sub-research questions are formulated. Firstly it is investigated how the relation between city and river has developed and how a design could influence this relation. Secondly, criteria for good public space in harbour areas are studied. Since the former harbour function slowly disappears, the contemporary and future spatial claims for this area are investigated at the third sub-question. As fourth question, the main varaible spatial preconditions are investigated to be able to make a design that can adapt to different future scenarios. This thesis uses research by design on the case of the Maashaven as main method to which design research such as literature study, plan analysis, comparative study and a scenario study are supportive. After formulating a vision on the area, an adaptive redevelopment plan is designed. Two robust interventions that could function as initiators of change in the area are further elaborated. They illustrate the meaning of the design on different scales and together cover all aspects of the scenario study and most stakeholders perspectives. The combination of design research and research by design leads to some generic and some site specific conclusions. Firstly, transforming a harbour basin into public space depends largely on the design of a selection of spaces at its edges. Nor the whole basin, nor all quays should be made public. Secondly, the strategy to reconnect districts cannot only consist out of public space design but also requires a good slow traffic network, a strong identity and an appealing mix of program. In the case of the Maashaven the spatial claims of industry and inland shipping, recreation and ecology showed to be compatible and can even strengthen each other. Using inner city basins for floating neighbourhoods as the municipality proposes, is rejected mainly because of its privatising effect. On the contrary, a modest amount of floating constructions for recreational, nonpermanent use can strengthen the public character of the harbour. Thirdly, the relation between city and river can be strengthened by making the river and inner harbours part of the daily life of people again. For Rotterdam specifically the design showed how the relation between city and river can be strengthened on neighbourhood, city and regional scale.","public space design; urban harbours; regeneration; ecological recovery; floating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-28","Architecture","Urbanism","","Delta Interventions","",""

(mentor); Hausleitner, B. (mentor)","2013","A railway station is one of the most important elements of modern cities. The station is of vital importance to shops and other economic functions in the city centre because of the constant flow of people going in and out of the city. At present, many Dutch cities saw the necessity of redeveloping their railway station environments. Every railway station environment has an own identity, and therefore its own potentials. Analyzing the integration of railway stations within their city’s urban fabric is one of the ways to determine those potentials. Many current regeneration projects are only focused on the connectivity on a regional scale. Often the local accessibility is considered as less important. A lot has been written about the quality and liveability of public space already. The public space in the vicinity of a railway station is one of the most important public urban spaces in a city. It is the first space people experience when arriving in the city. However, in many current railway station environment redevelopment projects the liveability does not get priority. Many different factors have resulted in railway station environments that are unpleasant places to be, cut off from their surroundings. This is where the challenges lie for the nearby future in the Netherlands, to regain the importance of the railway station and the railway network, especially in a large metropolitan area like the Randstad. These two currently subordinated aspects; the spatial integration and the liveability of railway station environments will be emphasized in this MSc thesis. The project location of this thesis is the railway zone in Gouda. The spatial potential and the liveability of the current situation have been analyzed, as well as the changes the existing plans of the municipality of Gouda will make. As final product of this graduation project an alternative urban renewal plan has been developed for the railway zone in Gouda.","urban renewal; public space; spatial integration; liveability; railway station environment; Gouda","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-26","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration","",""

(mentor); De Rijk, T.R.A. (mentor); Hillen, M. (mentor)","2013","This report aims to provide the Mauritshuis with a concept design that will contribute to the rejuvenation of the Mauritshuis’ visitor profile. The concept may attract a younger audience, without losing sight of the collection and the Mauritshuis’ current visitors. A promising target audience that contributes to this rejuvenation are young families. With attracting this group the Mauritshuis is able to catch two birds with one stone. On the one hand they attract parents who are aged under to current average age of 55 and on the other hand they can educate children about museum visits and inspire them to visit again when they are older. This research consists of an analysis of the Mauritshuis, a literature study on key trends museums are dealing with and a consumer research to discover the needs and wants of young families. Because young families are currently not covering a significant part of the Mauritshuis’ visitors, this means that they may not be intrinsically motivated to visit the collection of the Mauritshuis and currently have no extrinsic motivation to visit the museum as well. The goal of this research it therefore to increase the extrinsic motivation of young families by aiming on reducing the barriers and so to increase the incentives of young families to visit the museum. While improving this extrinsic motivation the Mauritshuis should never lose track of its reason of being; showing differences and similarities between our current timeframe and the Dutch Golden Age, using their paintings. Consumer research on young families pointed out that in order to reduce the barriers and increase the incentives regarding a museum visit, the visiting experience should contain social interaction between the family members, have a high level of activities and should give the families freedom of movement. Nowadays people are looking for total experiences that cover all phases in their journey. In this case those phases are a pre-visiting experience, the visiting experience and a post-visiting experience. In the pre-visiting experience families prepare their visit and this preparation should therefore be inextricably bounded up with the actual visit. During this visit families want to collect memories, which they can take home and share with families and friends (post-visiting experience). This results in four main findings that will function as a qualitative list of requirements in the design phase: reduce barriers and increase incentives; stay close to the reason of being of the Mauritshuis; enable social interaction, activities and freedom of movement during the visit; deliver a seamless experience throughout all the three phases of the customer journey. The concept which is developed in order to fulfil this qualitative list of requirements is called ‘Kijk je Rijk!’. It is an interactive application that will support the needs and wants of young families regarding the three phases of the customer journey. The collection of the Mauritshuis serves as the basis and after analyzing the concept it turns out that using a multimedia device does increase the incentive of young families to visit a museum.","rejuvenation; Mauritshuis; museum; young families; customer journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management, Design Aesthetics","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Boess, S.U. (mentor)","2013","Innovative Product Service Systems (PSSs) are needed in order to keep the healthcare system affordable, while safeguarding or enhancing care quality. This study examined application of the Community-based Co-design approach to assistive technology development for informal care. A sequence of methods was applied, involving end-users and communities in the earliest design stages. A design target was found together with informal caregivers, and a solution was iteratively developed together with various stakeholders. This PSS solution enables the informal caregiver both to monitor the care recipient while being away, and to efficiently manage emergency situations if these occur. The PSS arranges existing technology in a unique and contextually appropriate way. This makes the solution much more likely to be accepted by end-users and their neighborhood communities. Community-based Co-design was essential in reaching this result. After the early design stage, an embodiment design stage was carried out. Various qualitative research and design engineering methods were combined, 1) to develop and validate the estimated supportive value of the PSS to target users, and 2) to develop and study the feasibility of the PSS. A role-play evaluation study formed an important part of this process. Significant insights from both the early and embodiment design stages were fed back as far as possible into the PSS itself, or into PSS design requirements. Reflecting on the results, it has become more likely that the PSS will have supportive value to caregivers, and that the PSS is feasible. Several recommendations were made for further development - in particular, the societal cost-benefit analysis for the PSS is promising but premature, and requires elaboration.","alarm systems; monitored control systems; biomedical systems; communication systems; socio-technical system design; user interface; sensor systems; telecommunication; informal care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-06-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

There lies a huge assignment for the transformation of vacant office buildings. Amsterdam teleport has an increasing office vacancy rate that is now 22,4%.(were Amsterdam, 2011) This permanent vacancy problem calls for the transformation of these existing buildings. With finding a new purpose for these existing buildings, several problems come to light. The often deep building volumes have poor daylight access and are therefore highly dependent on artificial lighting. Besides these outdates buildings do not meet today’s energy requirements which is primarily caused by an extensive heating demand of 500 MJ/m². Second comes lighting which is responsible for an energy consumption of 260 MJ/m² (Meijer Energie & milieumanagement B.V., 2008). Together heating and lighting are responsible for respectively 40% and 22% of the energy consumption in existing office buildings. Heliostatic mirrors are computer controlled mirrors that can focus sunlight onto a predetermined target. The possibility to bring daylight deeper into a building contributes to better daylight access, minimizing electrical lighting, and reducing the demand for heating. And because daylight can be brought deeper into existing office buildings new spatial organisations become possible, these transformed buildings can operate differently. The main research question therefore is; “How can heliostatic mirrors play a role in the transformation of deep vacant office buildings, contribute to day lighting, heating and minimize the electrical lighting of dark spots?” The research found in this document is structured around a linear process that starts with understanding the concepts involved due to literature study. Because of the absence of a manual or quantifications on my topic of research, the next step will be to build a quantification method. Then the research will put (generic) models to the test, so that guidelines and conclusions for the eventual design will derive. The research will show that the application of heliostatic mirrors has implications for the internal organisation. On the basis of references and design study several variations will be explained. On the topic of energy this research shows that the contribution of heliostatic mirrors to heating does not live up to the expectations. The energy contribution seemed to be rather limited. In terms of daylight contribution results are pending and the topic of minimizing electrical lighting promising literature showed there is a significant decline in the demand for artificial lighting. Last a literature study on how to light effects the functioning of a space provides a range of criteria and concepts that will influence the eventual design.","heliostatic mirrors; thermal energy; daylight system; office transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-29","Architecture","Architectural engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","Cave mining operations produce bulked ore from self-sustainable propagating caves in high stress regimes. Undercut development creates even higher abutment stresses and a stress-shadow which have significant impact on extraction level stability. Geotechnical assessment of the infrastructure is vital for the safety performance and continuity of production. Northparkes Mines (NPM) is a block caving operation located in New South Wales, Australia. They deployed a post-undercutting strategy to develop the E48 deposit, exposing all tunnels and draw bells at the extraction level to high abutment stresses. Convergence of the extraction drifts and relative displacements in the brittle rock mass have been monitored during this process. The current industry standard for geotechnical analyses of hard rock in stressed environments is the non-linear Hoek-Brown failure criterion. It estimates the resistance to shear failure of jointed to heavily jointed rock masses by rock mass strength degradation. However, brittle rock masses fail in a tensile mode in low confinement zones around excavations. The most recently developed hypothesis in this field of work is the S-shaped failure criterion. It assumes spalling at low confinement and an inhibition of tensile failure processes at relatively high confinements, where shear bands are the dominant structures causing failure. In other words, it suggests that the Hoek-Brown failure criterion underestimates the rock mass strength in highly confined zones of brittle rock masses. Validated principles to establish the rate of degradation in high confinement zones are currently not available and the S-shaped approach is therefore not yet ready for engineering purposes. The aim of this project is to indicate differences in results derived from numerical modelling when either the Hoek-Brown or the S-shaped failure criterion is applied and relate those differences to geotechnical data obtained at NPM. A three-dimensional, parameterized environment has been created by applying the mesh generator KUBRIX Geo on a Computer-Aided Design of the extraction level. Undercut development was simulated by an adequate stress-path using the Finite Difference Method in FLAC3D. An evaluation of the response of extensometer stations to an advancing undercut front at NPM has revealed immediate and abrupt dilative behaviour of the rock mass once the cave line has passed. Scenarios using the S-shaped failure criterion were able to simulate this behaviour if rock mass degradation was sufficiently contained at high confinement, while the scenario using the Hoek-Brown failure criterion was unable to do so. The extent of yield, stresses in pillar cores and stress-strain responses of the rock mass indicate stronger pillars in scenarios using the S-shaped failure criterion. The S-shaped failure criterion is a state-of-the-art approach and although the basic concept is finding more support, the definition of its parameters will require more research in the coming years. This project improves the understanding of the application of the S-shaped failure criterion in continuum modelling and highlights its strengths and shortcomings.","block caving; failure criteria; brittle rock masses; FLAC3D; extensometer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

Also in the current existing office space, sustainable performance plays a more prominent role than ten years ago. It seems that the energy performance certificate is indeed providing the real estate world with some needed transparency. Although theoretically, the calculation framework seems to align with the energy performance index, the actual energy consumption deviates from the regulatory framework. When these consumption figures are being transferred to energy costs it becomes clear that the technical condition, the office space usage and the nature of the occupier are strongly influencing. Currently, it is up to the real estate sector to embrace sustainability and operationalize this principle through their assets.

Secondly, this project is supported by the Delft Institute of Positive Design, an IDE Delft institute that aims to develop knowledge that supports designers in their attempts to design for happiness and human flourishing. With the help of methodology derived from Positive Psychology, the MijMo watch has been designed to support the subjective well-being and long-term happiness of older women. The MijMo watch is a fitness tracker and mindfulness coach in one. It is an elegant digital watch for women that keeps them updated about their personal balance level. Worn around the wrist during the day, it can track movements of mild physical activities as well as from exercising. At set times during the week, the watch surprises the user with mindfulness practises that can be listened to through a small loudspeaker integrated in the clasp. “Mindfulness is the awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose in the present moment and non-judgementally. “ (Definition by Jon Kabat-Zinn) The benefits of mindfulness practises are stress reduction, reduced rumination, increased ability to focus, less emotional reactivity, support of working memory and cognitive flexibility. The MijMo watch has got several technologies integrated in its design. The physical activity of the user will be measured by an accelerometric sensor.

(mentor)","2013","Containerization has emerged as the favourable method in ocean transport as it is able to transport cargoes worldwide with low cost. Liner service is the concept which develops as the concept that provides scheduled transport service. At the latter development, it also provides intermodal service which combine ocean and inland transportation. Shippers and carriers, as two main stakeholders in container shipping commonly engage in service contract with agreed price and volume. However, this arrangement is vulnerable to contract default due to the fluctuation of spot freight rate which challenge the commitment of both parties and their ingenuity to avoid loss and/or gain profit from the situation. Index-Linked Contract (ILC) is concept that is introduced as one of alternatives in conducting service contract between shippers and carriers. With this concept, the contract price is adjusted by agreed indices and mechanism instead of fixed. This dissertation is focusing on the perception and future development of ILC form shippers and carriers point of view. The study objectives are met by conducting extensive literature review as well as gathering empirical data. Qualitative method is applied in this research by undertaking survey to companies which represents targeted group. The survey is conducted by interviewing key personnel in respective companies regarding the study objectives. Based on the findings, it is found that the concept is flexible and has diverse method to be applied based on the intended outcome, one of which is to be coupled with hedging tools to obtain predictable rates. However, as the concept is still considerably new, many shippers and liner operators are still hesitating in implementing the concept. Although it cannot solve current contractual problem completely, ILC can be perceived as alternative in contracting in liner container shipping. Finally, it is suggested to conduct more researches in the impact of commodity values specific commodities and trade routes with the implementation of ILC. Further investigation about the implication of regulation such as EU Commission in Competition and OSRA is equally important.","shippers; carriers; container; liner; contract; indices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

Since the transitional community shelter is an entire separate structure that should function as an education and community center, and is designed and constructed to protect its occupants and nearby residents from specific natural disasters as well, means there a many things to take care of within the design process. Transitional community centers can be built in disaster prone areas, in this research there is a focus on typhoons, floods and earthquakes, especially in urban slum areas, which are mainly underdeveloped and have poorly constructed houses and often lack proper sanitation. The guidelines provided in this research are oriented to the needs of the designers and engineers that have to bring these kind of constructions into practice and provide a description of the range of design guidelines that need to be considered when making design that have to be able to withstand natural disasters like earthquakes, typhoons and floods. Design | An Adaptable Community Center The proposed design of an adaptable community center accommodates educational, community and sanitation facilities to upgrade standard living conditions and hygiene in the slums of Metro Manila. Offering new opportunities can boost new developments by means of a strong connection with a market place, modern communication networks and proper accessibility. Communities should not be passive recipients of information but should be encouraged to help themselves and the design is provided with the mechanisms and tools to do so. There is a need to acknowledge that facilities for information, education, sanitation and communication could actually help to develop urban slums. When disaster strikes, the community is supposed to know how to handle and the center itself can transit into a safe house to provide proper protection against high wind forces, the impact of windborne debris, monsoons and high water levels caused by typhoons and floods. In case of heavy earth shocks caused by earthquakes, the building should withstand these and immediately be able to transform into a center of emergency relief.","shelter; adaptable; community; education; facilities; slum upgrading; empowerment; relief aid; transitional; urbanization; alarming; poverty; philippines; manila; slum; re-building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

(mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor); Van de Ruitenbeek, H.K.M. (mentor); Krijgsman, H. (mentor)","2013","During the design process, structural engineers are required to create more efficient designs while achieving maximum integration with other disciplines, satisfying design requirements and ensuring sufficient safety. Even though many algorithms, tools and case studies of computational optimisations for structural design are available in both literature and practice, their application is often tailored to a specific case. The limited generalizability of these optimization definitions complicates reuse of implemented design knowledge in new design situations. Even though structural design projects are unique in nature, they share a common base in terms of structural components, objectives and restraints (e.g. element strength, global structure deflection). This research proved that defining design knowledge within these abstract components allows for the reuse of definitions in new situations. This has been evaluated in three stages: 1. The development of a prototype for a knowledge-based framework, based on components, objectives and restraints; 2. The implemented knowledge was verified against reliability and efficiency of the structural design restraints and optimisation algorithms by analysing three cases; 3. Finally, the prototype has been used three complex cases to prove its versality. This resulted in a prototype of a knowledge-based framework that allows for the reuse and extension of design knowledge. In total ten case studies were evaluated with this prototype:  Three basic case studies that verified conservative evaluation of load bearing resistance.  Three benchmark cases that demonstrated that performance of efficient solutions found showed agreement with results in literature (maximum difference in performance 4\%).  A comparison of the implemented prototype with the commercial application Scia Engineer endorses the added value of the suggested approach, such as the possibility to include topology optimisation.  Three complex case studies have been extensively evaluated to demonstrate the reuse of knowledge in diverse contexts, e.g., a comparative case study, a theoretic study and a practical application. Finally, prerequisites were defined for development of a knowledge-based framework that allows for the reuse of explicit knowledge for structural optimisation, such as distribution of explicit knowledge over multiple levels of abstraction, in individual generic components of the structural optimisation process (such as a structural element) with context dependent relations introduced as variables. The ability of reusing explicit knowledge allowed the author for running the ten cases in a limited time frame. It is estimated that the effort for using computational optimisation in the design process will reduce by this approach. Additional research is suggested to quantify the benefits and effort of this approach in comparison to traditional trial and error design and specialised optimisation implementations.","reuse; explicit knowlegde; steel structures; structural optimisation; object oriented framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Specialisation Steel and Timber Construction","",""

Bocagrande is coping with several issues which affect the social economic value of the peninsula. Flooding, coastal erosion, overtopping waves and lack of accessibility are the general issues mentioned by the stakeholders. They all seem to be interrelated and therefore all these issues are taken into account in this project. In order to capture the overall problem that will be investigated in this study the following research question is formulated: What is the best integral solution for Bocagrande, concerning the problems of coastal erosion, flooding, overtopping waves and lack of accessibility, in order to secure the social and economic value that the peninsula has for the city of Cartagena? One of the major issues is the poor accessibility of Bocagrande. Since the increase of hotels and apartment buildings, nothing as been done to the infrastructure. There is one road that connects the peninsula to the city, of which the capacity is too low for the amount of traffic, resulting in congestion. This gets even worse when the streets are flooded. There are two types of floods, small scale and large scale. Small scale flooding happens every month on a part of Bocagrande, the bayside, due to high tide. This small scale flooding decreases the velocity and the capacity of the roads. There is no protection and no drainage system so the sea water can only be discharged with low tide. The sea water also causes damage to cars and property, since the basements of the hotels and apartments get flooded. Heavy precipitation also causes small scale flooding and decreases the road capacity and velocity. When high tide and heavy precipitation coincide with storm conditions, large scale flooding occur, which means that the whole of Bocagrande is flooded. The peninsula is then completely cut off from the city and nobody can leave or enter the peninsula without a boat. This integral solution consists of the following parts: 1) Construction of a berm and a raise of the seawall near Punta Santo Domingo to reduce overtopping. This will reduce damage to the road and increase accessibility by making both of the two lanes available. 2) A wall with vegetated dunes along the seaside coast of Bocagrande will reduce future erosion and prevent flooding. The resulting availability of a beach during the tourist season will add value for the hotels, restaurants and the small vendors. 3) Construction of T groynes and nourishment near El Laguito create a beach, preventing flooding and reducing erosion. The beach restores the old situation where restaurants are located. lt also protects the buildings from damage due to erosion. 4) Filling the lake on El Laguito economically solves the degrading water quality problem and adds valuable land to Bocagrande. 5) A wall along the bayside of Bocagrande prevents flooding which reduces the amount of damage to property behind the wall and increases the road capacity. 6) The accessibility of Bocagrande increases by the previous solutions. However constructing a tunnel from Bocagrande to Manga increases the accessibility even more. The increase of accessibility of Bocagrande, decreases the total travel time. The integral solution covers all the problem areas indicated by the system analyses and secures the social and economic value of Bocagrande by limiting the effects and adding value where possible.","Cartagena; traffic; flooding; tourism","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering, Construction Management and Engineering, Transport and Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","The Netherlands is one of the fi rst countries that have implemented Pedestrian Oriented Design (POD) concept in the urban area. ‘Woonerf’ (it can be roughly translated in English as ‘Living yard’) was the most popular type of POD in 1970s. ‘Woonerf’ aimed to infl uence driver’s behaviour and improve both the safety and quality of life on the street. It gave the street the functions of meeting place, playground, and walking area. Consequently, it made playful and creative urban landscape, and was very successful in the Netherlands. Moreover, it has spread throughout Western European countries such as Germany, Denmark, and the UK(Hamilton-Baillie, 2008). In the case of UK, the concept of ‘Home Zones’ was developed from the original concept of ‘Woonerf (residential area with restrictions to slow down traffic)’, and it was implemented in order to revitalise deprived neighbourhoods. The increasing in attention to road safety and environmental issues in the UK has made the concept of ‘Home Zones’ popular. In 1999, the British government created guidelines for the home zones, and it has included 14 pilot home zone projects. Home zones are considered as places for social interaction and intended, create a greater sense of pride and ownership in the street by the government of the UK. Consequently, Home zones are expected to improve the liveability in the deprived neighbourhoods (Clayden et al., 2006). However, it is hard to fi nd this kind of approach, for example home zones, to improve the condition of deprived neighbourhoods. The main goal of this project is to introduce Pedestrian Oriented Street Design as an approach to improve the liveability of Dutch neighbourhood. In the northern part of the Netherlands, there are some examples of POD, in the form of ‘Shared Space’. However, this approach is more focused on the development of a shopping street rather than of a whole neighbourhood. Thus, this report proposes the developed of Pedestrian Oriented Design in residential streets using with the case of Carnisse. In order to achieve the aims of this project and answer the research questions, diverse theories and discussions were reviewed. There are already many discussions about the value of street as an urban open space. They point out that the street takes the largest portion of urban open space (Woolley, 2003), it is the place where people can experience the city(Glaser, 2012), and where public socialising and community enjoyment in daily life can occur (Jacobs, 1993). Thus, this report searches for the possibilities of POD in the process of urban regeneration. This report discusses the case of Carnisse, a neighbourhood in the southern part of Rotterdam. In order to develop this project, the neighbourhood was analysed within the city, district and neighbourhood scale. The analysis of Carnisse showed some possible reasons that could make the neighbourhood deprived.","woonerf; shared space; post war neighbourhood; street design; pedestrian oriented street","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-31","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban regeneration in European context","",""

(mentor); Van Tol, A.F. (mentor); Van der Veen, C. (mentor)","2013","This thesis focuses on the behaviour of micropiles under axial tensile loading and modelling of the pile head displacement of micropiles. In the behaviour of micropiles, defined in load and corresponding pile head displacement, the development of the shear stress along the pile shaft is found to be of leading influence. This development of the shear stresses determines not only the lengthening of the pile during the whole loading process, but also the displacement of the pile tip. Due to the compressibility of the slender foundation pile the shear stress acting at the pile tip will only develop with high loads on top. Also a closer look is given to the pile stiffness. The contribution of the grout to the pile stiffness is found to be only of small influence on the pile head displacement and corresponding axial spring stiffness. However it is found that the crack width in the grout due to the tension load on top is relatively big and this might give problems with corrosion. The model to calculate the pile head displacement and correspond axial spring stiffness of the micropile developed in this thesis is called the Revised FOREVER model. It is based on the current Dutch method to determine shear stresses and maximum bearing capacity. The development of the shear stresses and displacement along the pile shaft is modelled using load transfer curves. Because the soil stress-strain relation is assumed to behave linear elastic-perfectly plastic along the pile shaft, the calculations can be done analytically. Due to a scaling factor which implements pile stiffness, shaft area, soil behaviour and bond length the model can be adapted different local situations. The model is compared with measurements from field tests and with other numerical models and the results correspondence with each other. Due to the scaling factor implementing all local parameters it was possible to simplify the calculation method. Therefore the Simplified Revised FOREVER model is developed. This is based on the current Dutch calculation method to determine the axial spring stiffness of tension piles.","micropile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor); Luiten, E.A.J. (mentor); Koppels, P.W. (mentor)","2013","The process of the phenomena of urbanization within developing countries in Latin America, such as Nicaragua, has increased the appearance of urban informality in the socio-spatial structure. Moreover, the lack of a clear planning framework has led Nicaraguan cities such as Managua, to an urban structure, which is no longer related to its context. Thus, increasing social, urban and environmental vulnerability of the most susceptible part of the population. In Managua, the sectoral approach to spatial planning development is causing urban growth to be directed through market-based initiatives, as well as fragmented and punctual public interventions. It lacks an inclusion of spatialization of regulations as tools to begin with the process of inclusion and assessment of values; to avoid the continuing loss of identity and sense of place of the city. Managua seems to be a never-ending nest of problems and there is no clear starting point within the city’s development plans. That is why the approach of cultural heritage assets as the redevelopment strategy was taken forward, based on the hypothesis that if there is a functional recuperation of the Historical City Core by the recognition of its assets (cultural, spatial and social), the identity of the city can be restored as well as the activation of the city’s urban restructuring towards a more coherent urban form development. This resulted in the proposal of a new model of development that aims at integrated actions with a multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-scalar setting. The necessary outputs to reach this model are present within this thesis and range from an analytical framework, to vision and strategies to an operational framework. Overall, this thesis proposes to replace missing links with a flexible and dynamic frame that achieves integrated relations of systems and governance levels. The thesis finalizes with recommendations for further application possibilities as it is clear that this graduation project is an academic exercise and the implementation of this proposal needs coordinated policies to face complex changes and to respond to the need of sustainable development.","cultural and heritage landscape; Historical centre redevelopment; social-spatial fragmentation; environmental vulnerability; Managua; Nicaragua","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Graduation Studio: Complex Cities and Regions in Transformation","",""

Firstly, weather conditions can influence traffic supply through a temporal reduction of capacity due to changes in driving behaviour. Secondly, weather conditions can influence highway traffic demand. A stated adaptation experiment has been conducted and a Panel Mixed Logit model is estimated to arrive at a highway traffic demand as a result of adverse weather. To examine the influence of precipitation on highway capacity it was chosen to estimate capacity distribution functions for dry weather, light rain and heavy rain based on the Product Limit Method. With the development of a generic model based on a cumulative normal distribution, breakdown probabilities can be calculated for any given traffic demand and capacity. Rainfall leads to a significant increase in probability of breakdown at bottleneck locations. A breakdown probability of 50% in dry weather will lead to an average breakdown probability of 86.7% in light rain and 77.4% in heavy rain conditions. The higher breakdown probability with light rainfall is the result of the increased traffic demand. The conclusion that can be drawn is that both traffic demand and highway capacity should always be incorporated in the analysis to come to accurate predictions regarding breakdown probabilities.","highway traffic demand; highway capacity; adverse weather conditions; breakdown probability Dutch highways","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2013","For large-displacement mechanisms, such as underactuated fingers, the out-of-plane stiffness can pose problems, especially as it tends to vary over the in-plane range of motion. In this paper a method is presented to design compliant underactuated fingers using topology optimization with a focus on obtaining a desired out-of-plane stiffness profile. Load path representation is used in combination with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Aside from the thickness of beam elements, the curve of a beam element is also employed as design variable. A set of objective functions is used to evaluate the behavior of the out-of-plane stiffness over the range of motion. The resulting Pareto solutions provide insight into the trade-off between the different objective functions on contact force and out-of-plane stiffness and also show the capability of this method to design compliant underactuated fingers. Using objective functions on out-of-plane stiffness results in solutions with a higher out-of-plane stiffness than when these objective functions were not used, while the solutions decrease little in performance in terms of contact force. The resulting shape of the out-of-plane stiffness over the in-plane range of motion is shown to vary per solution. It is also shown that using curved beam elements can have a positive effect on the out-of-plane stiffness. Experiments on an underactuated finger prototype verified the simulation results.","topology optimization; compliance; underactuated; finger; out-of-plane stiffness; load path representation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

These four entities included in the design as well as its global importance make us realize its icon status worldwide. Its existence and appearance should persuade people that sustainable design and behavior towards the environment can improve our way of living. Architecture is integrally connected to social and economical issues that undoubtedly should be considered during the process of designing. The question is how to express sustainability in the design of a building so as to be understandable by everyone, even to those who wouldn't have the chance to visit that building and only see it on pictures? Should it be clearly expressed at the facades and the outer skin of the building or should it be integrated in the climate and structural design of the building? Starting with the research on the site it seems necessary the intervention on it so as to improve its urban quality, its relation with the existing built environment and the natural elements, like water and the green space. At the urban scale principles, the green space of the existing green park should remain in order to enhance the sustainability principle of the project. As far as it concerns the building, several facts will affect the design. It is a building which addresses to five different users: the delegates, secretariats, businessmen, researchers and the regular civilians. However apart from the users it will be a representational building which should be recognizable from people that either visit it or see it at pictures. My intention is to design a building that would be easily recognizable from the public and at the same time be friendly and open to those who have the chance to either visit it or even work there. The proper use of the materials and the structure will help me to find the right balance of the scale that these two principles (easily recognizable and friendly) have.","sustainability; New York","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-30","Architecture","Architecture","","Strategic Architectural Design Development","",""

(mentor); Luiten, E. (mentor)","2013","This is a personal graduation project under the studio of Complex Cities and Regional Planning in the spatial planning chair of Urbanism track in TUD. The motivation of exploring the theme as ‘Landscape into Urbanism’ comes from the increasingly emerging environmental risks globally in urban areas. As the medium between artificial urban constructions and natural environment, urban landscape combines these two-side characters and then reflects them into the urban-landscape transformation process. Lots of recent sudden natural disasters or extreme climate condition such as the Hurricane Katrina and flooding in central Europe together with common environmental degrading from daily human activities all bring introspections to a more resilience and harmony urban-landscape relationship. Such landscape thinking is even more urgent in China, who has already suffered great environmental degrading during its fast urbanization process. Therefore, this project chooses Changxing Island in Shanghai, who could represent the spatial & operational conflicts between urban transformation and its dynamic landscape in both local and regional scales, as the research & design site. And with the general regional development and urban transformation concerns from Complex Cities studio, this project aims more than conserve the local natural & cultural landscape, but also take advantage of such uniqueness as local reflection to regional urban transformation context rather than following a tabula rasa pattern as current plan. The design & research exploration of this project is centred on the interpretation of Dutch Layer Approach model. From the inspiration of recognizing landscape’s values and integrating them with infrastructure and urban occupation layers, the proposed strategies and design guidelines proceed in reading natural & cultural landscape characters in specific site context, and also correlate such local advantages with regional urban transformation demand, with the consideration of dynamic future changes in both social-economic and environmental aspects. Through such design & research process on specific content, the exploration of integrating landscape into urbanism could be forward with more concrete definition on both spatial strategies and also retrospection on decision-making process, which directs to practical actions. What’s more, the process of answering how to integrating landscape as main research question actually lead to boarder research questions considering on the urban-rural transformation process in China, the recalling of cultural landscape values in China’s rural living & production pattern and thinking on the complexity of urban-landscape metabolism system.","infrastructural landscape; landscape urbanism; urban-rural transition; China","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-14","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

The qualities of the location are not efficiently used. The “green finger” is interrupted with the office area, where a lot of building are vacant because of the crisis. The location does not have good conditions for dwelling, because of noise, mono-functionality and isolation. For these reasons, the challenges posed to the design are: incorporation of housing in mono-functional district and definition of the program with activities for the new coming dwellers, which will make the area pleasant to live. In this way, the Teleport can be potentially transformed from the mono-functional district into a new self-sufficient city centre, strongly related to whole Amsterdam town, located in its “green finger”. The intention of my design was the integration of station with the residential part of the project. The aim was to break the border between the public and private and provide more gradient between these spaces. In this way, the dwellers reach their houses passing from the big public square in front of the station, through the smaller square, then the collective, but open to public square and the closed collective space in the atriums. The typology of atrium also helps in achieving the gradient between public and private. The atrium balances the built and unbuilt space and provides shelter from noise, wind pollution and stimulates social interaction.","hub; station; tranportation; communication; Amsterdam; Sloterdijk; Teleport; public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture & Dwelling","","","",""

In the design project, I wanted to create a certain flexibility in the dwellings. However, climate and structural issues ask for expensive and complex solutions, which are not likely to be applied and/or used in every day practice. Therefore, I “limited” the flexibility to a fixed zone and a service zone, where the service zone allows for flexibility. The fixed zone makes the building stable and strong (prefab concrete load bearing walls with precast plate flooring, whereas the service zone provides flexibility by using a Slimline+floor with a lowered ceiling. In this zone pipes and wires come together to two shafts. In this way, the basic envelope of one dwelling allows for stacking this envelope into row houses, maisonettes or separate maisonettes. By also placing a steel lintel in the prefabricated load bearing walls, openings/passages can be made through the dwellings on horizontal level, allowing for horizontal linking.","dwelling; flexible; closed building block","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-27","Architecture","Architecture & Dwelling","","At Home in the City: Amsterdam","",""

(mentor); Stouten, P.L.M. (mentor)","2013","This study fundamentally intends to reflect the process of urban renewal during the period 1974-1993, based on the principle of ‘Building for the neighbourhood'.This was aimed at improving housing quality,living condition and providing affordable social housings to low-income groups.That is to say that not only enhancing physical conditions but also lessening economic and social inequalities were a main objective of this principle. With changing contexts, this principle had left the many critics and was replaced by a new concept, called ‘urban regeneration’ since 1990s.A main failing of ‘Building for the neighbourhood’ did not meet the sustainable development despite of a success of the qualitative improvements. For instance, housing standards and environmental quality brought social obsolecence in the end according to the research. Oude Westen, for instance is a representative neighbourhood, applied to the principle of ‘Building for the neighbourhood’. This was a typical pre-war residential neighbourhood with 14.365 inhabitants, mostly from the working class. During the completion of urban renewal, an area-based, step by step rehabilitation strategy with reconstruction and renovation piece by piece was undertaken instead of wholesale demolition and a new construction.This was so local residents could continue to stay in same neighbourhood without displacement in the process. In terms of physical change, more outdoor space(public and collective) with public/commercial facilities were created in the old urban fabric. Over the last decades after completion of urban renewal, this neighbourhood has had problems in terms of physical and socio-economic aspects.According to analytical and exploratory research by author, some spatial problems could be found to interfere with the sustainable urban environment for living. First of all, a lack of connectivity regarding physical and socio-economic aspects to the surroundings is an obstacle to have a strong agglomeration at the district level. Secondly, in the neighbourhood itself, there is a series of public spaces created during completion of urban renewal that are not attractive and there is a deficiency of permeability because of the isolation of functional network and monotonous ground-floor frontages of buildings. As a consequence of the neglect for car parking in the early stage of urban renewal, Oude Westen as a high-dense neighbourhood inevitably has a problem of car parking. Lastly, a lack of diversity in housing typologies has led a number of local inhabitants to leave to a other neighbourhoods within the city. In addition, there are ongoing strategic urban developments, with Oude Westen is adjacent to such as a new central station of Rotterdam, many new offices and business and huge public space(Kruisplein) will enforce Oude Westen to become a part of central district in near future. Driven by the research, the design interventions show a possible scenario for Oude Westen in the future to enhance a built environment for living. Furthermore, this would be a sustainable transformation to connect the side with the city centre. In the end, the research and design proposal as mentioned before can be reflected in another case of neighbourhoods where urban renewal has taken place in major cities in the Netherlands. From the study, therefore, the findings have social and scientific relevance for offer similar neighbourhoods in the Netherlands.","Urban Regeneration; Urban Transformation; Reurbanisation; Rotterdam; Building for the neighbourhood; Oude Westen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban regeneration in the European context","",""

(mentor)","2013","Broadcasting by flooding is one of the most fundamental services for both wired and wireless networks. This also includes several sensor network applications that use broadcasting to spread information from one sensor node to the other sensor nodes in the entire sensor network. These wireless sensor networks have certain characteristics such as limited power and battery driven. However the simple flooding mechanism causes lots of duplicated packets and consumes a lot of resources. In view of these constraints, the broadcasting service should reduce redundant transmissions such that energy conservation is obtained since the devices within a wireless sensor network have limited battery power. Since it is not necessary for each sensor node to be active all the time a more sophisticated method might be introduced to flood an entire network and the other side is more efficient. In this work, an asynchronous sleep scheduling is proposed by an adapted duty cycle for each sensor where the duty cycle is based on the RSS based density estimation for each sensor node. By using the proposed duty cycle the reachability is compared with that of the fixed duty cycle and the adapted duty cycle by using neighborhood discovery density estimation model. The results show that the reachability of the network with an adapted duty cycle in combination with RSS based density estimation is two times more than that of the neighborhood density estimation in a 100m x 100m WSN of 200 sensor nodes. Further the results show the reachability is as good as in the case of the 90% fixed duty cycle but is more energy efficient.","WSN; density estimation; sleep scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

Om deze problemen aan te pakken is er door de toenmalige Minister Vogelaar voor Wonen, Wijken en Integratie (WWI) een beleid ontwikkeld met een fysieke, sociale en economische pijler. Hierbij worden meerdere wijkproblemen die elkaar versterken integraal aangepakt (PBL, 2010). Doordat de focus met name op de fysieke en sociale knelpunten heeft gelegen is hier relatief veel over bekend (Aalders, et al., 2008), dit in tegenstelling tot de economische pijler. ‘De rol van de bestaande wijkeconomie voor verbetering van de leefbaarheid in de wijken blijft hierin echter onderbelicht. En dat terwijl ondernemers een flinke bijdrage kunnen leveren aan deze leefbaarheid’ (Aalders, et al., 2008: p. 3). Door het ondernemerschap onder bewoners te stimuleren is het mogelijk om daarmee ook de leefbaarheid te vergroten. Door het ondernemerschap in de wijk zichtbaar te maken kan het een voorbeeldfunctie krijgen voor de bewoners. Er blijkt namelijk dat in een stedelijke omgeving waar veel kleine bedrijven zijn gevestigd lokaal ook meer ondernemers starten: zien werken, doet werken (Ministerie van Economische Zaken, 2010).

In order to address this question the first section aims to develop a framework in order to understand and describe informal development in Shenzhen. The spatial research translates this framework into spatial language. The final section the spatial is used as the basis for a number of strategies. Informal development is not a singular development, but can be understood from different perspectives. The poverty, legal, cultural and dualistic perspective coexists next to each other. The perspectives on informality inform the main stakeholders and by their decisions they shape the development of the village. As the village transforms, so does the floating population as they become urbanites. Informal development will go through a fixed set of phases in which informal economic opportunity will firstly increase and then decrease again. the goal is to achieve an situation in which integration is optimal. Existing approaches combine different elements of informality. The Chinese approach has failed to deal with multiple aspects of informality and thus deliver a comprehensive approach to integrate informal development The informal development in Shenzhen can be viewed from different theoretical perspectives. Each perspective reveals different elements to be of importance to the inclusion of migrants and integration of the village. The informal network is historically grown under the impact of the landscape, Chinese perception of the build environment and informal growth. Through the informal growth process, an ‘interior’ space was created between different neighborhoods that act as the main urban space of the village. The ability of the informal network to include migrants differs. The integrative quality of the village can be described in terms of its embeddedness in the regional structure and the quality of the interior space. The quality of this space can be described in terms of the surrounding fabric, the edge and the functions. When the empirical data from the spatial research is applied to the theoretical framework, the villages in Guangming can be categorized in five different developmental stages. The spatial distribution of the different village types follows a logic that can be explained using the informative framework. The five village types form the basis for the regional development proposal. The current interaction between informal and formal process creates an undesirable path towards decline of informal opportunities in the villages. Based on the five village types and the historic sequence of networks, a integrative carrying structure is proposed for the region. This structure has five layers which are discussed separately. Each stage is differently located in the territory and requires different formal and informal interventions to optimize the social inclusion of the migrants.","urban village; Shenzhen; informal development; spatial integration; floating population; migrants","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-26","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

(mentor); Hegyi, A. (mentor)","2013","Traffic congestion leads to significant economic and environmental costs. Currently, we can reduce congestion using infrastructure based systems, such as ramp metering installations and variable speed limits. However, we see more and more in-vehicle technologies which have the potential of replacing infrastructure based technologies. Therefore, in the future we will be able to reduce congestion by controlling individual vehicles using cooperative systems based control strategies. In this thesis we will develop a cooperative systems based control strategy to resolve a moving jam near an on-ramp. This strategy determines the number of vehicles that should be speed limited to resolve a moving jam with respect to a certain ramp metering rate. Additionally, vehicles are speed limited to realize a stable traffic flow once the moving jam has been resolved. The control strategy is evaluated using a simulation of traffic on a one-lane freeway on which all vehicles are equipped with ideal cooperative systems. The most important findings of this research are: (1) that a moving jam near a metered on-ramp can be resolved, thus resulting in an improvement of the throughput, and (2) that the most optimal throughput improvement is achieved when choosing a ramp metering rate which is as low as possible. The control strategy is one of the first integrations of ramp metering and variable speed limits for cooperative systems which can reduce congestion. However, before this system can be implemented in practice, the control system has to be able to deal with more complex traffic networks and non-ideal cooperative systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","As a useful tool in understanding the coastal behaviours, one-line models , which are designed to simulate the long-term shoreline evolution in response to imposed wave conditions, coastal structures, and other engineering activities such as beach nourishment, have been developed and applied to a wide range of projects in coastal engineering and management. However, most of them are deterministic and not probabilistic, the model performance is associated with presumed uncertainty due to the high quality input data required and the large number of processes involved in reality but which are simplified in the one-line theory. In the past, the assessment of model performance has usually been a subjective judgement of goodness of fit, which depends on researchers’ expertise and experience by comparing prediction with observation. This dissertation study aims to find a method of evaluating the performance of one-line models such as BEACHPLAN, so as to qualify the model accuracy in an objective way. To measure the skill of a model, uncertainty, optimization and sensitivity modelling of beach behaviour related parameters, such as shoreline orientation, wave climates, etc., are investigated, which provide acknowledge of shoreline response to variable input data. Four error analysis methods: correlation, shoreline movement, probabilistic and distortion length, are employed to quantify the model errors. Applied to a set of proposed criteria-Model Performance Rating System (MPRS), error indicators of these four approaches are ranked so that the best-fit input parameter/model performance can be identified. The adapted assessment method is tested on a ‘‘log-spiral’’ shaped shoreline of Poole Bay, UK. Additionally, shoreline orientation is addressed in this dissertation study, which is critical in shoreline evolution analysis. The results show that the methods are able to evaluate the model performance and select the best match. The significance of the method adapted in this research is quantifying and reducing the model uncertainty and establishing model reliability. In the future, more validations with other numerical models are needed before it can be recognized as a sophisticated assessment method.","uncertainty; model performance; assessment; shoreline evolution; one-line model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM Programme","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2013","The Project Experiencing gorillas in the cloud is a graduation project that aims ‘to create a product for the Apenheul that enhances the user experience of a visit to the park using sensor data’. In Apenheul a network of sensors has been placed around the gorilla island, constantly gathering data about the gorillas. Gorillas In the Cloud was created by TNO and Apenheul and other partners with the goal to stimulate innovation. The island of the gorillas serves as a sensor network field lab where professionals can test their sensor hardware and software on a live ‘human like’ environment. It offers TNO the opportunity to conduct research and to test and develop technologies with (new) research partners. It offers Apenheul the opportunity to differentiate their zoo through new and unique products affecting user experience, marketing and primate knowledge. In this thesis a description is given of the technology applied, of the users of the park Apenheul and of the design explorations made. One concept has been further developed. Its use is described via scenarios and the designed interactions and interface have been tested with an interactive prototype. Conclusions and recommendations about ‘how to experience gorillas in the cloud’ are given. The brief A product has to be designed that uses sensor data to create a rich and meaningful user experience for the visitors of Apenheul. The design targets families with young children. TNO wants to raise awareness about their (sensor) technology in order to interest business partners for collaboration. Apenheul received almost 500.000 visitors last year, who could have been potential users of the technology. Currently there are no products yet with which visitors can experience what GITC means and how it works. Products have to be developed that demonstrate the capabilities of the installed sensor network while giving Apenheul and their visitors extra value. People visit Apenheul to see animals and to have a fun day out. The product has to provide the right user experience in order to accommodate visitors during their journey. This graduation assignment explores products that make use of the data captured by current and future sensor technology installed in Apenheul. The approach The Network Focused Design (NFD) approach was chosen because it was developed to create networked products with digital content. NFD has been applied on this design case and has been evaluatated through summarizing the learnings of the design process. The approach introduces three key terms; data, touchpoints and metadata. During the whole process the skills and approaches thaught at the Design For Interaction (DFI) masters programme were used. A technology study mapped the relevant and applicable technologies and trends that are applied and that could be applied in this project. A user centered design approach was chosen to create designs meaningful to the visitors. User centered design aims to map needs and wishes of end users and to create products that are meaningful to those users. User research was performed in order to map the aspirations, needs and wishes of Apenheul visitors. The research has generated insights which have been used as requirements for the design process. The user studies were done in a qualitative, quick and iterative way to quickly gather important insights. The studies were focused on collecting valuable insights for the design phase. The design The design goal of this assignment was “To create a product in the park of Apenheul that enhances a 7 year old child's user experience during his/her visit to the park using data from the GITC sensor system”, while providing an engaging, educating, involving, fun, bonding, relating and reflecting user experience. The design explorations resulted in 130 sketches, 25 ideas 6 concepts and 1 product prototype. The gorilla mirror concept, based on the skeleton tracking principle of the Microsoft Kinect, has been prototyped and tested. During the design phases the possible data, touchpoints and metadata available and applicable in this project have been mapped and put in sheets. Test results User testing with children was done to evaluate the product prototype and the interactions. The tests indicate that children enjoy the product and that the product would be feasible for implementation in the park. First a number of issues resulting from the test would have to be solved and a redesign has to be developed. Conclusions The designed product meets the formulated requirements and can be placed in Apenheul to make GITC experiential. Recommendations Placing a number of interactive installations in Apenheul would communicate the efforts of the gorillas in the cloud project while enhancing the visitor experience. Once gorillas in the cloud is experiential, the technology and the learnings can be applied for other customers and other markets.","user experience design; meta products; innovative zoos; sensor systems; data communication; usability testing; interactive prototyping; motion controlled interfaces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Mor, A.R. (mentor)","2013","Power transformers are inseparable parts of the power system and the tap changer is an equally necessary part of the transformer. In order to keep the availability of power systems high, the reliability of the transformers must be improved. This can be done by improving the reliability of the tap changer, as tap changer failures are the cause for the majority of the power transformer failures. This thesis focuses on the development of acoustic diagnostics of tap changers and the tap changer that is investigated for defects in this thesis is the selector switch type tap changer. The reason for choosing acoustic diagnostics is that this is a method which can be used online and can be used with the least disturbance to the normal operation of the power transformer. Special emphasis has been laid on recreating the arcing conditions in the tap changer. Arcing inside the tap changer chamber is unavoidable but excessive arcing leads to a multitude of problems, so efforts have been made to acoustically detect the arcing phenomenon. In order to have both flexibility and control over the experimental parameters, the experiments in the following chapters are conducted on three sets of test objects. Furthermore, the type of defects that pose the most imminent threat to the operation of the tap changer are focused upon and the most appropriate methods of signal acquisition and processing are determined for these experimental setups.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

(mentor); Paarlberg, A.J. (mentor); Havinga, H. (mentor); Roosjen, R. (mentor); Ottevanger, W. (mentor)","2013","Large-scale river projects are executed on the Dutch rivers to meet increased flood conveyance standards. Because the projects bring variation to the standardised river profile, they are expected to induce increased river dynamics. The consequences are higher dredging costs and more disruption to inland navigation. All river intervention plans have been optimised to meet the dredging guidelines of Rijkswaterstaat, but it is important not to look at just the cumulative effect of individual projects but also at the combined effect. Furthermore, the dredging volumes are calculated in a deterministic way: the river discharge is simulated by means of a single representative yearly hydrograph that is repeated for every year in the simulation. The uncertainties in dredging volumes in time and in space are not known this way. Understanding the stochastic response of the required dredging can help the river manager better attend the hindrance for inland navigation. It will help the river manager to decide where and how to interfere in the river system. This study is conducted to determine the increase and uncertainty of the dredging demand on the Waal River, before and after the execution of the Room for the River programme. Numerical calculations with a 2D depth averaged Delft3D model are executed to determine the dredging effort and navigability. To include uncertainty in the model response a Monte Carlo Simulation is performed with discharge variation on the upstream boundary. The simulations conducted in this study show that the increase in dredging is less than can be expected based on the impact assessment studies of the individual river intervention works in the Room for the River programme which stresses the need for integrated impact assessment. The stochastic approach shows that the increase is relatively small compared to the uncertainty in dredging, but nevertheless significant, because considerable increases are predicted at locations that are already heavily dredged. The simulations shows that the dredging capacity on the Waal is insufficient to handle sudden large dredging peaks. If a flood event on the Waal is followed by a rapid fall of the discharge this leads to disruption to navigation for long periods of time. These peaks would require an unrealistically large dredging capacity so river management will have to consider structural measures to reduce the dredging effort, or to accept a lower quality of navigation. Structural measures are expensive and it is therefore illogical to try to mitigate all dredging work by structural measures. The dredging demand is not distributed evenly along the river: It is almost permanent at some locations and more sporadic at others. Locations that show structural dredging can be considered for locations to execute structural measures. Such location are predominantly found on the large river bends in the Boven-Waal. The information acquired from in this study can be used to develop mitigating measures to limit the maintenance dredging effort and the hindrance for navigability. In designing measures to mitigate the dredging effort, an emphasis should be put on more sustainable ways to maintain the river; The lay-out of the Dutch river system should be designed in such way that it keeps itself navigable. The results of the simulations put the use of a single representative hydrograph up for discussion. The hydrograph in the deterministic calculations is yearly repeated, so the natural yearly variance is not taken into account and the results of the deterministic method are also not representative for the Monte Carlo Simulation.. Information acquired from the Monte Carlo Simulations can be used to develop better representative hydrographs; The hydrograph needs to be as detailed as possible to better simulate reality.","dredging; Waal; Monte Carlo Simulation; room for the River; discharge variation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Rodrigo, A.M. (mentor)","2013","During the last 50 years electricity demand has significantly increased. Large amounts of electricity are transported from the generation to the consumption sites. Overhead lines or underground cables are used to transport the required energy. High voltage levels are used to reduce the transmission losses. Power transformers are responsible for linking the different voltage levels. In addition, power transformers must regulate the voltage of the electricity grid when needed. To achieve the regulation of the voltage, power transformers are equipped with on-load tap changers (OLTC). The winding of the transformer is equipped with tapped windings. The function of the tap changer is to adjust the output voltage of the power transformer by selecting the different tapped windings and without interrupting the load current. Different OLTC technologies are used in the market. The most commonly used technology of the last 50-60 years is the conventional oil type OLTC (OILTAP). In the last few years, time based maintenance is systematically being replaced by condition based maintenance. Condition based maintenance aims to reduce the costs that are associated with the maintenance of high voltage equipment and prevent possible failures. On-load tap changers constitute a vulnerable part of the power transformer and there is a number of power transformer failures attributed to OLTC failures. Diagnostic tools are used to assess the condition of tap changers. The condition assessment of the tap changer leads to a decision about the appropriate maintenance. This thesis investigates the possibility of a new diagnostic tool for on-load tap changers based on partial discharge (PD) measurements. The research project focuses on the major insulation defects that could hamper the operation of on-load tap changers. The differences between PD activity in star and delta connected tap changers are also investigated in this thesis. The conditions that are present in on-load tap changers are initially modeled by the use of small scale set ups. Signature PD patterns associated with the major insulation defects are obtained from the small scale set up. In addition, PD measurements are also performed in a small, single phase tap changer and in a large three phase, star connected tap changer. The main purpose of this research project is to investigate the applicability of PD measurements as a diagnostic tool to assess the condition of the insulation of on-load tap changers.","on-load tap changer; OLTC; diagnostic system; condition based maintenance; partial discharge; HFCT sensors; PD measurements; electrical detection; surface discharges; sracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

(mentor); Quist, W. (mentor); Zijlstra, H. (mentor); Teeuw, P. (mentor)","2013","The urban and dwelling development of Bos en Lommer district, at the time of its realisation, was aiming at attracting people in order to offer them better living conditions. Nowadays, the area has become dull and resembles in many spots an abandoned place, mainly because of separation between the different ethnic or social groups who reside it. In my opinion, social problems are more than eminent in the South Kolenkitbuurt. Such impression was formed after several visits to the site as well as extensive insight to relevant research material. At first sight, outdoor space, once intended to be “ideal”, became unlovely and decaying. That is mainly because the population this development was meant for, has changed gradually and the built environment does not satisfy the needs of current society as was in the past. By looking thoroughly into the demands of people who currently reside in the neighbourhood is the key to create a suitable environment which will aim at satisfying their living needs. Apt design can stipulate the progress of social engagement, improve relation between neighbours and upgrade social structure. Political, economic and social issues of the time the neighbourhood was created were radically different compared to the current situation. Bos en Lommer in general was designed for a society which had passed through severe difficulties, survived through wartimes and eventually started to build up their country with an inspiration and belief in a better future. It consisted mostly of native Dutch families. During time, the reality changed and immigrants from different countries flooded the area. They were mainly poor, less educated representatives of different ethnicities, with different cultural and religion backgrounds seeking for a better future. Soon, representatives of the same or different ethnical groups followed, resulting in creation of social groups with difficulty or questionable willing to engage in the existing social tissue (main reasons were language barrier, cultural differences with the natives etc). At the same time native Dutch residents of relativelly higher living standards left the neighbourhood being replaced by immigrants. Simultaneously, the built environment has been gradually deteriorating due to lack of maintenance by housing corporations and municipality. Today, South Kolenkitbuurt presents a morally and physically outdated image and except for future plans regarding extensive demolitions and rebuilts nothing seems promising in terms of interventions on the current built environment. Finally, taking into consideration Eisenman’s phrase “I don’t think architecture is about solving human problems at all”, scope of the final design is to create such living conditions that will adapt more accuratelly to the needs of the residents and overall promote liveability in the neighbourhood.","regeneration; sustainable refurbishment; retrofit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-30","Architecture","RMIT","","","",""

The model is calibrated using the available data. The model results were found to be in good agreement with the collected data. The results show a high bed resistance value which is due to the vegetation and possible ice content in the sediment layer. In the second part of the research, the hydrodynamic conditions for a more recent time frame are presented for which the sediment transport pattern is also predicted. A sensitivity analysis of the sediment transport is presented for the following parameters: grain size diameter, importance of waves and importance of model formulations. The sensitivity analysis shows that the waves are of primary importance compared to tidal currents. The sensitivity of results to variation in sediment grain size are also discussed.

Subsequently, a state-of-the-art is provided in order to understand the relevance of addressing the underlying conflict at this point in time, from a regional planning perspective. Based on this preliminary analysis, a hypothesis regarding regional development as a risk management strategy for the community at the Galeras region is provided. With reference to this hypothesis, the general approach of this Master’s thesis is outlined by, integrating concepts of participation, risk management, regional planning and urban design. The regional strategy compresses several urban and regional projects at lower scales. These provide both safety in case of volcanic eruptions, and growth opportunities for the urban communities settled on this territory. Specifically, a set of four premises will be the core of the decisions: Land has a social value higher than its economic value; Life preservation is a shared goal for all parts involved; there is a local culture that has evolved in this specific territory and needs to be preserved; and there is a constitutional and democratic framework that can provide useful tools for this specific case. From these premises, two regional conclusions are key outcomes of this thesis: A preliminary risk analysis as a proposed further step from the current Volcanic Threat Map (INGEOMINAS 1997) and a regional development strategy for the Galeras Region (Pasto, Nariño and Florida). Furthermore, one project has been chosen to detail to evaluate the effectiveness of the regional development strategy: The proposal of a piecemeal growth strategy for the village of Genoy as an alternative to the human resettlement policy proposed by the government (part the emergency measures outlined in 2003). In this case, community blames the national government’s emergency measures as the main cause of social conflict and impoverishment at the local community. The methodology implemented combines the methodology suggested by the Design as Politics 2012-2013 studio, and urban planning techniques such as stakeholder analysis, spatial analysis and research by design. At the end, an evaluation model to assess these proposals, together with a reflection on how the goals set at the beginning of the project were achieved.","risk management; regional development; volcanic threat; piecemeal growth; participatory strategies; Galeras volcano; Colombia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-25","Architecture","Urbanism","","Design as Politics","",""

Most of the central business districts of major cities are no longer welcoming to a pedestrian; with buildings shutting down their ground level to the passersby; leaving nothing for them to look at or engage with. The office building typology including high-rise towers which are filling up the cities for the last few decades have destroyed much of the original spirit of the European cities. The design challenge is to approach these problems and develop a design which can integrate with its context while bringing new life and activities to the street and also deal with the issues of architectural form and identity.","highrise building; mixed use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","TALL Studio (Vertical cities Europe)","",""

The research provides evidence for the assumption of literature that peers are better able compared to the governmental regulator to interpret information of each other. However, this thesis argues that this not necessarily decreases the information asymmetry in the regulatory relation.

Research was divided into theoretical and practical part. In the first one, mostly, literature was studied, where in the second one, nine interviews were made with the residents of the city Ljubljana. A notion ‘the sense of neighborhood’ was realized as a crucial point in connecting inhabitants in the neighborhood. Further more, it has contained two sub-notions, interactions in and identity of the built environment. A list of characteristics of built environment was collected, firstly, encouraging interaction and secondly, strengthening identity.

(mentor); Qu, L. (mentor)","2013","During the industrialization process early in 20th century in most of Chinese cities, heavy industries with contamination were initially located in city periphery when they were founded. But nowadays, these industrial areas gradually became part of urban area due to the rapid and large-scale urbanization and city expansion. Since late in the 20th century, with decline of heavy industries and traditional manufacturing, there has been increasing number of derelict industrial areas with great potentials to be redeveloped and integrated into the city. As for these industrial dereliction, the typical development mode in China is to demolish and then rebuild to maximize the profit of government and developers. However, this development mode may cause many negative gentrification effects and target only on certain groups of people, while the demands from the general public are being neglected. Therefore, it has been becoming an urgent need to come up with a collection of strategies both on city and local scales to tackle with this issue. The site chosen for the project is the former Capital Steel Complex, known as the Shougang Group, which was the largest and most important steel production complex in Beijing. It has witnessed the history of heavy industry development in China since it was founded in 1919, and enormous contribution to the city development was made by this huge company which has been functioning as the pillar of local economy. Due to city image and environmental concern, the industrial complex has been reducing production until it completely halted in 2010, which indicate the end of a grand age of this steel industrial area, leaving a 8km2 industrial dereliction with heritage value and huge potential for redevelopment in a strategic location in western Beijing. The objective is to develop a collection of strategies for redeveloping this site that will balance the preservation of industrial heritage and implementation of new urban functions in a ecological way, and at the same time meet the emerging demands both from city and local perspectives. This will be realized by creating a new centrality in the site identified as the CRD (Cultural & Recreational District)- expectation from government. The approach is culture-led regeneration in this large brownfield, namely, culture will be catalyst for new development and generate new economy related to culture and creative industries. During the regeneration process, the concept of positive gentrification will be introduced to guarantee the benefit of public, promoting social equality in this decaying area in problematic condition left by post-industrialism.","industrial heritage; culture-led regeneration; ecological renewal; adaptive re-use; new urban centrality; social equality; positive gentrification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-25","Architecture","Urbanism","","Graduation Studio Urban Regeneration","",""

The new country received assistance from the international community to set up a new government, but in the built environment anarchy continues. After the war there was no enforcement of planning and building regulations in the capital city of Prishtina. It was impossible to get drawings approved and according to some this situation has not changed much till today. In Prishtina, new constructions have been interwoven with the old ottoman city fabric. Due to the period when no municipality regulated construction in the city the spatial characteristics are the result of individual initiatives. The left over public space in the city is characterized by the stitching together of elements: Old and new, high rise and one storey, Ottoman era constructions and modern buildings. The public space is experienced as a patchwork, stitched space in which seemingly random elements exist side by side. This logic is interpreted into a design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-30","Architecture","Architecture","","Border Conditions and Territories","",""

(mentor); Bakker, C.A. (mentor)","2013","The introduction of LED lighting drastically increased the technical lifespan of lighting products. Furthermore the small dimensions of LED modules offers new design possibilities that can be seen in the current trend of designing embedded LED luminaires. In these luminaires the LED modules are fully integrated into the fixture body. In the Netherlands product lifetimes are declining (Huisman et al. 2013). LED modules have a general functional life expectancy up to 30 years. The difference in lifespans can lead to a mismatch between the ‘psychological product lifetime’ and the ‘physical product lifetime’. This in return can result in the disposal of still functioning luminaires, since they are disposed of based on emotional reasons. The assignment to explore options to extend the psychological lifetime of LED luminaires through design was set out by Royal Philips. Possibilities to extend the lifetime of the product on emotional grounds have been explored by comparing the constructs ‘emotional durability’ as described by Chapman (2003, 2008) and ‘product attachment’ as discussed by Mugge (2007), Schifferstijn and Zwartkruis-Pelgrim (2008), Savas (2004) and Schulz et al. (1989). ‘Emotionally durable design’ is about designing things we would cherish and keep, rather than throw away. Product attachment is defined as the strength of the emotional bond a consumer experiences with a specific product (Schifferstein and Zwartkruis-Pelgrim, 2008). Comparing these constructs resulted in adapting Mugge’s (2007) description of ‘product attachment’ through the determinants: pleasure, group-affiliation, self-expression and memory. Four of the five salient issues of emotional durability that are summed up by Chapman (2008): narrative, surface, fiction and consciousness can be assigned to the different attachment determinants found by Mugge (2007). The issue detachment, the fifth salient issue of emotional durability according to Chapman (2008), was not seen as helpful from a design perspective and therefore omitted inspiration for design. An immersive context study was carried out to determine which of the strategies for long-term attachment are most worthwhile to explore in more detail. The strong link between cosiness, homeliness and life made it interesting to gain more in-depth insight in the design of lifelike luminaires. Designing lifelike products is mentioned as design for ‘consciousness’ (Chapman, 2008) or design for ‘animacy’ by searbeck, (2009). Seeing a product as animate¬¬ can stimulate the development of a bond between the product and its user. Literature indicates that these kinds of feelings towards products have a positive influence on the emotional lifespan of a product (Chandler and Schwarz, 2010). A literature and VIMEO survey to related work in the field of animate luminaires indicated that there is very few research presented about this type of luminaires in the domestic context. In order to obtain more knowledge about this topic it was decided to make use of a longitudinal study with a technical research probe. More insight concerning the design of animate luminaires was gained while (1) generating ideas and concepts for possible research probes; (2) while building the eventual research probe called ‘Ethos’; and (3) by using ‘Ethos’ in two studies. ‘Ethos’ is an interactive luminaire and has a mobile light source that was designed to express both curious and shy behaviour by responding to sound. A longitudinal user study was carried out to gain more insight in (1) how an animate luminaire is perceived by its user, (2) if the intended character of ‘Ethos’ was identified and (3) if perceiving a luminaire as animate could lead to enduring attachment. A second study based on a short movie featuring ‘Ethos’ was used to obtain more information about how people interpreted its behaviour. Based on the outcomes of both studies it is expected that the guidelines: form follows function; intimacy through ambiguity; using accessories that are normally associated with humans or animals; use human or animal like behavioural patterns; usage of rhythms that are typical to living creatures and make the product respond to its environment, can help people to perceive a product as animate. It is expected that animated luminaires can stimulate the product-person relationship, as argued by various authors (Chapman, 2008; Chandler and Schwarz, 2010; Sung, Guo, Grinter and Christensen, 2007), and help Philips to differentiate itself from its competitors.","emotionally durable design; product attachment; research probe; LED luminaire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Intergrated Product Design","",""

In this project, this area has an important role, both functional and metaphorical. The European Union knows a big gap between the people and the political power. The EU is democratic in theory, but in practice it seems very technocratic, with a very big distance between the people and the power. This gap also shows in the city of Brussels, where the European Quarter is like an island within the city center. Inhabitants of brussels do not visit the neighborhood, while the EU-workers do not leave the area. The decision to build a skyscraper as the new European Commission headquarters will only cause a bigger distance to the people. The skyscraper typology is based on efficient development, not on architectural quality. It's a typology that separates the interior from the urban context in a very rough way. Instead of creating larger barriers, the new EC building should instead be a connective element between the metaphorical people and power. To achieve this, the city is extended inside the building. A neighborhood-like urban structure is creating in the form of interior public space. Different themed zones of public functions are added to the building to create a mixture that will be both usefull for the EC-employees as for any other inhabitant or visitor of brussels. A vertical metro-system removes the barrier of going up into the building, by offering a capacity comparable to the urban metro running underneath the building, and makes the interior public space part of the city.","EU; Brussels; high rise; skyscraper; architecture; design; interior public","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Materialization - TALL VCE","",""

(mentor)","2013","In a traditional AC distribution system, the synchronous frequencies of the generators are coupled with the system frequency, and thus the diesel engines are kept at a constant speed. In a Dynamic Positioning (DP) vessel such as a Platform Supply Vessel (PSV), the diesel engines sometimes work at the partial load condition. The efficiency of constant-speed diesel engines during partial load condition is lower than that during full load condition. This dropped efficiency can be improved by the variable-speed operation of diesel engines. At the request of Damen Shipyards Group, a new onboard DC distribution system is designed in this thesis to achieve the efficiency improvement in the PSVs. In a DC distribution system, the variable-speed operation of diesel engines becomes feasible because of the frequency decoupling between the generators. The Power Management System (PMS) of the proposed DC system is designed as well to achieve the system voltage stability, improve the quality of power supply and enhance the system survivability. After the economic comparative studies are conducted between the DC and AC onboard distribution systems, it can be concluded that the DC distribution system has a better economic performance with a higher efficiency, especially in DP partial load situations.","DC Distribution System; Variable-speed Diesel Generator; Super-Capacitor; Boost Rectifier; Dynamic Positioning; PSCAD; Power Management System; QoS; Survivability; Voltage Stability; Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","(ESE) Electrical Sustainable Energy","","(EPS) Electrical Power Systems","",""

(mentor)","2013","The current need to reduce CO2 emission from power plant flue gas demands development of new and more energy efficient separation processes. Liquid crystals are a new class of solvents for CO2 absorption; making use of a solubility switch between two phases. Solubility of CO2 is higher in the isotropic liquid phase than in the structured liquid phase. Phase transition enthalpy between both phases is low and therefore CO2 capture with liquid crystals has the potential to consume less energy in an absorption/desorption cycle than conventional CO2 capture processes. Liquid crystals enable precombustion CO2 capture at high pressures, hence the capture process can be used for CO2 capture from syngas; gas mainly consisting of CO2 and H2. At this stage research is focused on ideal selectivity and especially on the solubility of CO2 in liquid crystals. Literature study is conducted on experimental phase behaviour of liquid crystal like structures to validate the Predictive Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state. The Predictive Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state is used to predict phase behaviour of different liquid crystals with H2 and CO2 to identify the most promising molecular structures, resulting in a selectivity analysis. In the Thermodynamics Laboratory (Process & Energy department, TU Delft) the binary mixtures of pentyl cyanobipenyl, heptyloxy cyanobiphenyl, ethyl propyl bicyclohexyl, propyl butyl bicyclohexyl, hexyloxybenzylidene aminobenzonitrile and phenyl cyclohexyl with CO2, and the binary mixtures of ethyl propyl bicyclohexyl, phenyl cyclohexyl and heptyloxy cyanobiphenyl with H2 are measured using a Cailletet setup. Henry coefficients obtained from the experimental data indicate the solubility of the different structures. Accuracy of the bubblepoint curve prediction by the Predictive Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state is higher for small molecular structures at relatively low temperatures. The vapour liquid equilibrium prediction has larger deviations for binary mixtures with acetate structures in combination with CO2 and for all binary mixtures with H2; however the bubblepoint curve order is maintained in the vapour liquid equilibrium prediction. The Predictive Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state simulation predicts that highest solubility for both CO2 and H2 with bicyclohexyl based structures and the lowest with biphenyl based structures. From the Predictive Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state simulation it is found that more polar structures increase the solubility of both CO2 and H2. The experimental results measured in the Cailletet setup underline the predictions made with the PSRK simulation and demonstrate that weakly polar structures (PCH-type) have a higher solubility of CO2. Highly polar structures (7OCB) are also demonstrating high solubility of CO2 in the Predictive Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state simulation and experiments. Simulation of the experimental liquid crystals with the Predictive Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state shows prediction of bicyclohexyl structures phase behaviour is more accurate than predicting phase behaviour of biphenyl and cyclohexylbenzene based structures.","CO2 capture; syngas; liquid crystals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","P&E","","ETh","",""

(mentor); De Ridder, H. (mentor); Dadlani, P. (mentor)","2013","Philips Research has started an extensive program on developing healthcare innovations to support patients with cancer. This program contains several specific projects each dedicated to one specific type of cancer. The program responds to the trend of personalized care. More and more hospitals are aware of the positive effects of involving the patients in their treatment plan. Clinicians react positively to this innovation and conclude that taking the patient’s preferences, quality of life (QOL), physical- and mental status into account will result in a care improvement. The first project within this healthcare innovation program is running already and is focused on prostate cancer. Recently, a second project has been started aiming at breast cancer. This graduation assignment belongs to this second project and concerns ways to increase the patients’ involvement in defining their treatment plan. Literature indicates breast cancer is the most common type of cancer for women. The Netherlands indicates 12.500 women who were detected with breast cancer in 2011. This number is slowly rising. Currently, it affects 1 out of 8 women in the Netherlands. The current situation shows a need for care improvement. Designing a tool that supports breast cancer patients during their pathway requires knowledge about the medical aspects of breast cancer and knowledge about the experiences of the patients and medical staff. The researched areas of this theoretical study are based on an explorative research. This explorative research was conducted to get familiar with the topic breast cancer. Literature indicated that patients experience a higher satisfaction about their pathway when they experienced a high involvement. The underlying aspects that support statement are the feeling of control, empowerment. Another indicator that influences the satisfaction rate of the patient is the quality of relationship with the medical staff. A user study was set to gain more knowledge from the real-life situation. Multiple viewpoints are addressed to gain knowledge about the patients’ and clinicians’ experiences that relate to the findings of the theoretical study. The goal of this study was: “Explore how the aspects satisfaction, involvement, control, empowerment and communication relate to each other for breast cancer patients”. The used methods for this user study contain interview sessions and observations. Results of this user study are mapped in a Patient Experience Map. The map indicates four design directions that state when the patient needs to be supported, which consist of the diagnosis phase, decision-making phase, chemo therapy and recovery. In addition, the related touch points and needs can be found in this Patient Experience Map. Design specifications were based on knowledge from the theoretical study, explorative research and user study. These design specifications were used to validate ideas and concepts. An individual design vision for the four design directions has been stated to provide focus for the ideation and conceptualization phase. The design visions differ due to different needs and circumstances. Design direction 1: Diagnosis Design goal: The design provides support by preparing and guiding the patient step-by-step while supporting the relationship with the mamma care nurse. Design direction 2: Decision-making Design goal: The design supports consultations by creating the ability to prepare, communicate preferences/QOL and increase assertive behavior. Design direction 3: Chemo therapy Design goal: The design supports bonding with the design while patients experience side effects by teaching to adjust to their new lifestyle while maintaining their relationship with the clinician and informing them about preferences/QOL. Design direction 4: Recovery Design goal: The design offers guidance when patients need to adjust to their new lifestyle by preparing them when taking preferences and QOL into account. A creative session and a brainstorm session resulted in a rich amount of ideas for the four earlier stated design directions. Feedback from experts on these ideas resulted in choosing one idea to continue with during the conceptualization phase. The design direction that was related to the diagnosis phase was selected based on feedback from experts that stated this design direction is the most valuable one because of its large influence on the following design directions. The chosen idea for this design direction consists out of two parts, which are preparation before the diagnosis and guidance during the day of diagnosis. The patient receives a login code that gives access to the website corresponding to the tool. Scheduled appointments are visualized and include practical information and elaborate information about the scheduled appointment. The patient receives an iPad when meeting the mama care nurse on the day of diagnosis, which should guide the patient during that day. Guidance is given by navigation, reminders, contact with the mama care nurse and the ability to take notes and read information about the treatment. The development of the chosen idea and design direction were explored during a structured brainstorm session. Participants of the brainstorm had different backgrounds which complemented the concept development. This session contained discussions about the flow, interaction and use of the concept. The brainstorm session resulted in wireframes for the interface of the tool that were based on earlier research and knowledge of the participants. The focus of the visualizations of the wireframe was on the pathway. This resulted in the fact that the user had a clear overview of the appointments. More information can be found when the patients taps on an appointment. Important aspects in the extension of this appointment were the practical information, elaborate information and a video about the treatment. Furthermore, menu buttons such as pathway, profile, messages and questions were designed to fulfill the patient’s needs. The profile page contained personal information and information about the patient’s preferences. The preferences are introduced during the diagnosis phase, because of the importance of filling out preferences during the decision-making phase. The message page contains an email service with the mama care team. The question page consists of frequently asked questions. Patients have the ability to add questions and type in their own answer. The goal is to stimulate assertive behavior. The answers will be checked by the mama care nurse. In this chapter, the wire frame from the previous chapter was used as a base to create visuals. First different styles were created, which resulted in choosing the one that had a good balance between a medical look and a feminine look. Next, a color study was performed. Based on the feedback from experts two colors are chosen to represent the two parts of the design concept, which is ‘preparing’ and ‘guiding’ the patient during the phase of diagnosis. The visuals were used to create an interactive PDF. This interactive PDF allowed the user to imagine how it would be once realized. This working prototype is used during the user test. The goal of the user test is to validate the concept to the earlier stated design goal, which was: “The design provides support by preparing and guiding the patient step-by-step while supporting the relationship with the medical staff.” The user test was situated at the LUMC hospital and contained 12 participants consisting of 8 patients, 2 mama care nurses and 2 secretaries. Techniques such as Likert scale and ranking are used during this user test. Results of statistics, ranking, comments and final questions present positive feedback about the concept. Results indicate that the patient is more in control and involved during their preparation for the day of diagnosis by using the website. Having information presented step by step, originative from the hospital makes it more reliable and has a low threshold. Receiving this information from the mama care nurse increases their empowerment. Results from experts also indicate positive feedback on the aspects of control, empowerment, satisfaction and involvement. However, experts mention a tool cannot replace the value of personal contact. Results of the user test led to improvement of the visuals based on the flow and clarity of the tool. It was noticed that the tool has to be adaptive to different hospitals’ protocols. The patient has no access to additional treatments only a mammography is scheduled. Therefore, a link has been added to additional treatments from the scheduled appointment. The menu was found to be unclear. The menu options ‘messages’ and ‘questions’ confused participants. Participants had the need to take notes rater that the need for the standard prepared questions. The ability to take notes suits the different needs of the participants. Therefor this menu topic is changed. The content of the profile has been changed based on the confusion about the preferences and the need to know your mama care team. Therefore, the preferences are replaced by an overview of the mama care team. Participants mentioned that the ‘preferences’ will be significant during decision-making moments and they would like the mama care nurse to introduce the use of the ‘preferences’. A final important improvement was the addition of ear plugs. Participants mentioned they don’t want to be stigmatized as breast cancer patients when watching the videos on the tool. In addition, people in the waiting room are often quite. Therefore the participant prefers to listen using ear plugs.","breast cancer; treatment plan; support; involvement; satisfaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

These systems are often low-lying polder-belt canal systems, where many pumps are needed to meet different requirements regarding water quantity and quality. The control of a complex water system, consisting of continuous dynamics (evolution of water flow and levels) and discrete elements (e.g. barriers and pumps that are operated on or off) can be optimized using a so-called hybrid Model Predictive Controller. However, particularly the optimization of the combination of discrete and continuous elements requires extensive computational effort. Even with the ongoing increase in computational power, computational time remains an issue for the optimization of large hybrid systems in real-time control applications. Time Instant Optimization MPC has been proposed in literature as an alternative to the computationally more demanding Mixed Logical Dynamical models. TIO-MPC involves the optimization of a (a priori determined) number of time instants, which are the moments that a discrete variable changes its state. The rationale behind this approach is that in many cases, it is undesirable to have too many switching of controllers. This significantly reduces the amount of optimization variables, as the controller does not have to decide at every time step whether or not to switch the state of discrete variables. The latter would normally lead to a large combinatorial optimization problem. The contribution of this thesis is the extension of the current TIO-MPC in such a way that the time instants become continuous. This way, the gradient of the objective function can be derived. The gradient allows the use of efficient gradient-based solvers, which require a gradient vector of the objective function for finding an optimum. Furthermore, hybrid schemes including the optimization of time instants and standard MPC can easily be integrated. The analytical gradient of the objective function is derived by applying algorithmic differentiation in reverse mode. This way, the gradient of the objective function can be derived to machine precision at the computational costs of a single function evaluation. Another benefit of the use of algorithmic differentiation over finite differencing is the absence of a truncation error. Multiple TIO-MPC algorithms have been designed, and their performance has been tested using two test cases. Different performance indicators are defined and used to compare the results. The first test case involves the closed-loop simulation of a fictitious linear reservoir with one discrete control variable (pump) using two time instants. The second test case involves the pump scheduling of two continuous pumps, two discrete pumps and one a gate on a model of the Fivelingo boezem, an existing water system in the province of Groningen in the north of the Netherlands. For the latter, only open-loop simulations have been carried out using algorithms with a different number of time instants. For comparison, one continuous optimization was done. The gradient-based TIO-MPC algorithms are perfectly capable of optimizing both continuous and discrete elements, well within the allowed control time step. The computational time is correlated with the amount of iterations that is needed to converge to a solution. Therefore it cannot be said in advance which scheme is the quickest. A comparison of the different TIO-MPC algorithms used for the Fivelingo test case demonstrated that the use of more time instants generally leads to lower objective function values, indicating better control performance. The experiments also showed that the solution is likely to get stuck in (suboptimal) local minima if a user-supplied initial guess of the time instants is not given. Supplying a good initial guess or using a multi-start optimization procedure will potentially overcome this problem. The latter option is more realistic if one cannot come up with a good initial guess.","Gradient-based hybrid Model Predictive Control; MPC; Model Predictive Control; Time Instant Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-27","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Joshi, Y. (mentor)","2013","Current energy production is done in a way that cannot be sustained ultimately. Biomass is ideal as a sustainable alternative because it can be used in the existing energy infrastructure. For coal power plants verge grass is one of the products being considered for co-firing. The moisture content and its bioactivity currently prevent direct co-firing on a large scale. A very new and promising pre-treatment technique to counter this is wet torrefaction. Wet torrefaction does not evaporate the moisture, it allows a precise temperature and thus process control, high heat transfer and a combined washing out of unwanted salts. To predict the decomposition of verge grass during wet torrefaction a reaction model was set up. Hemicellulose and cellulose kinetic data was used from previous work on corn cob and pure cellulose. The model was tested with data from research on sugar maple wood meal decomposition. Wet torrefaction experiments showed that verge grass decomposes very rapidly in contrary to the model. Experiments done on xylan showed a very slow decomposition. Bagasse decomposition was very hard to monitor because very little decomposition products were detected. A possible explanation could be that grass is very young and thus has a low degree of polymerization. Xylan and bagasse on the other hand are already treated and therefore the toughest parts of the original material are being torrefied. Overall the biomass species had a very high solid mass loss. Verge grass and bagasse retained around 30% of the original mass and no solid residue was found with xylan. The solid fraction and liquid fraction that could be accounted for is lower than half of the original mass. Although additional tests are needed to accurately predict the decomposition of verge grass a design was made for a pre-treatment plant. This facility was regarded as a stand-alone facility and consists of several parallel CSTR’s and a heat exchanger. The needed calculations are performed to compare wet torrefaction with alternatives.","torrefaction; biomass; co-combustion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Van Heur, R.H.J.G. (mentor)","2013","Damen has grown to a worldwide market leader in tugs with their formula of designing and manufacturing standardized ships. One of the current developments is the change process from conventional product development with a project-oriented approach to a more configuration oriented development with a product oriented approach. From a demand to further improve the standardization concept, a graduation assignment was offered for the standardization of specifications of Azimuth Stern Drive (ASD) propelled tugs. A design part was added to fit the interests of both the company and the student, which lead to the following assignment: “Investigating the standardization of ASD Tugs and developing an exterior concept design proposal for future ASD Tug(s).” An introduction stage in the subject was started, where literature and specifications were reviewed and Design&Proposal (D&P) engineers consulted to gain general info on tugs, activities and its components. The environment of standardization within the company and the role of the different departments (stakeholders) was identified. Different levels of standardization were identified (ships, systems, components and process(es)), where the fourth level is the design process of the first three levels. First, it was decided to focus on standardization of the content, before the specifications could be standardized. The specification of a ship type is the description of components and systems. Therefore, an overview was made in order to compare the systems and components of the different ASD tugs. Since experience and naval knowledge were needed to identify which systems and components could be further standardized, it was decided to further focus on the fourth level of the process and leave the results with the D&P department. The stakeholders were interviewed to get an overview of the visions and opinions of the different departments. These visions and opinions were clustered in order to identify improvements for the optimization of standardization and a midreport was made that showed all the results so far. The conclusions showed that the current process of standardization was under exposed (among employees) and therefore not working to its full extent. To complete the overall picture on standardization, different (design) processes and standardization initiatives were mapped to create a communication tool for the standardization process within Damen. The map of the current standardization was be linked to the literature, in order to conclude with points of interest. This finalized the first part of the complete assignment. For the second part, the design part, a qualitative research was executed on the stakeholders preferences on exterior styling characteristics and a research paper was written. The results showed that the future tugs should look powerful, fearless, muscular, proud and rigid. The mast should look solid, strong, not be too hefty, but emit more composure than the current mast, which is too slim. These results were used as a basis for the ideation phase. Partly based on a current demand for a new redesign of the mast, it was decided to design within the current production possibilities of the different Damen Shipyards around the world. One of the points of interest of the first part of this thesis was an improvement cooperation and knowledge transfer between departments. Therefore, different people from different departments where involved to design in the style of the current and the most recent designed Damen ships. Ideas were clustered and three mast concepts were elaborated into 3D-models in order to evaluate the concepts on the most important/influentual requirements. For the wheel- & deckhouse one concept was elaborated to show the influence of more pronounced exterior styling conform the stakeholders. The best rated concept was optimized during extra iteration steps. The final wheel- & deckhouse and mast were modelled in the 3D-model of an ASD 3212 tug. Styling characteristics found in the literature and in recently designed Damen vessels are applied to the future tug. The styling redesign can be described as less chaotic, have body, look rigid, powerful and fearless. The thesis was finalized with an evaluation on the project and product and with conclusions and recommendations.","ship; tug; design; standardization; styling; exterior; automotive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Non-ferrous (NF) metals in municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash are mostly recovered by an eddy current separator (ECS) to retrieve the positive economic value and to strongly improve the environmental quality of the mineral ash contents before reusing them in road foundations or other applications. The splitter in an ECS is a metal plate that splits the falling product stream of the ECS in a mineral product and a NF metal product. Variations such as moisture content in the feed of the ECS make it necessary to continuously make adjustments to the splitter position in order to achieve the highest possible value recovery. The main research idea in this work is to adjust the splitter continuously by means of a sensor that can count both the metal particles as well as all the particles in the falling materials stream into the metals product. In this work the gain in recovery and retrieved value provided by the sensor was investigated and a preferred strategy is proposed to control the splitter by means of the information generated by the sensor. Particle trajectory tests were conducted to evaluate the changes in the trajectories due to variations in the bottom ash (BA) feed and to assess the possible consequences of these feed changes for metal recovery. The feed material used in the tests was the 1-6 mm size fraction, since ECS metal recovery from this fine fraction is the biggest challenge. The falling material stream from the ECS was intercepted by a 60 mm deep, flat container that was subdivided into multiple rectangular slots of 10 mm width. The material collected during 3 to 8 seconds of ECS processing was dried, weighted and classified and the NF metal particles in the different size fractions were analysed. Results from the ECS particle tests were used to simulate the system of ECS and sensor to assess how a sensor system would respond to variations in the BA. Optimal economic value recovery in the metal product is achieved at 29-32% metal product grade, which complies with 6% sensor grade. This sensor grade is measured by the sensor as it samples the falling materials stream through a 30 mm tube at the position of the splitter. A special result is that this optimum holds for both feed with 12% moisture and feed with 14% moisture. The count ratio of metal particles to all particles (z) was z=0.12 for both feed with 12% moisture and feed with 14% moisture content and the average particle mass ratio of non-metal to metal (k) was k=1.3 for feed with 12% moisture and k=1.7 for feed with 14% moisture. A reduction in moisture content of 2% will require an adjustment of 25 mm of the splitter away from the ECS to maintain the optimal economic value of the metal product. Vice versa, a 2% increase in moisture will require an adjustment of 25 mm of the splitter towards the ECS. The sensor grade, metal product grade and the count ratio all showed a monotonically increasing behaviour with increasing splitter distance, giving the ideal conditions for reliable automated control of the splitter by a the desired value-optimizing criteria. Simulations of ECS behaviour for different splitter positions showed that the sensor can add value to the metal product when compared to a human operator, who would adjust the splitter perhaps a few times per day, which is the common practice in industry. This conclusion holds for both feed with 12% and 14% moisture content, but the gain increases when the feed material becomes wetter. Moreover, control of the splitter as based on the sensor readings shows that the theoretical optimal value recovery in the metal product can be realized using the sensor.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

As a consequence, the order penetration point of these processes is typically very late, which makes service processes unusually complex and dynamic. Literature study and case study analysis exposed the inherent technical and organizational limitations of LSS when applied to service processes. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that, under specific conditions, Discrete Event Simulation and System Dynamics are more suitable than the traditional black box modelling techniques normally used in LSS.

The need for tools, like flood maps and flood models, for real time monitoring and forecasting of floods has also increased. When an upcoming flood is expected, and these preparatory tools are not available, giving an insight into how and when the flood will proceed is difficult. A rapid flood model can assist in decision making and emergency response during threatening flood situations. The concept of a rapid flood is a model which makes prediction of a flood event in 1) a short period with the use of 2) publicly available data 3) for any flood prone area in the world. This thesis evaluates the usability of a rapid flood model for river flooding and crisis management. This study consists of three parts. The first two, a 1D and 2D schematization, determine the most influential parameters and conditions of a flood for different types of river areas. Publicly available data is used for these most influential parameters and conditions to simulate the third study case, the 2011 Thailand flood event. The rapid model can be setup for any flood prone area in the world in 1 or 2 days by an experienced modeler. The publicly available data needs to be supplemented by chosen methods and equations to set up the model. This study shows that the most influential parameters and conditions for the rapid flood model are site specific. For a relative flat area the type of land use is an influential condition, while in a mountainous area the river geometrics are the main influential parameters. The analysis gives an insight into which data the available resources, both time and money, should be spend on, if they are not publicly available. Over all, this evaluation shows that a rapid flood model can provide a reasonable estimate of a flood event in a short amount of time by using only publicly available data. The proper use of the rapid flood model depends highly on the type of river area and using the correct data for the most influential parameters and conditions for these river and area types.","flood prediction; Rapid Flood Model; online data; Thailand Flood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures, Flood Risk","",""

(mentor)","2013","The storm surge barrier and levees located in the Hollandsche IJssel do not fulfill the current safety standards according to the third nationwide safety assessment. The non-closure probability of the storm surge barrier is too high and the inner slope stability of the levees is too low. Besides the problems regarding the flooding safety also problems concerning salt intrusion into the Hollandsche IJssel, sea level rise that might occur, tidal ecology in the river and local developments in the surrounding play an important role. The objective of this thesis is the development and conceptual design of a solution for the important problems in the Hollandsche IJssel. The solution needs to be cost-effective and consists of a technically and societal feasible design. After analysis of different solutions, adaptation of the Hollandsche IJssel storm surge barrier is preferred because the investments needed to adapt the storm surge barrier are much lower than the construction of a dam or new storm surge barrier. The total solution adapts the Hollandsche IJssel storm surge barrier, changes the current closure scheme of the barrier and postpones the construction of a new structure that eventually will be needed. The adapted storm surge barrier has a lower closure level to decrease the governing water levels on the Hollandsche IJssel and therefore decreases the risk of flooding and the investments needed for the reinforcement of the levees. The non-closure probability of the storm surge barrier should decrease to limit the effect of the non-closure probability on the governing water levels. When the storm surge barrier does not close high water levels will be introduced on the Hollandsche IJssel, the effect of the non-closure probability should account for this high water levels. The storm surge barrier will also close during low discharges to prevent salt intrusion and consequently the stop of the fresh water inlet near Gouda. The inlet near Gouda uses fresh water to flush the canal system of Central Holland and prevents damage to agriculture. Due to the lower closure level and use of the storm surge barrier during salt intrusion governing loads on the storm surge barrier increase. The existing steel gate that closes the Hollandsche IJssel storm surge barrier needs to be adapted to withstand the increases loads. Steel plates need to be welded to increase the capacity of critical steel elements within the storm surge barrier. The effect of the adaptations is that a small part of the investments needed for the levee reinforcement is prevented and that the risks of flooding in dike ring 14 and 15 decrease. It is assumed that it is possible to decrease the non-closure probability and therefore reduce the effect of the governing water levels. The recommendations at the end of this study focus on the research that is needed into the exact effect and design of the adaptations.","storm surge barrier; salt intrusion; Hollandsche IJssel; sea level rise; assessment; primaire waterkering; stormvloedkering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Chu, J. (graduation committee); Tian, F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2013","The Kite Power Group of the Wind Energy Department of Delft University of Technology has developed a pumping kite system to harvest high altitude wind energy (HAWP). HAWP technology is one of many renewable energy solutions that are emerging in a time at which Earth’s non-renewable energy resources are becoming scarce. The kite power system operates in periodic pumping cycles, alternating between reel-out and reel-in of the main tether from a drum, which in turn drives a generator. Electricity is generated during reel-out and only a small portion of the produced energy is reused during the reel-in process, which gives a positive end result. The current system has a movable ground station and contains all basic elements required to operate the kite in flight. The technology of the kite control unit is still is at an early stage of development and is being further developed and extensively tested at this moment.<br/>The future of the kite power technology depends heavily on the possibility of the kite power system to be fully automated and autonomous. In the current state of development of the system, a ground crew of at least three people is needed to operate the system which makes it highly inconvenient and costly in practice. As part of the Design Synthesis Exercise (DSE) a group of nine students was given the task to develop an automated launch, landing, and storage system for an upscaled version of the specific pumping kite power system which uses a kite of 70m2. Automation of the entire operation will enable the technology to be implemented on a larger scale and as such become economically profitable.<br/>Going through a full design process that ended with a detailed design of a launch, landing, and storage system in a period of 10 weeks required a well structured planning. Systems engineering methods were used which divide the design process in three main parts marking their respective completion in specific milestones. The first part covered the entire project planning and the preliminary design phase with a baseline report as the first milestone in the design process. In a highly creative manner a large number of ideas was produced. Subsequently, each one of them was evaluated by means of a trade-off and obvious losers faced immediate elimination.<br/>The second part of the design process was focused on the conceptual design of a limited number of concepts. At the start of this phase all ideas from the first part of the design process were integrated into full-system concepts. The feasibility of each of the integrated concepts was evaluated on a limited number of criteria after which another trade-off was performed. Four different concepts were chosen and were further developed in the remainder of the conceptual design phase. Multiple analyses were performed on topics such as functionality, technical details, sustainability and finance to obtain a good overview of the overall performance of each concept. After extensive research on all four concepts another trade-off was carried out and the final selection of one definite concept was made. At this point the conceptual design phase reached its milestone. Both the clients and kite power experts have confirmed the decision to take this concept into the detailed design phase.<br/>The third and final part of the systems engineering approach is the detailed design phase. In this phase the chosen concept was extensively researched and upgraded to a detailed design over a period of three weeks, and the results are contained in this technical report. Prior to research on the technical properties of the detailed design a detailed design overview was produced. The functionalities of the system were fully explored and put on paper. Furthermore the automated system was divided into subsystems and corresponding mechanisms. This enabled performing detailed research on specific elements of the system in subsequent steps of the design process. At the start of this third phase, pertinent background studies were performed to acquire a thorough understanding of both the aerodynamics and the commercial, environmental, and legal frameworks. The detailed research was first performed on all the subsystems, whereafter the integrated system got a closer look. The analytical approach was hereby always set prior to any calculations. The analysis of the subsystems was divided into structural integrity, energy consumption, actuators and sensors, operation time and cost. The integrated system analysis comprised research on the operations and maintenance, sustainability, soft- and hardware, and RAMS characteristics as a few examples. During this process many challenges arised. To resolve these challenges and optimize the design an iteration phase was implemented after the research was finished. In this phase the compliance matrix was used as a guide and solutions that improve compliance of the detailed design with the requirements were implemented. The detailed design phase ended with an investigation on post-DSE topics such as a financial analysis including profitability and Return on Investment (RoI), verification and validation and a project design and development logic.<br/>As a final result of the design process a solution for automated launch, landing, and storage of the kite power system has been produced on a detailed level. This system is based on a tall vertical boom of 35m (comparable to the length of a Boeing 737) on which a horizontal beam can slide up and down. The kite is launched from and landed upon this horizontal beam, when it is positioned at the top of the vertical boom. Both the horizontal beam and vertical boom can be tilted to put the system at an optimal angle for the launch and landing process. A storage unit has also been designed on a ground level. The horizontal beam can slowly lower the kite into the storage, in which a folding mechanism has been added to prevent entanglement of the tethers and the bridle system. The system has been designed in such a way that it can operate automatically and autonomously for a period of three months; a decision-making tool has been produced that ensures operation only within the kite’s operating limits (no lightning and a limited range of wind speeds). The research and development process as described in the above paragraphs have ensured that the detailed design has been explored on a widespread range of topics and has pushed to project group to achieve a sound level of depth within the available resources.<br/>The various results that are produced in this report lead the way for several conclusions. The most important conclusion is that the performance of the automated launch, landing and storage system is considered to be a success. It was shown that the the design can autonomously operate a pumping kite system within the boundaries of the requirements. Furthermore, it was shown that the system can land the kite in a wind speed range of 4 to 25m/s and launching can be performed between 5 and 25m/s. However, this performance fully relies on the capabilities of the control unit. The system was required to not exceed the limit of using 0.1% of the energy produced by the kite for the launch, landing, and storage procedure. As the system uses 0.036% of the average produced energy, it is considered to have met this requirement.<br/>As the team aimed to develop a sustainable design, recyclable materials were implemented. Besides the beam subsystem, steel is used in the design of the automated launch, landing and storage system. Steel is found to be recyclable for 93% and has highly convenient properties in case of structural application as well as costs. As for some parts no renewable materials could be used for structural or durability reasons, the goal to make the system 100% recyclable is not met. The client has stated a maximum cost requirement of Euro 20,000. Unfortunately this requirement is exceeded by 167% as the total estimated costs were estimated to be about Euro 53,500. If the client would reach break even after 20 years of operation, the energy price of 1kWh will have to reach an average price of Euro 0.285, which is unfeasible in comparison with the current price of Euro 0.06. The main reason for this is the replacement of the kite and main tether after each three months.<br/>The most important recommendations that follow from the conclusions are related to cost reduction, profitabilityand funding. The currently designed system increases its cost budget of Euro 20,000, reaching a total of Euro 53,451. It is suggested to use cost estimation relationships for assembly to obtain a more accurate representation of the total cost. A second point of interest is to investigate the need for storage of the kite. Possibly this need can be eliminated or reduced to a partial-cover if the kite and tether durability are increased. The regular kite and tether replacement (every three months) are the largest cost drivers of the entire system and an increase of their durability and lifespan will most certainly help the system to move towards a commercially feasible state. Other recommendations to improve the profitability of the system are related to upscaling the existing model and exploration of an offshore implementation, such that the system can generate more power. The last two propositions on the financial area are focussed on funding. The Kite Power Group is advised to start with the acquisition of subsidies as soon as possible and also look into the prospects of attracting business partners and sponsorships.<br/>A second set of recommendations is related to sustainability. On one hand hand the amount of recycled and/or recyclable materials can be further increased. A second suggestion poses the idea of promoting the kite power system as the true symbol of renewable energy and innovation to increase public interest. The kite power generation could be combined with a wind turbine on top of the tall vertical boom and a storage roof that is covered with solar panels. One final recommendationn follows from the contact with SkySails during this project. At this point such company is already commercially active on the energy market with a kite power system that has comparable features to the proposed detailed design in this technical report. The company has informed that they would gladly support the research with technical feedback and as such it is recommended to keep close contact with this company in further development stages.<br","Airborne Wind Energy, inflatable membrane wings, renewable energy","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AE3200 - Design Synthesis Exercise",""

The model is capable of reproducing a number of trends caused by the difference in processing conditions, like temperature and cooling rate, with respect to the microstructure and growth kinetics. However, a single set of nucleation and growth parameters to define the behaviour through a range of conditions have not been found yet. Thus, the goal of this project is to optimise the cellular automata model with a single set of nucleation and growth parameters which makes it capable of predicting the microstructure and growth kinetics at different processing conditions. The CA model uses a simplified calculation of the carbon concentration profile in the austenite. Validation of this simplified calculation, termed as the ‘semi analytical model’, was performed. This was necessary to ascertain that the error obtained in the calculation of the CA model is not a result of this simplification. It was found that the accuracy of the semi analytical model depends on the nature of the transformation. The error increases when the transformation becomes more diffusion controlled in nature. The improvement in the CA model was carried out in terms of its ability to deal with the interaction of the solutes with the austenite-ferrite interface. This, in turn, affects the thermodynamic conditions applicable at the interface. The two extreme equilibrium conditions which are generally defined are the para-equilibrium (PE) and the local equilibrium with negligible partitioning (LENP). The former represents a constrained equilibrium resulting in faster kinetics, while the latter is associated with short range diffusion leading to slower kinetics. In order to account for the slowing down of the kinetics at the end of the transformation, a transition from PE to LENP was proposed. This ‘gradual transition approach’ is based on the interface velocity and accounts for equilibrium states intermediate to that of the PE and LENP conditions. Isothermal austenite-to-ferrite transformation in a dual phase steel, DP600, at temperatures of 625, 650 and 700 deg. C was studied. The general trends with respect to the ferrite transformation rate, final ferrite fraction and ferrite microstructure were predicted by the model using a single set of parameters. However, in order to explain the trend with respect to the ferrite grain size, the parameter describing the amount of edge cells used for nucleation had to be manually adjusted at different temperatures. A greater contribution of edge nucleation was required with decrease in temperature. The fraction of edge cells used for nucleation was 0.3, 0.1 and 0 at temperatures of 625, 650 and 700 deg. C respectively.","microstructure model; thermodynamics; cellular automata","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Material Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Wapenaar, K. (mentor); Slob, E.C. (mentor); Storms, J.E.A. (mentor)","2013","Green's function retrieval by seismic interferometry (SI) exists in a variety of forms. Many of the applications of SI allow the creation of new seismic traces by crosscorrelating a wavefield recorded at two separate locations. The sum of this operation over multiple sources results in the creation of a new signal such that one of the recording locations acts as a virtual source to the other. We demonstrate that it is possible to use teleseismic shear wave transmission responses to create virtual source records for lithospheric imaging through SI. We utilize teleseismic shear wave phases for primarily two reasons: namely, (a) at large offsets the incoming wavefront approximates a plane wave due to spread of the wavefront in relation to the comparatively finite seismic array, and (b) the large distances act as a natural temporal filter to separate the incident P and S arrivals. We develop a method that allows such shear wave phases to image the subsurface. A series of forward modelling experiments with 2D elastic propagation were conducted. SP converted energy maps primarily to the vertical component. At large ray parameters, decomposition was capable of separating the P and S fields. Sufficient illumination by many ray parameters is essential to clearly resolve subsurface features; however, decimation studies indicated that it is still possible to identify strong reflectors with suboptimal sampling. Attempts to mitigate the complex effective wavelet generated by earthquake faulting behaviour were met with difficulty; deconvolution was unsuccessful due to the non-minimum phase nature of the effective source wavelet, but spectral whitening is a necessary preprocessing step to SI was necessary. Correlation panel filtering techniques, including singular value decomposition and wavenumber filtering, were tested to remove spurious energy present in the virtual source records created through SI. Spurious terms introduced by the long duration earthquake-generated wavelet were further suppressed in the common-offset domain. After creating virtual source records at every model receiver location, imaging was performed. A conventional migration technique was applied to each virtual source record and stacked to produce an image of the model subsurface. All major features of the model were resolved with a high degree of accuracy using the approach developed here. Finally, a field dataset was selected from southern Mexico with sufficient S phase sampling and prepared for imaging. By azimuthally limiting a window around the relatively linear orientation of the seismometer array, earthquakes that vary in distance correspond to sampling of unique ray parameters. A total of 43 S phase transmission responses were selected that met our criteria for magnitude and location. Geometric and topographic corrections were applied to each transmission response. The processing steps tested on our forward models were subsequently applied to this dataset and virtual source records were created via SI. The virtual source records are then migrated to form an image of the lithosphere. The resulting image of the Cocos subduction zone reproduces features present in the literature and also reveals new details at greater depths; this demonstrates the utility of the method developed within.","seismology; interferometry; shear wave; imaging; subduction; earthquake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geophysics","",""

(mentor)","2013","Materials of steam water cycles can suffer from corrosion induced by halide anions in feedwater. Organic halogen compounds in feedwater can be degraded and release halide anions under high temperature and pressure. Therefore it is necessary to be able to measure the organic halogen concentration. Existing measurements including Adsorbable Organic Halogens and Gas Chromatography are either not convenient, affordable, accurate or reproducible enough at these very low concentrations, meaning a new method should be developed. In this research the option of destroying the organic compounds to release the halide anions and measure them with ion chromatography was studied. The question is, which is the best way to destroy the organic compounds and release the halides anions. Six organic halogen model compounds were tested: aliphatic and aromatic fluorine, chlorine and bromine containing compounds. Two main methods were studied: UV/vacuumUV (VUV) photolysis and wet chemical oxidation with K2S2O8. There are three phases in the research: 1. Study different UV lamps and oxidants on the target compounds and find the optimal combinations. 2. Try different dosages of K2S2O8 and find an optimum. 3. Test halide release of target compounds in power plant conditions. In the experiments, three kinds of lamps were applied: VUV, low pressure (LP) lamp and medium pressure (MP) lamp. H2O2 and TiO2 were used as a catalyst. Last but not least, wet chemical oxidation was tested, with varying dosages of K2S2O8. The experiments were executed with both single compounds and mixed compounds. The results show that the organic fluorine is the hardest to degrade while organic bromine is the easiest. Aromatic compounds are easier to degrade than aliphatic compounds. This happens not only in AOP process, but also in power plant conditions. The recovery of bromide and chloride in most methods could reach 95% while aliphatic fluorine could only reach at most 70%. It can be concluded that MP/H2O2 is the most effective method for degradation of organic halogen compounds since it requires less time for the reaction to be completed, but wet chemical oxidation also showed high recoveries for all halide anions. The advantage of wet chemical oxidation is simple equipment and universality. The method with the lowest degradation rate and recovery is UV/TiO2.","boiler feedwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-08","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Zadpoor, A.A. (mentor)","2013","Cam impingement appears to be an important factor in the development of early osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. A Cam is generally diagnosed in young and active adults, already at the age of thirteen. Therefore, it has been suggested that excessive femoral loading during skeletal development might trigger the abnormal morphology. The goal of this research is to understand how the deformity develops. A finite element analysis is conducted to predict the stress distribution in the immature proximal femur under different loading conditions. Furthermore, the influence of the orientation of the epiphyseal plate is studied, as a Cam-type deformity is highly associated with an abnormal epiphyseal extension on the anterosuperior region. Previous studies suggested that octahedral shear stress promotes growth, while hydrostatic compressive stress inhibits growth. These mechanobiological principals are implemented to predict the bone growth rate. The position and the shape of the growth plate, as well as the loading direction highly influence the stress distribution in the proximal femur and growth plate. A medial directed load causes high compression stress in the growth cartilage in the lateral region. Endochondral growth is inhibited, which could result in a deflection of the growth plate, observed in Cam patients as epiphyseal extension. High regional stresses and osteogenic index appear in the epiphysis at the anterosuperior region when a convex growth plate is modeled. These results would support the theory that a Cam-type deformity might not be a result of endochondral growth, but the higher stresses demand local remodeling and apposition. Incorporating dynamic loading and tissue adaptation is needed to further understand how mechanical stimuli effects the epiphyseal growth and to predict morphological changes over time. Once one understands the etiological factors of cam impingement, the disorder can be treated at an early stage and the development into early osteoarthritis might be prevented.","mechanobiology; bone growth; cam impingement; proximal femur; FE Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor)","2013","This report is written as a graduation thesis for the Master’s degree in Design for Interaction, Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. It describes the process of researching, prototyping and evaluating a new interactive kite simulator, developed within a consortium of design firm Frank & Frens; the TU Delft; Innosport; the NKV and Robert Hoogendijk. The goal is to teach the basics to beginning kite-surfers realistically and in a controllable and weather independent environment. Kite-surfing is a young, emergent and exhilarating outdoor sport that requires the entire body to form an integral connection between the kite and the board. It is also highly weather dependent which makes practicing not always possible and as effective. To find out the requirements for learning to take place and what aspects are essential for a realistic simulated experience, extensive research has been conducted. During this project the sport has been studied at large; a literature study has been done to motor skill acquisition and the first experiences of beginners are gathered through observations, interviews and own experience. The gathered insights have been translated into design specifications and a design vision that resulted in three possible directions to follow. These directions all serve the concept of a kite simulator with which the project set out with, but with varying degrees of dynamics. The second part of the project focussed on prototyping and evaluating proposals for a tangible kite controller. The purpose was to control a kite simulator program and to feed back a resulting traction force on the user’s body. With the help of expert kite-surfers, several prototypes have been evaluated on realism in order to reach the highest level possible. Only then can the simulated experience truly add value to beginners. By using the input from experts and by setting out in one of the design direction, a self-supportive kite simulator has been fabricated and tested. This resulted in recommendations for further development; insights in possible added value and a final design proposal for an ultimate kite simulator embodiment. The final prototype has made the first step towards a fully realistic simulator design and laid the groundwork for future development. So far, it showed not only potential for beginners to practice with, but the findings of the final evaluation sessions were also enough to convince the consortium to continue investing in the project at large.","education; sports; simulator; tangible user interface; design; interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-06-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Wallinga, J. (mentor); Van Thiel de Vries, J.S.M. (mentor); Reimann, T. (mentor); De Schipper, M.A. (mentor)","2013","The goal of a sediment tracer is to give quantitative or relative feedback on (coastal) morphological changes or track either sediment or other particles (e.g. contaminations) in sediment dynamic environments. A sediment tracer is a visible or invisible marked (sediment) grain that is artificially injected or is present in-situ. This Master Thesis main objective is a feasibility study and the development of a new type of sediment tracer. This sediment tracer focuses on the intrinsic luminescence properties of the quartz and feldspar minerals as a measure for sediment transport. Utilizing an intrinsic property as tracer has a number of advantages over the use of artificial or natural tracers. First the tracer is a guaranteed match to its environment in terms of transport and interaction within the sediment system. The use of artificial tracers is especially problematic in large study areas, because the deploy scope depends on the quantity of injected material to the environment it is placed in. Natural tracers (partly) deal with this problem, since they make use of in-situ material. An example is the utilization of naturally occurring radionuclides. However, they don’t account for internal dynamics that can provide insight in the transport history from the original source to the position of deposition. Hence natural tracers are mostly used for provenance studies. Luminescence is the latent light that is emitted by a mineral after it is stimulated by a source of heat or light. It is a well described phenomenon in sediment grains and the mechanics have a simple analogy to a battery that is charged and uncharged (i.e. luminescence signal is accumulate and depleted). The accumulation of a luminescence signal is triggered by ionizing radiation, which is the product of naturally decaying radioactive isotopes during prolonged burial. The depletion occurs when the grains are exposed to heat or daylight. The rate at which the signal depletes depends on the daylight conditions as well as the depth of immersion in water. This makes every sediment grain a possible data recorder for its own (day)light exposure history or deposition- /erosion history, put in terms of morphology. We hypothesized that the degree of daylight exposure, hence the depletion of luminescence signal during transport, could represent the distance- and/or mode (aeolian, water lain etc.) of transport. Luminescence is measured in an equivalent dose in Grays. There are a multitude of stimulation methods to recover an equivalent dose from sediment, moreover are each of these methods are coupled to unique luminescence properties. Usually these stimulation methods are tested separately on either a quartz or a feldspar sample. In this thesis we have developed a new protocol to simultaneously retrieve a range of signals (blue light-, (post infrared) infrared light- and thermal stimulation) from a polymineral sample of mixed quartz and feldspar grains. This Polymineral Multi Signal Single Aliquot Regenerative protocol, PMS-SAR for short, proved to be representative for separate measurements of quartz and feldspar. Next, we have conducted controlled daylight exposure- or bleaching experiments to investigate the bleaching behaviour per signal. We found that each signal has a unique dynamic bleaching rate and range that differs approximately one order of magnitude. To test the feasibility as a sediment tracer we have been applying the PMS-SAR luminescence protocol and the results of the bleaching experiments in a test case at the Sand Engine, a mega-nourishment at the Dutch coast. An intensive monitoring campaign at the Sand Engine pilot project has provided bathymetry- and hydrological data. With this data a model is made to investigate the historical evolution of a sand spit that arose at the North-eastern tip of the Sand Engine after construction. Next luminescence measurements were conducted on selected sediment samples taken on the Sand Engine to see whether the results are in accordance with the historical evolution. The luminescence measurement results from the Sand Engine samples were then reflected upon the bleaching curves to give us the Equivalent Exposure Time (EET). The measurement results reveal an average increase in EET value for the different signals with distance from the first core position, which is consistent with our expectations. In addition to this we could also make a clear distinction between the presumably water lain transported samples and the aeolian sample. These distinct observations reveal the true potential of a multi signal luminescence technique and the use of it in morphological studies. However, these observation were made with very straight forward assumptions, hence to get a more accurate picture that can by appointed to morphological evolution and processes in mega-nourishment additional experiments are recommended.","Sand Engine; mega-nourishment; coastal; luminescence; intrinsic; sediment tracing method; tracer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

This impoverishes harbour areas close to Rotterdam like the Stadshavens area. The municipality of Rotterdam is trying to revitalize these areas by transforming them into sustainable living and working communities. Evides N.V. is participating in this by developing an innovative wastewater reuse plant which will reuse the wastewater from the Stadshavens area by treating it to demi-water standards, while also recovering nutrients and energy. The objective of the research described in this thesis is to develop several sustainable and innovative treatment scenarios for the wastewater reuse plant, test relevant innovative technologies on lab scale and present a conceptual design of the wastewater reuse plant. Conventional wastewater treatment plants treat the wastewater under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Especially the aeration needed for aerobic treatment has a high energy consumption. With the development of new treatment techniques like ceramic nanofiltration and forward osmosis it is now possible to replace the aerobic treatment used in conventional wastewater treatment plants by these technologies. This saves energy and gives a smaller installation footprint (no settling phases are necessary). Four scenarios were developed, two using combined collection of wastewater, while the other two have a separate collection of grey water (from washing) and black water (from toilets). One of the combined collection scenarios and one of the separate collection scenarios uses ceramic nanofiltration (CNF) as a first treatment step, while the other two use forward osmosis (FO) as a first treatment step. After the first treatment step, the water quality is sufficient to produce demi-water by using the reverse osmosis process (RO). In the separate collection scenarios, the grey water is treated similarly to the wastewater treated in the combined collection scenarios. Nutrients and energy are recovered from the reject water of the CNF and FO processes by applying anaerobic digestion in the form of a UASB reactor. This process produces sludge and biogas from the biological material in the wastewater. After this step, magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitation and SHARON®-Anammox® processes are applied to recover orthophosphate and ammonium from the wastewater. With the separate collection scenarios, the black water is treated similarly to the concentrate water treatment in the combined collection scenarios. After comparing the scenarios based on energy consumption, demi-water production and demi-water quality, it was chosen to apply separate collection of wastewater , using CNF as a primary treatment step. The CNF process was tested on lab scale to review its performance when treating either raw wastewater or grey wastewater. Results indicated a better permeate quality and reject composition when treating grey water, but more fouling was observed, compared to raw wastewater. However, it is estimated this is controllable by applying regular backwashing and chemical cleaning. This research has shown that membrane processes can be used as a viable replacement for the aerobic processes which are used in conventional wastewater treatment plants. By using membrane processes instead of aerobic processes, less energy is consumed, while still achieving reliable effluents and reuse products. Based on the research a conceptual design of the wastewater treatment plant was made which consisted of a building which contains all treatment processes except the grey and black wastewater buffers, the demi-water storage and the digestion process tanks which are located outside of the building.","wastewater; reuse; forward osmosis; ceramic nanofiltration; demi-water; design; RINEW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

The Europees Massagoed Overslagbedrijf (EMO) is the largest terminal of this kind in Europe, with a supply of around 30 MT of coal and iron ore per year. EMO handles vessels from Panamax up to the largest dry bulk carriers presently trading and is a vital part of the supply chain of iron ore and coal for the European steel and electricity industries. In the future, changes are expected in the supply volumes of coal and iron ore. Also, a new range of Very Large Ore Carriers (VLOC’s) was recently introduced. The question arises if such changes, over which EMO has little or no control, affect the efficiency of the terminal in any way. It is currently unknown which of these external or input factors affect the terminal efficiency, and to what extent. To provide this knowledge, the following research question was formulated: What input factors affect terminal efficiency and what are the quantitative effects on terminal efficiency when these factors change The research was scoped to include the efficiency of the quayside, as well as the storage yard. The quayside can be seen as a queuing system, where the quay cranes are the servers. The service rate, or crane unloading rate, is an important factor in the efficiency of the quayside. Higher unloading rates mean more throughput of material with the same resources...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The geographical location and the internal complexity of the majority of the reservoirs that are brought into production necessitate extensive research of all the reservoir characteristics. One element in the array of research tools is the construction of a geological model of the reservoir. A geological reservoir model can be used e.g. to determine the optimum location for new wells, or to predict the flow of the fluids and gasses through the reservoir. Although it requires time and effort to build a reservoir model, it increases the chance of successfully producing a complex hydrocarbon reservoir. The first step in being able to generate a geologically realistic reservoir model is developing the modelling tool. During this MSc project a new geological modelling tool that is being developed by Total has been tested. This tool, GOAL, is a plug-in to the reservoir modelling software GOCAD that is able to model fluvial channels with i.a. point bars, levees and lobes. The channel simulation in GOAL is based on the random walk theory, which allows to build geological realistic looking sedimentary objects, condition the output easily to well data and connectivity data, and to make several stochastic realizations of the model. GOAL has been used to construct a geological model of the Cajigar outcrop. This outcrop contains different kinds of fluvial channel and lobe deposits. The GOAL model has been compared to a previous geological model that had been constructed using an object modelling technique. The different sedimentary elements in the GOAL model were connected in a much more geologically realistic fashion, compared to the purely statistical determined location of those objects in the object model. Using both models for dynamic flow simulation could result in large differences in the calculated flow, because of this difference in connectivity. In general the model with the connected sedimentary elements, the GOAL model, would produce the most realistic flow output and therefore this modelling technique can be considered as an improvement compared to the object model. To investigate the applicability of GOAL on a real world subsurface example, a geological model was constructed of the Westphalian Upper C (WUC) interval in Blocks K4 & K5 in the Dutch offshore. The model covers an area of 25x18 km, is on average 75 m thick and is divided into six subintervals. The size of the area to be modelled made it necessary to use a low resolution grid with cell sizes of 50 m square and 2 m thick. The GOAL modelling of the WUC was done in two steps; (1) model the channel belts in each subinterval, and (2) model the individual channels inside the channel belts. For the channel belts that contained braided channel deposits the resulting geological model was satisfactory. For the channel belts that contained meandering channel deposits however, the point bar deposits fell below the grid resolution resulting in a too low fraction of point bar cells in the output grid. Since the point bar deposits were determined to be the reservoir sands, this result was unsatisfactory. Loss of detail at lower grid resolution is a common issue encountered during geological modelling. To investigate the sensibility of the GOAL output to changes in meander wave length and grid cell size nine different GOAL “test models” have been created with three different grid cell sizes and three different meander wave lengths. This resulted in an equation to calculate the maximum point bar facies fraction at a specific combination of meander wave length and grid cell size. Using the input settings of the WUC GOAL model a maximum feasible point bar facies fraction of 0.289 could be calculated. This is considerably lower than the target point bar facies fraction of 0.60, but could be increased by using a larger meander wave length. The same equation can be used to calculate the minimum meander wave length to realize the target point bar facies fraction; 861 m. However, this would result in too large connected point bar volumes in the grid, making the model inadequate for dynamic flow modelling, so a balance has to be found between the point bar facies fraction and the meander wave length. To minimize the necessity of making compromises between input parameters a Matlab Cellular Automata routine was created that increases the point bar facies fraction while conserving the connectivity characteristics between the channel and point bar facies in the GOAL output model. It was possible to increase the point bar facies fraction of all the “test models” towards the target value, so an additional parameter could be defined to discriminate the different models from each other based on their connectivity characteristics. A “most realistic” model was chosen based on river analogues and the number of connected point bar volumes in that model was used to quantify the quality in all the models. This data has been used to make a classification of the models, that can be used to find the optimum GOAL input settings for meander wave length at different grid sizes.","geological modelling; cellular automata; GOAL; random walk; Westphalian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Section for Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor)","2013","In the mass balance of a riverbed, some terms are usually assumed constant for reasons of simplicity. One of the terms assumed to be constant is the change in bedload layer, which is defined as the sediment transport divided by the particle velocity. To study the effect of this assumption, a numerical morphodynamic model has to be computed. For such a morphodynamic model to work, some input parameters and models have to be determined. The most important input models are those of the predicted sediment transport and particle velocity, which are studied in this research. The Dutch upper Rhine is used as basis for this study, with particle diameters and sediment composition as stated in earlier studies. To compare the predicted sediment transport by sediment transport models, sediment transport data of three measurement campaigns is used. Before the sediment transport models are compared with the measured data, a small literature study is used to determine which sediment transport models might be applicable for predicting the sediment transport. With the available specifications of the sediment transport models, two fractional transport models were chosen as applicable: the model of Wu et al. (2000) and the model of Wilcock & Crowe (2003). Both original models approximate the measured data quite well, so no calibration of the models is required. The model of Wu however, shows some unusual behavior for increasing sand/gravel ratios and is more sensitive for changes in its calibration parameter. Therefore, the model of Wilcock & Crowe is chosen as most applicable for this part of the Rhine. To determine the propagation velocity of the particles, two models of Van Rijn (1984) and one model of Engelund-Fredsoe (1976) were used. One of the Van Rijn models predicted unrealistic particle velocities, but the remaining models approximated the particle velocity in a similar way, approaching measurements from Francis (1973) and Luque (1974). Due to the similar behavior of both models, no choice was made between them. Eventually, the thickness of the bedload layer was determined, providing a realistic input for a 1D sand/gravel morphodynamic model.","bedload; sediment transport; particle velocity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2013","Load Sensing Bearing (LSB) units are based on the measurement of the elastic deformation of the outer ring of the bearing unit usually using strain gauges which are placed along the circumference of the bearing. The master thesis is aimed at estimating the lateral tire force of a vehicle wheel using the vehicle wheel bearing hub unit which is instrumented to become a LSB and is placed in a BMW E60 lab vehicle. Calibration of the LSB is needed to obtain a strain-force model. In situ calibration is expensive, time consuming and not always possible. Therefore a calibration system, the Bearing Test System (BETSY) has been used. Sensor responses of the LSB are greatly influenced by differences in bearing housing compliance where on one hand the LSB is mounted on the machine and on the other hand in the vehicle. It will be shown how it is possible to use BETSY as calibration system when the LSB is mounted to machine via the actual knuckle and ball joints found in the vehicle. Next, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is used to obtain a strain-force model to estimate the lateral force. However, the strain gauges are subjected to thermal influences of a low frequent nature and can therefore only be used to estimate the ‘high’- frequent lateral force. Besides that, it is not possible with the specific compact wheel hub unit of the BMW E60 lab vehicle to determine, with the strain gauges, whether the vehicle is turning left or right. To overcome these two issues, two Eddy-current sensors measuring the tilting movement of the ABS-ring, which is integrated in the seal of the bearing, are used to determine the direction and to estimate the low frequent content of the lateral force. Calibration and validation experiments are performed to show the accuracy and precision of the lateral force estimation.","lateral force; Tire Contact Patch; Hub Bearing Unit; Strain Gauges; Eddy-current Sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Carlton, J. (mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2013","In the time when the World can experience volatility of international trade due to World economic crisis, concentration of the shipping industry and liberalisation of transport markets, port competition is becoming fiercer over the time. In such an environment, freight forwarders’ role is becoming more and more important, representing a valuable link in the whole supply chain. This research attempts to analyse and benchmark port services based on the factors and criteria most important to freight forwarders’ port choice, the operational efficiency and performance benchmarking of container ports and terminals, situated in the area of the United Kingdom and Balkan Peninsula. It does so by applying different techniques, starting from questionnaire survey among freight forwarders in these regions in order to determine the most important port choice factors, followed by analytical benchmarking technique such as DEA to analyse impact of operating factors on port efficiency and concluded with productivity analysis to measure terminal productivity changes during, before and after the World economic crisis. The study found that region where freight forwarders are acting has impact on their port choice. Geographical location seems to be the most important factor while choosing a port, followed by terminal intermodal connection efficiency and reliability, frequency of ship calling, inland delivery cost, port accessibility, flexibility to answer freight forwarders demands and port working hours. Benchmarking analysis showed that most of the terminals from the sample are inefficient, where mainly larger terminals based in the UK depicted higher efficiency scores above 80 %. Study found terminal operational efficiency is positively related to both seaside and landside terminal connectivity and port customer service. Productivity analysis showed high volatility in productivity change during the World economic crisis, with overall productivity loss, suggesting that terminals were mainly focused on terminal expansion rather than rationalisation of input use.","Freight Forwarders; Port Performance; Port Choice; DEA; Operational Efficiency; Malmquist Index; Container Terminals; COMEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor)","2013","It is estimated that 25% of the remaining oil and gas reserves worldwide are held in Arctic regions. The combined effects of a global resource depletion, climate change and technological progress, mean that this natural resource area is now increasingly interesting and commercially attractive. However, numerous challenges are present when it comes to hydrocarbon production in cold climate, not only related to suitable technology, but also to social and environmental issues. Any hydrocarbon development in the Arctic represents, thus, a balance between opportunity and risk. This thesis analyzes a broad range of aspects influencing offshore hydrocarbon field development scenarios in cold climate, emphasizing on terminals as a major building block necessary in the development of a petroleum field. Feasible, safe and cost effective terminal concepts for cold climate areas, face challenges that need specific assessment of technical solutions and operational aspects. Many of these challenges can be managed, though at additional cost, through the application of customised solutions. After having presented and gained the necessary knowledge and insight in the main issues influencing a cold climate terminal, an assessment of different development schemes is carried out, using for this purpose three case studies located in the Barents Sea: Johan Castberg, Snøhvit and Goliat fields. In this context, a quantitative assessment of breakwater stability in cold climate environments have been an important part of the discussions. Finally, given the complex and often unique risk challenges present in cold climate regions, risk assessment arise as an important part of the decision making process, and thus, has been used to understand the sensitivity of different development schemes. The Master thesis, therefore, provides an insight in the following aspects: - Aspects influencing offshore hydrocarbon field development scenarios in cold climate. - Technical issues influencing a cold climate terminal, with a thorough quantitative discussion of breakwater stability and design in cold climate. - Operational issues influencing a cold climate terminal. - Assessment of the sensitivity of different schemes through case study analysis. - Risk assessment for identification and evaluation of the main risks involved, applied to the case studies.","Oil and gas; Cold climate; Terminal; Breakwater; Risk assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Hol, J.M.A.M. (mentor); Beumler, T. (mentor); Wilson, G.S. (mentor)","2013","The most highly loaded frames of the newly developed Airbus A400M transport aircraft have glass reinforced aluminium laminate (Glare) straps attached to them to increase their resistance to fatigue damage. These straps were designed using static strength requirements for the frame. Basic justification was done in two steps. Firstly, the frame load was divided between frame and flange on the basis of in-plane stiffness of these parts. Secondly, a fatigue analysis was performed on the strap using an empirical model for fatigue of Glare laminates under tension. This report contains a thorough explanation of the development of a code which can be used to analyse the fatigue crack initiation and propagation characteristics of the combination of frame flange and Glare strap at once under variable amplitude loading. The choice was made for a modular implementation of a combination of analytical models. This allows the programme to analyse a large variety of cases and allows it to be adapted easily in the case it is decided to continue its development. The fatigue crack initiation model works in three stages. First, it computes the highest stress cycle occurring in the metal sheets of the laminate, second, it corrects this cycle to match the available SN-data, and third, it finds the corresponding cycles to initiation using the nearest matching SN-curve. Fatigue crack growth calculations are based on an analytical model which applies displacement compatibility at the delamination boundary, to solve for the crack tip stress intensity and subsequently calculate crack- and delamination growth characteristics. These displacements originate from four phenomena. One, the crack opens due to far-field stress in the metal layers. Two, there is also a crack opening effect because of the release of residual stress due to crack- and delamination growth. Three, crack closing occurs due to the bridging effect of the fibre layers. Four, the fibre layers elongate and deform due to the bridging load they sustain. The influence of variable amplitude loading on the laminate is taken into account by implementing the Wheeler yield zone model. Correct working of the code was verified by assessing whether the modules produced results equal to the codes they were based upon. The parts of the code that were made from scratch were verified by checking whether these parts reacted to input parameter changes in a way that matched expectations. Validation with a variety of test results proved that all the modules and combinations thereof produce results which corresponded to the experiments. The code that was developed for the research described in this report was used to evaluate Airbus' method of justification of their design of the Glare reinforced frame. It was shown that the method of justification is unconservative, which is likely due to the assumption that the load through the flange is redistributed to the strap. A study on ways to improve the design of the Glare reinforced frame flange showed, that the performance of the Glare-reinforced frame flange could be improved by increasing the amount of fibre layer in the cross section relative to the amount of metal.","A400M; Glare; fatigue; crack initiation; crack propagation; crack growth; variable amplitude; FML; fibre metal laminate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Design Methodologies","","Aerospace Structures","",""

(mentor); Zlatanova, S. (mentor); Veldhuis, C. (mentor)","2013","Where Level of Detail (LoD) allow City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) models to be shared over different application domains, only one LoD defines building interiors. As there are potentially numerous applications with a need for building interiors (but not with all the details as defined in LoD4), in order to attain a larger applicability the LoD system should be extended with building interiors in accordance with the existing exterior definitions. Since CityGML LoD2 is a common LoD, in this research it is investigated how to automatically generate interiors for LoD2 (resulting in a model called LoD2+) in which the details are comparable to those of the exteriors. A key application in the Netherlands for LoD2+ is the determination of net internal area of buildings (the surface area which can be used by building owners). This property is useful for many applications which require the size of buildings, but is especially important for real estate taxations and sales. The registration of these values by Dutch municipalities (via Basisregistratie Adressen en Gebouwen (BAG) - Key Register for Addresses and Buildings) is at the moment still a manual process (determined from building blueprints), and is therefore error-prone. This research dealt with the design of a finite set of shape rules to generate valid LoD2+ city models from a CityGML LoD2 model with a small amount of semantic information. Here LoD2+ is defined as the existing building solids complemented by inner shells for each storey in a premises where space is allocated for walls, roofs, ceilings and floors. Using Boolean set operations (e.g. union, intersection and difference) the building exteriors can be split in the right amount of storeys according to BAG and erosion can be applied to offset walls, roofs, ceilings and floors to obtain storey solids according to LoD2+. From LoD2+ buildings in which interior surfaces are classified, the net internal area of the majority of premises can be estimated. By calculating these values from LoD2+ city models a comparison can be done, resulting in the validation of both the net internal area in BAG and the LoD2+ city model. Significant errors are found in the BAG registration, since net internal area was mostly not recalculated after the net internal area standards were changed/introduced. For this research prototype software has been developed in C++ for the conversion of LoD2 to LoD2+ buildings and the calculation of net internal area.

Using exclusively the products sold in the stores. The products are inspired by Eastern rituals such as the Ayurveda ritual from India. The focus of this thesis is on the Rituals City Spas. In 2008 the first City Spa was built and over the years five more were built. The City Spa should strengthen the brand Rituals and improve sales in the stores. However after five years the City Spas have not reached their full potential. The amount of treatments booked are not at full capacity and several complaints have come regarding various aspects of the City Spa. Rituals stands behind their City Spas but has lost their intial vision they had in mind for their City Spas. A thorough research was conducted via a literature study, analysing wellness and beauty trends, benchmarking and visiting every City Spa location. This research concludes on these subjects and makes eleven recommendations. The first remarkable insight of this research was, the lack of communication of the City Spas. Comparing this to its international competitors it shows that Rituals stays behind. Rituals has a strong brand in the Netherlands and therefore should also look at the competitors closer to home, it must differentiate itself from both the national as international competitors. The second remarkable insight was that all the City Spa locations differ from eachother. There is no clear concept of what a Rituals City Spa is and offers. This matches Rituals’ lost vision on the City Spas. The treatments that are offered also do not stand out in their uniqueness. The interior of the City Spas has an ordinary look-and feel and does not remind the guest of where she/he is, in a Rituals City Spa. The Rituals City Spa must offer the guest something he cannot receive somewhere else or achieve at home. The City Spa should be more than just a treatment, it should be an experience. All insights combined lead to new ideas and concepts. A few recommendations earlier made, are discussed and taken in account with the idea generation. The communication was improved by increasing the awareness of the City Spa on the front of the store and also inside the store. During the entire graduation heaps of inspiration was found to create an ideal (fictive) Rituals City Spa. This ideal City Spa is shown with a scenario describing several elements of the City Spa and its ideal experience. Two new pieces of furniture were designed, a new design proposal for the Footspa and a proposal for a display cabinet. The Footspa design proposal was worked out in detail, and also in such a way that it can be applied in smaller City Spas with single modules. The Footspa was tested by building a mock-up. Three City Spa employees tested the new design and were very positive and enthusiastic of the new design. Of course also some remarks were made to improve the design proposal of the new Footspa. At the end of the thesis final recommendations are made on every aspect of the Rituals City Spa, including its presence in the online world.","Retail design; Spa & Wellness; Furniture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","","",""

This research consists of an extensive literature study that includes genetic algorithms, quantum genetic algorithms and construction scheduling. Existing applications of optimized design with genetic algorithms and quantum genetic algorithms are the theoretical basis for the hypothesis. Based on the theoretical research, an improved quantum genetic algorithm which is used for construction scheduling optimization design with the constraints of time and human resourcing is established and named as AQGA (A quantum genetic algorithm). A null hypothesis is taken: AQGA cannot help to improve the optimization design in civil engineering construction scheduling. Then a case study is done with AQGA: through the analogy with flow-shop scheduling, unit construction scheduling is chosen to be processed with AQGA. At the end of the case study, the flowchart of unit construction optimized design with improved quantum genetic algorithm AQGA is given, unit construction optimized design is realized through the improved quantum genetic algorithm There are some constraints and limitations in the study and research. For example there are simplified and idealized assumptions since a realistic simulation cannot be realized because there is no available quantum computer to run the simulation. But the unit construction scheduling optimize problem is expressed in quantum computing language. It is expected to be a starting point for future application of quantum genetic algorithms within construction scheduling in civil engineering projects and even more broad, quantum computing within civil engineering.","quantum genetic algorithm; construction scheduling; AQGA; unit construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

A swarm of robots equipped with sensors could be used in a variety of useful settings such as border patrol, monitoring water quality of the ocean with underwater robots, or – in case of the FireSwarm project – for finding dune fires with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This thesis was assigned by the research company Almende B.V. and is related to the FireSwarm project. The main idea behind projects like FireSwarm is that a large group of cheap UAVs with cheap less reliable sensors can search more effectively than one expensive UAV with more reliable sensors. Therefore, the main focus in this thesis is on the development of efficient robotic search strategies for different sensor representations. The robotic search problem that is defined in this thesis is the problem of finding an important point (a fire) in a predefined search area as fast as possible with autonomous UAVs. Herein, a clear distinction is made between search with perfect (deterministic) sensors and search with more realistic and imperfectly (stochastically) modeled sensors. The modeling of the fire sensors is very general in order to be able to represent any kind of (fire) sensor. This is achieved by, instead of qualitatively modeling the effect of each factor on the fire sensor, modeling the sensor as a simple stochastic process. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the tests performed in this thesis. First, the optimal strategy for search with a single UAV, with perfect deterministic sensors, is shown to be a predefined sweeping path. Furthermore, the methods proposed in this thesis for predefining a search path for multiple UAVs with deterministic sensors resulted in near- optimal performance. Secondly, it is concluded that for increasingly stochastic sensors, the predefined sweeping path is easily outperformed by the simple greedy strategy proposed in this thesis. So, because of the general representation of the search problem, the results found in this thesis cannot only contribute to the development of fast efficient algorithms for the FireSwarm project but also to other real-world (robotic) search problems.","Robotic Search; UAVs; Multiple Robots; Stochastic sensors; FireSwarm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Unfortunately it is often impossible (or uneconomical) to design a structure that will fit this requirement. That is why structures are designed with a certain allowable probability of failure, displayed by the overlap of the probability distribution functions in the figure. To design a structure with a certain probability of failure, the probability distribution function of both the load and the strength should be known. The load of waves can be determined using wave energy and the frequency of waves which can be determined using prediction formulas. The inaccuracy of the parameters in these formulas play a major role in the probabilistic design of structures, because the distribution function of the wave-load is directly influenced by it. There are plenty of prediction formulas for wind waves, but only a few formulas exist for wind waves in water of finite depth.

(mentor); De Vlugt, E. (mentor)","2013","Offset muscle activation is the constant neural firing to muscles, even at rest, defining the minimum muscle contraction. Until now, the offset muscle activation has been neglected in the analysis of the dynamical behavior of joints. There is a clinical need for an assessment method to estimate the contribution of the offset muscle activation to the total joint torque in stroke patients, in order to choose the optimum treatment method. The goal of this study was to develop a method that estimates the offset muscle activation of the wrist joint muscles in vivo, in addition to other contributions from tissue viscoelasticity and stretch reflexes. For this purpose, an existing one-sided neuromuscular model of the ankle was extended to a two-sided wrist model for full biomechanical characterization over the whole range of flexion-extension movement. The model parameters (including offset activation, amongst others) were estimated from measured wrist torque, angle and EMG as recorded during imposed ramp-and-hold flexion and extension rotation. It was found that offset muscle activation was present at rest, in both stroke patients and healthy controls. Both offset activity of the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and reflex activity of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) were increased in stroke patients compared to controls. The viscoelastic behavior of the FCR was changed in patients compared to controls. From the results of this study it was concluded that following stroke a constant muscle force can be applied by the ECR, which may act as a counterbalance to the altered tissue viscoelasticity and possible shortening of the FCR muscle (or vice versa). Apparently, a new antagonistic force balance had developed around the wrist joint in the stroke patients, having a structural origin on one side and an active (neural) origin on the opposite side. The results may be of importance for targeted treatment of the movement disorder, when choosing for casting, drug therapy or surgical intervention.","offset muscle activation; stroke; increased joint stiffness; neuromuscular; parameter estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-23","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

The most striking aspect in the elaboration of the different opportunities is that the most influential opportunities are (partly) driven by impacts on external factors. Due to improvements in the design of a civil engineering project, great benefits can be obtained at external factors in the field of sustainability. A typical example is the reduction of rolling resistance. this reason an important conclusion might be that in future, more focus need to be given on the influences on external factors, whereas improvements at the project itself will become less emphatically. It even might be the case that less sustainable solutions in the construction of the project itself will become very sustainable as a result of spectacular improvements to the external factors. In the course of the research it has also become clear that for the application of a sustainability approach it is essential to define a coherent and correct strategy where a thorough attention is needed for each layer in the strategy. It can be noticed that, based on the experiences as a result of the evaluation of a couple of sustainability approaches, in many cases insufficient attention is given to the correct formulation of a sustainability approach. As long as the ambitions and the applied criteria in the procurement process are not coherent to each other, the ambitions can be well stated, the criteria can be well formulated, but still the mission, vision and objectives will not be met. This results in an improperly functioning approach.

The SWASH output discharges are smaller than the 5% lower limit of Eurotop and Neural Network predictions. Nevertheless, they were close values and they have the same order of magnitude, which is very important when comparing overtopping values. No refection analysis was done. The smaller discharges are believed to be explained by the fact that SWASH does not describe splash, and therefore, only overtopping due to waves running up the slope, but not due to “spray” is taken into account. In addition to this, it is thought that SWASH does not model accurately enough wave breaking over abrupt changes in bottom geometry or steep slopes resulting in underestimation of overtopping. On the other hand, SWASH is not able to predict wave overtopping at rubble mound breakwaters. A breakwater is not well modelled in SWASH, because porous structures are dealt as a numerical dissipation box and not as a physical obstacle for incoming waves. As a result, waves are damped but not diverted upwards, so there is no overtopping. The reasons why this happens and some recommendations are given in this thesis.

Social networking sites, Internet banking, online communities, all gather and store data concerning their users preferences, interactions or activities. This data is strongly relational and can be represented in the form of graphs where a Vertex represents the subject of the information and Edges represent its interaction or connections with other entities. The purpose of using resources to store these large amounts of information is later processing that will lead to useful result derivation. Hence, we are dealing with graph processing. The large amount of information is leading to distributed graph processing for result calculation within a ?nite time. Distributed large-scale graph processing, is a computational intensive task that entails many challenges such as distributed programming and knowledge of platform speci?c architectural characteristics. One approach that attempts to make the graph processing easy, platform independent and ef?cient, is Google’s Pregel model. Pregel’s computational model is based on an iterative program representation with two distinct entities (Master, Worker), that abstracts distribution related details behind a ?exible, user friendly API. In this project, using C++ and MPI we implement a Pregel clone, called MPI2, and we evaluate its performance in the DAS4 cluster of TU Delft using three well studied graph processing algorithms(i.e,Page Rank, BFS, APSP).We conclude that the Pregel system successfully abstracts the graph processing task to a level where platform speci?c information is transparent. Furthermore, we observe that the system scales with the increasing number of computing nodes without introducing extra communication overhead.

(mentor)","2013","Minimally Invasive Surgery or MIS is a branch of surgery focused on reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures, accomplished by minimizing the size and number of incisions. The approach inevitable leads to confinement of the operational space and restricts the movement of the used instrumentation. In this thesis, a MIS procedure called Endonasal Skull Base Surgery (ESBS) is presented to illustrate the need for maneuverable instruments. The maneuverability of an instrument can be enhanced by adding one or multiple cable-actuated steerable elements to the tip of the instrument. Currently the cables in these (multi-)steerable instruments are placed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the steerable element. This thesis proposes the use of helix cables as means of multi-steerable actuating, wherein the cables are rotated along the longitudinal axis of the steerable element. A force driven two dimensional simulation model was developed and validated in order to analyze the actuation behavior of helix cables in a steerable element. The results enabled the creation of a mechanical control method, which is integrated in a demonstrational prototype. The prototype reveals three additional functionalities to a steerable element: 1) The expansion of the shape domain of a steerable element, resulting a higher diversity of possible direction and position combinations of the tip. 2) The incorporation of a local positional stiffness of the tip. 3) The incorporation of a sampling behavior between the control handle and tip, meaning that only cable-induced shape-modes of the handle are passed on to the tip.","MIS instruments helix-cable actuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2013","The need to create a more flexible and modern electricity system, which additionally can attribute to energy savings, has been started in the Netherlands in the 1990’s beginning with the introduction of liberalization and unbundling of those corporations responsible for electricity production and transport. Creating a more flexible and modern electricity system requires for instance the integration of small scale decentralized electricity production by individual consumers, with large scale centralized electricity production by corporations. Considerable technical and social modifications are required to make this system work. An electricity system that makes considerable use of ICT and information is required which is called a smart grid. One essential element in this smart grid is the smart meter. Small scale residential consumers can equip their homes with a smart meter. This smart meter can collect information concerning energy flows, can be used to automate certain tasks and can be employed to provide feedback to the consumer concerning energy usage. This feedback can be used by the consumer to engage in energy saving strategies. Consumers will need to accept smart meters, by which we mean that consumers will voluntarily make use of a smart meter. When many consumers accept these smart meters, the diffusion of smart meters is high. The Dutch government would like to have a situation where the diffusion of smart meters is at least 80%. This level is required by European law and is set in such a way as that it enables effective functioning of the smart grid. The acceptance of smart meters by an individual consumer is not a static phenomenon. Consumers have certain attitudes towards smart meters based on the social class to which they belong, but these attitudes can be influenced. Consumers can exchange information with each other and can receive information from for instance the media. These information exchanges can lead to adjustment of their attitudes towards smart meters. We take advantage of these facts and have made use of agent-based modeling and simulation to simulate the effect of information exchanges between consumers. The “Diffusion of Smart Meters Model and Simulation” can be used to study how over time the average acceptance of smart meters by a group of consumers changes due to the exchange of opinions between the consumers within this group. Additionally we can examine the effect of exposing consumers to positive information through the media. The design of the agent-based model and simulation presented in this thesis is guided by a conceptual framework and metamodel which has been created specifically to assist researchers in the design of agent-based models and simulations of socio-technical systems. This conceptual framework and metamodel deals with the sanctioning of these models sand simulations. We contend that the notion of traditional validation of a model and simulation is not applicable in the case of agent-based models and simulations of socio-technical systems which often exhibit complex and non-linear behaviors. This notion of traditional validation, which is intended at proving that a model and simulation corresponds well to the real world, is only applicable in the case where we have relatively simple problem situations which we intend to study with well understood models and simulations. When we have deal with complex problem situations and relatively complex models and simulations, we cannot prove that a model and simulation corresponds well to the real world. We now sanction our model and simulation, during which we test if we THINK if the model and simulation corresponds well to our problem situation. This sanctioning is a more subjective assessment of the usefulness of the model and simulation. The results from this simulation study indicate that a higher level of smart meter acceptance can be realized by making use of media influence and by letting consumers of a higher social class meet with each other. A high level of acceptance of smart meters by many individual consumers again will lead to a high diffusion of smart meters throughout society. The conceptual framework and meta-model have proven to be useful to be able to sanction the model and simulation compared to a traditional validation of the model and simulation. Sanctioning of this model and simulation has lead to the development of a simulation heuristic which has been used to provide a solution to the smart metering problem. the conceptual framework and metamodel are still in their initial design stage and will require additional improvements over time.","agent-based modeling and simulation; smart meters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","SEPAM","",""

Therefore offshore turbines are being made larger to economize in the support structure and installation costs. As the technology for wind turbines improves, the industry has developed wind turbines with rotor diameters as large as 150 m and power ratings of 8.0 MW. It is the intention to build wind farms in water depths of even 60 meters. The combination of increasing water depths, increasing wind tower heights and rotor blade diameters creates loads that complicate the foundation design.

(mentor)","2013","Traditional (sequential) applications use malloc for a variety of dynamic data structures, like linked lists or trees. GPGPU is gaining attention and popularity because its massively-parallel architecture allows for great speed improvement for programs that can be parallelised and implemented for a platform like OpenCL. Programmers who try to port their existing sequential or even parallel program to OpenCL however will soon discover that this standard defines a subset of C with several limitations, one of which is the absence of a malloc() routine that can be called from an OpenCL kernel. This document describes the results of research towards the impact of this limitation by trying to answer the question: ``How should a kernel-side heap allocator be implemented in OpenCL?''. To give an answer to this question, two important aspects are investigated. Firstly we seek the impact from the programmers perspective by trying to understand the use-cases for which a parallel program requires an in-kernel heap allocator. We sought for a wide variety of implementations of parallel algorithms and investigated their memory usage patterns. Secondly we aim to explain the complexity of a dynamic memory allocator by taking a closer look at the limitations imposed by hardware and the OpenCL standard, and trying to find a way to implement a memory allocator in OpenCL. Based on our findings we present KMA, the first dynamic memory allocator for OpenCL kernels. Results from our use-case survey show that there are several cases where a programmer could benefit from an in-kernel malloc routine. Non-regular data-structures are required both for scheduling purposes and for holding intermediate results, and a memory allocator aids in creating these structures. Programmers usually find their way around the lack of a malloc routine, sometimes by creating something on their own that resembles part of one. Although a malloc routine thus is not a hard requirement, it can make the life of programmers a lot easier in these cases. Designing and implementing a memory allocator for OpenCL is far from trivial. Its capabilities are limited by the available hardware and language constraints: hardware does not allow for communication between the OpenCL kernel and the host system, and the OpenCL specification lacks fundamental features like mutex locks. Because of these constraints, even the data-structures we might take for granted, like full-featured doubly-linked-lists, cannot be implemented in OpenCL. We believe a memory allocator should be implemented in two layers. The bottom layer should implement behaviour like the malloc() routine found in C. On top of that data types can be implemented which may use datatype-specific restrictions to optimise the usage of the low-level memory allocator. Our KMA prototype shows that by carefully analysing the limitations of the OpenCL environment it is possible to implement an in-kernel memory allocator, be it limited by the constraints imposed by the GPU platform and OpenCL. Although using KMA comes with a performance penalty, it can offer the flexibility and code readability for the use-cases we identified, and offers the right level of support for optimisations if the use-case permits.","OpenCL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor); Fens, T. (mentor)","2013","In this thesis, technical-institutional arrangements for the financial settlement of prosumers are considered, with which the low-voltage distribution network efficiency can possibly be improved. The potential and impact of prosumers on the distribution low-voltage network were evaluated by a load-flow model. The performance indicators of network efficiency, with regard to the impact of prosumers on te low-voltage network, were found to be: network capacity; network real power losses;and network voltage magnitude. It was found that the nett maximum RDG feed-in, especially during peak periods, is indicative of the impact of each prosumer on the capacity of the low-voltage network, with: - The degree of correlation between RDG instantaneous output and local consumption is determinative of the total load on network capacity. - By shifting ?-CHP (combined heat power) generation of real power to off-peak periods, capacity utilization is improved. - Curtailing PV (photovoltaics) generation of real power is effective in improving capacity utilization. The nett power generation pattern is indicative of the impact of each prosumer on the real power losses of the low-voltage network, with: - The degree of correlation between RDG output and local consumption is determinative of the total volume to be transported. - Shifting ?-CHP generation or curtailing PV generation, in order to match local demand is effective in lowering real power losses. - Curtailing PV output not effective, since network losses will always be smaller than the volume curtailed. Furthermore, it was found that the network voltage magnitude is not threatened by RDG nor can it be regulated effectively, without high numbers of RDG with voltage control capabilities. Given these results of the load-flow model, regulated tariffs for prosumers are considered. Connection tariffs for prosumers are recommended to remain shallow, since for a deep tariff the computation of the fee is problematic, resulting in obscure tariffs and unfair treatment of new entrants. Prosumers charged shallow connection tariffs are however indifferent of their impact on the distribution network efficiency. Therefore a (limited) prosumer specific network tariff with smart metering is proposed. Capacity issues are expected to occur for only short periods during a day, the smart meter is only required to store and communicate usage data over this period. This way data acquisition and processing costs can be severely limited. Given that losses are a quadratic function of the current, the value of RDG generation is dependent on the total load on the distribution system. Providing incentives to reduce network losses can be applied by distinguishing between periods of high and low load, applying the high and low indexes provided by the smart meter. The prosumer network tariff is then applied with limited costly real-time metering. The smart meter functions can be extend such that time-of-use signals can be provided to prosumers. With high enough RDG presence in LV-networks, time-of-use charges or bonuses could be provided as an incentive to prosumers in order to adjust their generation to distribution system needs. The technical-institutional arrangements that can capture the RDG impact and potential is than characterized by a prosumer specific tariff, employing smart meters, that promotes prosumer participation in the provision of network services.","RDG; institutional arrangements; load flow analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-05-24","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Infrastructures","","EPA","",""

The comparison is good and the general conclusion of our study is, that it is very well possible to simulate core-annular flow through a pipe using the volume-of-fluid method. We also checked the generality of characteristics for the wave at the core-annular interface as proposed in the literature. In a qualitative sense we confirmed these characteristics. However, there are quantitative differences. An explanation for this discrepancy is suggested. Besides vertical also horizontal core-annular is studied. For these cases pressure variations in the water layer counterbalance forces generated by a density difference. Furthermore is shown that a stable core-annular flow can exist even without surface tension. In the end results are given for pressure drop reduction.

Within these new multicultural and information rich environments, new forms of social cohesion are constantly formed and challenged; an interesting opportunity lies in designing new ways to leverage local social capital. Afrikaanderwijk is a highly multicultural neighbourhood in Rotterdam South. Although it has a low social index compared to the rest of Rotterdam (and of The Netherlands) it is considered a neighbourhood with opportunities. Consequently, many initiatives have spurred in the last years as part of a National action plan to improve the relatively disadvantaged conditions of the inhabitants, leveraging the unique characteristics it withholds. The ethnic diversity of the neighbourhood is treated in a polarized way: on one hand, it is seen as an important element of richness in a rapidly changing society as the one of Rotterdam, a living lab for new social practices; on the other, the generally low level of education of the inhabitants and their different ethnic background are somewhat stigmatizing them, relegating them in a lower level of society, with slim opportunities given by the local work and social environment to improve their condition. An especially crude situation is observed within the Afrikaander youth. Despite incentives given to initiatives for children, women, and elderly, youngsters seem completely neglected by policy makers. These youth usually attend lower education institutions and have little or no initiatives promoted by the neighbourhood to stimulate their passions and talents after school hours. Furthermore, they are frequently stigmatized as problematic; a common observation regarding young Turkish/Moroccan boys who hang around in groups in public spaces, doing nothing or worse. They often do not have anything better to do than hang around, a practice more common to Mediterranean or Latin cultures, but seen with a certain degree of suspicion within Dutch society. The lack of initiatives within their own local society is aggravated by their poor education level; an immigrant with a low education level (or even no diploma at all) is not attractive to employers, therefore the chances of these youngsters to fulfil their dreams to become better citizens and gain success is very slim. Yet these young adults do have passions, interests, and talents. However, local institutions do not seem to understand the potential of uncovering and exploiting these qualities for societal benefit. The current project, therefore, proposes a more viral, decentralized way of stimulating youth’s self-organization using social media and mobile technologies. Interestingly, young adults interviewed displayed a natural fluency in their relationship with new technologies: smart phones, game consoles and social media are embedded in their everyday life. Obviously belonging to the first generation of digital natives, who “think and process information fundamentally differently from their predecessors” (Premsky, 2001). They withhold an inherent potential that can be unlocked in innovative ways, stirring educators and policy makers towards future-oriented talent development programs. Inspired by the contemporary Open Design movement, the current project exploits young digital natives’ potential by co-creating with them a means for their empowerment through a peer-to-peer talent development platform. The corresponding step-by-step workshop concept IK BEN STER(K) was proposed and co-designed with Sophie, a coach from the Wijkschool Feijenoord Rotterdam Offensief and performed with the Wijkschool students on a weekly basis over a period of a month. During six workshop steps the students were progressively made familiar with different open source tools such as: Thingiverse, an crowd sourced collection of open designs created for 3D printing and laser cutting, Tinkercad an open online 3D modeling tool to create personal designs for 3D printing and laser cutting, Instructables, an online How To and DIY community where people share their inspiring projects and inventions, the Ultimaker an open source 3D printing machine available at CityLab Rotterdam. The workshop inspired the design of a new interaction scenario for the workshop experience, with a Facebook group as the digital platform for the resulting hybrid community, and two sets of ubiquitous devices as the intermediaries between the digital and physical interactions of the participants. The touch points and the wireframe of the new product service system have been designed optimizing the steps of the workshop, and evaluated with the students during a new workshop on laser cutting. A refinement of the entire product service system (both the digital Facebook page and the ubiquitous devices) followed the workshop evaluation and tested again to verify its acceptance in the student community of the Wijkschool. The final workshop platform is envisioned as a product service system using the Open Data released by the young adults through the documented workshops (via Instructables or similar means of knowledge sharing), and identifying each contribution as a valuable piece of his/her own skills’ portfolio. Members of the community have their own interactive “community membership ID”, a RFID connected token which enables them to personalize and to be recognized in multiple access points of the neighbourhood (e.g., clubs or cultural centres). A more active member will benefit more and will be recognized as a valuable citizen. Other challenges exist, especially on the level of the young adults’ acceptance to be visible to their local community. A reward system could be a possible solution, in terms of enhanced work opportunities or special treats in local stores or cultural centres. The relevance of the project is two-folded: on one hand to increase the level of participation of the youth in their neighbourhood, on the other to allow them to self-promote their value within their own community using new open technologies. Fostering their skills and talents enabled them to contribute to increased social capital of the Afrikaanderwijk, and desirably, of the wider context of Rotterdam. The current pilot serves as a “best practice”, inspiring future social interventions with similar socio-cultural characteristics and affordances.","product service system; talent empowerment; ubiquitous technology; hybrid community platform; social innovation; disadvantaged neighbourhood; young adults","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

The BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)can be used to measure and certify the buildings environmental performance. This book aims to provide readers with a basic understanding of BREEAM, by answering several questions, like what is the background of sustainability? How does BREEAM work? What are sustainability issues described in BREEAM? And how is BREEAM implemented in practice? This book is written for anyone interested in understanding how BREEAM works, and is specically aimed at first-time BREEAM users. Users of this book can be architects, ‘non-sustainability’ building professionals (for example structural engineers) and students. However, this book can also be used by project developers, clients and project managers. This guide is focused on the Norwegian BREEAM but is useful for all BREEAM-versions.","AR0531 Smart & Bioclimatic Design","en","student report","","","","","","","Campus only","","Architecture","Architectural Engineering & Technology","","","",""

The current facilities of the Port of Havana are however in a state of heavy decay and the city is not able to receive tourists travelling by yacht or ferry. For this reason the master plan Tourist Port Havana has been created. The objective is to find a feasible solution in the Havana Bay to receive large numbers of tourists that will visit the city by yacht or ferry. This has resulted in the design of Marina La Coubre, which holds enough berths for 276 yachts of varying sizes, and the design of Havana International Ferry Terminal. With its four berths, the ferry terminal can process ferry lines connecting Havana and for instance Key West, Miami, Tampa, the Bahamas or Cancún. The Ensenada de Atarés in the west of the Bay of Havana is a prime location for both components. The location is close to the historic city centre of Havana, and sufficient area is available on land as well as on water. From a hydrodynamic point of view, the Atarés bay is suitable due to the absence of currents that can be of hindrance to yachts. Locally generated wind waves are however of concern and to ensure the quality of Marina La Coubre a floating breakwater is required. The roads around the port are adapted so the extra generated traffic can be distributed without blocking the through flow. Marina La Coubre is connected to a new roundabout, with a layout that increases the traffic safety. Traffic towards the Havana International Ferry Terminal is rerouted to increase the capacity of the network. Marina La Coubre and Havana International Ferry Terminal are two great assets to the city of Havana and fit neatly in the master plan Tourist Port Havana. The designed components ensure that the port will be able to receive large numbers of tourists visiting the city by yacht or ferry. When evaluating the project, there are however some challenges that arise. The nautical analysis has shown that due to an increase in nautical traffic in the bay, the entrance channel becomes a bottleneck. If the Port of Havana decides to focus on tourism, the attractiveness of the port as a destination for cargo vessels decreases significantly. A decision should be made whether the future of the Port of Havana is as a tourist port or a cargo port. This report makes clear that a combination of both will lead to conflict. The financial and economic evaluations of the project show that without incorporating indirect effects to the local economy, the project has limited viability. Financial support by the government is however justified, as the project generates extra value to the society.","Cuba; Ferry terminal; Marina","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering, Section Transport and Planning","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering; Transport and Planning","","","",""
