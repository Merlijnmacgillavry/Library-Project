Most of the buildings in these cities are founded on the foundation layer above the compressible layer. Therefore this compressible layer can induce problems when the soil pressure increases significantly due to the weight of the high-rise buildings. This deformation can cause inclination of the floors, damage to the structural and non-structural elements of the building. Therefore the structural design of a building must appropriately be designed to respond or resist these deformations.<br/><br/>The deformation, which causes the problems in the building itself, is the differential deformation (sagging). This is unequal deformation over the entire plot of the building. The uniform deformation of the building does not induce problems in the structure itself, but it can damage the adjacent buildings because the soil under these buildings will deform (hogging). The construction sequence decreases the problem for the higher levels because the deformation of the compressible layer start occurring during construction, and these levels are constructed horizontally independent on the amount of deformation of the<br/>soil.<br/><br/>For this research, the following mitigating measures are considered: changing the construction sequence; increase the length of the foundation pile; application of a camber; increase the stiffness of the foundation slab; increase the stiffness of the superstructure; application of a jack-down system.<br/><br/>The primary factors which are affecting the applicability of the mitigating measures are the amount of settlement, the soil structure, and the time-dependent behavior. By a significant settlement of the soil, the mitigating measures of applying a camber and increasing the stiffness of the structure are not possible or less favorable. The soil structure determines if increasing the length of the foundation piles is possible, this mitigating measure put the foundation piles in the second foundation layer, which is situated under the compressible layer. With this measure, the problem of the compressible layer is solved, but it is an expensive mitigating measure. Adjusting the construction sequence depends on the time-dependent behavior of the settlement. It can be an option when the settlement happens mostly during construction. When the settlement of the soil takes longer than the construction time, the jack-down system can be applied to adjust the structure when needed, even when the building is finished.<br/><br/>The application of the jack-down system is definitely worth considering when a high-rise building is built on compressible soil. The other mitigating measures can be applied too, however, only under very specific conditions. This makes the jack-down system the most favorable mitigating measure.<br","High-Rise Buildings; Compressible Soil; Structural Behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robotic fabrication and Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) can play an important role in this change, but there is a lot of uncertainty and ignorance about the design process of robotically fabricated CLT elements. This uncertainty is primarily caused by the application of linear workflows instead of integral ones. Within the fields of robotic fabrication and CLT, the research narrows down to the robotic milling process of CLT connection panels. Therefore, this research intends to answer the following question by means of four different parts: What does an integral workflow for robotically fabricated customized CLT connection panels look like, that promote exploration of the structural performance of CLT structures in the preliminary design phase? Part I Literature Study Part II Pilot Study Part III Integral Workflow Development Part IV Discussions The Literature Study focusses on two fields, namely the field of CLT and the field of robotic fabrication. In the final chapter of this part, the mutual affordances and constraints of these fields are discussed as these significantly influence the design space of the integral workflow. The second part concerns the production of a small mock-up to explore the process of robotic fabrication. The literature and pilot study together serve as input for the development of the integral workflow in the third part of the research. This workflow is developed in the parametric environment of Grasshopper and is divided in three modules: Global Structure, Joint Design, Robotic Fabrication. For the Joint Design, focus is laid on CLT connection panels of which the principle is derived from a reference project in Alblasserdam (NL). The main conclusions on the research question consist of the relationships and (in)dependencies between the different modules. Another important conclusion is that one cannot apply CLT in the outdoor environment without applying shedding to ensure complete moisture control. To increase the integrality of the workflow as developed in this research, more feedback loops across the three modules should be integrated. For instance, the affordances and constraints of the robotic fabrication process should be integrated within the relationships between the three modules. Hence, if doing so, this information was available in an early stage of the design process and would decrease the uncertainty of it. This implementation could be investigated by producing a mock-up study along the integral workflow.","Cross laminated Timber; Robotic fabrication; Integral workflow; CLT connection panel; Preliminary design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Jumbo Maritime is a company specialized in handling and transporting substantial cargoes which did not fit into a container. To compete in the heavy lift shipping market, a well-balanced fleet composition is essential. In the current situation, the heavy lift cargoes are transported by a fleet consisting of ten vessels, having a varying crane lifting capacity from 3000*10^3 to 650 *10^3 kilogram (Class K, H, J and E). However, in the past five years, it has become apparent that the deployment of the vessels based on the heaviest item (between 75-100% of the capacity) has only been needed in a meagre five percent of all transportations. The installed crane capacity on the Jumbo vessels are an overcapacity compared to the demand of the market. During this research, a decision support tool is developed to improve the match between the demand from the market in the heavy lift cargo industry and the supply of the heavy lift shipping vessels. This will result in an improved fleet composition that maximizes profit. Subsequently, the tool has been examined to see whether it can henceforth be applied to the fleet composition to support Jumbo Maritime in its leading role of supplying heavy loads.The Maritime Fleet Size &amp; Mix Problem model was used to find the optimal fleet composition. The goal of this model is to maximize profit, achieved from transport orders based on reduced cost of the vessels. Considering that the proceeds of a load depend on market demand, the transport data of the past five years has been used as an input parameter. A fleet is chosen by taking into consideration both the technical and financial aspects. The technical aspect is the maximum combined crane capacity installed on the vessels. The financial aspects of the vessels exist of capital costs, labour costs, fuel costs and maintenance costs. The result of this model will lead to an optimization in the distribution of the vessel.Subsequently, the vessels that are at the end of their life will be replaced in the near future. The Vessels classified under H and E will be replaced by a variety of the newer J-light classes. The decision about the composition of the new vessels in the Jumbo fleet should be supported by the optimization model. The new vessels will be used as input in the model, together with the prediction data of possible future market needs. These future predictions will consist of three scenarios: 1) the demand will stay the same as it has been for the past five years; 2) Demands will rise with 6% due to an increase in the oil and gas industry; 3) a 35% increase in the renewable energy related market. The result of the three scenarios will be a new fleet composition with a corresponding profit.An optimal fleet composition will be the result when the transport data of the past five years, together with the current fleet characteristics, are used as input for the Maritime Fleet Size &amp; Mix Problem. The current fleet composition [2:4:2:2] is in the optimized situation as followed [1:2:1:8], whereby the theoretical gain increases from 108 million to 181 million. When the future scenarios one, two and three together with the new vessel types (K: J: J-900: J-800: J-700: J-600) are introduced, new optimum fleet compositions arise. The new optimized compositions are as follows: scenario one: [1:1:0:1:0:6] with a profit of 56 million, scenario two: [1:1:0:1:0:6] with a profit of 68 million and scenario three [1:1:0:1:0:6] with a profit of 58 million.The results of the Maritime Fleet Size &amp; Mix Problem show that the profit can be optimized with an alternative fleet composition. The mathematical model determines the composition of the fleet by using the transport data from the past five years. The optimization model is subjected to a number of assumptions to approach the reality. By also using the Maritime Fleet Size &amp; Mix Problem model with the introduction of the J-light and combining it with the three different future scenarios, the vessel type with a combined crane capacity of 600 tonnes appears to be the most efficient in the J-light class.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The LooWee was developed in collaboration an electric wheelchair user in search for a new toileting solution for female wheelchair users. The goal of this thesis was the further research the idea and design a new toileting solution that could replace the available tools. Currently, adult diapers or a catheter are the only options, but these are medically unnecessary. The two main issues with these tools are discomfort and capacity. They are either painful or wonât last the whole day. Limiting the userâs mobility and having a negative effect on their quality of life. Based on previous prototypes and the client experience, this thesis focussed on finding the most suitable design direction. Incorporating a tool into the wheelchair seat would fit most in the given context. However, it came with multiple challenges. The client sits on an orthosis and making alterations can influence the performance of the seat. Which was a problem that occurred in the previous prototype. Therefore the chosen concept focused on incorporating a urination tool without making large changes to the orthosis. Figure 1 shows only one small change is made to the bottom layer of the seat. Which is the ergonomic shape of the seat, which determines its performance. The embodiment of the chosen concept focussed on comfort and functionality. The different aspects of the concept were further researched. Prototyping and material testing were used to detail the design. In the end, all the results were gathered into the final design, as it is shown in Figure 1. The LooWee can be added to a Lewis orthosis. This seat has a tilted orientation, which is used by the LooWee to drain the urine to the back of the seat. A silicone product is sunken into the seat, to keep it leveled with the top of the seat. A curved shape sticks out from the seat surface with the opening. This curve will form to the userâs body and capture the urine directly at the source. Urination through the opening will help control the unpredictable female urine stream and prevent spilling. A toplayer will cover the silicone part, for comfort (mask the feeling of sitting on an opening) and to prevent sweat. The drained urine is stored at the back of the wheel, provides enough room to store the urine of a whole day. The embodied design was validated with a comfort and functionality test.","Wheelchair; urination tool; Prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The fatality rate of non-military helicopters is about 1.44 per 100,000 ight hours [9].

Currently, the visitors of the museum have a rather passive role and are merely subjected to the visual artworks in the museum. The museum desires to give the visitors more insight in the world behind photography, such as the photographic process, the invention and developments of the photo camera or the process of developing photographs in the dark room. This project explores the possibilities to let the visitors of the Nederlands Fotomuseum experience the world behind photography in an active, co-participatory way. First an analysis of the context is made: The museumâs vision, goals and ways of working. The way other museums handle interactive, educative installations. The desires of the visitors and motivation for coming. The way photographers work and what they desire. The principles of the photo camera. This is followed by an exploration of three promising scopes. Resulting from the analysis, the design goal is re-defined as: âDesign an educational interactive experience for the visitor of the Nederlands Fotomuseum with a rechargers motive and no experience with photography. This experience needs to make this target group take a longer and better educated look at photographs to let them experience what it is like to be a photographer and what it takes to make a photographâ. The developing stage shows the creative process towards coming up with a design proposal fulfilling the design goal and meeting the requirements. This is done through a process of ideation, conceptualization and validation. Next, the design proposal is given, consisting of a presentation of the total design, an explanation of the envisioned co-participatory interaction, and a more detailed design of the mechanical part of the design proposal. Finally, the project is concluded by evaluating the design proposal on the requirements, discussing the feasibility, desirability and viability, and posing the recommendations for further research and development.","Museum experience; Experience design; Interaction design; Co-participation; Installation design; Photography; Cameras","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This research proposes using the lateral deviation of the automated vehicle within its lane as a method to communicate if it is going to yield to the pedestrian. In a crowdsourced experiment, videos containing an approaching automated vehicle were shown to participants. The effect of 1) levels of deviation (no deviation, deviation of 0.4 m, 0.8 m and 1.2 m), 2) direction of deviation (towards pedestrian, away from pedestrian), 3) vehicle behaviour (yielding, not yielding), 4) onset of deviation (onset at a distance of 50 m and 30 m from the pedestrian), and 5) intended vehicle path (vehicle going straight, vehicle taking a turn) were studied. A between-subjects design was used to assign participants (total N = 945; and after filtering, N = 638) randomly to one of 4 groups based on 1) the deviation direction-behaviour mapping (deviation towards pedestrian was âyieldingâ and away was ânon-yieldingâ, deviation towards pedestrian was ânon-yieldingâ, away was âyieldingâ) and 2) instructions at the experiment start (not informed of the vehicle deviation, informed of the deviation). Each participant viewed 28 videos, and the task was to press and hold a key as long as it felt safe to cross. The results showed that 1) vehicle deviation to indicate yielding led to a statistically significant improvement in willingness to cross, for all four groups 2) the deviation level was significant when comparing the two extreme values (0.4 m and 1.2 m) for the yielding trials in two of four groups, 3) for one group there was a statistically significant difference in willingness to cross when the vehicle indicates that it intends to take a turn versus when it intends to go straight ahead. It is concluded that lateral deviation of the vehicle, when used to communicate yielding intent. affects the pedestriansâ willingness to cross the road.","Pedestrian Crossing Behaviour; Automated vehicles; nonverbal communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Human Factors","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The automobile industry has been continuously working on bringing automation in motor vehicles for the betterment of human life. Advancement in technology has helped companies manufacture cars that can drive and navigate on their own called Autonomous vehicles (AVs). There are numerous effects of AVs on society. The AVs are forecast to bring enormous changes in the labor market. The objective of the study is to understand how the introduction of AVs will impact the labor market related to skills and job types in The Netherlands. There has been a fear that changes in geography and technological change threatens the employeeâs mismatch with their skill and job. Over multiple decades this mismatch has increased the demand for new skills and the supply is maintained by increasing the education level of workers. This demand for skill is due to technological change and it is predicted that there will be similar changes due to the introduction of AVs. To achieve the objective of this research, 13 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the academicians from the universities of The Netherlands and experts from labor organizations of The Netherlands. Interview questions were generated with the help of the conceptual model which was generated by the literature. From the result of the interview, it can be concluded that the AVs will not be having a major impact on the labor market and the problem will be very minimal related to skill and job types. Skill mismatch is not a major concern in The Netherlands and it will be only persisting for a short duration. There will be an increase in jobs and skills related to ICT and the supervision of AVs. Furthermore, interviewees claimed that the skill mismatch problem will not emerge if the introduction of AVs to the society is done incrementally and gradually. Based on the result, it is recommended for the future study should focus on quantifying the impact of AVs on the labor market based on the wage effect and inequality. And also expand the study in other countries if the effect is different compared to The Netherlands.","Autonomous vehicles; labor markets; skill mismatch; The Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

While they provide many benefits they also create a social gap between parents and children. Interests of parents and children often do not align, as parents tend to prefer physical activities, showing a reluctance towards the prefered digital play of children (Hoika, E., Wu, Z., Alexander, J.J., &amp; Thomsen, B.S., 2018). This creates a barrier in shared digital play. It would be valuable to break this barrier, as adults and children are more likely to be happy in general and feel more connected with their family members when they spend more time playing together (Ginsburg, K. 2007). In order to achieve this goal, a promising area to explore is the type of play that involves the interest of both parents and children. By combining tangible and digital elements a type of fluid play can arise, capable of breaking the digital barrier, resulting in family connection.UNGA is a loyalty campaign specialist which has shown interests in creating this type of play. Dutch loyalty campaigns, often targeted towards families and children, provide a context in which this fluid play will be explored, offering a platform to reach thousands of families. This leads to the project assignment of designing a fluid interaction with a smartphone to engage families in play, within the context of a loyalty campaign. Various design methods and tools are applied within this thesis, mainly following the research through design principles and exploring the possibilities of animation as a design tool. After exploring UNGA as a company to define its context, insights on family connections from the perspective of Dutch families are gathered. Furthermore the context of fluid play is explored by hands-on experimentation and desk research. By analyzing the results, a design focus is created, with the following design statement: fluid family play should encourage âpoking funâ at each other, where parents and children are equally involved in a personal &amp; physical activity.Subsequently, concepts are developed through multiple rounds of experiential prototypes, involving internal and external stakeholders in the process.âFliereFluitersâ is introduced as the designed fluid play experience. By carefully utilizing tangible and digital elements in one fluid play experience, FliereFluiters compels to both children and adults, breaking the digital wall amongst family members. By combining a personal, physical and humorous activity within this experience, FliereFluiters manages to enable family connections, one surprise at a time. A loyalty model is proposed in which the concept reaches families through multiple channels. Supermarket interaction and social media aspects are proposed as means to introduce the concept to consumers, while the involvement with the concept takes place primarily at home.The design proposal is validated through the involvement of families and experts from different backgrounds. To fully validate the long term family impact of the concept however, a long term study involving the participation of Dutch families with a fully operational prototype is recommended.","family communication; Play; Smartphone; Digital; physical; loyalty program; Connection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This electrical energy is required 24x7 to operate and cool all the IT equipment present in the data center. The electrical energy required to cool all the servers present in the white space can range from as low as 10% to as high as 40% of the total data center electrical consumption. The server's inlet temperature has to be within the ASHRAE recommended range (18o C â 27o C), so that they can function correctly. Â Â A simplified design of a raised floor white space with hot aisle / cold aisle configuration is considered. The tile flow rate through the floor tiles influences the server's inlet temperature. To control the tile flow rate, 11 design variables of the data center white space are identified. These are the position of the 4 perforated plates, the amount of perforations of each perforated plates, the floor tiles perforation, the raised floor height, and the CRAH distance to the cabinet. 600 design samples of the white space are generated by applying the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique on these 11 design variables. A well-validated CFD software 6SigmaRoom by Future Facilities is used to generate the CFD results. The standard k-Îµ model is used to model the turbulence in the CFD simulations, in a steady-state condition. A database of 600 samples is generated by recording the cabinet's inlet temperature, flow rate of floor tiles from the CFD simulations, and the corresponding changeable design parameters generated by the LHS technique. The error due to CFD simulation is estimated at less than 4% for the tile flow rate and 1.7o C for the server inlet temperature.Â  Four Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are trained on the data from the database to predict the floor tile's tile flow rate and the cabinet's inlet temperature, respectively. The average R2 prediction (testing) accuracy is 0.97 for the tile flow rate predictions and 0.92 for the cabinet's inlet temperature predictions. Their average prediction error is less than 5% for the tile flow rate and less than 20 C for the cabinet's inlet temperature. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), a variant of the genetic algorithm, is used to find the optimum values of the 11 design parameters of the white space. These optimum values are going to ensure the server's inlet temperature to be within the ASHRAE recommended range. The genetic algorithm optimizes the design variables based on the predictions made by the neural network predicting the tile flow rate. The values of the optimized design parameters are verified using the 6SigmaRoom software by comparing the server's (mean) inlet temperature of the optimized case with the non-optimized case. More number of servers have their (mean) inlet temperature below 270 C in the optimized case as compared to the non-optimized case. The electrical power required by the CRAHs to cool the white space is reduced by 10% in the optimized case as compared to the power which is required by the CRAHs in the non-optimized case. In this study, a CFD simulation of the white space took 40 minutes. The neural networks took less than a minute to make the predictions, and the NSGA-II algorithm took less than 10 minutes to find the optimized design parameters of the white space. Â Thus, in this thesis, it is shown that using an artificial neural network and a genetic algorithm, in combination with computational fluid dynamics gives satisfying results in optimizing the white space design, required to keep the server's inlet temperature within the ASHRAE recommended range. The computational time required to find the optimum white space design is also reduced by using a neural network and a genetic algorithm. The prediction by the neural network and the optimization performed by the genetic algorithm can be improved further with the availability of more training data and in-depth knowledge of applying these techniques (the neural network and the genetic algorithm) in predicting and optimizing the solutions respectively.

Next, the research was narrowed down by considering a single case fromengineering practice. It was decided to consider a dive-under that was beingconstructed near Zwolle, the Netherlands. This dive-under consists of multiplesegments which are all constructed in the same manner by first casting the slaband subsequently casting the walls on top. The hardening process of the wallscorresponds to a typical imposed deformations case as is also described inliterature. Â In order to assess the risk of early-age cracking for the selectedcase, finite element software was used. The hardening process of the walls ofthe dive-under was modelled by considering a cross-section of the wall andslab. A parameter study was carried out to gain more insight in the effect ofaltering the different input parameters of the analysis on the resultingstress- and strength development during hardening. Â Also, creep data which could be found in literature was analysed andthe Maxwell chain model was adopted to be able to model the viscoelasticmaterial behaviour. The Maxwell chain model consists of units of springs anddampers connected in series. When using several of these units in parallel, theviscoelastic material behaviour can be simulated. Evaluation of the Maxwellchain model was needed to be able to use the available creep data in theanalysis. Â Because the outcome of the analysis was dependent on many inputparameters, several laboratory tests were carried out at the Stevin laboratoryof the TU Delft. This was done for the specific concrete mixture that was also beingused in the construction of the walls of the dive-under. The aim of these testswas on the one hand to simulate the hardening process of the wall of thedive-under and on the other hand to determine the strength- and stiffnessdevelopment of the material over time. Also, the autogenous deformations weremeasured in a ADTM test. The results of the tests were analysed and couldsubsequently be used to improve the accuracy of the finite element modelregarding the risk of early-age cracking. Â Then, by making use a finite element model of the TSTM test and comparingthe outcome of this analysis with the results of the actual TSTM test, theviscoelastic material behaviour of the concrete could be derived. It was foundthat the effects of creep- and stress relaxation at early-ages were initially underestimatedand new creep curves were derived. An average early-age creep factor for thestress in a governing point in the bottom of the wall of around 2.4 was found. Next to the laboratory testing and computational models, temperaturemeasurements and visual inspections were done in practice on a segment of thedive-under. The temperature measurements could directly be used to improve themodel. The aim of the visual inspections was to determine whether early-agecracking would actually occur in the walls of the dive-under. During theinspections it was found that early-age cracking did not occur in any of theinspected walls. Cracking of the walls was eventually observed, however notwithin the time period that was regarded for early-age cracking. The results ofthe inspections were then used to be able to make judgements on the accuracyand suitability of the model for the assessment of the risk of early-agecracking. By making use of the collected data, the derived material propertiesand the temperature measurements from practice, the assessment of the risk ofearly-age cracking could be performed more accurately. This resulted in afigure which showed the stress- and strength development over time for agoverning point in the cross-section of the wall. Based on information found inliterature, a global risk of early-age cracking of the wall could then bedetermined. Â When comparing the results of the above described finite elementanalysis with the results of the visual inspections, it was found that theresults of the model did not correspond to the observations from practice. The outputof the analysis suggested a high risk of early-age cracking, while in realityearly-age cracking did not occur in any of the inspected walls. Possible causesfor this difference were subsequently discussed. In the end, conclusions were drawn on the accuracy of the analysis, thematerial properties that were determined through laboratory testing and theeffect of viscoelastic material behaviour on the risk of early-age cracking ofthe walls. It was found that the material behaviour at early-ages (the first 48hours) is very important for the overall stress development. Also, the resultsof the laboratory testing suggested that the effects of creep- and stressrelaxation are generally underestimated in this period. Moreover, it wasconcluded that early-age autogenous swelling is of significant influence on thestress development over time. This period of swelling prior the autogenousshrinkage is however not taken into account in the current Eurocode. Â More research is needed into the (viscoelastic) material behaviour atearly-ages. In this way the creep curves as proposed in this research can beverified. The fact that cracking of the walls only occurred at higher ages,suggests that the effect of stress relaxation at higher ages is limited. Thisbehaviour should be investigated in more detail. Also, the research methods thatare used in this study should also be combined for more cases in the future.Using the combination of a computational model, laboratory tests and observationsfrom practice creates the necessary conditions to be able to draw well-foundedconclusions on the accuracy of the used models and the material behaviour in practice.Testing methods should be developed/improved to be able to measure materialbehaviour at very early ages.

The SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) defined five automation levels in order to differentiate the responsibilities between the driver and an automated driving system, ranging from âNo Automationâ (L0), to âConditional Automationâ (L3) and âFull Automationâ (L5). The transition to full automation, however, brings new risks, such as mode confusion, overreliance, reduced situational awareness and misuse. Therefore, led by SWOV and together with many other parties, a 4-year project MEDIATOR is launched. The goal is to create a self-learning mediating system which guarantees safe, real-time transition of control between human driver and automated system depending on who is better fit for drive (Mediator, 2019).When the automation system reaches its operational limit in a given traffic situation, the automation issues a so-called take-over request (TOR), asking the driver to take back control of the vehicle (Gasser &amp; Westhoff, 2012; Hoeger et al., 2011). The Human Machine Interface (HMI) plays a critical role on passing signal from the automated vehicle to driver when TOR happens. Therefore, it is of vital importance in avoiding misunderstandings, misuse, over-reliance, reduced situational awareness and mode confusion. However, nowadays, there are various different HMI design for autonomous vehicles in the market. Develop an unified HMI design principle to regulate the autonomous vehicle industry is also one of the tasks of MEDIATOR project.The graduation project is focusing on the HMI research and design when takeover happens ( see Figure 1). The key research questions of the graduation project are âwhen is it needed to communicate what kind of information and how to communicate the information with the driver during takeover?â So exploring the scenarios of TOR and then define the similarities and differences are one of the tasks. Simultaneously, from a research of Bazilinskyy and colleagues (2018), the means to communicate take-over requests are divided into three main categories that may be used in different level of urgency for take-over transition: visua l(written messages or signals shown on cluster, head unit or other in-vehicle displays), auditory (sonorous signals or voice messages), and vibrotactile (vibration of the steering wheel or seat). So it will be one of the challenges to explore which modalities to communicate TOR are the most effective means. In addition, driverâs situational awareness (SA can be defined simply as âknowing what is going on around usâ) predicts the takeover performance. Drivers are better able to respond to hazards when theyâre aware of the driving context. Therefore, enhancing the SA is also another challenge for the design of the takeover journey.In conclusion, the objective of the project is to design the HMI of autonomous vehicles in order to enhance situation awareness for a better take over transition/journey.","Human-machine interface design; Human-Centered Design; Design for autonomous driving experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The contact between employees and customers is a great way to spark new opportunities for ideas relevant for customers (Kelly &amp; Storey, 2000), they have in-depth and highly context-dependent operational knowledge and have creative potential. They make an interesting often unused source for innovation potential. In the case a single employee or a small team of employees that are not assigned to the task are indeed the sources of the generation and implementation of such new ideas, products and processes, it can be called employee-driven innovation (EDI). Many organisations, therefore, try to engage employees and facilitate employee-driven innovation to increase its innovation capability. With the current global trend of servitization, which is the process to extend the customer relationship by bringing value also after a product purchase, companies will invest in the development of services. When companies would like to increase their innovation capability through employee-driven innovation, employees will therefore likely be expected to create ideas for services in which they are often not educated or trained. One of the challenges for a company in employee-driven innovation is to create and sustain a company culture and environment that generates the right conditions for this. Especially if this should be supportive of new service development, as services have intangible qualities that make it harder to test the actual value for the customer even with educated staff. Hence, the first aim of this thesis is to understand the challenges and effective ways of organising employee-driven innovation for new service development. Through a literature review and participatory design sessions with employees from a service solution provider, I created an approach that displays what the managerial, organisational and employee roles can do to facilitate employee-driven innovation in three parallel steps. In addition, TOPdesk, an ESM service solution provider, was also interested in increasing its innovation capability through employee-driven innovation. They captured their interest in a company objective that aims to create profit from a new market, coming from employee initiatives. I found that TOPdesk employees need guidance and support in their employee initiatives, to enable them to create and develop new service ideas. Therefore, the second part of this thesis is about creating a design toolkit that fulfils these needs and an implementation design roadmap in order to facilitate employee-driven innovation at TOPdesk.Â <br/>The employee initiative toolkit is a structured approach that guides and enables employees with new service ideas to effectively explore its value with the goal to convince the management team it should become a new service for TOPdesk. Through covering idea selection criteria, aspects of a business plan and pitch canvas, employees are able to do this. The purpose of this toolkit is to increase the effectiveness of employee initiatives for new services and therefore contribute to implementing employee-driven innovation for new service development and reaching their company objective to increase its innovation capability.","Employee-driven innovation; New service Development; Employee initiatives; Design toolkit; Participatory design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

IMDs are used today for the treatment of previously untreatable conditions as well as the continuous monitoring of the health of patients. The field, where active IMDs have been the most successful, is the field of neurological conditions, on which traditional medicine such as the intake of pills has very limited effect. In order to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by the IMDs it is vital to have communication between them and the external world. In this way, the treatment method provided by the IMD can be configured and optimized for each separate individual, achieving the best possible results. Moreover, the state of the device itself can be assessed and therefore possible flaws in its operation can be detected and corrected. Finally, in case of monitoring the patientâs health condition communication is also vital. <br/>However, this communication between the external world and the implanted device also introduces the possibility for someone, that possesses the required expertise and skills, to hack the device. The hacker can possibly âeavesdropâ the communication channel in order to extract information regarding the patient or even act in order to change parameters of the device and the therapy it provides, possibly causing harm to the patient. One way for hackers to disrupt the normal operation of the IMD is to drain its power source, namely the battery of the device, an attack that is named battery denial of service (BDoS) attack. One of the easiest ways to achieve such an attack is to make the device commit valuable power resources in order to run the authentication protocols continuously, by non-stop requesting for access. In this thesis, we try to tackle this problem by creating an analog circuit module that can act as an add-on to commercial IMDs that will have the task of authenticating the user that is trying to communicate with the IMD by making use of harvested wireless energy that is required for the communication. In this way, we expect to relieve the IMDs from spending time and resources on the authentication process. To that end, we designed and created an analog experimental prototype that employs both wireless power transfer and data communication, by simply making use of off-the-shelf components. The goal of this experimental prototype is to identify further challenges that can arise in a so called zero power defence scenario. <br/>To that end we implement a system that makes use of near-field resonant inductive coupling as a wireless power transfer method and is able to provide some mW of power across distances of up to 2cm, an amount of power that is sufficient to drive a microcontroller that can execute a low power security protocol in order to authenticate the entity trying to access the receiver. In addition to that, it can achieve a downlink data rate of 200kbit/s using amplitude shift keying modulation and an uplink data rate of 1kbit/s by making use of passive load shift keying modulation. This system is a unique implementation, since it constitutes the only solution that implements a highly asymmetrical bidirectional link by making use of ASK and LSK modulation and has a completely wirelessly powered receiver. Moreover, since this implementation was achieved with simple off-the-shelf components, there is a large margin of improvement in terms of size and efficiency if such a system was to be designed as an ASIC.","Wireless power transfer; Wireless Communication; Energy Harvesting; Security; Analog design; PCB Design; RF design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The direct costs of such fraud for the analyzed companies are quantified, showing that the sustained losses are relatively low compared to the figures reported in various resources. Regression analysis is used to model which characteristics make companies more attractive to cyber criminals, and how they influence losses suffered by businesses. Reputation and domain popularity are able to explain to an extent the frequency of being targeted. Furthermore, companies operating locally, as well as smaller businesses seem to experience higher financial losses. The implications of the results for businesses and society are discussed.

In numerically maximizing the production of these fuels, as well as in many other optimization problems, an objective function has to be optimized on the basis of an input vector, related through some underlying model. Although the adjoint methodology generally allows for efficient gradient-based optimization of such a problem, it quickly becomes infeasible when the model comprises a large-scale system, or access to this model is prohibited. To resolve this, we consider the application of a model order reduction scheme, in combination with subdomain surrogate modeling, to perform the optimization using a reduced-order approximation of the model. In particular, we employ principal orthogonal decomposition (POD), efficiently reducing the size of the underlying system of equations, on the basis of a limited number of samples of the full-order model. Applying a domain decomposition, this number of samples can be reduced even further, although at a decreased efficiency. Next, radial basis function (RBF) interpolation is applied, using the samples to construct a trajectory piecewise linear approximation of the reduced-order model in each subdomain. Combining these different techniques, an optimization algorithm is constructed, applying the adjoint methodology to the reduced-order model in order to compute an approximate gradient. The accuracy of this approximation was found to be poor, but comparable to alternative sample-based methods.<br/>An improved accuracy could be achieved by reducing the number of input parameters, allowing for more efficient optimization when applying the algorithm to a particular reservoir model. For another model, however, the algorithm performed worse upon reducing the size of the input, as a result of the fewer degrees of freedom in the optimization procedure. Reacquiring this freedom during the optimization, improved results could be attained, but the number of iterations and thus the cost of the method increased drastically. Comparing the full input implementation to another sample-based method, specifically a straight gradient ensemble algorithm, it was found to produce comparable results. Each method was able to surpass the other, dependent on the particular situation, though the reduced-adjoint algorithm generally expended more effort to attain similar results. This suggests that further study is necessary, for example improving the RBF interpolation or input reduction techniques, to fully exploit the benefits of the POD-TPWL methodology.","Production optimization; Adjoint-based optimization; Model-order reduction; Surrogate modelling; Reservoir simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In this thesis the Frame VM was developed as a VM that supports many different types of languages in a principled way. Achieving this is done by basing the VM on language independent models of memory and control flow. Usage of the scopes-as-frames paradigm and control frames resulted in an instruction set that is relatively small at its core, but does allow for the construction of complex control flow. As an effect, many different programming languages can be compiled to the Frame VM. In addition to this VM, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for executable semantics of programming languages was created. This language, Dynamix, allows for a modular approach to writing the semantics of a language. Additionally, Dynamix provides a meta-compiler that uses these semantics of a language to compile programs to the Frame VM. To validate the Frame VM, direct compilers for Rust and Prolog have been created in a student project and compilers for Scheme and Tiger were created using Dynamix. Using these semantics of Scheme and Tiger, it was possible to execute programs containing usage of call/cc and a suite of Tiger benchmark programs. Furthermore, the control flow of Tiger was extended with exceptions and generator functions. This extension did not require any changes to the existing semantics, showing the modularity of control achieved when using Dynamix and the Frame VM.","Scopes-as-frames; Dynamic semantics; Frame VM; Dynamix","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The project originated from a critical perspective on Smart City as a leading urban development paradigm. Many cities labelling themselves as smart cities competitively implemented advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), pervasive sensor networks, or internet of things (IoT) for infrastructural or economic purposes (Kitchin et al, 2015; Townsend, 2013). This enabled ubiquitous extraction and monitoring of urban behavioral data, facilitating more efficient, resilient, and frictionless urban governance.Data-driven nudging emerged as vast aggregate of citizen behavioral insights became available to be implemented into the concept of ânudgeâ, a libertarian paternalistic strategy of behavior change (RanchordÃ¡s, 2019; Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008). Citizen behaviors can be steered more elaborately through targeted and dynamic adjustment of choice architecture enabled by development of analytical algorithms. Pervasively embedded network of urban sensors has made this new type of nudge more invisible, thus more powerful. Hence, data-driven nudging is raising ethical concerns in terms of behavioral manipulation, ubiquitous surveillance, and urban depoliticisation (Kitchin et al, 2015; Lanzing, 2018; RanchordÃ¡s, 2019; Void et al, 2018; Yeung, 2016). Making matters worse, citizensâs level of awareness not only on data-driven nudging itself but also on smart city in general turned out to be significantly lacking (Government Europa, 2018; Jameson et al, 2019). The project addresses the lack of awareness of the presence of data-driven nudging and its social implications by designing a speculative experience of Smart Bench. The Smart Bench is an intelligent bench which is designed to nudge citizen behaviors according to a predetermined algorithm. Because smart technologies tend to reproduce pre-existing prevailing biases, the purpose of the design is to make them experiential to the general public. Participants are invited to try out the bench and a special interface where they could take a look at the software principles behind it and have a unique opportunity to adjust the nudging algorithm for others. As they proceed along the experience, participants can experience the discriminatory implications of data-driven nudging and openly discuss its application for urban governance. The evaluation results confirmed a fruitful capacity of speculative design in terms of materialising an abstract unfamiliar concept and evoking critical awareness on its potential implications. Most of all, the design provided participants with a space for open discussions about the necessity of data-driven nudging for urban governance and further reflect on pre-existing discrimination in our current society.","Smart City; Speculative Design; Data-driven nudging; Critical Design; Experience design; behavior change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Such private blockchains use permissioned blockchain consensus algorithms as the participants need the permission of the authority to be able to join the system. This paper will give an overview of the blockchain technology, investigate permissioned and permissionless blockchain, and focus on permissioned blockchains to analyze it in terms of, e.g. trust models between the nodes, incentives, number of nodes &amp; parties involved, and scalability regarding the number of transactions.","Blockchain; Byzantine Fault Tolerance; Consensus Algorithms; Cryptocurrencies; Permissioned Blockchains","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To make this transition successful, the Province ought to adopt an integrative approach, addressing other elements such as socio-spatial inequality, pressure for urban expansion and economic challenges that have to be integrated in the transition strategy. The following report describes these elements and the challenges they bring and proposes a vision and a development strategy based on the sector where these elements connect: the agri-food sector. Zuid-Hollandâs agri-food sector is an important link in the global economy, and many of its infrastructures are oriented towards export through the Port of Rotterdam. However, there is an unequal distribution of profit and power related to the agro-food sector, which results in socio-spatial inequality. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of both the physical and social environment, we conclude that the spatial pressures and existing challenges are most present in the edges of the provinceâs biggest cities. Hence, the Living Edges project envisions how the linear global agro-food sector can be transformed into a circular regional agri-food sector in a social just way . By designing a strategy in which this transition is detailed in space, the project aims to decrease socio-spatial inequality through bypassing the linear food system with interventions in the edges between the urban and rural areas. It does so by increasing diversity, social cohesion and equitable access to healthy, affordable food. As a result of efficient local circular production, the delta province will have more space for regenerative, nature-based and robust water defense systems. The vision and strategy designed by the Living Edges project provides tools for emancipating the province from the linear global economy towards a local, equitable and circular economy. Through networked governance with a multi-scalar focus, the Province of Zuid-Holland can be an example to other similar regions in Northwestern Europe and promote the idea of a just region.<br/>Dynamic Adaptation Policy Pathways are advised for the strategy in order to incorporate deep uncertainty in the long-term, large scale project.

Supply-demand asymmetry refers to the existence of an undersupply of vehicles at some locations at the same time as underutilization of vehicles at other locations. We propose to use dynamic pricing as an instrument to incentivize users to rebalance these vehicles from low demand locations to high demand locations. Despite significant research in rebalancing vehicle sharing, literature so far lacks experimental results on dynamic pricing in free-floating vehicle sharing. We propose to use an algorithm that minimizes the differences in the idle time of vehicles. The algorithm is tested in a real-life experiment that was conducted in cooperation with an FFVS provider. The experiment shows that even slight dierences in pricing and a novice algorithm can already influence user-behavior to counter the supply-demand asymmetry. Improving the existing algorithm by doing more experimental research is advised to further uncover the potential of this strategy.","Dynamic Pricing; user-based operations; user-based rebalancing; free-floating vehicle sharing; price sensitivity; living lab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-05-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Within this demanding environment, the need for strategic information has become extremely important, as it greatly enhances decision-making processes and the optimisation of the supply chain. In this research, a novel approach is proposed that is aimed at predicting customersâ daily purchase probabilities, with the goal to improve short-term forecasting accuracy. Besides the well-acknowledged importance of forecasting practices and customer relationship management, this research is motivated by three main observations in online grocery retail; short interpurchase times, consistent shopping patterns and loyal customers. Methodology: The approach involves the application of binary classification methods to analyse and predict online shopping behaviour. Within this context, two non-parametric learning algorithms, namely stochastic gradient boosting and random forest, are compared to traditional logistic regression. Both stochastic gradient boosting and logistic regression are extended using classifier chains (CC) to handle multiple outputs. Subsequently, the obtained purchase probabilities are aggregated and compared to the predictions of a univariate Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous (SARIMAX) time series model. Results: The boosted tree CC model was able to achieve an improvement of 1.77% in mean-absolute-percentage error (MAPE) and 20.95% in mean-squared logarithm of the accuracy ratio (MSLAR) compared to the predictions of the random forest and an improvement of 1.15% in MAPE and 16.81% in MSLAR compared to the SARIMAX time series model. The model acquired consistent results for customer groups of different sizes, with prediction errors that exhibited the lowest bias as well as variance of all models. The analysis of the explanatory variables indicate that behavioural attributes and variables, that concern interpurchase times in particular, were most significant of the target variables. Eventually, the application of calibration methods led to a decrease in forecasting performance rather than improving it. Conclusion: This research proposes a novel approach for short-term customer demand prediction within the online grocery retail market, which can provide an alternative to conventional time series forecasting techniques. The obtained results are satisfactory and of value for management and decision makers.","Time Series Forecasting; Customer behaviour prediction; Multi-label classification; Classifier chains; Stochastic gradient boosting; Random forest; Logistic regression; SARIMAX; Calibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

A general game AI for level generation can only be created once we have a method to describe video games.

Using this language allows us to analyze games at their mechanical level. The problem of General Video Game Level Generation (GVG-LG) can thus be defined as follows: construct a generator that, given a game (e.g. described in VGDL) which can be played by some AI player, builds any required number of different levels for that game which are enjoyable for humans to play [1]. This research investigates the characteristics of what makes automation of general level generation for 2D video games difficult, identifying what exactly makes it so challenging.

These phenomena are becoming more than individual and collective interactions as they are capable to generate highly innovative and unique virtualities in digital spaces. If architecture, as it is itself a mean of generating virtualities, adopts the commoning practices similar to those of the game commune, it could lead to a more inclusive and opensource building tradition. By combining the commoning practices of the game commune and maker spaces together, the design of spaces where emancipatory spatial practices can be pedagogically exercised is a necessity in areas where crafting and manufacturing is being deterritorialized along with its workers and communities. Furthermore, the alienation of people from tools, materials and processes (technical and social) perpetuates a cycle of consumption that is detached from broader social and environmental consequences.

The goal of this research is to ï¬nd out if unsupervised learning methods can contribute to wind pattern classiï¬cation. It can then be investigated if the classiï¬cation can increase understanding in speciï¬c wind patterns. The input data for the unsupervised learning model consists of 40 years of reanalysis wind speed data of an area including Japan. To classify the wind patterns, the dimensionality of the input data is reduced using diï¬erent autoencoders. This reduced dimensional form is then clustered using K-means clustering. The results of the K-means algorithm are compared and the best autoencoder is chosen. The resulting clusters are analyzed for extreme wind patterns, such as typhoons. It is expected that these wind patterns will be clustered together. To check this, the cluster containing typhoon Jebi, the typhoon which caused the highest insurance cost ever in Japan, is analyzed. If this cluster contains typhoons, unsupervised learning is able to provide useful information regarding wind patterns. The best working autoencoder used in this research is the 3D CNN autoencoder. Using the 3D CNN autoencoder, some clusters with speciï¬c wind patterns are found. The cluster containing typhoon Jebi consists of 95.8% of typhoons, from which it can be concluded that unsupervised learning is a valid method for wind pattern classiï¬cation.","Unsupervised; Wind; Classification; Convolutional; Neural; Network; Autoencoder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","","35.1166662, 139.3833318"

A tunnel of rings guide people to the entrance of the building. Every ring presents an auditive message on the different sides of the concept value, such as historical value or emotional value. The discovering of these sides goes together with the optical illusion that some ovals are rotated in such a way that they seem circles from the front. The interaction vision metaphor for this is Alice in Wonderland, where she gets interested to explore more when she sees the talking rabbit. âPerspectiveâ is adaptable to the wishes of DNB, for either Holidays, DNB campaigns or social issues in society. The audio fragments can be adjusted and for the lighting inside of the rings different colours can be used. The design attracts people and engages them with the message of DNB.

(mentor); Price, Rebecca (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Throughout history, there have been different attitudes towards eating fruit in the human diet. Currently, fruit is mainly perceived as a snack, that is to be eaten as a separate piece. Various developments in the history of the Netherlands like industrialisation, emancipation and internationalisation, have contributed to this position. With the competition of convenience snacks, a very small percentage of the population eats the recommended amount of 200 grams per day. If seen as integral part of the meal, fruit consumption will become a more conscious and structured behaviour. Among consumers, the idea of eating fruit combined with other ingredients causes some friction. By serving meals with in a familiar place and a logical context, the consumer can familiarize himself or herself with the idea of meals that include fruit in an easily accessible way without any required preparation efforts. Caterers serve meals to a large group of consumers on a daily basis. Consumers trust the expertise of the chef and are more accepting towards meals served by food professionals. Caterers therefore have a large influence and responsibility. There are some concerns among caterers around the creation of new recipes and the right approach towards consumers. To help caterers deal with these concerns, this thesis has created the Fruitdaging challenge. The Nationaal Actieplan Groenten en Fruit will be the project owner for this challenge and act as a neutral party who can reach out to, and connect with different stakeholders. Research into consumer behaviour shows that changes to a lifestyle are triggered when several internal or external factors change simultaneously. By designing the external and triggering the internal factors, it is possible to steer towards these transition points. Eventually, intrinsic motivation must trigger the actual change in behaviour. The most effective way to get people to accept dishes with fruit is by connecting them to the culture. A series of experiments were held to create a sandwich as iconic as the âbroodje gezondâ. From these experiments, a system for flavour pairing was created as a tool for creating recipes. A toolbox is provided to assist caterers with the interpretation of the Fruitdaging challenge on both recipe development and consumer approach. In the toolbox are a workshop, a case study, a card game and an online platform to support and help caterers to create and serve more dishes with fruit as a main component. Four different packages suggest several activities to approach different types of visitors. The challenge and toolbox are publicly available and self-explanatory. The challenge can be adaptable to fit to the resources and corporate structure of different type of caterers, to allow all caterers to join and create a widespread effect. When meals with fruit are served more frequently, the idea of fruit as an ingredient will start to become ordinary. It is expected that the challenge will cause people to start using more fruit in their meals at home, which leads to a higher intake of fruit.","Behaviour change; Food design; Fruit consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In Kumasi, the fastest growing city in Ghana, flooding events have become more intense due to rapid urbanisation and land use intensification. Additionally, rapid population growth, urbanisation and lack of organised waste collection, brings along tonnes of solid (plastic) waste on the streets, riverbeds and -ways. Plastic waste creates blockages in drains and rivers, which causes flooding of open areas, streets and houses. To what degree plastic waste accumulation aggrevates flooding in Kumasi remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study investigates to what extent plastic accumulation impacts flood severity, in response to rainfall events in the city of Kumasi, Ghana. This is done by modelling different rainfall scenarios in a 1D-2D model developed with the software HEC-RAS. This model was forced with static and dynamic data available from open source databases and collected during fieldwork. Data collection took place during six consecutive weeks in May-June 2019 and consists of bathymetry and discharge measurements, a flood- and plastic waste survey performed together with citizens. The impact can be determined using different model scenarios varying in rainfall magnitude and in obstruction of riverways, serving as plastic accumulation. Flood severity was analysed in terms of extent, depth, velocity, local hydraulic impact and flow distribution. The model has been validated with two events, one during which velocity and stage was measured, which results in the same order of magnitude, modelled slightly lower than measured in the field. The second event was a historic rainfall event, which could be validated with community reported flood depths. From this validation it became clear the flood extent of the event was underestimated and depths close to the streams were overestimated. The results show that the selected rainfall events without blockage cover the studied area between 11-25% with water depths higher than 10 cm. The inundated areas are adjacent to the river streams and inundate flat and low lying areas. Comparing this to the scenarios where bridges where obstructed to 33% and 67% individually, the total inundated area remains more or less the same, varying between 0-3% in inundated area compared to the scenario without blockage. However, in terms of flood distribution, areas around the blocked bridge are impacted more, thus inundation areas shift within the observed study area. Comparing this to the rest of the area, upstream or downstream less flooded areas arise, making the change in total flood extent only change slightly. Furthermore, the two bridges that are obstructed have different impact on the flow in the study area, as the scenarios of obstructing the second bridge with 33% produce a numerical instability and therefore incorrect results. From the plastic waste survey it followed that plastic waste is very much abundant in the study area, thus the occurrence of plastic accumulation at the bottleneck locations seem inevitable. The results of this research have shown the main contribution to flooding is flow from upstream areas exceeding river capacity, while local blockages mainly aggravate flooding around the blocked locations.","Flood modelling; Plastic Waste; HEC-RAS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","TWIGA","6.666582, -1.593632"

For this reason the HWBP is researching methods which can improve the efficiency of dike reinforcement projects. This thesis was initiated to analyse what could be done in the transition period between registration of a dike reinforcement project at the HWBP programme and the start of the reconnaissance phase of the project, as it is potentially useful to utilize this time period. This thesis focuses on the impact of implementing monitoring and soil investigation earlier was analysed, because information collected before or during the transition period can be used for the benefit of the dike reinforcement projects. For this a theoretical case of the dike trajectory at Amerongen was used, for which piping is the dominant failure mechanism. The benefit in performing additional soil investigation and monitoring is dependent on the project phase in which the measurements are started and/or performed. The aim of this research was determine when the methods need to be implemented, how much investment is needed and what the expected benefit of the measures is. The benefit can be expressed in expected project costs in case of stronger parameters are found and in expected annual risk if weaker parameters are found. For the applied case dike trajectory at Amerongen the expected reduction in project costs is 19,4% of the initially estimated project costs if the measurements were performed or started early. In comparison, the expected project cost reduction for the common project structure is 13,3%. The investment costs due to monitoring and soil investigation was 4,6% of the estimated project cost when starting early and 4,1% for the common project structure. In conclusion, by investing 0,5% of the estimated project costs on starting monitoring and soil investigation early in the dike reinforcement project a 6,1% reduction in the project costs is expected.","monitoring; dike reinforcement; soil investigation; duty of care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

However, the difficulty of establishing a Corporate Venturing Unit, becomes apparent in the literature. ENGIE Ventures and Integrated Solutions (EVIS) also resorts to external CV activities, in order to cope with the pace of technological innovations in the predominantly classical energy industry making it an interesting case to conduct the research. The first part of the research consisted of research endeavors into external CV objectives, in order to develop a version of the intended external CV objectives for a CVU at EVIS. This has been done by conducting a thorough literature review. Consequently, these insights were used as a foundation to conduct internal interviews at EVIS in order to develop a set of intended CV objectives for a CVU at EVIS. The second part, researching the factors, started with a literature study, resulting in the development of a conceptual framework of factors. This conceptual framework has been used as a foundation for a total of nine external interviews. Ultimately, the insights of both the internal interviews and external interviews are processed into implications for EVIS. For the CV objectives intended for a CVU at EVIS, strategic objectives should outweigh the financial objective, where the following strategic objectives are specifically mentioned in order of importance: Strategic corporate renewal and a window on new technology, business models and capabilities â Promoting ENGIEâs innovative and entrepreneurial image â Developing an innovative and entrepreneurial culture within the corporate â Leveraging internal capabilities, competencies and ideas to create new business â Accelerating innovation though ventures â Creating deal flow for corporate M&amp;A. For the financial objective, the interviewees at EVIS indicated the room for potential loss-making investments and ambiguity towards whether every investment should be financially viable. However, external interviews provided a different insight: every investment should show good financial returns, purely looking at the investment financials. Furthermore, the factors that should be considered in order for a CVU to engage in external CV activities, based on literature and external interviews, have been approached by categorizing them into five categories: Factors internal to the CVU, factors in the relation between the CVU and the corporate parent, between the CVU and external ventures, between the CVU and spin-offs and between the CVU and external investment partners. The following factors have been found to be most crucial to consider for a CVU engaging in external CV activities: balancing strategic and financial objectives, the CVUâs team composition and compensation, the autonomy of a CVU and the degree of autonomy it provides to ventures, collaborative investments together with financial and strategic co-investors, and specific activities of a CVU with spin-offs (e.g. motivation to spin-off, involvement of external investors, etc.). However, most importantly, there is no one size fits all for the factors identified.

However, tacit knowledge, as well as the hidden curriculum, are difficult to make explicit (Grey, 2018), because they are hidden in ourselves and our culture (Mareis, 2012). In the course, IDE Academy, a first-year master course in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering of the Technical University of Delft, the hidden curriculum plays an important role for students. The course set up allows students to choose skills to learn in a free-fail environment, thus, the curriculum of the course is highly dependent on the students and their decision making. This means that the hidden curriculum of the students becomes the curriculum of IDE Academy.The aim of this project was to find ways to make the hidden curriculum more explicit in IDE Academy and to contribute knowledge of how to unveil the hidden curriculum in design education.","hidden curriculum; tacit knowledge; Design education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Groot, J.V. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The global energy demand is growing, while climate change is demanding a sustainable way of generating this energy. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) can be a part of the solution for this problem. OTEC generates electricity by using the temperature difference between the surface water of the ocean and the water at 1000 meters depth as a driving force. As this temperature difference is present all year round, there is no need for energy storage, which is the case for wind- and solar energy. An OTEC system utilizes an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which uses ammonia as a working fluid. A lot of research is conducted on this cycle, all assuming steady-state. However, as the system is constantly changing its state, either by a changing temperature difference or by variations in the operating conditions of components, more research is required to investigate the impact of these changes. Therefore, a dynamic model has been developed. In order to cope with these changes and to ensure the optimal power output at all times, a control strategy is developed and implemented on the model. As the system has been developed with the use of a control system as a boundary condition, a model is adapted which prioritises computational time over accuracy, but, according to literature, is still accurate enough for the small transients. This model has been implemented for the OTEC cycle and improved from normal dynamic models by including pressure drops and storage tanks.Â Allseas, in cooperation with the TU Delft, has built an experimental set-up of an OTEC cycle. Experiments conducted on this set-up were used to compare the model with reality, both steady-state and dynamically. It has been proven that the steady-state values matched the experiments within 1%, and theÂ  dynamics matched the experiments almost perfectly. As a next step, the system has been scaled to match the desired 3MW output. With this scaled model, realistic scenarios were simulated to check the response on larger transients. The scenarios consists of a start-up and shutdown of the system, a changing inlet temperature, pumps being shut off and a number of heat exchangers that are decoupled from the system, for example when a number of heat exchangers need maintenance.Â  The outcome proved that, from a dynamic perspective, the influence of a seawater temperature change was negligible. As the temperature changes per second are very small, the net output scales linearly with the temperature difference. A start-up and shutdown of the system was successfully simulated, which is the largest possible transient in the system. The influence of pumps that are stopped and heat exchangers being turned off for maintenance have been simulated, which showed just a slight decrease in net output. It also showed that the system, when running at the nominal conditions of the pump and turbine curve, was not running at an optimum. Therefore, a control strategy was developed by conducting a sensitivity analysis and, after using an optimisation to find the optimum point, the resulting control strategy was implemented. This new strategy resulted in an increase of 15% in the net output, compared to the nominal conditions. This proves that an OTEC cycle could greatly benefit from using a dynamic model to predict its dynamic performance and the implementation of a control system.","OTEC; Dynamic model; Organic Rankine Cycle; Transient; Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Neurostimulation is a common medical treatment modality used to treat neurological disorders. It applies electrical pulses to revert and prevent undesired neural behavior or to create desired neural behavior. The required specificity of said stimulation treatments is oftentimes achieved by implanting the neurostimulator close to the target area. Implantation of active medical device poses a series of challenges and requirements in size and power consumption. Wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies have been used to reduce the size or eliminate the use of batteries, which are the main limiting component in terms of size and longevity of the implants. In conventional WPT systems, the energy must be focused from an external transmitter to a receiver in the implanted neurostimulator. This one-to-one link cannot be used in some applications in which a network of neurostimulators is required to deliver treatment in multiple locations distant from each other. This is the case for some chronic headache treatments in which both the supraorbital and occipital nerves must be stimulated. This thesis proposes a new system level topology for a neurostimulator network for the treatment of chronic headaches, in which all implants are powered through a single WPT link. It was theorized that the bone tissue in the skull can be used as an acoustic conductor for ultrasonic waves, similarly to bone-anchored hearing aid systems that already use bone conduction to conduct acoustic waves in the audible range. Finite element simulations showed that the skull can conduct ultrasonic energy in two frequency bands, which are 0.1-0.6 MHz and 1-2 MHz. A 2 MHz operating frequency was chosen for safety reasons, since the 1-2 MHz band does not leak unwanted energy into neighbouring soft tissues like the brain. At this frequency, the WPT link undergoes an attenuation of about 20 dB. Each individual neurostimulator employs the ultra high frequency (UHF) stimulation technique to improve in power efficiency. Both the UHF stimulation and ultrasonic wireless power transfer work in the MHz frequency range, so the ultrasound signal can be âdirectlyâ used for the electrical stimulation of the tissue by means of a simple ultrasound transducer and some power conditioning. Previous designs using this concept are not easily scalable and cannot perform charge balancing to ensure safe stimulation of tissue. In addition, the use of a WPT powering method cannot guarantee a stable and uniform supply for the implanted neurostimulator. As a result, there is a need for a multichannel system that can deliver UHF stimulation pulses in a safe manner, while ensuring efficacy of the stimulation regardless of the power levels received through the WPT link. This thesis proposes a novel output stage for implantable neurostimulators that ensures the efficacy and safety of the stimulation. Since the efficacy is directly related to the total charge delivered to the tissue, a novel charge metering circuitry is designed to control said amount of charge. Safety is obtained by minimizing the residual voltage after a stimulation cycle, which can otherwise damage the tissue and the electrodes. This is done by means of a novel charge balancing scheme that monitors the voltage across the electrodes and stops the stimulation when it crosses 0 V. Circuit simulations successfully validate the design. The proposed neurostimulator was also implemented on a PCB board and tested. The charge delivery resolution of the charge metering circuit is 510 pC. A residual voltage of 0.5-29.5 mV was achieved with the charge balancing circuitry, using an electrical model of the tissue. In vitro measurements in a phosphate buffered saline solution show a 80 mV residual voltage. Hence, this work successfully presents a new neurostimulator output stage topology that ensures efficacy and safety in the presence of an unreliable WPT link, while being compatible with multichannel operation and an IC implementation.","charge balancing; charge metering; neurostimulator; multichannel; ultra high frequency stimulation; wireless power transfer; CMUT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Research shows that the expectations of academic graduate job seekers and employers do not align and this graduation project confirms that job seekers and employers do not speak the same language. On the one hand, job seekers do not seem very able to communicate their skills and abilities in a convincing manner. On the other hand, employers do not seem very able to communicate the job requirements effectively. In this graduation project, Jeroen ter Haar Romenij validated and developed a vacancy platform in collaboration with the start-up HelloCareer. The platform allows academic graduate job seekers to explore job opportunities with the use of a job task language. With this task-language, HelloCareer aims to bridge the gap between educational study programs and actual job profiles on the labour market. The task language enables job seekers and employers to express their preferences, respectively for a future job and a future employee, in a uniform language, thereby reducing the asymmetry of information between the two parties, ultimately resulting in better matches. During this graduation project, a task-language for the three master programmes that are a part of the TU Delftâs faculty of Industrial Design Engineering was co-developed with academic graduate job seekers. Based on intense involvement of both the job seekers and the employers, crucial learnings were acquired on how to best define and apply the task-language and shape the design of the task-based vacancy platform. The way in which the preferences of the job seekers are represented by the platform has a direct effect on the job opportunities that are presented to them. Therefore, the value of autonomy over self-representation is highly at stake and has been put central in the development of the task-based vacancy platform. To engrain this way of thinking in the design process, a design for values approach has been chosen. Through empirical research that was conducted with academic job seekers, it has been explored what the value of autonomy over self-representation means for them in the context of the vacancy platform. As a result, these insights have shaped the design of the task-based vacancy platform which is described in this thesis. The final result is of this graduation project is a User Interface Design that demonstrates in a clear and practical manner how the task-based vacancy platform operates.","Job Search; Task-Language; Startup; Vacancy Platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Those vortices then travel downstream of the cylinder as they are being dragged along with the current. The horseshoe vortices can scoop up bed material surrounding the cylinder, weakening the foundation of the structure. This phenomenon is known as scour. A common protection method to reduce the effects of scour is the dumping of stones in the vicinity of the cylinder-bed junction. The aim is to alter the flow dynamics near the bed in such a way that the underlying sediment is mostly unaffected. However, the protection material itself is also subject to hydrodynamic forcing and can therefore be entrained as well. This would be described as damage to the protection layer as its effectiveness reduces due to re-exposure of the underlying sediment. It is for this reason that protection layers must be carefully designed depending on their use. The mechanism of the horseshoe vortex system and its damaging aspects are not completely understood yet, making engineering of specific protection layers challenging. To better understand the flow behaviour upstream of a cylinder-bed junction, where the formation of the horseshoe vortices takes place, several tests have been performed at the Eastern Scheldt Flume in the Hydro Hall of Deltares. Here different cylinder and bed protection configurations were subjected to turbulent current and wave conditions where the upstream flow fields were measured with a PIV measurement system. Since the obtained information of the tests is limited to a specific area, there was an interest in modelling the test cases by means CFD, while using the test results as validation. In this thesis several of the test cases have been modelled with the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) hybrid turbulence model, based on the Spalart-Allmaras formulation, which include the following: a) Open channel with a smooth bed and no monopile b) Open channel with a rough bed and no monopile c) Open channel with a smooth bed and a smooth monopile d) Open channel with a rough bed and a smooth monopile The modelling strategy used starts off with a basic simulation case (a) which is compared to the test results for validation of the simulated flow characteristics. This model is then elaborated on by inclusion of either a rough protection model (b) or a smooth cylinder (c). Both models are again validated with the test results so that the ability of the IDDES model to model the fluid-structure interaction is investigated. Finally, a simulation that includes both a rough bed and a smooth cylinder (d) is performed. For simulation models b, c and d an assessment is made for potential initial particle entrainment by means of hydrodynamic forcing indicators. Additionally, the effects of bed model surface roughness on the entrainment of bed material are briefly considered.","CFD; Entrainment; Scour; Statistical Analysis; Turbulence; OpenFOAM; IDDES; Wall functions; Surface roughness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Electric Vehicles (EV) can provide this flexibility by adjusting their charging speed. An aggregator can provide this flexibility of many EVs to the balancing markets. However, since EVs are moving entities of which the exact mobility behaviour is unknown at the time in which the aggregator has to hand in their bids, the aggregator is subject to uncertainty. In this research it has been determined to what extent EV movements influence the potential of EV-flexibility for providing flexibility in the form of FCR (Frequency Containment Reserve). <br/>As can be concluded, the aggregator will have to withhold and uncertainty buffer up to 25 % from their bids to the market to prevent being fined for not being able to provide the full contracted amount of FCR when EV behaviour deviates from the forecasts. This strongly reduces the amount of FCR that can be provided. Secondly it can be concluded that the fines do not sufficiently incentivise the aggregator to withhold enough flexibility from their FCR bids to result in the desired reliability. Lastly, it can be concluded that reducing the length of the FCR bids from 24 hours to 2 hours will increase the amount of FCR that can be provided by EV aggregators with around 20 %.<br/>Further research to this topic is recommended that includes the geographical component of electric vehicles since this will enable to determine the effect of the grid limitations on the potential of providing FCR by making use of EVs. Also it is recommended to add weather forecast and other factors that influence mobility behaviour to the forecast in the model but also take the actual demanded amount of FCR into account since this will enable to more exactly determine the uncertainty buffer that is needed.<br/><br","Electric Vehicles; Uncertainty; Balancing Market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Across the world measures were taken to reduce the spread of the virus. Public Transport (PT) had a unique position, being both an essential service and a place where the virus can easily be spread. This research investigates the measures taken in PT in the Netherlands and internationally in an objective manner. No assessment is made of any kind of any measure. In the Netherlands, the Outbreak Management Team collaborated with the public transport association OV-NL to ensure every companies response was similar. Through an interview with the chairman of OV-NL, Pedro Peters, more information was gathered on this particular aspect of the research. Besides taking measures to reduce the virus, mainly by reducing or avoiding contact (both between people and with surfaces), companies reduced their service levels. This reduction was a response to the large decrease in passenger demand and partly to more of the personnel reporting sick. This research investigated this reduction of service throughout the first period of the virus outbreak in the Netherlands (27th of February â 1st of June). Besides the Netherlands, measures taken in other countries were also investigated, showing many similarities. However, other measures were taken as well, like checking the temperature of passengers in for example Thailand, China or Iran or using a proximity app which happened in Singapore. Not every country experienced the virus outbreak at the same time. In the research, data by the Oxford University and Blavatnik School of government was used to create world maps that visualize the closing of public transport for all days of the outbreak up to June 1st. The same was done to create a map for lockdowns and using data found through an online search a world map visualisation was made about the mandatory use of face masks in public transport. The maps show a general trend: following the virus, but it is clear that some countries responded early or late and that the correct response to the virus was unclear. Especially the face mask visualisation shows a more random pattern. So while within the Netherlands the response to the virus was uniform, internationally the response was quite random. This research can be used to further research the measures taken and assess the measures with regards to for example effectiveness, safety or comfort.","Public transport; Corona; COVID-19; Face mask; Lockdown; Metro; Train; Tram; Bus; Virus; visualisation; world map","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compare numerically computed polarization curves to the historical polarization data to derive the microphysical properties of Venus's cloud and haze particles. Results: From our research we obtain values for the imaginary part of the refractive index of the cloud particles of the order 10^(-4). It is most likely that the absorber is mainly located at the equator or in patchy clouds covering 80% of the planet. It is found that in the presence of precise disk-integrated polarization data, it is possible to detect variations in the polar regions. For Venus we found that it is likely that there exist larger particles at higher altitudes at the Venus poles. Unfortunately, it is very hard to say something about the long term variations on the planet. For the Venus case, it can be roughly stated that: the polarization was higher in 1975/1976 than in 1965/1968; the polarization was also higher in 1968/1970 than 1965/1968 but not higher than in 1976; there was a decrease in the polarization of the ultraviolet region in the years 1964/1965. Conclusions: Future observations should be made in a broad range of wavelengths, at as many phase angles as possible and in time frames similar to the orbital period of the (exo)planet. Since Venus can be observed as if it were an exoplanet (broad range of observable phase angles and disk-integrated data), we applied this research to exoplanets as well. We concluded with the help of the Venus data and simple models that it is possible to obtain cloud properties, such as the refractive index and the optical thickness of the cloud, of exoplanets using polarization observations. It was found that those properties are harder to distinguish using flux measurements since the geometric albedo and the distance to the planet are unknown.","Venus atmosphere; Disk-integrated polarization; Flux; PyMieDAP; Exoplanets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These foundation piles need to be identified and measures need to be taken. The urban quay walls are supported by two types of foundation: pinewood piles, which are easily affected by bacterial decay and spruce piles. To understand the mechanical behaviour of quay walls better, it is needed to know the type of wood used for each pile foundation along the 200 km of quay walls currently showing signs of damage. For that reason, specialized diving teams are hired to identify the rotten piles and foundation defects, to know which foundation piles need replacement. Since the area is very large and diving inspections are costly and lengthy in time, there is a need to correlate the foundation defect to the masonry damage above the water level. The masonry above the water level could give lots of information about the condition of the foundation, due to cracks or deformations in the masonry. This research could help to relate foundation defects with damage patterns in the masonry. Understanding this relation helps to identify foundation defects at an earlier stage and helps the municipality to prioritize the replacement of foundation piles. The thesis aims to find indicators above the water line to identify foundation problems by studying the crack patterns in a typical unreinforced masonry quay in Amsterdam. From the point of view of the masonry structures, failure of foundation piles results in a settlement deformation causing cracking. This research will support the current work by Sweco in helping to find foundation defects from above the waterline via masonry damage patterns in quay walls. This will be achieved by performing a parametric study, bases on 2D nonlinear finite element analyses, varying the extent of the pile defects, the material properties of the masonry and lateral boundary conditions for a selected representative base case. To simulate the damage in masonry, a smeared crack approach was used. The foundation defects were simulated by applying a settlement deformation to the quay wall. A Gaussian settlement deformation profile was imposed and the ratio between the length of the profile and the length of the quay wall was varied to simulate the failure of single or multiple piles. To capture the influence of the material properties of masonry (especially related to tension failure), three types of masonry were defined: weak, average and strong. The influence of the boundary conditions at the edges was checked by performing analyses with horizontally free lateral sides and with horizontally fixed lateral side. This is done to simulate the effect of arching in the structure. Eventually, the influence of the location of the foundation defect was analyzed by comparing a symmetric Gaussian settlement deformation with an asymmetric settlement. The analyses show correlations between the vertical displacement at the top of the structure and the length of the settlement profile. As expected, this can be interpreted with the fact that if several piles are damaged simultaneously, a larger portion of the quay wall is cracking. The material properties of the masonry influence the development of crack patterns. The stronger is the masonry, meaning increasing the values of Youngâs modulus, tensile strength and fracture energy, the larger is the settlement displacement needed to obtain the same crack pattern. The lateral constraints contribute mostly to the development of the horizontal crack since no horizontal cracks appeared in situations without these constraints. Since the influence of additional loads is not considered in the analysis and the model is modelled in 2D it is recommended to analyze the influence of both in further studies. It is also recommended to validate the model against field measurements since no verification has been done.","Unreinforced masonry structures; Quay walls; finite element analysis; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

To decrease the environmental footprint of concrete, in which cement has the highest contribution, it would be of great importance to be able to recycle cement, which would positively affect the environment. The separation efficiency plays an important role in the cement properties. The Smart Crusher is a novel concrete crushing- and separation technology developed to optimize the separation efficiency of the concrete. This study investigates the recycling potential of the cementitious fractions obtained from the Smart Crusher. The aim of this research is to evaluate the reactivity of the cementitious binder retrieved from recycled cement stone to obtain a fully functional binder that can replace primary cement in constructions and structural elements. To gain more insight in the reactivity of cementitious binder retrieved from recycled cement stone, the Smart Crusher cement fractions, which in this study had an unknown origin, are compared with non-hydrated and hydrated reference cements CEM I 52.5 R and CEM III/B 42.5 N. Therefore, the different materials are characterized, using TGA, DSC, MS, XRF and XRD. Analysis of the chemical and mineralogical composition showed the presence of hydration products in the hydrated Smart Crusher, CEM I 52.5 R and CEM III/B 42.5 N samples. Additionally, quartz is found in the cementitious fractions of the Smart Crusher, which indicates the presence of aggregate particles such as sand in these samples. Furthermore, the absence of P2O5 in the cementitious Smart Crusher fractions proved that there is no or a not measurable amount of fly ash present in the cementitious Smart Crusher fractions. Upcycling of the hydrated Smart Crusher, CEM I 52.5 R and CEM III/B 42.5 N materials is done by thermal treatment. To assess the upcycling, again the chemical and mineralogical composition is analysed. Red colouration (500 Â°C and 800 Â°C) and melting (1400 Â°C) of the cementitious Smart Crusher fractions again show the presence of aggregate particles in the material. During thermal treatments of the Smart Crusher, CEM I 52.5 R and CEM III/B 42.5 N materials, the decomposition of hydration products and calcite are monitored, using TGA, DSC and MS. The thermal treatment at 800 Â°C showed the formation of alite and belite phases in all the samples and was therefore seen as the treatment with the most potential in this research. The only material that shows the formation of alite and belite during other thermal treatments was CEM I. After the thermal treatments the composition and crystalline phases were determined, using XRD and XRF. Insight in the mechanical performance of the different binders was obtained by flexural and compressive strength tests. Mortar prisms were made, containing CEM I and CEM III/B as reference cement and thermally treated CEM I, CEM III/B, 0.0 â 0.063 mm and 0.063 â 0.125 mm cementitious Smart Crusher fractions. The mortar mixtures with the thermally treated binders were observed to be rather dry as a result of an increasing water demand. Compared to new cement, the increase in water demand led to a low degree of compaction, resulting in return to strength properties that were practically unmeasurable. The reference cement showed a lower early strength for CEM III/B compared to CEM I and comparable strength after 28 days due to the higher gain of strength of CEM III/B. Especially the flexural and compressive mechanical tests showed that more research is necessary. To conclude, this study showed that a certain reactivity can be expected in the secondary binders after upcycling, but that the unmeasurable strength properties of the upcycled materials showed the need for more research to make a better estimation of that reactivity.","Recycle; Cement; End of life; Cementitious binder; Reactivity; Smart crushing; Circular Economy; Secondary binder; Upcycling; Sustainabilty; Dehydrated cement paste; Rehydration; Characterisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(graduation committee); van den Bos, Ab (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Application of Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis (NLFEA) is lagging behind the many digital advances in the structural engineering practice. This is due to the need for codes and standards. To help development of these codes and standards, 119 solution strategies were developed with different assumptions and choices for the concrete constitutive model, the finite element discretization, the way of modelling the reinforcement and the incremental-iterative procedures. The constants aspects of the constitutive model, like confinement and the reduction compressive strength due to lateral cracking, are based on the RTD1016 Dutch Guideline. All models are two-dimensional with a plane stress assumption and in all cases the analysis is force controlled with the application of an arclength method. This is done to increase the value of results for application in practice, as generally displacement loading is hard to apply in a real-life structure. The strategies were benchmarked with 101 experiments on reinforced concrete beams selected from literature. Those beams cover a broad range of design aspects, failing both in shear and bending, reinforcement configurations with- and without shear reinforcement, both prestressed and conventional reinforcement and heights ranging from 90 to 1200 mm. This resulted in 1919 NLFEAs which were performed with an automated approach in the DIANA multi-purpose finite element software package. It was concluded that the failure load and failure mode of the experiments can be approximated with a mean uncertainty of 1.05 with a coefficient of variation around 10 percent, provided that an appropriate solution strategy is applied. It is possible to assign an appropriate solution strategy when the structural design is known, where the main influence is the presence of shear reinforcement. Beams with stirrups are robustly modelled by a rotating crack model, while beams without stirrups were found to be better approximated by a fixed crack approach with specific choices regarding reinforcement modelling and equilibrium. To have a more objective way of judging the ductility of a failure, a measure of the dissipated energy in the reinforcement was implemented in the DIANA code. It was found that the mean model uncertainty of a ductile failure can be as low as 1.045, with a coefficient of variation around 10 percent. Brittle failures showed a mean uncertainty of 1.131, with a coefficient of variation just below 16 percent. Therefore the ductility index was found to be a valid way to judge the reliability of an NLFEA result. This study has demonstrated the applicability of force controlled NLFEA for reinforced concrete beams. The derived properties of the model uncertainties are a crucial input for safety formats.","NLFEA; Concrete beams; Model uncertainty; DIANA; Ductility index; ULS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lately, this is done using modern materials, such as fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP). FRP is a relatively light-weight material that has a high yield strength, which allows for aesthetically pleasing, very slender designs. Governing for such designs is often the dynamic behaviour of the bridge: its eigenfrequency may very well lie within the `critical range' of common footfall frequencies. If the step frequency of a pedestrian crossing the bridge lies near the eigenfrequency, a high dynamic amplification factor occurs: high vertical acceleration values for the bridge deck will occur, which means discomfort for the pedestrians.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a sustainable solution to that problem was sought. Rather than using pile foundations to clamp the bridgeheads (and thereby increase the eigenfrequency out of the critical range), it was investigated whether the kinetic energy can be harvested from the bridge. Ideally, this both dampens the vibrations and provides free, sustainable energy.<br/><br/>Several theoretical models were developed to describe the behaviour of an existing footbridge for which data is available. Adaptations to these models were made in the form of either extra dashpots or a tuned mass damper (TMD). In both cases, the dampers are regenerative, i.e. able to harvest energy.<br/><br/>It was shown that adding a TMD provides the best energy harvesting performance. From a practical perspective, it has some advantages as well, such as universal applicability. The parameters in the single degree of freedom (SDOF) model were optimized for maximum energy harvesting while still keeping the vertical deck acceleration at reasonable levels. Finite element analysis largely confirmed these design choices, and showed that reducing the vibration levels is certainly possible with only a relatively small TMD. For a single person crossing at near-resonant footfall frequency only leads to a vertical acceleration of about 1.5 m/s. <br/><br/>The amount of energy that can be harvested in such a way is small but non-negligible: about 26 Joules worth of energy is estimated to be gained by an `average' person crossing the bridge. This is taking into account system efficiency as well.<br/><br/>A literature study concerning real-world energy harvesting systems was performed, and showed the possibility to closely emulate the theoretical behaviour that was assumed for the regenerative dashpots. This can be done using electromagnetic dampers in combination with proper power electronics design.","pedestrian bridge; vibration; Energy Harvesting; Tuned mass damper (TMD); damping; deck acceleration; FRP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The way of operating the gas turbine, with lean premixed combustion reducesÂ the flame temperature in the combustion chamber which results in low NOx emissions. The downside of this way of operating is the increased sensitivity of the combustion system to thermo-acoustic instabilities.Â These instabilities arise due to an interaction between unsteady heat release at the flame and the acousticsÂ of the combustion system. At lean premixed conditions, a fluctuation in equivalence ratio results in a largeÂ fluctuation in flame speed which is related to the heat release. This makes the lean premixed combustionÂ very susceptible to acoustic pressure waves travelling through and reflecting inside the combustion system,Â as these pressure waves can influence the mass flow of gas and air in the premixing duct and thus changingÂ the composition of the fuel mixture that is convected towards the flame. An additional effect to the unsteadyÂ heat release are fluctuations of the total mass flow at the burner outlet, which are convected towards theÂ flame front, an increase in combusted fuel will result in an increase in heat release.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"">To analyze the sensitivities of the combustion system, a thermo-acoustic model will be constructed.

TheÂ combustion dynamics are analysed for frequencies in the range 0 - 300 Hz.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"">It was found that the HW09 is susceptible to combustion instabilities when the pressure drop across theÂ premix gas nozzles is low, which results in a decrease in fuel supply impedance. This increases the pressureÂ amplitude in the 90 Hz range, this behaviour corresponds to the modelled results when changes to the gasÂ preheating temperature or fuel nozzle compositions are made in the thermo-acoustic model, which influenceÂ the pressure drop over the gas nozzles. This is accompanied with a decreased amplification at the critical 120Â Hz range. This is a known side-effect, as the 90 Hz needs to remain dominant for a stable combustion system.Â This means the pressure drop over the gas nozzles balances on a fine line, too low will result in high 90 HzÂ pressure waves and too high will result in a more unstable 120 Hz frequency.Â Several of the hybrid burners in the annular combustion chamber are fitted with a cylindrical burner outlet.Â This changes the flow field out of the burner and is used to allow a higher maximum load for the gas turbine.Â The inclusion of this burner ring makes the combustion system upstream of the burner outlet more resistantÂ to acoustic pressure fluctuations in the frequency range up to 120 Hz. The burner system does become moreÂ sensitive to acoustic pressure fluctuations for frequencies higher than 120 Hz.Â Fuel composition influences the combustion behaviour of a fuel mixture. Low-calorific fuel shows to be inherentlyÂ more unstable in this gas turbine configuration as opposed to high-calorific fuel. If hydrogen isÂ added to high-calorific fuel, the flame speed is increased as is the influence of both equivalence ratio perturbationsÂ and velocity perturbations on unsteady heat release.The increase in flame speed results in a reductionÂ of flame length, which changes the convective time delay and shifts the instability of the combustionÂ system from the 120 Hz area towards the 180 Hz area.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"">The thermo-acoustic model responds to changes of operational parameters in an equal manner as was foundÂ from data analysis. The results are comparable up to 200 Hz, after which the flame can no longer be assumedÂ to be compact, which means compressibility, 2D and 3D effects have to be taken into account. Fuel compositionÂ analysis shows the importance of flame length and convective time delay on combustion stability.Â For hydrogen addition it can shift the critical frequency towards the second harmonic frequency of the combustionÂ chamber, this will result in rapidly increasing pressure waves and high accelerations. With increasedÂ knowledge of the effects of hydrogen addition or low-calorific fuel on the flame dynamics, the model can beÂ a predictive tool to investigate the combustion behaviour when the change to this fuel mixture will be made.Â The ability to predict the influence of different operational parameters or changes to burner geometry on theÂ stability of the combustion system can be very beneficial for analysis of future changes to the gas turbine andÂ its operation.","Combustion Instability; Gas Turbine; Humming; Thermo-acoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The use of collaborative contracting strategies is increasing of which the bouwteamÂ is an example. The bouwteam is a collaboration agreement during the design phase of a construction project, in which at least client, contractor, and designer work together to deliver a feasible and constructible design.Â Â Even though the contractor is involved early the client is still in charge of the project and has control over the design, indicating that client and contractor are dependent upon each other.Â The goal of this research is to identify contractor's perspectives of collaboration in bouwteam, in order to find a way for contractors to influence client-contractor collaboration in bouwteams to achieve successful project delivery. Three contractor's perspectives are identified with help of Q-methodology, including a Q-set of success factors for collaboration in bouwteams, and are called relationship first, early involvement of the right people,Â and structure first. Even though the perspective value collaboration differently, they share the belief thatÂ mutual trustÂ and a clear defined scope of the bouwteamÂ are most essential for collaboration in bouwteams. To indicate how contractors can influence client-contractor collaboration, strategies are designed based on the identified contractor's perspectives and implementation of them. Since each client is different and a client-specific approach is desirable, three clients are identified in literature and for each one a strategy is designed. Combined, the strategies form a strategic framework that can be used by Â contractors. To define a way for contractors to influence client-contractor collaboration, practical implications are established. For the contractor, it is important to define the scope early and clearly for successful project delivery. To achieve this, the contractor can identify the client charactertiscts of the involved client and determine the perspective of available personnel. The contractor's are a valuable reference for the contractor because they represent his playing field. The contractor can have a meeting with the client to elaborate on which success factors are most important for the bouwteam. With this information, the contractor can determine which perspectives are most appropriate to establish good collaboration. As a result, the contractor can develop a strategy and communicate this internally. For this, the strategic framework can be used as a guideline to give insights into possibilities and considerations. In doing so, relationshipÂ firstÂ and structure firstÂ are considered most suitable for good collaboration.Â Dependent on the client, the contractor can choose the right perspective to deploy to influence client-contractor collaboration to achieve successful project delivery. Nonetheless, in the end, defining the scope is one of the most important success factors for collaboration for the contractor, independent of the strategy to be develop. However, one has to question whether the bouwteam is a necessary approach for collaboration between client and contractor in a project. But even when this is not the case, the contractor's perspectives can stille be used since the collaborative principles from a contractor's perspective are similar.Â ","Contracting strategy; Bouwteam; Early Contractor Involvement; Utility and building sector; Collaboration; Client-contractor collaboration; Q-methodology; Strategic framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It augments the deployment of several applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain which demand low latency and near real-time response for their reliable operation. However, the existing approaches that help accomplish this are inherently static and suffice only for scenarios offering a fixed service at the edge. Thus, rendering them infeasible for a large scale IoT scenario with several heterogeneous services and end users such as a Smart City. Among the several challenges in realizing edge computing solutions for such a scenario, the impact of incorporating key aspects of the interactions of the IoT devices and the clients with the edge, remains to be explored. These interactions translate to the ease of use which is vital to determining the degree of adoption of an edge computing infrastructure by the end users and subsequently its profitability for the service provider. This thesis presents EDIRO, which is an edge-driven distributed orchestration framework for edge computing that enables the edge to drive the workload orchestration through the collaboration of multiple constituent edge nodes. It takes into account the existence of on-demand and ephemeral nature of workloads that require an input, i.e., an IoT resource such as an image or sensor data for their execution. These IoT resources are sourced from the end users and the IoT devices in the vicinity. Recent studies that highlight the idea of collaborative processing and the simultaneous presence of data producers and consumers in an IoT ecosystem, support this vision. The underlying concept in EDIRO is the utilization of such IoT resources that are contributed by the end users in the vicinity, to carry out service orchestration for the client requests. To the best of authorâs knowledge, this is the first work in the edge computing domain to conceptualize the idea of edge-driven distributed orchestration and implement a proof of concept followed by its evaluation and practical feasibility analysis. The main contribution of this thesis is the edge computing orchestration framework EDIRO, which is developed in Golang and released as open source to encourage collaboration with the community. Experiments are conducted on three different types of computing devices emulating edge nodes in a field scenario to determine the practical feasibility of EDIRO. The measurements include the time to serve a client request, the overhead due to the distributed orchestration approach and the computing resource utilization under bursty and normal traffic scenarios. The evaluation suggests that EDIRO is feasible for practical IoT use cases and provides a reasonable trade-off in terms of the benefits offered by this edge-driven approach and the overhead incurred. This thesis shares valuable insights into the ways in which this work opens up the scope of further research in this domain along with the key findings from the system development and experimentation phase.","Edge Computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Service orchestration; Distributed orchestration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Currently, the country holds the role of the second biggest exporter of food globally, having 94.5 billion in value of goods exported in 2019. In South-Holland itself the organic sector contributes to the regionsâ budget by 16%. Most of the production is happening in large greenhouse clusters known as the Greenport. However, the organic sector produces a considerably huge amount of waste and pollution. It also forms drosscapes in outdated lands of infrastructure. Drosscapes and the organic patch system of the landscape are two individual systems that do not work in synergy with each other. They both create different kinds of waste (environmental, social, economic and solid), not contributing to circular sustainability. Therefore, the main question is how they can be combined with the organic sector, improving the performance of the agro-industry and reducing waste. The project answers this question by looking at the sector through a strong sustainability concept which includes the key values such as the circular and knowledge-based economy and a wide range of participants. The strategy of the region is based on four main principles. First, the goal is to bring drosscapes back into the organic system. Second, the sector has to be combined locally. Third, potential stakeholders and R&amp;D companies have to be involved more widely and from different fields. Finally, spatial diversity has to be improved in order to make the organic sector in South-Holland circular. The strategy is based on scenario planning. The detailing of the strategy focuses on diverse system clusters of production making relations between local and compact. Additionally, the small scale examples are based on knowledge and innovative technologies, being considered a potential export product, contributing to the food geopolitics, but most important - to South Hollandâs sustainability. Patch structure in the concept is used as a method, in which clusters are able to close smaller loops of production before they become connected to the regional circular system. As a result, the main sector of the export would become knowledge of farming and adaptation to climate change in the region. The strategy can be applied in different scales and locations while reaching circular economy by implementing local drosscapes into a system. Policy makers can make the best use of drosscapes in a practical way by applying the strong sustainable concept and similar strategy in their region.","Circular economy; Province of South Holland","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio â Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

All these passengers spent most of their time behind the security check in the terminal, waiting for their aircraft to depart. In this area, passengers are encouraged to spend their money (Kaplan, 2018). Schiphol offers many different retail, and food and beverages stores where the passengersâ needs can be met. The sale of goods in the terminal is Schipholâs largest source of income (Schiphol, 2020). The passenger volumes at Schiphol have been growing in the last few years and are expected to keep growing in the coming years (CBS, 2018 and Schiphol, 2020). Growth in the passenger volumes causes both the passenger and goods flows to increase. In addition, there are many other streams in the terminal. In order to ensure that passengers are not hindered by these flows and all logistics processes take place in a safe manner, the logistics process will need to be set up differently. Schiphol is dealing with a complex environment, where there is no greenfield and solutions will have to be found within the current infrastructure. Therefore, the goal of my graduation project was to develop a new logistics concept for Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in 2030 with a focus on the passenger experience and safety norms. Various design methods and tools have been used to research the current logistics process, the values of stakeholders and trends that may play a role in the future of the logistics process. Based on these results, a future vision for the logistics process has been designed for 2030. The future vision contains that Schiphol will have to facilitate and control the logistics process in 2030, using a connected chain and autonomous processes. In order to meet the passenger experience and safety norms, it is mainly important that Schiphol gets control over the logistics flows to Schiphol, control in the logistics streets and control over the logistics flows to the terminal. In order to achieve the future vision, idea mapping sessions have been organised, from which the new logistics concept has been created. Both a strategic and tactical roadmap have been designed, in which service propositions work towards the new logistics concept in three horizons. These propositions take into account the various suppliers involved in the logistics concept and offer a new logistics concept for each of them. The new logistics process centralises the logistics processes to a Logistics Centre in the Schiphol area, from where Schiphol takes full control with the Schiphol Logistics Service and delivers all goods to the terminal. By centralising the logistics processes and making one logistics party responsible for the logistics process, the number of logistics flows in the logistics streets and the terminal will be reduced, thereby benefiting the passenger experience and safety norms.","Roadmapping; Future Vision; Airport; Schiphol; Logistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In recent years there has been a gradual increase in methods incorporating such temporal dynamics through sequential processing of user consumption histories. Some works have also included additional temporal features such as time stamps and intervals between a given userâs interactions with the platform. The latter, in particular, may be a strong signal providing additional context with respect to the current user preferences. However, in previous works this source of information has only been used passingly, without any signiï¬cant analysis of its impact on recommendation. In this thesis we examine the effects of such intervals, termed time gaps, on recommendation accuracy. In order to do so, we propose a family of novel DeepTimeDelta models, extending a state-of-the-art sequential Recurrent Neural Network based recommender. Through the comparison of our time-dependent models to the sequential baseline we demonstrate that the use of time gaps leads to improvements in recommendation performance, in particular for cases following longer user inactivity. Furthermore, we examine the mechanisms regulating the model recommendation behaviour. Our results suggest that the above performance improvements may be achieved through increased reliance on user long term preferences as well as strong regulation of the importance of the recently consumed items. Finally, we examine the performance differences for users groups with distinct consumption behaviours, demonstrating some improvement for groups featuring less active users as well as users consuming more popular content.","Recommender Systems; Deep Learning; Time gaps; Temporal recommendation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Seabubble is an autonomous hydrofoil that is able to fly above water. The Seabubble can transport 4 to 5 passengers on inland waterways. The hydrofoil-technology creates a whole new travel-experience because it provides very stable and silent travel conditions.Haven-Stad is used as a case-study. This water-rich area in het Westelijk Havengebied of Amsterdam will be transformed into a mix of residential- and workplaces. The Seabubble can make community sharing possible within this area.The ViP-method served as the main research &amp; design method to create a future-oriented context for the design. Additionally a creative session and Minimal Viable Products supported the designing phase. The VIP-method requires a construction of a future context in which the design is implemented. This context is created by means of literature-research, a survey and interviews. This resulted in a context in which the challenge of the design lies in connecting 2 divergent type of individual-oriented passengers: the passengers differ in their preference regarding (continuous) technical development, like autonomous vehicles.Additionally a detailed description of the desired interaction is required. The easiest interaction for individual type of passengers is a spontaneous interaction. This spontaneous interaction is described by an analogy: The interplay of confidence and doubt during improvisation.The creative session led to the first ideas of how to exploit the journey by Seabubble as a social stimulus between neighbours of Haven-Stad. This session resulted in several design directions. These directions are used for MVP-testing in which low-fidelity prototypes, in test set-ups, test if the ideas would give the desired effect in practice. The obtained insights are translated into a list of requirements as a guideline for a design for the Seabubble and to provide as tools for stakeholders in the field of shared autonomous vehicles. For this last reason, all the insights are bundled into a guide in a generic state.MVP-testing showed that a certain amount of (cooperative) control provides a motivation for undertaking interaction. This insight was used, together with the list of requirements, to design a control-system for the Seabubble: the SpeedBubble. It facilitates interaction by requiring passengers to cooperate in order to have a sense of control on the sailing speed.The SpeedBubble is a projection that indicates the speed of the Seabubble. The passenger can choose to interfere with the control of the autonomous Seabubble by means of the SpeedBubble; they can collect âbubblesâ by moving their hands orfeet. The amount of control depends on the amount of collaboration since the SpeedBubble can only be controlled when the passengers act in successive order (regarding their seating position).The evaluation of the SpeedBubble concept was conducted amongst neighbours in a test set-up. The test showed that the concept stimulates interaction in a spontaneous way. Both divergent type of passengers were actively involved.The SpeedBubble concept could be offered as a customization-option for parties that would want to implement Seabubbles in community sharing contexts.","ViP; Autonomous Control; Seabubble; Interaction; Toolset; Hydrofoil; Design for Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Modular construction has advantages in terms increased speed, safer construction and less construction waste. Applying modular construction in high-rise however brings about great complexities for the structural design of the building. Therefore, a design aid is created which generates a structural model from any arbitrary shape and uses structural optimization techniques to explore a range of designs for the early design stage. Existing optimization techniques have been studied, including Cross-Section (CS-) optimization (size) and BESO (topology). CS-optimization adapts the size of each member, considering utilization and displacement conditions whereas BESO removes or adds elements from the model based on stress level and Target Ratio (TR). Performing the methods successively further decreases the structural weight at certain TR. Generally, weight increases as more elements are removed. By developing the two-way coupled ESO&lt;&gt;CS-optimization method, elements are removed by lowest strain energy density, while the cross-sections of the remaining members are updated in each iteration, thus coupling ESO (topology) and CS-optimization (size). This results in a logical load path and additional weight reduction especially in the braced frame structures loaded by lateral loads when displacement is governing. In multiple load case design, the removal of elements is somewhat hard to interpret, however the method consistently results in the lowest structural weight for the considered cases. In order to create a modular structural design, boundary conditions are assumed by standardizing column and beam dimensions and considering multiple realistic load cases (wind+vertical load). By transforming arbitrary shapes into structural models and optimizing these, a range of solutions for the structural design is presented in which the number of elements and the structural weight are generally negatively related. For the considered rectangular buildings, the results are more efficient than core or outrigger structures and almost as efficient as mega frame structures, with the added benefit that it can be applied to any shape. Exploration of these solutions is a useful contribution to the early design stage of modular high-rise buildings, while the coupled ESO&lt;&gt;CS-optimization method could also be useful in other optimization problems.","Structural optimization; Topology optimization; Size optimization; High-rise buildings; Modular construction; Parametric design; Karamba3D; BESO; ESO; Cross-section optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

If these occur, a large number of victims is expected in a short amount of time, which puts pressure on the military medical chain. As it is crucial to treat patients as early as possible, low resource medical treatment facilities (Role 1 MTFs) are placed near the battlefield. Heavily wounded soldiers are transported to this facility, where they are stabilised in order to survive transportation to a facility with more resources. Due to the Role 1 MTFâs critical function, it is of importance that the communication of patient details is optimal, as it improves the patient flow and survival rate. Currently, the communication of patient details causes a delay in the treatment process. This graduation project aimed for the improvement of patient detail communication by providing insight into the current communication process and formulating a vision for future innovation.Â By performing different research activities, such as observations and interviews, an understanding of the Role 1 MTF and the used communication methods was developed. This resulted in an overview of communication problems that affect the efficiency of care and are experienced as frustrating. The key influence of these frustrations was the lack of situational awareness (SA), which became the focus of this project. To summarise the research findings, a journey map was made.Â The journey map provides an overview of the events that take place within the Role 1 MTF, the communication activities, the workload, and the cognitive load as it is perceived by the general military physician (AMA). It was decided to focus on the AMA, as this person has the role of commander and has to makes the medical decisions. Design opportunities could be identified from the journey map and were used as a starting point for ideation. The ideation resulted in several design ideas, which were evaluated on their desirability and credibility. The insights obtained from this evaluation were used to formulate a future vision, which was visualised in a vision map (figure 1).<br/>The future vision describes three innovation horizons to increase SA and improve the communication of patient details in the Role 1 MTF. The first horizon describes how process innovation could be achieved in the short term. The second horizon proposes the adaptation of available technology, which can be implemented within 15 years. The third horizon describes disruptive innovation for the far future, where the Role 1 MTF will become obsolete.<br/>In the end, this graduation project provided a tool to evaluate the communication of patient details in the Role 1 MTF and a vision for future innovation. These tools are the outcome of user-centered research, which makes them of value for the MinDef and can support future innovation for the Role 1 MTF.","Military; Situational awareness; Communication; Healthcare; Journey mapping; Vision; Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This was achieved by examining innovation, adoption and the existing theories around those, looked at through the lens of the company context and corporate challenges. The current implementation process and user involvement were examined, allowing for a comparison of the literature and reality. Studied innovation and adoption theories include the UTAUT model, growth hacking and ADKAR, amongst others. This research revealed that relevance of an innovation to its target group is one of the most important adoption determinants, as well as its ease of use. A combined model is introduced that shows the application of user-centeredness to increase adoption. Considering the existing implementation process includes an agile feedback loop that is focused on cultivating ease of use, a focus on expanding that user involvement is chosen. Expanding it into the decision-making level on the business side of the applicationâs development creates opportunities to make the decisions more user-centered, causing a trickle-down effect. The design goal is reformulated as âIncreasing adoption by representing user input (aided by growth hacking strategies) in the prioritization process for A2H, to help the airline achieve their goal of making operations more efficient and customer-centric through digitalization.â Focusing on this prioritization process revealed some areas for improvement regarding the current way of working, as well as a need for more evidence to support decisions. Intersecting this opportunity with the user involvement goal of the project led to the development of a framework that allows for the collection of direct user input to provide evidence for decision-making. Additionally, studies and interviews were conducted to establish whether user input in the prioritization session would yield different results than the current way of working, and it was found to have influence on the decisions made. This framework, the âUser Value Frameworkâ, was established using insights from contextmapping, observations and interviews. It includes an intervention that supports the process of collecting user input to be used in the prioritization session. It is presented as part of a strategy to increase UX maturity in the company and move toward more explorative research and user-driven business. To achieve this, it includes a validation and expansion strategy over the long term to accommodate in-between proof of value of user-centeredness.

(mentor); Akyildiz, A.C. (mentor); French, P.J. (mentor); Vdovin, Gleb (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Introduction: Atherosclerosis, the major source of cardiovascular diseases, is one of the leading causes of death. During atherosclerosis the arterial wall is affected by a complex process of lipid driven inflammation that leads to thickening of the arterial wall resulting in a so called plaque. Because of plaque growth, the lumen of the artery gradually narrows. As the lumen area is decreasing, reduction and even restriction of blood flow can occur, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke depending on the affected artery. Biomechanical stresses are known to influence the development of the disease. Those stress are the plaque structural stress (PSS) and wall shear stress (WSS) induced by the blood flow at the vessel wall. The aim of this project was to study the contribution of these biomechanical stresses and their combination to plaque progression in human coronary arteries. In order to investigate this effect a new methodology for the calculation of the stresses was introduced that utilizes the image modalities optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The combination of those two image modalities can provide more accurate information regarding the plaque composition than the approaches that have been applied so far. In particular the cap thickness, which is the region shielding the lipid rich necrotic core from the blood flow, is crucial for structural stress calculations. Methods: The new methodology consisted of three steps. During the first step image data from the image modalities optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) were fused. The resulted images were cross-sections of the human coronary arteries that consisted of the lumen and the outer wall obtained from IVUS and the fibrous cap obtained from OCT. However, they did not contain information about the size of the necrotic core; thus, the second step was to reconstruct the necrotic core. For that purpose an algorithm from the literature was implemented that can reconstruct the necrotic core. The produced geometry resulting from the second step consisted of the same features as those from step one but they also included the contours of the necrotic core. The third step was the calculation of the PSS using those 2D geometries. The WSS data were obtained from another study. For the statistical analysis the data of both stress calculations were ranked as low, medium and high. Two different approaches for the definition of the thresholds of those ranks were used, vessel specific and absolute thresholds. In the vessel specific approach the thresholds of the aforementioned ranks were specific for each vessel, while in the second approach the threshold values were based on the whole sample size. Those two approaches were studied in order to explore if the response of the vessels depends to the absolute values of biomechanical stresses or it is relative to their respective biomechanical stresses. Change in wall thickness was used as metric to quantify the plaque progression. In order to study the contribution of the biomechanical stresses to the plaque progression in the human coronary arteries, statistical analysis was carried out using ANOVA with plaque progression as dependent variable and PSS and WSS as independent variables. Results: Plaque development was significantly related to WSS using both approaches to rank the WSS values into low, mid and high. In general, regions exposed to low WSS showed the most plaque progression. The individual effect of PSS was not statistically significant using both approaches, however there was a trend demonstrating that high PSS could promote plaque development. When PSS and WSS were combined using the vessel specific approach to rank the data, there was plaque progression for the cases of low WSS combined with any level of plaque structural stress. However, only WSS had a statistically significant effect in this case revealing that the resulted effect was entirely estimated by WSS. If absolute thresholds were used for both WSS and PSS, there was no statistical effect. Despite that, there was a trend showing that high PSS combined with high WSS could promote plaque development. Conclusions: During this project a new methodology was utilized in order to study the contribution of WSS, PSS and their combination to the plaque development in human coronary arteries. It was also the first study that utilized the combination of the image modalities OCT and IVUS in that topic. It was demonstrated that WSS could promote plaque development. PSS also enhanced plaque progression but with no statistically significant effect. Regarding the combination, it was demonstrated that the effect was explained completely by wall shear stress for the vessel specific approach. For the absolute thresholds approach, there was no statistically significant effect. However, more data are required to validate these results.","OCT; IVUS; biomechanical stresses; wall shear stress; plaque structural stress; FEA; Atherosclerosis; Atherosclerotic Fibrous cap; coronary; artery; ANOVA analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Time correlation is achieved byhopping a message through the whole network. This message wakes up all thenodes and lets them perform a measurement. Measurement data is added tothe transmitted message and is collected by a gateway at the end. The nodesharvest energy from a Radio Frequency (RF) source and store it in a capacitor.When the capacitor has sufficient energy, the nodes can turn on their system.A low power Wake-Up Receiver (WURx) is turned on and the nodes fall asleepwhile waiting for the incoming request message. Communication is done usingactive transmissions and the ultra-low-power WURx for data reception. Nodesconsume a continuous power of less than 2 ÂµW in sleep mode while the WURx isturned on. The receiving sensitivity is -40 dBm, which limits the communicationrange. The request message hops through the network to overcome distancelimitation. Collisions are avoided with Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) usingthe WURx. The hidden node problem is overcome by toggling an operationalamplifier during CCA. Distance limitation is overcome by a novel network layeralgorithm. The network layer algorithm finds a directed acyclic graph (DAG)based on all nodes, starting in a single special source node and ending in agateway. Data from all the nodes are gathered in a round, where each node cantransmit one message around. The timing interval between the data collection ischosen to be bigger than the required energy divided by the minimal harvestedpower. In this way, all nodes will have sufficient energy in every time interval.The found DAG represents all important links where the nodes should wait forbefore measuring and transmitting.

The model has been simulated for a case study of an Airbus A310 main landing gear replacement. Independent teams provided the best performance using a mediated feedback automated negotiation method. The most beneficial results for compliant teams were obtained through task allocation by the team lead. Social teams presented significantly better results for voting than for other task allocation methods. The combination of socially oriented mechanics and task allocation by voting provided the most advantageous task execution performance for all simulations.

As the patients in this department could easily deteriorate and (potentially) pass away, the staff members of LUMCâs ICU often need to act rapidly and make decisions within a short period of time, while they experience severe (time) pressure. This pressure causes stress and increases the chance of human errors by the staff members, which eventually could lead to adverse events (incidents that caused irreversible damage to patients). In order to minimise the human errors made by the staff members and thereby, the amount of adverse events, the ICU physicians and nurses of the LUMC currently need to participate with two training exercises, called Advanced Life Support+ (ALS+) and Crew Resource Management (CRM). Despite the fact that they are encouraged to reflect on- and expand their non-technical skill set, the (ALS+/CRM) trainers still notice that the non-technical skills of the staff members differ with their expectations. Initially, they believed that the difference in desired behaviour (by the trainers) and shown behaviour (by the staff members) is caused by the current set-up of the ALS+ and CRM training. However, it was found that this difference is mainly caused by two other factors. First, although they need to participate with the ALS+ and CRM training, the staff members still have little awareness about their behavioural impact on acute procedures, meaning that they do not precisely know how they can stimulate effective teamwork. Second, the staff members are barely triggered to reflect on their behaviour or to apply their learnings/action points (in practice) once they participated with the ALS+ and CRM training. As a result, (sustainable) behavioural change is not established and the staff members continue to show their old behavioural patterns. Based on these two factors, I developed the iCare-initiative. The iCare-initiative consists of four product solutions: an application, renewed (digital) patient boards, pocket cards and debriefing-flyers. <br/>In the short term, the staff members can reflect more structuredly on their behaviour with the use of the debriefing-flyers. Next, they are reminded of their action points and other important behaviours (during acute procedures) via the pocket cards. In the long term, once the staff members feel more comfortable to think about- and reflect on their behaviour (in teams), the application and renewed patient boards will be launched. The application offers a platform to the staff members to individually develop/train their non-technical skill set and reflect more consciously on their behavioural impact. Furthermore, the patient boards aim to create continuous awareness amongst the staff members to reflect on their behaviour, but also to encourage them to share useful insights via a convenient (accessible) platform. Although the iCare-initiative consists of four separate product solutions, they all work together in one integrated system. This system mainly aims to prepare the staff members for acute procedures, to expose which non-technical skills they should improve, and to allow the staff members to individually develop their non-technical skills. Eventually, these new opportunities will accelerate the transition towards desired behaviour in LUMCâs ICU.","intensive care unit; behaviour; behavioural change; teamwork; healthcare; service design; concept design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

To reduce accidents with other road users, automated recognition and classification of road users is crucial. The most accurate models are large convolutional neural networks, however they require expensive and powerful hardware to be implemented. The hardware requirement hinders wide embedded use in education and industry, slowing down the potential increase of safety on the road. In pursue of reduced inference time on GPUs, research has focused to reduce the computational demand of neural networks. However the accelerations on microcomputers are not reported, potentially leading to different results.<br/>To contribute to increased insight of the applicability of previous research on microcomputers, this thesis compares accelerations on a microcomputer and GPU. This is pursued by using the pretrained neural network ""Squeezedet"", trained on the ""KITTI"" road user dataset. The neural network is pruned in 3 different ways: by reducing the number of filters, by reducing the size of filter kernels along a layer and by reducing the amount of layers. The accelerations<br/>are measured on a Raspberry Pi 3b+ and a Tesla K80 GPU. The process of embedding the neural network on the Raspberry Pi is described in great detail, to promote further research and educational use. Acceleration of the network is up to 12 % better on a Raspberry Pi than a GPU, when pruning filters from the network. When pruning full layers, or decreasing filter size the accelerations are up to 4% worse than on a GPU. This means when working with a microcomputer, the choice of pruning method can not be based on reported accelerations on GPUs. Therefore the recommendation is to do more research on accelerating neural networks for microcomputers. This will lead to wider use in industry and education and eventually safer roads.","vehicle; neural; network; safety; automated; artificial; intelligence; convolutional; pruning; accelerating; microcomputer; raspberry; pi; object; detection; road; user; pedestrian; cyclist; car; filter; kernel; layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Companies need to keep up with the fast pace of the rapidly changing business landscape to stay competitive. To achieve this, they have to find ways to continuously innovate and search for new opportunities. The company Pon Holding believes that continuous innovation can be achieved by unleashing the ideas of employees in all their subsidiaries (so-called Operating Companies). This approach is called bottom-up innovation, where employees are considered in the front-line to witness (i) hurdles in current operating models, (ii) changes in customer demands, and (iii) trends in the market that can become (new) business opportunities. For Pon Holding, exploiting employeesâ ideas allows the Operating Companies to rejuvenate current products and services and create new ones. Pon (Holding) consists of 4 business groups, including Pon Equipment and Pon Power Solutions (PEPP). The business group PEPP has built the innovation lab âArea 52â to embed continuous innovation into the business group and its 8 Operating Companies. The aim of Area 52 is to embed bottom-up and continuous innovation in Operating Companies to sub consequently focus solely on the creation of new ventures for PEPP. Unfortunately, Area 52 sees that (i) employees within Operating Companies are inhibited and prevented from working on ideas and that (ii) Operating Companies struggle to make innovation a priority and facilitate bottom-up innovation within their organizations. <br/>Hence, the main purpose of this thesis is to explore and design how Operating Companies can support employees to innovate in a structured, consistent, and experimental manner during their daily work activities. Hereby, it offers PEPP a generic design ready for implementation and offers new perspectives to both the organization and todayâs literature gaps. By conducting extensive interviews and observations, light is shed on the 15 factors within PEPP that affect innovative behavior among employees and the main hurdle of a lack of time is identified. Additionally, it revealed that bottom-up innovation takes place but is unfruitful. As a matter of fact, a handful of employees work on ideas in their personal time dealing with (i) a low success rate, (ii) high risks, and (iii) no compensating rewards. This low success rate is found to be vital to resolve since it (i) can be easily prevented by offering tooling and (ii) leads to fruitful results that sub consequently (iii) encourage more employees to engage in bottom-up innovation. Minimum tooling in the form of a crash course is designed, ready for implementation within the existing structure of OpCoâs. Offered by Area 52, the crash course equips employees with the necessary innovation expertise leading to higher the success rate of their ideas. A pilot with 12 participating employees found that the crash course (i) developed participantsâ innovation expertise (and thus organizational innovation capabilities), (ii) increased the success rate of ideas, and (iii) contributed to building an innovative-supportive climate. Despite its positive results, necessary conditions and recommended iterations require more attention to ensure the tooling is implemented and bottom-up innovation can be realized.","Corporate Entrepreneurship; Bottom-up approach; MVP Tooling; Crash Course","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

When this aspect is overlooked a foundation element risks not reaching its design depth or getting damaged during the installation process. As a result significant delays and/or costs could occur. A driveability study gives insight in the installation aspects of a foundation element. Driveability is the ability of a foundation element to be driven to a designated depth with a<br/>reasonable speed and without exceeding acceptable material stress. In this report will be researched how the probability of refusal of a sheet pile installed by vibro-driving can be predicted by means of a driving speed-depth-curve (vp-z-curve). Having insight in probability of refusal improves risk assessment and decision-making on driving projects. The focus is on sheet pile installation by vibro hammers as these projects are generally executed in large numbers and under similar conditions. Therefore, these project types are very suitable for application of probability theory. Allwave-PDP is used as a basis to create a probabilistic prediction method. Parameters of the pile driving system (pile, hammer and soil) modelled in Allwave-PDP are turned into stochastic parameters in the probabilistic method. Probability of refusal is predicted with a Monte Carlo simulation. Pile and hammer parameters are modelled by deterministic parameters. Variability of soil parameters is caused by soil heterogeneity and transformation variability. The probabilistic method is validated with three well-reported case studies in Woudsend, Den Oever and Rotterdam. Predicted results show agreement with measured results. The model is a proof of concept that shows the potential of applying probability theory to driveability prediction methods. A proof of concept of the modelling (transformation and spatial variability) and the method (extension of Allwave-PDP) is given. Not any existing model is known to incorporate probability theory in driveability prediction methods. The probabilistic method can simply be extended to other pile types or impact hammers. Therefore, this method is promising to predict different pile driving system configurations.","Driveability; Random field; Soil heterogeneity; Vibro hammer; Soil damping; Soil fatigue; Pile installation; Sheet pile; Probabilistic model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Cryogenic propellant is necessary to make space beyond the Moon accessible. Boil-off of cryogenic liquids raises the initial mass of spacecraft by increasing the amount of propellant required to carry-on. Therefore, mitigation of boil-off is key in reducing the mass of the propellant tank. The goal of the thesis is to find the mass optimum of a cryogenic propellant tank by varying the different passive and active insulation options. The question what the most mass efficient configuration of propellant and structure of a given cryogenic propellant tank for space applications using active and passive boil-off mitigation options is answered. Different options to reduce the heat flow to the fluid and vapour are identified. Spray-on foam insulation, multi-layer insulation and coatings are passive methods to prevent propellant from heating. An active component such as a cryocooler can be included in propellant tank design to remove heat from a system. It is also possible to increase the maximum allowable pressure, thereby increasing the saturation temperature of the liquid, or to reduce the initial storage temperature of the propellant to increase the heat capacity of a liquid before the liquid boils. A tool is developed which analyses different propellant tank design options by calculating the heat flow through the propellant tank insulation and structure to the fluid bulks. The propellant tank structure is divided into separate nodes and the heat flow between different nodes is calculated. The liquid and vapour bulks are also modelled as two nodes of the system. Heat is transferred between these nodes by radiation, conduction or convection. By analysing many options in a Monte Carlo-like system, a design optimised for the total mass can be selected. The Boil-off Monte Carlo program developed has models for different insulation methods. The conduction equation is used to identify the heat flow through the spray-on foam insulation and the propellant tank shell. For the multi-layer insulation, the empirical modified Lockheed equation is used to determine the heat flow over the layers of insulation. The mass penalty and power required for including a cryocooler to the design are found by using the empirical Ter-Brake and Air-force Laboratory relations for existing cryocoolers. In the mass penalty for the cryocooler, the additional mass for the power system and wiring are included. Different parts of the program have been verified. Due to a lack of experimental and flight data of existing spacecraft, the Boil-off Monte Carlo program is not validated. Two cases are analysed, a propellant depot orbiting Earth at geostationary orbit and the Centaur upper stage loitering to Mars. For the propellant depot, three mission duration are used to identify when passive-only insulation suffices and from when onward an active component saves mass. The Centaur upper stage mission is used to identify whether the stage can be used for a long space mission by only modifying the insulation. From the results, it can be concluded that it is most efficient to insulate a propellant tank with passive insulation if the mission duration is under a year. For a mission duration longer than 12 months, active measures reduce the mass of the tank compared to passive-only insulated designs. The Centaur stage can be used for longer space missions by adding MLI to the existing design. By adding a cryocooler boil-off can be mitigated for any mission. The most mass efficient configuration of the Centaur travelling to Mars is by adding 60 layers of MLI and a cryocooler providing 5 [W] of cooling power to the original design.","Liquid hydrogen; Space Systems Engineering; Propellant tank; cryogenic liquid; insulation; Centaur; mass optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Extreme events such as storms continuously threaten the coastal region and pose a serious risk of coastal flooding. Under the influence of climate change, the seaward pressures are only expected to increase. Sea level rise is accelerating, storm intensities and frequencies will increase, and precipitation will become more extreme. At the same time human pressures such as coastal tourism and rapid urbanisation impose stresses to the coastal system. An estimated 23% of the world's population lives in the coastal zone where natural hazards cause a direct flood risk. Protection of the coastal region becomes more and more relevant. Coastal management strategies need to take the local circumstances into account. Therefore, a good understanding of the coastal zone is needed, but especially in data-poor regions there is a lack of geomorphological information such as slope and grain size. This thesis presents an alternative approach for acquiring this data with the ability to run on a global scale using remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing, satellite imagery in particular, has proven to be a promising new technology to monitor coastal regions at large temporal and spatial scales and is applied here to determine coastal slopes and sediment sizes. The approach has shown promising results and paves the way for an estimate of the grain size at beaches around the world. Some hurdles remain to be taken but the ability to do measurements of coasts around the globe using satellite imagery will change the way we study our coasts forever.

The spacecraft should be orientated properly during the orbit, according to the mission objectives. The estimation is based on a plethora of sensors, like rate gyroscopes, star trackers, sun and earth sensors, magnetometers (for low earth orbits). However, during the orbit the spacecraft operates according to some protocol, which is characterized from its different modes. During safe mode conditions, gyroscopes and/or star trackers might be turned off for energy saving reasons. Then the satellite senses only the geomagnetic field's direction and directions of other celestial bodies. In addition, the motion of a rigid body is described from well-known dynamic equations up to model uncertainties. The goal is to estimate how the satellite faces the Earth at each instant of time, by utilizing the two aforementioned sources of information. Limited research has been undertaken for this problem; on the contrary, the vast majority of published works provide solutions to the problem at the presence of rate sensors. Within a general non-linear framework, the problem of orientation and rate estimation can be set under the Bayesian formulation of estimation. The available tools provided by this approach, are the widely-known Kalman-Based filters. An alternative compelling approach considers the dual optimal control problem thus being more compatible with the geometric nature of the problem. This approach is also more promising, since it overcomes some critical difficulties of the former one and it is applicable in a coordinate free fashion. In this thesis, the aforementioned observation is emphasized and looked into. Therefore, two specific filters are studied: the second-order-optimal minimum energy filter on the special orthogonal group; and the predictive filter on, which is derived on this work. The two filters perform very well with the predictive filter to be less tolerant in measurement noise. Both filters are analyzed and simulated in various scenarios and a comparison is demonstrated, given particular emphasis to their structure. Finally, the predictive filter on is extended and used in an attempt to provide an alternative approach for the problem of the orbital position estimation by utilizing a kinematic model for the Earth's geomagnetic field. Towards this direction it is proved that under some realistic assumptions this later problem is equivalent to two separate problems and therefore the resulting filter can be decomposed in two distinct filters interconnected in series. The optimal correction term which is determined through the estimation process provides information regarding the orbital rotation rate.","Attitude Estimation; Lie groups; Optimal Control Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

A new, energy-recovering ankle-knee prosthesis was designed to provide support during SitTS and StandTS, with a natural torque profile. The prosthesis uses pneumatic cylinders to store energy during StandTS, and recover it during SitTS. To make the use of the prosthesis as intuitive as possible, the design was optimized to mimic natural torque profiles during the transition. The addition of an ankle joint enables a more posterior placement of the prosthetic limb, which should reduce the required knee torque. The prototype provides a peak extending knee torque of 21.7 Nm and a peak plantarflexing ankle torque of 10.8 Nm during SitTS, which can be further increased by increasing the pre-pressure in the system. It is concluded that the current prototype has the potential to provide support during the SitTS and StandTS transitions, but that alterations are required to improve the available joint torques.

Municipalities face challenges in unwanted changes in the population of the city because different groups are having problems fulfilling their housing needs. In particular, lower- and middle-income groups are affected by the limited supply of housing suitable for their means. Also, as a result of national economizing, an increasing amount of elderly lives for a longer time at their own home, instead of in a healthcare institution, despite the fact they need a form of (mild) care. This group has a higher risk of the consequences of feeling lonely as well since a large part of this group lives alone. Different shared living concepts could contribute to partly solving the problems municipalities are facing. Rental- or buying prices could be lower, because of new business cases, the sharing of facilities and possibly square meters. Next to this, important social networks could be set up, which leads to differentiation and better social cohesion in a city. There are several initiatives for shared living projects, but despite mentioning the willingness to facilitate new forms of living and organizing this by some municipalities in their housing visions, different bottlenecks are making the realization of the projects difficult. One form of shared living, which is upcoming again, and can realize projects offering houses with a rent in the social and middle segment in a city, is the housing cooperative.

For effective use in energy storage, hydrogen has to be compressed. Conventional electrolysis of water and subsequent mechanical compression of hydrogen is an energy intensive process. A one-step conversion and compression can take place in a Electrochemical Hydrogen Compressor (EHC). This has the disadvantage that the resulting stream of high pressure hydrogen contains water. In order to assess the capability of hydrophilic zeolites as a means of selectively adsorbing this water, a in silico screening study of 6 zeolites was performed. To this end, a force field was constructed to allow for the simulation of high pressure hydrogen dehydration using Monte Carlo methods. The validity of this force field was evaluated by replicating simulation studies of adsorption of water/ hydrogen on zeolite frameworks with the presence of extra-framework cations. At the system pressure of 875 bar, prediction of the fugacity coefficient by means of the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (PR-EOS) yields inaccurate results. Therefore, these are calculated in the CFCNPT ensemble. It is demonstrated that the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) is not suited to predict binary adsorption isotherms in this system. As a result of the screening study, it is found that the selectivity of water over hydrogen is almost linearly correlated to the amount of Al atoms in the zeolite framework. Furthermore, it is observed that topologies which feature a low amount of void space outperform those where significant void spaces are present. This can be attributed to the fact that the interactions of the zeolite with water are stronger than those with hydrogen in the limit of a low Si/Al ratio (Si/Al=1). It is theorized that water adsorbs preferentially at the surface of the zeolite, and competitive adsorption by hydrogen can only take place in sufficiently large void spaces.","Hydrogen; Dehydration; Zeolites; RASPA; BRICK; Grand Canonical Monte Carlo; molecular simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

The area of interest is called the Couspeau area and is 72 km2. In this area, Vocontian basin sediments deposited during the Jurassic and Cretaceous can be found. The area contains well exposed fold and thrust structures. The oldest structures begin in the West, while the younger ones can be found in the East. All thrusts strike approximately N-S. These thrusts were assumed to be formed by the second Alpine orogeny. A structural map of the area was created in QGIS version 3.12.0 using geologic maps from the BRGM and using fieldwork data from Applied Earth Sciences students collected during the AESB2430 course at TU Delft. Subsequently, four E-W orientated cross sections of the area were constructed. These sections were restored using MOVE to verify if the interpretations were geologically feasible. 2D forward modelling was then applied to discover possible types of structural mechanisms which were active in this area. Possible mechanisms include fault-bend folding and regular folding. Fault propagation folding was assumed to be a suitable mechanism, but didnât produce satisfactory forward models. Strain circles were added during forward modelling to analyse what kind of deformation is caused by different thrusting mechanisms. The restored sections were also used to calculate the total amount of shortening in the area, and how much of this shortening was caused by folding or faulting. The total amount of shortening was 24%, from which 38% was caused by faulting and 62% by folding.","Structural Geology; 2D modeling; Vocontian Basin; Fold and Thrust belt","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before stretching the current limit, AAS shall demonstrate that its growth is safely possible. In the past, both Hillestad et al.

Therefore, a currently lacking definition for taxiway system at systems level is defined first. Besides, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for taxiway systems are defined in order to identify parameters for improving the system based on stakeholders' point of views: safety, capacity, robustness, and environmental impact. Also, methods for assessing taxiway systems on these identified KPIs are defined. Next, AAS is used as a case study to analyze the performance of the taxiway system at the airport on the defined safety KPI. As part of the safety analysis of AAS, for the first time a taxiway system was analyzed on the Sustainable Safety vision as developed for road traffic - and showed to be valuable.

However, the design of flexible gas turbine combustors able to operate with a wide range of Dutch Natural Gas (DNG) and hydrogen fuels is accompanied by new complex challenges. Small quenching distance, high burning velocity and propensity to develop instabilities at leaner conditions makes hydrogen-rich fuels particularly prone to boundary layer flashback (BLF). Both academia and industry are currently involved in developing a better understanding of the BLF phenomenon, so that new generation combustors can be designed. From recent experimental investigations carried out by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) research group, it has been noted that the configuration of the flame plays a crucial role in flashback propensity. In confined geometry, where the flame is partially or completely surrounded by walls, the boundary layer flashback propensity is much higher. Indeed, in the confined configuration the flame-flow interaction effects are very strong. However, even in the unconfined configuration it is not completely clear how the flame-flow interaction affects the boundary layer flashback onset.<br/>In the present work, tube burners have been used to investigate different hydrogen/DNG turbulent flames. Particular attention was paid to the lean hydrogen premixed flames relevant for gas turbines combustors. In the first part of the investigation, flame regime maps have been used to characterize flashback propensity of different hydrogen/DNG mixtures at different equivalence ratios. Furthermore, the effect of tip temperature has been investigated by comparing flashback onset in both cooled and uncooled conditions. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Mie-scattering measurements have been used, both to obtain useful statistical data and to visualize the flashback transient phenomenon. Indeed, the lean hydrogen flame and DNG flame behaviour during flashback have been visualized and compared.<br/>The results highlight that, the flame-flow interaction plays an important role. The interaction is related to the hydrodynamic or Darrius Landau instability which causes the presence of an adverse pressure gradient just downstream of the flame front. The adverse pressure gradient leads to a slowdown of the flow, which allows the flame front to propagate upstream. The coupling of this interaction with the velocity fluctuations of the turbulent field leads to flashback. The flashback location is outside of the viscus sublayer, but still in the proximity of the wall, where the velocity fluctuations are stronger and the distance between the average flame front and the burner exit is small. The distance between the burner tube outlet and the flame front directly affects the strength of the adverse pressure gradient on the approaching flow. The closer the flame front is to the burner exit, the more the incoming flow is deflected and retarded by the burner walls. In these experiments the most significant difference between the DNG and hydrogen flame is not qualitative but quantitative. The mechanism itself is qualitatively the same, however, hydrogen flame flashback occurs much more abruptly. This is related to the response of hydrogen flame speed to stretch. Indeed, since the Lewis number is lower than one, the lean hydrogen flame speed increases with stretch leading to thermal-diffusive instability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evolution of the Internet has led to a new economy based on digital information and communication. New production, consumption and business models are mushrooming, especially in the Province of South-Holland. This fast development is facilitated by the massive exploitation of construction materials, energy and data flows. The data sector has a high energy demand, which is even surpassing the CO2-emission of the aviation and shipping industry. The flows that support the sector are linear, consuming a lot of energy and producing a lot of waste, because construction materials and infrastructures have a short life-span. The Province of South-Holland aims to be circular in 2050. Thus, addressing the challenges that this new economy poses on the region need to be prioritized. The strategic and integrated development of the digital economy into the (urban) fabric of South-Holland functions as a catalyst for the circular Province. The goal will be reached by proposing a strategy consisting of a spatial development framework, stakeholder action plan, phasing and scenarios, policy guidelines and a typology toolbox. This strategic report explores how a connected and resilient datascape in South-Holland can be created/developed while preserving the global value and increasing the local value. For the strategic and integrated development of the digital economy into the (urban) fabric of South-Holland, data hubs as a platform for awareness, participation and knowledge exchange are proposed. These platforms will either function as a creator or a transformer of the local environment, while preserving the global position of the region. The development of these datascapes is circular, (energy-) efficient and creates value throughout the different scales. This will form the base of a sustainable and resilient circular economy in the Province. In this strategy, the flows of construction materials, energy and data are optimized from linear flows to circular cycles.","Circular Economy; Province of South Holland; Data","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio â Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

This has shown to increase the initial cost of construction which, if left uncontrolled, would lead to an increasing gap in the provision of affordable social housing.

To explore how a circular construction industry can be deployed in the provision of social housing, our focus is on three different kind of strategic areas: social housing in big cities, social housing in medium-sized cities and (former) industrial areas. The previously mentioned tools will illustrate not only the transition towards a more circular construction industry that supports the provision of social housing, but also shows how it can function as an area that engages people with the transitions towards a circular economy.

(1999). DEMCON Medical Systems is working on a novel TC method to repair Mitral valve regurgitation in early stages as a preventive measure against progressive MR. The envisioned device is to achieve this through the placement of artificial chordae tendineae or neochordae. This thesis presents the next iteration step within this project. A design was created which was capable of placing neochordae in a simplified procedure, in an ex vivo environment. The design was translated into a prototype, which was used to evaluate the design via two tests.<br/><br/>Test one consisted of a timed intervention. Eleven participants were asked to place neochordae on a plastic heart model in four rounds. The procedure was completed from the start untill locking of the neochordae length 41/44 times. Mean procedure time dropped over the rounds with 590.7, 404.5, 303.7, 280.2 [s] for rounds 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. Standard deviation reduction over the rounds on the placed neochordae length was less than the reduction in procedure time. Mean Â± standard deviations were 88.7 Â± 7.4, 87.6 Â± 7.0, 85.6 Â± 2.0, 88.4, Â± 12 [mm] for rounds 1,2,3,4 respectively.<br/><br/>In test two, the design was presented and the procedure demonstrated to a panel of four cardiac experts from the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC), including a thorax surgeon, two cardiologists, and an interventional cardiologist. They were asked to evaluate the deviceâs safety and theorize on the clinical effectiveness of the design. They concluded that the tines on the ventricular and leaflet fixation components were potential safety risks, due to potentially damaging pre-existing chordae tendineae and papillary muscles during placement. Furthermore, they critiqued the general shape of the implant. Participants expressed a need to place multiple neochordae. Additionally, they expressed a preference for the straight-line technique the implemented folding leaflet technique.<br/><br/>Through these results, it was concluded that the designed procedure is feasible to execute in an ex vivo environment. The procedure order, has the potential to serve as inspiration and backbone for future developments. The translatability of the designed components onto the next iteration has to be critically reviewed. First, several components have to be further evaluated on their mechanical performance as well as overall performance in a more clinically representative test environment. Additionally, the feedback provided at the MUMC is in stark contrast to the continuous guidance from the thorax surgeon at the MST. The fundamentality and severity of their critique should be taken as a warning and prompt further investigation towards patient safety criteria and research into the optimal implant shape. Future research into these crucial aspects could hinder the strict adaptation of the current component designs. Overall this iteration and its evaluation have generated a lot of new insights regarding the placement of neochordae.<br/><br","Chordae Tendinea; Biomedical device; Endovascular; Mitral Regurgitation; Mitral Valve; Neochordae","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-18","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the past decades extreme weather events have become more common as a result of climate change, which is brought on by the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Climate change and sustainable development are motivators for the research topic of this thesis, since the prevention of a climate crisis is favourable to the mitigation of its consequences. Emissions and plastic waste can, in part, be decreased by substituting synthetic materials with degradable and sustainably sourced ones since their embodied energy is lower than that of synthetic materials. Flax fibre composites are thought to be capable of competing with glass fibre in various product applications, such as non-essential structures, sports equipment and designer products. Because of the hydrophilic nature of plant fibres, they tend to be subject to incompatibility when paired with hydrophobic polymers such as epoxy, which ultimately means that they have below average interfacial properties. The studies performed on this issue suggest that hydrolysation of the hydrophilic hemicellulose, which is a one of compounds making up plant fibres, with dilute alkali solutions leads to an increment in tensile and transverse properties of flax fibre composites. The interfacial properties of synthetic fibres are best evaluated by performing the pull-out test, the micro-bond test and the single fibre fragmentation test. Since plant fibres are prone to scattered tensile properties, the single fibre fragmentation test is found to be most suitable as it consists of a fully epoxy embedded fibre, increasing the chances of the test to succeed. According to literature, an increase in adhesion manifests as an increased amount fibre fragments in the sample, as well as shorter fragmentation length. Due to the more ductile nature of elementary flax fibre bundles, their fragmentation did not resemble the one observed for synthetic fibres in literature. It was however noticed that the birefringence patterns forming as a consequence of stress concentration, matrix cracks or debonding, could be used as a qualitative indication towards the improvement or deterioration of the interfacial properties. Results were affected by the uncontrollability of independent variables such as fibre diameter, the presence of kink-bands and other naturally occurring fibre defects. Alkalisation was found to affect the birefringence patterns in the single fibre fragmentation test in two opposing ways: by affection adhesion and fibre failure strain. Low intensity treatments showed and increased manifestation of birefringence patterns due to the improved adhesion, while the higher intensity treatments were found to hinder the nucleation and propagation of birefringence patterns because of the decreased failure strain difference between the two materials. Tensile tests of the technical fibres showed that higher intensity treatments led to an increase in failure strain of the fibres due to decrease in micro-fibril angle in elementary fibre bundles and swelling in technical fibres. The applicability of the single fibre fragmentation test in combination with elementary flax fibre bundles is limited due to the hardly controllable independent variables, and is unlikely to provide an accurate quantification of the interfacial shear strength of plant fibres.","Flax; adhesion; sfft; single fibre fragmentation test; fibre; interfacial; alkalisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This is especially the case for the operation of connecting the second end of the cable to the turbine. The applied method of using a quadrant means that in the workability analyses, multibody dynamics, line dynamics and sea state dynamics need to be combined, resulting in lengthy simulation requirements. The objective of this thesis is to determine vessel motion based limits to cable integrity in order to simplify workability analyses. This method allows the problem to be analyzed in the frequency domain, resulting in computational efficiency gains. In order to arrive at the desired result a literature study is performed regarding cable loading and cable failure modes encountered during quadrant assisted cable pull-ins. On that basis a detailed investigation into the relations between vessel motion and mechanical cable responses is carried out. To achieve this, a representative cable and a set of high but realistically encountered sea states are simulated. The obtained relations are then compared to the cable integrity limits for curvature, tension and compression to acquire limits expressed in terms of motion parameters such as acceleration, velocity and displacement. The results from these simulations show that: 1) maximum cable tension is closely correlated to upward heave velocity of the crane tip, 2) maximum cable compression is closely correlated to downward heave velocity, 3) maximum curvature is most closely correlated to downward heave velocity. It is concluded from the results that the cable response can be determined from the crane tip heave motion, which in turn is known from the vessel motions. This means that analysis of such a problem is possible in the frequency domain. As the results show that heave motion is governing in cable failure, heave compensation in the crane is recommended for the operations considered. In addition, an enhancement of the analysis process is proposed by extracting the linear relations and vessel motion limits from a small set of time domain simulations and assessing the situation thoroughly in a frequency domain analysis. The configurations considered exclude any effects added by cable protection systems or interaction effects with rigid bodies in the vicinity of the cable. Even though the analysis process is generally applicable and constitutes a significant improvement in computational load, the obtained relations may be generalized further by implementing a closed formula relating vessel motion to cable failure, or application of the cable protection system to the assessed configuration. Additional research in these directions is encouraged.","subsea cables; quadrant; vessel motion based limits; second end pull-in; submarine cables; cable dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The weirs were built in the early 1930s and now one is faced with a replacement task. Various studies have been carried out in recent years on the future of the weirs in the river Meuse. This concerns research into the entire weir system, different types of weirs and the way in which the current weirs should be replaced. This study does not focus on one specific task, but focuses on various aspects that are important for the replacement task, both âsoftâ and âhardâ technical aspects. The first aspect is to find a suitable assessment framework that a new weir must meet. This assessment framework has been developed by means of literature research and interviews with specialists from Rijkswaterstaat, resulting in a risk and opportunity plan especially for weir structures. The assessment framework thus forms the basis for finding both a suitable weir type and a suitable solution for construction. A variant study has been carried out into different weir types. The considered weir types are delineated into a conventional variant, the flap weir, and three innovative variants, namely variants with inflatable technology. The steel-rubber gate, also known as the Obermeyer weir, scores best. This weir type consists of air-filled bellows that inflates and deflates the flaps. It is distinctive in terms of discharge capacity, nuisance and ease of maintenance.<br/>The next phase is to make a conceptual design. A new weir regime has been developed on the basis of several considered weir configurations. A weir configuration with two weir spans of 50 m weir, each with 5 separate flap-bellow components has been designed. Furthermore, the weir sill has been designed with a length of 34 m. Based on the design loads on the bottom, a soil protection has been designed. A block mattress with a geotextile as a filter proves to be a suitable soil protection. The downstream length of the bottom protection is designed as a total of 50 m. Thereafter the forces in the membrane are determined, after which a suitable type of membrane is designed.<br/>The last phase of this research focuses on finding a suitable solution for construction for the new weir in Linne. Three different construction methods have been developed, in-situ, side channel and prefab. For each method, the (global) weir dimensions are verified for the governing load situations. Ultimately, a suitable construction method is selected on the basis of an overall cost indication and assessment criteria, derived from the assessment framework that has been compiled in the first phase. Construction variant C, the prefab solution, scores best. It is an innovative solution in which the entire weir, including flap and bellow elements, is built in a construction dock upstream of the current weir and then transported using pontoons with winches. The major challenges of this construction method are the floating transport where the enormous weir construction must not be damaged, the coupling of the air supply pipes to the compressors in the abutment underwater by divers and the guarantee of a good transfer of forces from the weir sill to the bottom. On the other hand, there is considered to be a great advantage over the other variants in terms of, among other things, costs and construction time. The solution is therefore proposed as the implementation solution for the Obermeyer weir to replace the current weir in Linne.<br/>In addition to this study, a strategy has been developed to deal with uncertainty in design as a depth study.

Loneliness amongst adolescents is a complex problem that many are not aware of yet. Of the youth between 12 and 18 years old in Delft, 42% states to feel lonely (GGD Haaglanden, 2016). This issue needs to be addressed by Team Youth of Gemeente Delft. However, the civil servants and their partners do not act upon it. This led to the following research question of this project: âWill a design-led approach enable the civil servants of Team Youth from Gemeente Delft to act upon the complex problem of loneliness amongst adolescents in Delft together with other relevant actors?â First, three sub-questions were posed to find out what the design-led approach should consist of. They were answered through literature and field research. The first question addressed systemic design and showed that such an approach allows different actors to collaborate to find a mutual understanding of a situation. This enables the actors to create and follow a shared vision, for which interventions can be developed. The second sub-question gave insight into the current situation of loneliness amongst adolescents in Delft. A causal system map was created, which revealed six interconnected root causes that give a subjective explanation of why the problem is as it is. When researching why Team Youth currently does not act upon this situation, it was found that the policy implementation process is not performed optimally. This process was researched, and four areas of improvement were found. The involvement of unvaried parties, a consultative role of the civil servant, a conventional approach and an undefined structure of the process counteract when dealing with complexity. The third sub-question concerned the research of design principles that might improve or enrich these four areas. Co-design was discussed, which demands a collaborative role and the use of participatory techniques. To create one structured process that focuses on dealing with complexity and creating mutual understanding, the Systemic Design Toolkit process was mentioned. The insights and design principles from the research were translated into requirements for the design-led approach that would be set up. A research through design process followed, in which a systemic co-design process with four phases was set up, performed and researched. First, a network and co-creation team was built. Next, two co-creation sessions took place to explore the problem field and solution space. In the last phase, the results were discussed with Team Youth, which led to a defined action for the policy implementation plan. With the insights and results from the process, and help from actors in the network, the assigned actor was able to enact the action and develop an intervention. The research and evaluation of the performed process resulted in an adjusted list of requirements on which the final proposal is based: the WIJ-model (Welzijn Implementatie Jeugd model). This systemic co-design process enables civil servants to act upon complex problems during the policy implementation phase and implement well-being amongst the youth of Delft.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; WijStad; Gemeente Delft; Loneliness; Adolescents; Systemic design; Co-design; Design-led approach; Empowerment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

These visualisations were evaluated in a human-in-the-loop simulator study focused on supporting an early and late car overtake manoeuvre, initiated by HSC. Although most participants reported a preference for visualisation of both the intended trajectory as manoeuvring boundaries, results in terms of torque conflicts and position conflicts indicated no significant differences between the visualisations. Subsequent analysis, however, indicated that this was probably caused by the variability in how participants used the visualisations in combination with their apparent preferences in performing the overtake manoeuvre. In conclusion, supporting HSC with visual information does not improve compliance, but shows an improvement in acceptance. For future work it is recommended to further investigate the impact of visualisations on intra-driver variability.","Single Trajectory Haptic Shared Control; Ecological Interface Design; Visual Feedback; Conflicts; Compliance; Driving Behaviour; Overtake Manoeuvre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(II) The full feedback loop between corals and their environment forms the core of this model framework, where the morphological development is new and closes the feedback loop. (III) The developed BMF predicts the coral response to environmental input via (mainly) process-based relations within the accuracy of climate projections. (IV)- The BMF supports both the deep reef refugia hypothesis and the turbid reef refugia hypothesis. (V) The BMF contributes to the development of protection and recovery programs and is not site-specific. (VI) The BMF is developed for long-term predictions - in the order of decades to centuries - but runs on daily averages and is therefore applicable for assessing the response of corals on shorter time-scales; such as months to years. SUMMARY The increasing pressure on Earthâs ecosystems due to climate change becomes more and more evident. These pressures are especially visible at coral reefs. Therefore, a good understanding of the biophysical mechanisms controlling these ecosystems is needed, so that accurate predictions of their survival can be made. Such an understanding is also needed to develop efficient recovery and protection programs vital to the maintenance of these ecosystems. Because the research on marine ecosystems is relatively young and the phenomenon of coral bleaching is yet to be fully understood, there is no comprehensive framework in which the complex interactions between corals and their environment are combined. In this study, a biophysical model is developed in which four environmental factors are included in a feedback loop with the coralâs biology: (1) light; (2) hydrodynamics; (3) temperature; and (4) acidity. Literature from multiple disciplines is combined to find the interdependencies between the corals and their environment. These relations include coral growth, coral bleaching, storm damage, and recruitment/recolonization of corals. For the connection with the hydrodynamics, a coupling is made between the biological model developed here and Delft3D-FM. The composed biophysical model is a big leap forward in understanding the world of coral reefs, as it is the first construction of a model framework including four environmental factors in which the hydrodynamics are included in the feedback loop. Furthermore, it creates the ability to assess recovery and protection programs based on the four aforementioned environmental factors; e.g. the susceptibility of coral bleaching can be reduced by increasing the attenuation of light through the water column. Because more environmental factors have a role to play in the coral dynamics, the framework is constructed such that these can be added relatively easily.","Biophysical model; Coral reefs; Process-based modelling; Delft3D flexible mesh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Melbourne is one of the major cities in Australia consisting of 351 suburbs in total. One of them is St Albans, a suburb between the middle and outer suburbs, 15 km north-west of the city centre. This area is marked by a vast scale, repetition in the built and unbuilt environment, a limited number of dwelling types and a great amount of family living households. The exciting urban structure of the outskirts of the cities are mainly developed on a principle of freestanding villa types on extremely generous lots. At present, it is mainly the city centre of cities in Australia that are being developed, principally as high rise apartment building types in the grid structure of the city due to the forecasted population grow. The city centre of Melbourne is becoming more dense than ever and accordingly the domestic needs are changing. To meet these needs, it will require a housing brief in the middle and outer suburbs of Melbourne. As suburbs are increasingly recognised as part of a cityâs wellbeing with their own alternative ideology it opened up a perfect chance to investigate in these parts of the city and offers new opportunities. How to deal with the confrontation between the forecast of a rapidly growing population and the deep historical connection Australians have with the cultural identity of the suburbs in Melbourne? This graduation project is a proposal for a new typology in suburbia. The answer is found in a re-interpretation of the Australian dream. It seeks to defrost the current situation by unlocking the design potentials hidden in the physical structures of the suburbia, initiating a new chapter a low rise high density development. As Melbourne is a place of settlement from the cultural position of colonisations, it will be a mixed housing project construct to different income groups who can not achieve the Australian dream. A dream that is a belief that home-ownership can lead to a better life and is an expression of success and security. The welfare of the state was relatively small due to this mass home-ownership. The distribution of housing costs associated with housing loans led to a demand for a well developed welfare system. The gap between renting and owning a house is too big. The project response to the problem of affordability, accessibility and density in suburbia. Adding an active strip between the neighbourhood and the hospital intended as a lively catalyst for the neighbourhood. The idea is to swap the narrative between permanent and impermanent architecture, changing peopleâs perspective and bringing attention to a new typology. Together with a new way of living and working, it is up to the community to decide what the project does and what it means. By stepping off from the positive qualities of these areas, in this project St Albans, such as the good public transport connections and family friendly environments. It can be transformed into a new living environment for the low and medium income population connected to the city. This study constructs a strategy of affordable and sustainable housing, an implementation for a gradual transformation of the exciting urban structure of suburbia. The urban sprawl of the suburbs in Melbourne can become the most vibrant residential areas where the new domestic requirements can be met.","Densification; suburbs; manual","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","Independent Group",""

Vapor-compression based household refrigerators are one of the most used electrical appliances in the common household and consume electricity throughout the day, so finding a more efficient alternative would be beneficial. One such alternative uses the magnetocaloric effect as cooling mechanism and could theoretically reach a much higher efficiency. However, the search for the right material with the right characteristics for the commercial realization of this technology is still ongoing and this thesis aims to assist in making progress in said search. The focus of this thesis is on the substitution of manganese with nickel in Mn-Fe-P-Si compounds and how the magnetocaloric properties of these compounds hold up against similar compounds that had manganese substituted with cobalt as this lowered the Curie temperature and decreased the thermal hysteresis, which are favourable results. Unfortunately, there are a few factors such as price and criticality that motivated replacing cobalt with a close relative such as nickel in hope of achieving similar results. Measurements done with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) indicated that the synthesized Mn-Fe-Ni-P-Si compounds have very similar magnetic properties to the Mn-Fe-Co-P-Si compounds. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements showed that both compounds reduce thermal hysteresis similarly, but the nickel compounds are capable of lowering the curie temperature much more with increased doping compared to the cobalt compounds. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis proved that nickel is substituted in the proper place and that the decreasing Curie temperature is the result of a change in the ratio of the unit cell parameters a and c. Nickel thus showed to be an excellent replacement of cobalt to be used to substitute manganese with to lower the Curie temperature of the initial Mn-Fe-P-Si compound and reduce thermal hysteresis. More research could be done on further tuning the composition by for example increasing the silicon doping as this has shown to increase the Curie temperature rather than decrease it whilst also reducing the thermal hysteresis. Combined with the results from this thesis it could lead to a composition with more favourable magnetocaloric characteristics.","Magnetocaloric; Curie Temperature; magnetization; Hysteresis; magnetocaloric effect; MCE","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Hence, there is a strong need for disaster risk reduction and risk management. Further development and implementation of methodologies for flood hazard assessment of atoll islands contributes to this. The methodology proposed in this thesis was applied to Majuro, an atoll island and capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. More specifically, the flood hazard related to different flood drivers, and including compound events (i.e. the combination of coastal flooding and precipitation) was assessed for the densely populated Delap, Uliga, and Djarrit region, in the east of Majuro Atoll. Main flood drivers are waves during typhoon events and distantly generated (swell) waves, but precipitation and high water levels (mainly tide) are important as well. To include all possible combinations of these flood drivers, and to include the spatial variation in events, 1000 years of synthetic events was generated based on data for historical events. Accurate simulation of inundation depths was computationally unfeasible for all synthetic events. Hence, a method was developed to reduce the number of model simulations, without losing information on the probability of occurrence of each event. The main steps of this method seem applicable to many other study areas where many scenarios are needed to include all (combinations of) drivers. Main steps are: (1) Selection of representative events â by Maximum Dissimilarity Algorithm, based on parameters that characterize the events. Hereby, the most extreme events are included as well. (2) Simulation of inundation depths for the representative events â by use of Delft3D, SWAN, and XBeach models. The XBeach model included a module for rainfall (first application). (3) Weighted interpolation to obtain the inundation depths for the synthetic events â based on the same parameters as in step 1. Based on the inundation depths for 1000 years of synthetic events, flood maps for different return periods and flood drivers were derived. These provide insight in the flood hazard for the DUD region due to the different flood drivers and for different return periods. The importance of different flood drivers varies significantly per area. Generally speaking, flooding related to (swell) waves in combination with high water levels is more frequent, while infrequent typhoons lead to the most severe flooding. Precipitation is an important flood driver as well, and exclusion would lead to underestimation of the flood hazard. Analysis of inundation depths suggests that for many areas these are limited to a maximum, where after excess water drains to the ocean â mainly into the lagoon. The derived flood maps could be used as a base for assessment of flood risk, climate change impacts, and closely related freshwater availability. In relation to the latter, more in-depth understanding of the contributions of precipitation and coastal flooding to the total flood hazard is needed, as on the long term infiltration of precipitation seems favourable, while that of oceanic water is not.","Majuro; Atoll islands; Small Island Developing States; Compound flooding; Flood hazard; Synthetic data; Scenario reduction; TCWiSE; UNINET; BEWARE; XBeach; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-16","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","7.100, 171.369"

Situated on the threshold between the machine landscape of industrial agriculture that is the Flevopolder, and the neo-liberal free-for-all development of Oosterwold, the project provides a communal space for the prospective agricultural communities around the site. The agricultural cooperative which would manage the project, would work together with a research institute experimenting with alternative methods of farming, and would form a council with representatives of the city, the institute and the forestry department to make decisions on the land use of the commons, and thus gaining agency. The project presents itself as an urban image in the countryside, and announcing itself as a new beginning of sorts, the start of a new history in which we are able to re-establish our relationship to the land. As the community works together with the city and the institution to practice and experiment with alternative forms of agriculture, there is an opportunity to undo the damage of modernised agriculture, introducing new minor rhythms into the landscape that make space for wild plants and animals.The building serves to represent thenatural histories of the territory, allowing the community to engage in a dialogue with the land, and being represented in their relationship to it.The first times of the city of Almere, and the fictions and histories of its territory can thus be understood in dialectic relationship, so that this project can indeed become a concrete utopia, and a new city, or at least a prototype of it.","Post-Anthropocene; Landscape; Territories; New Town; Agriculture; Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

After the companies left the area, the area became vacant and nature took over the area. Now it is an oasis of rest where time has been standing still.

The main research question answered in this thesis is phrased as follows: How can the design of lock heads be optimised to increase the sustainability?<br/>Different alternatives have been generated to try to increase the sustainability. Each alternative has been compared to the lock head in Empel to test their feasibility. The following alternatives are considered: Inhomogeneous cross section, Prestressing and Hollow sections. From the alternative study it becomes clear that none of the alternatives are effective. The alternatives show no significant decrease in cost and MKI. Therefore, the alternatives are neglected in the remainder of the research. Based on this conclusion the following question arises: Is it possible to increase the sustainability of a lock head design based on commonly used design rules? In the next step of the research a parametric model is developed in order to answer this question. The parametric model design is based on the rules prescribed by the 'Handboek voor het ontwerpen van Schutsluizen' and the 'Richtlijnen Vaarwegen 2017'. The parametric model takes into account two types of gates, being a single leaf gate and a mitre gate. Again, the lock head in Empel has been used to validate the parametric model. From the parametric model it follows that in general a mitre gate is more cost effective and sustainable than a single leaf gate. This is because a mitre gate is generally shorter than a single leaf gate, so less materials are used and the construction pit can be smaller. Furthermore, the parametric model shows that the global stability check horizontal bearing capacity is a key parameter in the design of a lock head. To account for the horizontal bearing capacity the length and the weight of the lock head are important factors. The next step is to compare the lock head designs from the parametric model with the lock head design in Empel. The lock head design in Empel deviates from the rules prescribed by the 'Handboek voor het ontwerpen van Schutsluizen'. By deviating from the rules a more cost effective and sustainable design is acquired than both the designs from the parametric model. The lock head in Empel is shorter and lighter than the lock head designs from the parametric model. This is due to the fact that the lock head in Empel derives its horizontal bearing capacity from the lock chamber. In order to design a more cost effective and sustainable lock head it is advised to incorporate the lock chamber in the stability calculations. Hereby a shorter lock head can be achieved.","Lock Heads; Sustainabilty; Navigation lock; Parametric model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

A solution for an engineered dune system on the Galveston Island West End has been proposed, but storm surge models have shown that protection from this engineered dune only goes so far, moreover the search for a proper alternative that fulfills technical requirements and social political influences have proven to be challenging. This study aimsto assess different dune alternatives, proposed in different reports, with a range of multi disciplinary criteria. The assessment of dune alternatives will also result in guidelines that should be considered for design, maintenance and governance aspects for an engineered dune barrier on Galveston Island, TX. Using a multi disciplinary approach for the evaluation of the different dune alternatives, the following research question was formulated: To what extent do the various dune alternatives fit the requirements for a land barrier at the West End of Galveston Island, looking at both technical and sociopolitical aspects? In this context, technical requirements are defined as the storm surge-and rainfall coping capacities of the dune, i.e. against what kind of storm is the dune resistant. Social political influences are a combination of the perception by local residents that are directly influenced by the construction of a dune system, governmental forms of collaboration, and in provide an analysis of the maintainability of the dune alternatives using the storm surge capacities. The different dune alternatives that have been assessed consist of the dune system proposed by the USACE and GLO (2018), the big dune system proposed by Galvez (2019) and the hybrid dune system as proposed by Muller (2017) and will hereafter be called alternative 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In this report a fourth alternative was introduced which is based on the hybrid dune system by Muller (2017) and consists of a clay core instead of a concrete core. Alternative 4 was chosen in order to simulate the difference between a concrete core and a clay core. Based on XBeach calculations, the storm surge coping capability of each dune was determined by projecting 10 year-, 50 year- and 100 year storms onto the dune alternatives. ArcGIS maps from the Galveston Island allowed for projection of flow patterns on the island in order to determine the rainfall coping capacity. An evaluation of sociopolitical aspects was based on a review of the literature on dune systems, forms of collaboration between governmental and private entities, and interviews with various respondents consisting of private individuals and companies, as well as governmental agencies involved in the process. Analysis of the various dune alternatives, based on multi disciplinary criteria, demonstrated that alternative 1 is completely flattened in 50 year storm events, whereas alternatives 2, 3 and 4 show a good storm surge capacity. All alternatives aggravate the current rainfall capacity at Galveston Island West End, because each dune system poses an obstruction that is not there currently. Alternatives 2 through 4 show a good enough storm resilience, requiring post-storm recovery maintenance while still providing a reduced but fair storm surge capacity. The sociopolitical results indicate that Galveston Island West End residents wishes are only safeguarded for alternative 1. On this basis, the main recommendations are to perform tests upon the dune system alternatives regarding storm events occurring in succession, which is not unusual in the Gulf of Mexico. A combination of alongshore erosion rates from the Galveston Island and the effect of dune vegetation should be determined for the dune alternatives, since these aspects were not considered in this research. Further research is needed to identify the combined effects of rainfall and storm surge in order to get insights into the performances of a certain alternatives. Furthermore, the exact role including the desired storm surge capability should be well defined in order to determine which stakeholder wishes and influences are to be fully considered for the dune system design.","Multidisciplinary; MCA; Dune design; Dune; Galveston; Erosion; Rainfall estimation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal Texas Study",""

A promising method to decrease the number of stops are Green Light Optimal Speed Advice (GLOSA) systems. These systems will give a speed advice to arriving vehicles based on the schedule of TLCs, which needs to be known and fixed. However, most on-street controllers change their schedule until the last moment to maximize the performance. In this thesis a predictive controller is developed that is suitable for real-world application based on DIRECTOR; a state-of-the-art predictive controller. A prediction model is used to predict future arrivals based on available measurements to optimize and fix the schedule in advance. The proposed controller can enable GLOSA systems to improve performance. Appropriate pre-processing steps are implemented and the optimal input features are selected to improve the performance of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict future arrivals. All detection data is stationary over time by using the differenced series. The time data is divided into workdays and weekend days to create a binary input and undesirable jumps during midnight are removed. The combination of stop line detectors, queue detectors, arrival detectors and signal states of the controlled and preceding intersections as input maximized the performance. The prediction horizon of the proposed prediction model could be extended. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) decreased with 17% compared to DIRECTOR. The proposed controller extends the control horizon and uses multiple prediction models to predict the arrivals for the entire control horizon. The proposed controller outperforms DIRECTOR with 14 - 38% reduction in terms of vehicle delay and 5 - 32% reduction in terms of numbers of stops based on the scheduling mode. The GLOSA system is an add-on of the controller and is able to operate without the GLOSA system. The control horizon of the proposed controller always has a fixed length which is needed to determine the time until green. The implemented GLOSA system will determine the optimal speed based on the time until green and the expected delay due to the surrounding vehicles. The proposed controller is a cloud controlled application. Therefore, it is possible to adjust the setup (i.e. scheduling modes) during the day. Enabling GLOSA all day except during rush hours will lead to 3 - 4% reduction in terms of vehicle delay and 29 - 32% reduction in terms of numbers of stops based on the scheduling mode. This setup of the proposed controller is also competitive with the hand-crafted non-predictive on-street controller. Compared with this controller, the proposed controller will reduce the number of stops with 26% at the cost of 16% increase in vehicle delay. The proposed controller is designed conform the safety standards used on-street. Permission is received from the provincial government to do on-street pilots with the proposed controller. These results could give new insights into the performance of the proposed controller.","Traffic flow; Traffic light controller; TLC; Predictive controller; Prediction model; Decentralized control; Model predictive control; green light optimal speed advise; GLOSA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Based on the observation of CABG surgeries, interviews with surgical members and meetings of new operating room design discussing criteria comparison, Project A introduced a new Operating Room design with a 75-inch nonmedical display showing medical data for better information sharing during surgeries. This solution was evidenced effective and will be implemented in the new operating room in practice. Project B simulated an auto-checklist of CABG surgery procedure to make sure every surgical team member aware of current situation during surgeries. Steps of surgeries and trigger of each step were determined with the assistance of cooperating surgical members. After negotiation and obtaining the consent of patients, medical information shown in EPD-Vision during their surgeries were allowed to be used. Then, necessary data from patients was obtained and processed by a MATLAB program. This simulation program uses the obtained data to detect automatically items of the checklist. As a result, times of the items of the checklist determined by the program were mostly comparable to the times written down by the assistant. In some cases, there was a time delay due to manual input by assistants. Hence, the project still has limitations to implement a completely automatic checklist.<br/>Project C is an APP design on a concept to remind related members of going back to the operating room quickly.

The process to tackle the project is visualised. The goal of this project is: Building a cost-effective, compact and simple 3D printer that can print electronics for technical integration of prototypes. This thesis is the basement of this project goal, therefore the focus was on developing the extruder that prints conductive material and how this goes together with filament. In the research phase, first research questions are formed to structure the research. The main research question is: What is needed to make a cost-effective extruder printing integrated electronics? Based on this question and on the goal of the project sub questions are made. These sub questions are answered per chapter. From the research it can be concluded that solder paste will be used as conductive material, for having a good conductivity and low price. For the extruding method, it has been chosen to continue with the Archimedes screw and plunger method. These are low cost, simple and compact solutions. There are several thermoplastic filaments possible that might be able to withstand the heat of curing. The shape of the trace has to be found out as this has influence on curing the solder paste. The way of curing solder paste has to be found. The solder paste is cured in the oven. In conceptualization phase the two main things are explored, how to cure the solder paste and how to extrude solder paste. Three big experiments are done to find the right combination of solder paste with the thermoplastic filament and the reflow settings. Next to this, an extrusion method has been chosen. The solder paste has the composition of: Sn42Bi57,6Ag0,4. The melting temperature is 138 [oC]. The chosen thermoplastic material is PLA X3, this filament can withstand the curing temperature. Curing has been done in the oven, heating the oven to 142 [oC] with the sample in the oven. Then leaving the sample at this temperature for ten minutes, when the sample has cooled down by opening the door the electric circuit is ready to be used. The prototype of the extruder head, that has been developed, has two extruders: the thermoplastic extruder and the solder paste extruder. The bracket is designed as such so the thermoplastic extruder can be lifted manually. The printing process is as follows: 1. Design the 3D CAD model 2. How to slice and adjust the g-code 3. Preparing the printer 4. Printing the solder paste in the 3D print 5. Pick and place components 6. Curing the 3D print Making sure to design the prototype according to a set of design guidelines. The most important guidelines are to design the electric circuit in 2D and to 3D print the circuit in the XY plane. To proof the designed concept and settings are working a demonstrator is developed. It is wanted to create a simple prototype that easily proofs the printers capacities. There is chosen to make a flashlight. After some iterations the final design is simple: containing a battery, an LED, a resistor and a switch. The future of the designed proof of concept is shown. The 3D printer can print prototypes with an integrated electric circuit at a low cost. After the developed proof of concept, the project is evaluated on the basis of the design rules and design drivers. The project goal is satisfied. A cost-effective, compact and simple proof of concept for a 3D printer that can print electronics for technical integration of prototypes is designed. A solid base has been created that can easily be broadened and used to develop a product out of it. The most important recommendation is to further research the possibilities to 3D print the solder paste.","3D printing; Electronics; Solder paste; Agile Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The current prevalence of open geographic information, such as nationwide-covering LiDAR datasets in the Netherlands, opens up opportunities for different parties to experiment in a search for solutions based on LiDAR data. A current approach in answering this demand for 3D city models is 3dfier, which is an ongoing project to automatically generate, disseminate and maintain a 3D city model based on open source airborne LiDAR datasets as a main source. Trees are currently not included in the 3D city models generated by 3dfier, while trees are an integral part of any city landscape.<br/><br/>In this thesis, an implementation is developed that goes through multiple stages of the construction of 3D tree models. First, an initial classification method of the available LiDAR point cloud data is done. This results in a new intermediate point cloud that consists of mostly points belonging to trees. These classified tree points need to be segmented, such that each segment consists of a group of points that represent a single tree. A second classification is constructed after the segmentation, which is called data cleaning. This step ensures that every segment that consists of tree points, is checked for misclassifications and outliers and that these are removed. After cleaning every segment, tree models can be constructed in various LODs and additionally, the types of trees are classified based on identifying features of these trees.<br/><br/>The conclusions of this research are that it is possible to construct 3D tree models based on airborne LiDAR point cloud data and that these can be made to fit in an existing 3D city model. This is demonstrated by creating a 3D city tree model for an existing 3D city model and merging them into one dataset. While further work is required to achieve a seamless fit, the integrated results show that the datasets complement each other well.","Classification; Segmentation; Modelling; Trees; Vegetation; LiDAR; Tree models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The EU ETS is currently the most important regulatory instrument implemented for this purpose. Although the effects in terms of abatement are certain, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) introduces uncertainty with regard to the price of carbon emissions. Carbon price levels have dropped significantly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. ARX-GARCHX models have been employed to fit hourly day-ahead prices in nine European countries and fit daily average wholesale electricity prices in the UK using dummy variables for the introduction of the UK Carbon Price Floor (CPF). In the former analysis it is found that carbon prices were only passed through to electricity prices after carbon prices increased in 2018. In the UK it was found that the carbon to electricity price pass-through was present only after introduction of the CPF, even though permit prices remained low. Therefore, it is concluded that the total costs of emitting should exceed a certain threshold value for the price of carbon to be passed through to electricity prices. This thesis proposes a dynamic CPF design that can be introduced EU-wide or on a national level. The introduction of such a price stability mechanism would ensure the carbon price pass-through needed to achieve long-term environmental goals, regardless of developments in the carbon market.","EU ETS; Carbon Price Floor; Volatility; Price Modelling; Time Series","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Pereira Roders, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","âTangible and intangible heritage are sources of social cohesion, factors of diversity and drivers of creativity, innovation and urban regeneration â we must do more to harness this.â This was the message of Irina Bokova, the Director-General of UNESCO, during the World Urban Forum in Napels in 2012. Her statement provides the basis of this research, if urban heritage is preserved and used correctly it can deliver social change. Urban heritage can be perceived in several ways but in general urban heritage can be perceived as real estate. This real estate serves, as mentioned above, a common good: the understanding of a shared history (Pereira Roders, 2007; Tarrafa Silva &amp; Pereira Roders, 2012). Preserving these buildings for that goal is reached through a spatial programme or strategy. This research is therefore a symbiosis of heritage management and real estate management. Understanding the added value of heritage in city development will create the possibility to give certain weight to the preservation of these buildings. Knowing which weight a building carries for society, in terms of added value, provides the basis for the decision making process of preserving a building or not.Heritage however, does not only add value it costs capital as well. It is costly to preserve heritage due to the restrictions posed by governmental rules and regulations. Heritage is also difficult to preserve due to the mostly unwieldiness of the properties for modern businesses. Preserving only to preserve for the afterlife does therefore, not yield success. Knowingly investing in heritage that adds more value to society than it costs is more likely to yield success. The difficulty however is the definition of added value for society.The cost of heritage conservation is measurable through the financial investment needed to conserve the real estate, it is however far more difficult to know the added value of heritage. It is somewhat measurable how heritage adds value for specific stakeholders, for example the added value heritage has for its users. It is even more difficult to understand the added value of heritage for society. There are no tools available which pinpoint the added value of individual heritage. The Historic Urban Landscape approach provides only a general view on the added value of heritage. The aim of this research is to provide insight in the tension between the different values of heritage (both economic and otherwise) through the recognition of added values of heritage for society.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

(graduation committee); Stuyfzand, Pieter Jan (graduation committee); PeÃ±a, Karina (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Pressure on fresh water resources has led to water scarcity and increasing demand for alternative water resources, such as rainwater. Nevertheless, heavy metal contamination is a limiting factor for re-use of urban stormwater. This research focusses on the adsorption of heavy metal contaminants by biofiltration systems, specifically on the Bluebloqs Biofilter, to fulfil the water quality requirements for infiltration. The effect of various physical and chemical conditions on HM adsorption were assessed.A field experiment was built in the summer of 2019 and operated during 5 months. A range of low to high heavy metal concentrations was synthetically dosed to functional prototype of the Bluebloqs Biofilter, with the aim to characterise both the removal efficiency as well as geochemical processes in the filter media. Results showed that due to saturation of the filter media, Cd and Zn concentrations in the effluent rose above the Dutch infiltration standards after 74 bed volumes. Ni, Cd and Zn were most susceptible for bed saturation as average concentrations over biofilter depth increased by operation. Highest removal of all heavy metals happened in the top 5 cm of the filter bed. A surface complexation sorption model was developed in PHREEQC to evaluate adsorption of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn. The model was established by calibration on batch adsorption experiment data of the same heavy metals. With this modelling tool, various physical and chemical conditions in stormwater could be easily simulated and extrapolated, as well as characteristics of filter media that could be modified. Surface complexation modelling showed a reasonable fit compared to the Freundlich isotherm.The order of adsorption to the filter media was Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Zn&gt;Ni. Batch simulations showed that by raising solution pH, adsorption of each HM was increased for both quartz sand and iron oxide coated sand. For pH 7.0, the partition coefficient for iron oxide coated sand was 1.34, 16.8, 19.9 and 23.9 for Ni, Cd, Cu and Zn respectively. For pH 8.0, the partition coefficient rose to 12.9, 2.15*103, 282 and 698 in the same order. In the case of quartz sand and pH 7.0, partition coefficient was found 4.7 *10-2, 1.18, 1.41 and 14.8 for Ni, Zn, Cd and Cu respectively. When increased to pH 8.0, partition coefficients rose to 0.7, 34.0, 228 and 201 in the same order.To a lower extent, increase of ionic strength of the solution had a negative effect on the adsorption of Cu and Cd. By increasing the Zn and Cu proportion by a factor 5.0 in the influent stormwater, adsorption of Ni and Cd was negatively affected, but only for unrealistic high concentrations.One dimensional transport simulations were performed for the average stormwater compositions found at the field experiment. Ni showed first breakthrough in the filter due to lower affinity, followed by Zn, Cd and Cu. Increase of the pH from 7.0 to 8.0 delayed breakthrough by a factor 9.2, 15.8, 25.9 and 135.1 for Cu, Ni, Zn and Cd respectively, despite the type of media used in simulations. By changing the 20% of the top layer of the total filter length from quartz sand to iron oxide coated sand in the model, the adsorption capacity increased and delayed the breakthrough of heavy metals by a factor Â±2.36 at all pH conditions.Comparison of the established sorption model with field experiment data showed underestimation of Ni adsorption, while Cd and Cu were overestimated. Zn adsorption showed the most similarity between model results and field data. The model cannot provide an accurate prediction on HM adsorption, but it can be used to compare in between HMs.For the first mature system of the Bluebloqs biofilter, operational in Spangen, Rotterdam since the summer of 2018, the first exceedance of the Zn for the infiltration standards was predicted after 410 bed volumes, due to saturation of filter media. This resulted in elevated Zn concentration in the effluent. Further improvement of the sorption model could be established by additional batch adsorption experiments to obtain more trustworthy results.","Urban stormwater management; biofiltration systems; heavy metals; adsorption; surface complexation; PHREEQC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-11","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

To this end, the MaaS-team has set up a framework agreement and seven national pilots. Within this context potential business models for MaaS proposition and their sustainability have been investigated. Through academic literature, a conceptual model is created to guide data gathering and analysis. Thirteen anonymous MaaS Service Providers (MSPs) are interviewed in semi-structured interviews from which the qualitative data is analysed through open coding. This yielded a range of target customers, value propositions and revenue and pricing models as well as results on how MSPs interact with transport operators and how they implement key functionalities. Analysis shows there is no strong business model for consumers yet. Business models aimed at the government, employers, other MSPs and other businesses seem much stronger. Additionally, business models for MaaS seem overly reliant on kickback fees. To judge whether business models for MaaS that are currently being developed are sustainable, these business models were investigated for their ability to both create and capture sustainable value. The business models are less ecologically sustainable than MSPs think they are, with little over half being ecologically sustainable. Reversely, the business models were more socially sustainable than the MSPs thought they were, with about three-quarters being socially sustainable. There thus seems to be a disconnect between perceived and actual sustainability among MSPs. Nonetheless, all MaaS propositions offer the tools to make a sustainable impact if an outside actor is willing to pay for that, allowing the MSP to capture the created sustainable value. Based on these findings the conceptual model was revised, policy and managerial recommendations are made and implications for the literature is discussed. Finally, the limitations to this research are discussed and future avenues for research are presented.","MaaS; Mobility-as-a-Service; Sustainability; Business Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Historical drivers of biodiversity loss have been agriculture and urbanization, through causing environmental pressure, loss of natural habitat and fragmentation of habitat for numerous species and ecosystems (PBL, 2014). Pressure on biodiversity remains high today as the limited amount of land in the Netherlands is used intensively and densely inhabited. Â Biodiversity ensures the health and resilience of ecosystems (Vink, Vollaard &amp; de Zwarte, 2017): it influences its functioning and ability to react and adapt to changes. People are dependent upon the worldâs ecosystems through the ecosystem services they provide, but at the same time their actions are affecting the health and resilience of these ecosystems in a negative way. This relationship has to change fundamentally in order to ensure a healthy future for the worlds ecosystems and each species involved. Although biodiversity is generally higher in cities than in the rural areas around (PÃ¶tz, 2016; Vink, Vollaard &amp; de Zwarte, 2017) many species are still under pressure. There is a lack of biodiverse and connected green spaces, disturbances such as light and maintenance are negatively affecting urban ecosystems and nesting opportunities for species that have become dependent upon the city are disappearing (Dramstad, Forman &amp; Olsen, 1996; Vink, Vollaard &amp; de Zwarte, 2017; CBS, PBL, RIVM, WUR, 2018). This in turn also negatively affects the ecosystem services available for people living in cities. Future urban development, such as inner-city densification, are expected to further contribute to these pressures, as nature is still largely excluded from urban planning and design processes (Snep &amp; Opdam, 2013, PÃ¶tz, 2016; Vink, Vollaard &amp; de Zwarte, 2017; Weisser &amp; Hauck, 2017). This graduation project researches how knowledge from biodiversity, urban ecology and nature-inclusive design can be translated to urban planning and design. This is done by researching theory and at the same time studying the spatial aspects within the case study location of the Zomerhofkwartier in Rotterdam. The aim is to reach mutualist urbanism: a way of urban planning and design that provides conditions for strengthening biodiversity within âhabitatsâ that will also benefit people greatly. The found methods for a mutualist urban planning and design process consist of facilitating an âinterwoven urban mosaic through strongly interconnected landscape elementsâ (Forman, 2014) by designing for animals and people simultaneously (target species and target groups). Design principles that are then applied in design are: use, 3d connectivity, porosity, microclimate and time. Using these methods and design principles four mutualist habitats are designed for the Zomerhofkwartier that integrate within the ecological network of Rotterdam: a multi-level street, a public courtyard, a collective rooftop network and a collective garden. These mutualist environments provide a new relationship between the city and urban nature, between built structures and urban nature and between people and urban nature.","urban planning; urban design; nature-inclusive; biodiversity; urbanism; mutualism; zomerhofkwartier; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.929274, 4.479649"

The operation of the grid-connected power stage with DC active power buffer has become standard in high compact systems. More importantly, this solution eliminates the requirement of high energy storage in the DC-link because the pulsating power is compensated leading to an electrolytic-less capacitor design.

This often leads to structurally redundant and therefore overdimensioned ship designs. Hence, much improvement could be expected from ship structures where optimization algorithms help advise in the design process. In this research, the midsection of a Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger (TSHD) is optimized. A TSHD midsection generally consists of longitudinal stiffened panels and transverse web frames. The typical web frame and longitudinal stiffener layout is optimized, as a weight improvement of this section can have a large effect on the total weight of the ship since it is repeatedly reoccurring.<br/><br/>This research has optimized the midsection of a reference TSHD in two ways; the first step was to perform a shape optimization for the longitudinal stiffener arrangement, which was followed by a topology optimization for the transverse web frame. Both optimization objectives were to minimize mass. The order of optimization follows the hierarchy in which stresses are introduced into the structure; from the plates that make up the hull toward the stiffeners and eventually the web frames. The complete optimization was performed a total of seven times, for seven different web frame spacings ranging from 25% to 175% of the web frame spacing of the reference TSHD.<br/><br/>For the shape optimization, a Simulated Annealing algorithm was used. The reference ship was simplified to be able to parameterize the geometry into eleven panels with T-stiffeners. Each panel has a set of variables that describe its geometry; the plate thickness, number of stiffeners, stiffener web height, flange width and web and flange thicknesses. Although feasible results came out of the optimization, no clear parallel was found when comparing the plates of different web frame spacings. This is due to the fact that it is a high dimensional problem. Although no clear parallels were found, the results were able to cope with all the loads.<br/> <br/>The topology optimization was performed with a modified Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (MBESO) method. The applied modifications ensure a fast convergence for large topology optimization problems. The new method was first verified by comparing results to two benchmark cases from the original BESO method, which was followed by three examples of common topology optimization benchmarks. Once established that the modified method was capable of reproducing test cases, an aspect ratio analysis was performed to better understand the transmission of stress. After that, the full geometry of the midsection was divided into smaller basic models and the same optimization was carried out in order to help interpret underlying physics of the final results. Finally, the topology optimizations for the seven web frame spacings were performed, resulting in a new orientation of beams. The topology optimization results showed that constructing beams not in an orthogonal way and along the ship hull but rather under various angles could reduce the total mass of the web frame.<br/><br/>To see how the shape optimization result influenced the topology optimization, three studies were carried out where all the surrounding plates had the same thickness, except for one that would have a significant smaller thickness. This showed how the web frame supports the hull plating, but also how the web frame is dependent on the stiffness of certain panels to be able to transfer shear into them.<br/><br/>Finally a comparison was made between the reference ship and the optimized structure. The result was a decrease of 23\% in weight for the midsection. Due to practical production considerations this weight is likely to be higher in practice, however it is a promising start toward a more efficient ship design. The innovative combination of shape optimization combined with the MBESO procedure could help in early design stages where the main components of the construction are defined.","midsection; topology optimization; shape optimization; hopper dredger; TSHD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve low discomfort, a comfort oriented nonlinear model predictive controller is created. We know humans are sensitive for discomfort in certain frequencies in acceleration. By penalizing the frequencies for discomfort a higher comfort performance can be achieved. Two band pass filters are created to penalise the frequencies. A band pass filter (0.03-0.2 Hz) for the frequency of motion sickness and a band pass filter (1-2 Hz) for general discomfort. Due to the MPC framework the filters can be implemented on the predicted accelerations. The filtered accelerations are penalised within the MPC. The MPC is made for path following control. To test the MPC a reference generator is built. The reference generator creates reference signals about the path ahead for the controller. To test the performance of the filters, tests are done with different controllers. In the different controllers the filters are penalised individually and together and compared against other controllers. The controllers are tested on multiple scenarios (e.g. double lane change and a sinusoidal trajectory). On the scenarios multiple disturbances are tested (e.g. wind disturbance and sensor noise). We conclude that the MPC design that relies on the motion sickness filter has a significant decrease of motion sickness in scenarios where a lot of motion sickness is present, with improvements up to 30.7% compared to the basic controller. The MPC design that relies on the general discomfort filter helps bring the general discomfort down. On the double lane change maneuver with a changing velocity the general discomfort filter has improvements up to 10.7% compared to the basic controller.","Autonomous vehicles; nonlinear MPC control; Comfort; Motion Sickness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thermochemical conversion of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) in combination with hydrogen to produce methanol in the presence of catalyst provides a pathway to close this carbon cycle. Steady state activity tests were carried out in a small integral reactor for methanol synthesis from a mixture of either CO/H2 or CO2/H2. The temperature was varied from 200 to 300Â°C, while the total pressure was held constant for CO/H2 at 85 bar and CO2/H2 at 60 bar keeping stoichiometric flow of hydrogen at GHSV of 24,000 hrÂ¡1. Four different metal oxides namely ZnO, ZrO2,MgO and CeO2 were investigated for support effects on active Cu along with different combinations among them while keeping commercial catalyst as the benchmark. Catalysts were prepared using urea hydrolysis method. It was found that ZrO2 and MgO show higher selectivity however the latter does not exhibit comparable conversion as the commercial catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. Detailed GHSV study for Cu-ZrO2 paint a completely different picture showing higher methanol selectivity (64%) with increasing space velocity (at GHSV of 32,000 hrÂ¡1). In case of COhydrogenation, commercial catalyst performs the best, albeit displaying signs of carbon deposition at higher temperature (280Â°, 300Â°C). This situation is circumvented by employing ZnO/MgO combination as a support. Cu-CeO2 exhibited characteristics of an excellent water gas shift catalyst. This led to a novel configuration of mixed bed consisting of Cu-CeO2 with commercial catalyst. Results indicate that this combination improves themethanol yield by atleast 30% as compared to commercial catalyst at a high GHSV of 24,000 hrÂ¡1.","Copper; Urea hydrolysis; CO2 hydrogenation; GHSV (Gas hourly space velocity); Methanol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

The agent needs to explore its environment and by simultaneously receiving rewards it learns what is appropriate behaviour.<br/>Even though it has roots in machine learning, RL is essentially different from other machine learning methods. In contrast to others, RL agent has to generate its own data to learn from. In this thesis, we aim to train an RL agent to fly a quadcopter to track any target position (way-point) in three dimensional space. Where conventional control strategies for quadcopters involve a separate attitude and position controller and most RL solutions focus on one of the two controllers, our goal is to design a low level RL controller capable of computing motor commands directly from sensor input, therefore replacing both attitude and position controller with one RL policy. The policies we develop utilize the algorithm âTwin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradientâ (TD3) for learning. TD3 is a variant of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.<br/>The policy for attitude control trained for 3500 episodes 3, around 6.1e5 time steps. The learned policy is able to stabilize the attitude of the quadcopter (in simulation) with a success rate of 94 %. For position control, two policies are generated with two different types of dense reward. The resulting type 1 policy has high fluctuations in motor commands and therefore oscillating attitude and position values. In none of the evaluation trajectories a steady state value is reached. The type 2 produces a working policy after a shorter training time of 1200 episodes, 1.1í6 time steps. For all tested trajectories, this policy achieves steady state for almost each way-point. This thesis proves that TD3 can be used for low-level quadcopter control, replacing both inner and outer loops of the quadcopter control. Using the dense reward function and applying negative reward on position control only results in a stable policy that can track way-points all throughout the 3D space. Future work requires the twostep parameter estimation to be tested on a real life quadcopter, as well as enrolling the policy onto a real life quadcopter.","Reinforcement Learning; AI; DNN; quadcopter; TD3; DDPG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several critical approaches to design place its efforts in creating artefacts for critical reflection. As part of the spectrum, speculative design is an approach that, through speculation into the possible, aims to challenge the status quo, explore the implications of emerging issues, and frame debate around matters of concern. While the goal of speculative design is in engaging publics in debate and exploring alternatives to the dominant narrative, the practise has been facing several critiques. More specifically, speculation as remained exclusive to the designer as an author and most of the work is disseminated in gallery spaces, limiting the reach and depth of the debate generated. New projects and practitioners have emerged that push speculative design work into new contexts and within a participatory mindset. This thesis is placed at this intersection between participation and speculative design. While this intersection seems promising and valuable, there might be some challenges in the transition from authorial practise to a participatory process. Additionally, bringing speculative design in new contexts might bring several risks, specially when practised within the domains it aims to critique. The main research question addressed by this thesis is the following: When we open up the speculative design process, is the practise able to retain the critical aspects related to it? Eight semi-structured interviews with leading practitioners working on this space were done. From the interviews, three main challenges were identified: âStuck in a Singular Viewâ refers to the challenge of engaging a plurality of voices and on maintaining a nuanced perspective when critically discussing the future; âStuck in the Contextâ is related with the difficulty in engaging in self-reflexive behaviour when working with speculative design inside contexts that might be reluctant to critique; âStuck in the Nowâ refers to the difficulty in working in the future and how short-sightness might create an obstacle to speculative thinking. Additionally, several issues were mapped from the interviews and brought in a provisional framework for participation in speculative design. This framework consists of four levels that represent different aspects of the process: Context of Operation, Participants, Moments of Engagement, and Outcomes. Finally, the four levels and the three main challenges were used to problematise the design space and create a critical toolkit for integrating participation in speculative design. The goal of the toolkit is not to provide a solution on how to this, but it proposes several different questions and issues for reflection. The toolkit consists of 37 issues, spread throughout the four levels and in relation to the three challenges. The issues took shape as hexagonal playing cards, making it possible to connect the different cards and explore the design space.","Speculative Design; Participation; Criticality; Futures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This seems to suggest a disappearance of the necessity to work. In his New Babylon project, Constant Nieuwenhuizen has imagined a society in which the inhabitants, the Homo Ludens, are completely free of any occupational obligations. How can an architectural intervention transform an existing building in order to integrate in such new kind of society? This design question was accompanied by a research that emerged from a personal fascination. The question from this perspective was: How can certain natural processes be abstracted and translated in simple rules in order to use them in computational tools in the design process? An intervention in an remnant from an industrial era has been designed in order to suit this new kind of society. The intervention creates a new route through the building, the floors of the existing parts contain the program. This program aims to provide technological additive manufacturing tools and render them accessible to a wider public. It strives so by providing interactive user interfaces and human-robot collaborations. The intervention has been developed in close relation to the research. The computational tools created in the research have been used to design the structure. First a main volume was created which determines the composition of the atria as well as the structure. Structural analysis was applied to inform the composition and thickness of the beams. Consecutively, analysis of the utilization of these beams is used to inform its cross sections. Details as railing and balustrades are the design with the aim to extend the emerged architectural language. Because of the close relation with the research in natural processes certain art-nouveau characteristics emerged in the architectural language of the intervention. However, rather than merely decorative, they are informed, performative and functional. The emerged architectural language therefore may be referred to as âinformed art-nouveauâ. The research concludes that itâs important to acknowledge the complexity of natural processes and that they are always a part of a larger entangled system. Therefore, in order to use a natural reference in the development of computational tools it is essential to abstract an aspect that seems relevant for the project, which than needs to be translated, adjusted, and complemented in simple rules. By doing so the natural processes become merely inspirational in the architectural design. Yet they have been fundamental in the development of this project, which is evident in the emerged architectural language.

The system provides a simplified cooking procedure to tackle operational hurdles in the food service industry, such as labour shortage and increasing food wastage. Although Foodtrick brings high efficiency, the bias of frozen food in buyersâ minds haunts the expansion of Foodtrickâs business. To achieve the ambition of Foodtrick, this thesis addresses the identification of potential markets, the formulation of the brand proposition and the design of the communication execution. The theoretical framework is formulated based on the literature on the interconnection between B2B buyer behaviour and emotional attributes. Two brand strategy tools, brand positioning and marketing communication, are introduced as the means to convey the value. To better formulate the brand proposition, one needs a comprehensive understanding of âwhoâ, âwhatâ, and âhowâ. The intended result is to incorporate functional and emotional attributes to strengthen the perceived value of Foodtrick. Two stages of studies in positioning and communicating are performed. Positioning study results in the defining of prospective markets and developing understanding in B2B and B2C market circumstances. Communication analysis captures insights into the behaviour of buyers and end-users interacting with Foodtrick. The findings extracted from the two stages research are translated into the reshaped brand proposition, which is that Foodtrick delivers a single but simple solution (functional attribute) assisting buyers to become independent (emotional attribute). The new positioning of Foodtrick, a one-way meal preparation journey to navigate food services owners towards independent food services, intends to invite the ideal buyers to engage. Four principles namely accessible nutrition, knowledge transparency, consistent involvement, and ease of achievement are crafted to develop the final communication strategy. The three communication parts which are presented include visual identity, communication journey and landing page. The visual identity with a new name and logo is used to facilitate brand recognition. The communication journey portrays the required interaction and information to assist the internal team in developing brand experiences for future buyers, while the landing page is intended to demonstrate value and build external communication with buyers. These three parts are intended to be the initial steps and inspirations for the corporationâs brand launch in the near future. In conclusion, the outcome of this thesis provides a new way of thinking and strategy for communicating the value of the emerging food service system in the B2B market. Nevertheless, the final design remains several constraints and lack of external validation. The thesis concludes with suggestions and reflection for the further undertaking of Foodtrickâs brand development.","Branding; Brand development; Positioning; Marketing communication; B2B; Frozen food","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Area detected as water subtracting the permanent water area is the detected flood extent. In total there are nineteen images being processed. The flood detection result is validated by flooded locations from NOAA flood reports and the news, and the accuracy is at 70.4%. The detection result, with flood conditioning factors which include precipitation, sea level, elevation, drainage capacity and distance to the water area, is the input to the probabilistic forecasting model. All inputs are standardised to a common grid system and every cell in that grid system contains a set of data. Two kinds of model structures are proposed and both models are trained with logistic regression and probit regression, both of which are the members of the Generalised Linear Model(GLM). The first kind of model structure is only tested in the New Orleans study area and the second kind of model structure is examined at both study areas. The precision of the first model structure is at 20% with a kappa value at zero. For the second model structure, over-sampling method SMOTE is used to increase the number of data points of the class 'flooded'. The highest precision of the second model structure at New Orleans is 12.6% and at Miami 23.6%, and the highest cohen's kappa values are 0.127 and 0.131 for New Orleans and Miami respectively. The first model structure actually failed in building a success model at a large portion of the study area due to limited records. For the second kind of model structure, most variables are linked to the flooding by the model correctly. The precipitation has a positive relation with flooding, especially when time effect is considered. Elevation reduces the probability of flooding. At the Miami study area where no sea dike exists the sea level has a strong positive relation with flooding. Drainage capacity used in the New Orleans study area does not show an influence on flooding, which requires modelling the intricate drainage system more accurately. In Miami study area, when the study area is confined to the seaside and Miami Beach area, the accuracy of prediction is improved, which informs that land-use type is crucial to be considered in the input. This study innovative collected information from several remote sensing images of different flood events and applied the information to build a probabilistic model, which shows that the information provided by mages could link flooding conditioning factors with flooding. It is recommended to incorporate the remote sensing technique in the flood extent forecast model in the future.","flood; flood forecasting; remote sensing; probabilistic model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though the performance of computers is increasing at unfathomable speeds, the calculation of many fluid problems remains to be challenging. With the emerging widespread use of Large Eddy Simulation (LES), the computational cost of simulations has further increased. Nowadays, the successful application of CFD is highly dependent on the user. A crucial factor that influences computational performance, as well as the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results, is the underlying spatial discretization of CFD problems. Adaptive mesh refinement has the potential to address these issues, by automatically creating a computationally-efficient and user-independent mesh. The objective of this Master's thesis is to improve the computational efficiency of LES CFD simulations by developing and testing a novel more user-independent AMR error sensor. A series of novel error sensors are proposed that are based on an error estimate, which is obtained during run-time by comparing the results of a fine and coarse-grained simulation. A popular reference error sensor based on the curvature of velocity magnitude is used as a comparison in three different test cases: Mach 3 flow over a forward-facing step, flow over a two-dimensional cylinder at Re=100, and flow over periodic hills at Re=10595. All error sensors performed similarly for the Mach 3 flow over a forward-facing step. Essential flow features such as the bow shock, shock reflections, and slip lines were captured and well resolved. Differences in performance were mainly attributed to the control of the adaption routine. Anisotropic refinement led to a further error reduction in the range of 10 to 15%. Performance in the laminar two-dimensional cylinder case varied substantially. The novel error sensor based on the percentage error in the solution performed the best, leading to up to five times the computational savings in comparison to the reference indicator. Across all tests, anisotropic refinement was not able to lead to any computational savings when considering the run-time of the problem. The performance of all error sensors was underwhelming for the flow over periodic hills. The error sensors failed to refine the upper wall, which, without wall-function, lead to a significant error in the solution. The overall performance of some novel error sensors was shown to be promising. Large computational savings in a robust user-independent AMR routine were presented for the compressible and laminar cases. However, more research is required for the successful applications in turbulent flows. Arguments were presented that highlight why adaption based on a target mesh size in conjunction with mesh coarsening is superior to regular threshold-based adaption. Directions and possible solutions to make adaption for turbulent flows successful are given as well.","Adaptive Mesh Refinement; Large Eddy Simulation; Error estimation; AMR; LES; Periodic hill; CFD; Error sensor; Richardson extrapolation; H-adaption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It includes the reduction of iron ore pellet or sinter material towards producing metallic iron. The metallurgical behaviour of sinter and its reduction rate are controlled by its initial physical and chemical properties, as well as the blast furnace gaseous conditions. To improve and optimize the metallurgical performance of sinter for ironmaking, it is necessary to understand the fundamental mechanisms of phase equilibria, microstructural transformations and reaction kinetics as relevant to different sinters in the upper shaft down to the reserve zone of the blast furnace. The objective of the present MSc research is to study the sinter solid state reduction reactions that take place in terms of thermodynamics and metallurgical kinetics when varying the initial material composition under certain temperature and gas atmosphere conditions.<br/>Â Six pilot scale sinter materials with strongly variable bulkmineralogical and chemical composition were sized down to fractions of 250-500Î¼m,being a grain range adequately fine to isolate microstructural effects, whileexcluding the impact of meso-porosity and mechanical fractures (&gt;1 mm), as practically aspossible. A industrial sinter sample, obtained from the production lineof Tata Steel Ijmuiden was included in order to verify potential differences inreduction.

The reduction experiments were interrupted at different reduction times. The 36 reduced samples were further analysed with XRD for phase quantification to then be placed in polished sections for microscopical analysis. The materials were examined under Reflected Light Optical (LOM) and Scanning Electron (SEM) microscopes in order to verify microstructural changes, visualize phase transitions and identify existing stable and meta-stable phases. In total 396 microscopical images were produced. The results of the experiments were compared with thermodynamic models, which show which phases and reduction degree are theoretically expected at equilibrium.<br/>Â Hereby,based on research results, the study attempted to give answers to the initialreseach questions in order to confirm or deny the research hypothesis. The mainfindings of the study were mostly qualitative, referring to the mineralogicalchanges observed during reduction and their impact on reduction kinetics.Results verified that starting composition and mineralogy influencesreducibility kinetics, while the way minerals impact reducibility is dependedon the imposed conditions. It was observed that at T= 950<sup>o</sup>C/XCO=0.65/N<sub>2</sub>=0.5, the differences between the reduction rates of low and high basicitysamples become smaller, due to enhancement of the relative reduction progressof minerals like precipitated Magnetite.

The reduction fronts of Hematite and SFCA converge in a single sinter particlewith higher temperature conditions.Two types of unreacted SFCA wereidentified under the microscope, one Fe-rich SFCA and one Ca-Al-rich SFCA.

The state-of-the-art methodology divides the wave impact flow into two parts: the global flow and the local flow. The global flow considered as the solution of the incompressible Euler equations for the liquid and gas in the tank; and the local flow as a perturbation of the global flow. However, researchers have found it to be a challenge to generate repeatable global flows of focused breaking waves and, therefore, to draw definitive conclusion about the contribution of the global flow variability in the impact pressure variability. In this context, a new facility was designed and built at MARIN in the framework of the SLING project to further investigate the physics of sloshing impacts: the Multiphase Wave Lab (MWL), a wave flume of 10 m in length, 0.6 m in width and water depth of 400 mm.<br/><br/>This thesis aimed to identify and evaluate the sources of variability of the global flow of focused waves, to define the repeatability criteria and to determine the theoretical conditions that would lead to global flow repeatability in the MWL. To achieve the objectives, both theoretical and experimental work have been required. <br/><br/>Three main sources of global flow variability were identified: (1) water depth variation, (2) long bounded waves (seiching) and (3) currents induced by seiching. These drivers of variability were modeled in a wave generation and propagation algorithm from which the sensitivity of the global flow to the sources of variability has been addressed. The results showed that the water depth is the most critical driver of variability and that repeatability would be achieved if its difference between experiments is below 0.5 mm.<br/><br/>Based on the sensitivity study and the characteristics of the wave maker, a criterion to experimentally quantify global flow repeatability was derived from the Sobolev norm of the Fourier space of free surface elevations at a distance from the focal point. To validate the theoretical value, impact waves were generated using a wave focusing technique. Linear wave and wave making theories were used to compute the paddle motion generating the wave impact of interest. The breaking wave was designed using a two-parameter Ricker amplitude spectrum formulation, which defines the contribution of each frequency to the total breaking wave energy and therefore changing its characteristics (crest thickness, crest stability, gas pocket sizeâ¦). Image processing techniques were used to measure wave maker motion and free surface elevations from video recordings.<br/><br/>While more repetitions are required to confidently conclude about the validity of the criterion, the experimental results showed that when the âdissimilarityâ value was below the theoretical threshold, exceptional repeatability of the global flow was obtained.","Breaking waves; Repeatability; Wave impact testing; Wavemaker; Linear wave theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Core material was taken from the Westphalian A/B part of the core. Some of this core material was recently obtained by the TU Delft via the North Sea Core Initiative. Since the Westphalian A/B in the Pennine Basin is fluvio-deltaic in origin, it is highly variable both vertically and laterally. In this thesis we set out to develop a method to extrapolate facies found in the core material to recognize if these are<br/>present in other locations in the well. This means that core material is correlated to the well log. This correlation is then extended over the rest of the well. Two investigation targets were chosen, the first facies is channel base facies, consisting of very coarse sandstone, the second a swamp facies. This firstly requires a detailed core log, and a short study of the well log data. The core log is interpreted in order to try to establish some form of elektrofacies. The well data is then formatted and different principal component analyses (PCAâs) are performed in order to differentiate the facies from their surroundings. For both analyses more than 90% of the variance was explained by the first two component axes, making them reliable. Both target facies require different data sets in order to distinguish them from their surroundings. The swamp facies<br/>becomes easily visible from the third principal component axis, while the channel base sand is harder to differentiate, being recognizable from a point cloud in a principal component plot. In total 40 coals were found to be present over the researched well interval, starting underneath the Zechstein formation, from 12800 to 13800 ft. No other similar channel base coarse sands<br/>were found over the interval apart from the one in the cored material. Overall, it seems that the basics for this method of detection and extrapolation is quite reliable and better than using the original log data, although it does need some further development and improvement.","PCA; Carboniferous; North Sea; Westphalian; Facies Extrapolation; Coals; Coarse sand; Core Logging; Method","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","54.218575, 2.18225"

This makes it unsuitable for implementation in low- and medium-income countries. Its costs are directly related to the strength of the systemâs magnetic field. Therefore, an MRI scanning technology dedicated for use in low- and medium-income countries has been developed by Delft University of Technology and Leiden University Medical Center that makes use of a low magnetic field. This low-field technology, that requires a smaller size magnet and yields lower resolution images, is already capable of diagnosing infant hydrocephalus, a frequently occurring condition in sub-Saharan Africa. For a successful implementation, it is crucial that this technology is integrated in an MRI system that adequately addresses challenges within the context of sub-Saharan Africa and is equipped with all necessary functionality to diagnose infants with hydrocephalus. From observations and interviews in the healthcare environment of Uganda, it was found that â in addition to high cost â poor infrastructure and challenges that occur during imaging procedures limit the implementation- and use-potential of current MRI systems and thus can affect the implementation of this new system. Poor pathways and unavailability of forklifts or cranes often cause breakage during installation and transport. Moreover, lack of space in hospitals hinders implementation of large systems that require dedicated, shielded rooms. During imaging, movement of the (infant) patient may affect the image, and often mothers are kept in the imaging room with the patient to calm her. Other challenges for the operation of these systems in this context include heat, humidity, dust, power outages and the presence of pests. A concept of a complete MRI system that integrates the developed technology and addresses these challenges is designed. This MRI system enables an ergonomic and safe operation, facilitates safe and comfortable insertion and removal of the patient from the machine, and allows mothers and operators to remain close and in visual contact with the patient. The entire concept takes up no more than 3 m2, can be installed in any room with a power socket and features a plug and play installation. It can be carried over rough pathways without the need for a forklift or crane. Furthermore, the concept features a bed with sliding mechanism that optimizes the space inside the system, allowing hydrocephalus patients with significant expansion of the head to be imaged. With this concept, the first steps are taken towards implementation of the technology in hospitals in low- and medium-income countries. Through further development and testing in close collaboration with stakeholders, the concept can be optimized to enable diagnosis and treatment of infants with hydrocephalus and eventually many others, and hereby contribute to increasing the (e)quality of healthcare around the world.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

One of these options is energy storage via the conversion of excess power to hydrogen, during periods of high generation from wind and/or solar. In periods of power shortages hydrogen is converted back to power. In the literature fossil fuelled turbine cycles have been studied extensively, furthermore multiple fuelcell turbine cycles have been modelled. However, models with hydrogen and oxygen fuelled turbine cycles and fuel cell turbine cycles are scarce, leaving opportunity for further optimization of modeled hydrogen and oxygen fuelled cycles. The application of pressurized H2/O2 can lead to several improvements over conventional thermodynamic cycles and fuel cells. In this work, a number of high efficiency hydrogen and oxygen fuelled thermodynamic cycles, based upon the Graz cycle and the Toshiba Reheat Rankine cycle, both a coupled closed Brayton cycle with a Rankine cycle, are investigated. urthermore, the following thermodynamic improvements are proposed to fit the Graz cycle: an increased TIT (turbine inlet temperature), the use of a reheat combustor (the inclusion of a second combustor), condensate preheating and hybrid cooling (a combination of open loop and closed loop cooling) of the high temperature turbine blades. All upgrades together lead to an efficiency of 75% LHV. The rise of efficiency of the individual upgrades summed up is lower than the rise off all upgrades together. This is due to the fact that adding reheat and increasing TIT introduce extra high temperature turbine blade cooling needs and losses, which an improved cooling method counteracts. For this reason, the cooling method used is rather influential. Therefore, two cooling methods, open loop cooling and hybrid cooling, used in the Graz and Toshiba cycle respectively, are studied in this thesis.Next to the thermodynamic improvements, an electrochemical improvement is studied, by adding fuel cell systems to the turbine cycles. Multiple fuel cells combinations are studied: a single low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a low temperature, intermediate temperature and high temperature SOFC in series. Moreover, the type of fuel cell cooling is investigated, both cooling by adding steam to the cathode and recirculating excess oxygen in the cathode are studied. The addition, of a triple SOFC cooled by oxygen recirculation, to an upgraded Graz cycle leads to a potential efficiency of 84% LHV. This efficiency is reached at a relatively low fuel cell fuel utilization of 58%. In this study the turbine cycle is not fully adapted to the fuel cell system or vice versa. Both systems are adapted to each other, leading to the unique triple fuel cell system operating in series, which is more easily coupled to a turbine cycle and can operate at an overall higher SOFC utilization, compared to a single fuel cell. However, from the fuel cell side 2 of the 3 fuel cells are less electrochemically favorable, as only one of the three fuel cells can operate in the best conditions. The overall system efficiency of the combined multiple fuel cell in series system with a turbine cycle, however is most efficient.","turbine; Fuel Cell; Hydrogen; Exergy Analysis; power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It may involve sexual assault, rape or sexual abuse.ââ (Centrum Seksueel Geweld, 2019). The consequences on victimsâ lives are severe. Victims can experience mental, physical and/or social problems, affecting their daily lives and sometimes lasting a lifetime if left untreated. 98% of the victims donât look for help due to feelings of shame, fear and guilt (Bicanic, 2018). The aim of this thesis is to propose a design solution to aid with the processing of sexual violence, to specifically design for female victims (between 12-24 years old at the time of the event) of sexual violence in a way that reduces the negative effects on their daily lives. The research phase focused on defining the negative effects and finding opportunity areas, using elements of ViP and systemic design methods. Based on literature and field research, the broad context of support after sexual violence was built. The research included interviewing victims and experts in the field. Insights were gathered in a system map, which visualized all stakeholders and their relations. The problems victims experience were listed and discussed. Themes were identified and formed the basis for a worldview, summarizing the current meaning of sexual violence in the Netherlands. Based on the context research, a vision was formed including a framing statement, an interaction vision and design boundaries. Firstly, the most important stakeholders in the system were defined: the victim herself and her loved ones. The negative effect which needed to be addressed was the deteriorating bond between the victim and her loved ones, due to misunderstanding and ignorance of loved ones around the effects of sexual violence. Following this, the statement goal was to make a loved one feel confident in engaging with the victim by facilitating the sharing of insecurities in a playful way. This vision formed the basis for ideation. Ideation involved a generative session, individual ideation as well as rapidly prototyping ideas. The outcome was a working mechanism ensuring the sharing of insecurities. This mechanism was translated into a design concept, called VORM. VORM is a social game designed to strengthen the bond between a victim of sexual violence and her friend. The goal of VORM is to meet each other in the middle, by building a bridge towards each other. Players can get closer to each other by asking questions about insecurities and sharing their truths. The elements of the game provide the input for the questions and building the bridge. VORM was validated through user testing of the usability, desirability, effectiveness and sustainability of the game. Experts evaluated the target group fit, accessibility and placement in the care process. The conclusion is that VORM facilitates the sharing of insecurities in a playful way, strengthening the bond between players. Experts see a role for VORM in the care process and some participants expressed strong buying interest. Further research is required to map (the size) of the target group and consequent market opportunities.","Sexual violence; support; Social design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The introduction of renewable energy sources and decentralized generation changes the way a power grid will react to this disturbance. Renewable Energy sources are mostly connected by power converters resulting in a decrease in inertia compared to the total of the power grid. A high penetration of âpower electronic interfaced generationâ gives rise to the need for an updated outlook on how to design and operate the grid and essential is to model and test the power systems before and during use. However, steady-state analyses might not reflect reality close enough, when power electronics become a major factor in the grid.<br/>To give perspective on the change in grid stability, an IEEE 39-bus benchmark of a power grid is modelled and perturbed by power drops on different load busses. Within this IEEE 39-bus model, the generation sources are replaced, step-by-step, by either a representation of a grid following voltage source inverter, a representation of a current source inverter, or a representation power and voltage constraint. The results of a steady-state voltage stability analysis and a small signal stability analisys are compared to a range of dynamic indicators extracted from a dynamic simulation of the before mentioned perturbations. This comparison gives an indication on the change in transient stability of the overall grid considering the integration of power electronic sources and also shows the difference in stability between the power electronic models themselves.","Grid Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

With an expected CO2 emission increase of 21% by 2040 for air traffic, there is an urgency to reduce the negative impact on the environment. On top of that, the number of passengers is expected to double within the next 20 years. This challenge requires intervention from governments, airlines and passengers. Creating a more reliable flight planning would reduce the fuel consumption and costs for airlines. However, for airlines with a hub-and-spoke network, the schedule design relies on maximizing the connecting passengers. A more reliable planning with embedded buffers could lead to a lower offering of connecting flights. The goal of this research is to design a novel optimization model for balancing reliability and connectivity by buffer scheduling in the flight schedule, and to evaluate the impact on environmental sustainability. This research provides a Proof of Concept with a case of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The optimization model presents a Pareto optimal front that makes the trade-off between reliability and connectivity explicit. Main findings of this research are that (i) the model is suitable for supporting decision-making on a basic level, (ii) the stochastic variance of the model should be limited and (iii) the flight schedule presented by the model reduces the CO2 emissions significantly. Further research is required on how to optimize schedules with a higher level of complexity for the methodological elements and on the business side.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

From an engineering perspective, standardisation contributes to working more efficiently and effectively and thus less costly. The perspective of naval architecture company C-Job is that standardisation can contribute to engineering lead time reduction. Since customisation (adding value) and standardisation (reducing costs) are counterparts, a conflict arises when both are aimed for. This thesis proposes a strategy to implement design reuse principles to answer the main research question: How can reuse of design of the non-owner spaces on super-yachts, support reduction of engineering lead time? To provide a substantiated answer to this question three topics are studied. These topics are the design process within C-Job, principles of design reuse and commonalities within existing super-yacht designs. The results of studying the three pillars of this thesis substantiate the proposed solution called the Scale-To-Order strategy. Analysing the design process at C-Job shows that a great portion is consumed by iterating the design to solve all space claim clashes and grid mismatches. Omitting space claim clashes and grid mismatches in an early stage of design would therefore eliminate a significant part of the design process. Reviewing literature on design reuse leads to suggesting the underlying principles of design standardisation, modular design and parametric design for application in the S-T-O strategy. The proposal of using these three principles is based on the commonalities that are found in existing yacht designs. The resulting strategy consists of three stages that follow the kick-off meeting with the future yacht owner. In stage one, principle solutions are chosen, based on the greatest commonalities in existing yachts, that include a typical arrangement below the main deck and a corresponding structural global model and HVAC and sewage principles and routing. In stage two, modifications to the solution chosen in stage one are made if desired. Anticipated modifications can be made modular on beforehand and new modifications can be introduced as modular in the future. Stage three is the scaling of the global model to the desired dimensions and serves as a compliance check for integrity of the model. The goal of the S-T-O strategy is to accommodate engineering lead time reduction in the design phase of super-yachts at C-Job. The expected amount of time saved by employing the strategy is roughly fifty percent of the original concept and basic design phases.","Design reuse; lead time reduction; scalable; platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

Flame-Wall Interactions (FWI) have been shown to adversely effect combustion processes in terms of both efficiency and maximum performance. Heat and momentum losses cause incomplete combustion and allow for unburnt hydrocarbons (UHCs) and unoxidised radicals such as carbon monoxide to leave a combustion engine. This is not accurately represented within presently used combustion models, which raises the need for accurate data on essential combustion parameters, such as temperature, during a FWI. In order to assess thermal energy losses, CARS thermometry has been found to be an accurate, non-intrusive temperature measuring technique which can be used for in situ probing of combustion processes. Due to increasing power densities of newly developed combustion engines as well as continuously increasing aerial traffic, the adverse effects of FWI on combustion affect the efficiency and environmental impact of aircraft engines only increases. By curbing the losses induced by maintaining combustion in a confined space, depleting fuel reserves are better conserved and adverse environmental effects curbed. This study focuses on the evaluation of temperature data obtained by broadband RCARS thermometry of a turbulent FWI as well as the delay of the probe pulse with respect to the pump/Stokes beams. Since the dephasing of the excited rotational states is not constant across the rotational states, the measured relative population of each state changes with increasing delay. In order to compensate for the resulting spectral heating issue, the pulse delay needs to be accounted for when generating the spectral libraries used to obtain temperature information from the spectral data captured by the camera. The integrity of these spectral libraries has been investigated by performing a spectral fitting routine of ideal CARS spectra computed by a Matlab code. The spectral libraries consist of Nitrogen CARS spectra ranging from 200K to 2400K in steps of 100K. The probe pulse delays investigated range from 50 ps to 450 ps. The temperature error measured in this study reduces with an increase in temperature and alternates between overestimating and underestimating the actual temperature of the investigated spectrum.","CARS thermometry; turbulen combustion; FWI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Bodyweight-supported gait training enables functional and task-specific training of walking shortly after a neurological injury. After a neurological injury, individuals have to relearn their active control of lateral balance to avoid falling. However, bodyweight-support forces seem to influence the dynamics of lateral balance. Existing literature does not sufficiently explain the interplay between bodyweight support and lateral balance, and conflicting results have been reported. One possible explanation of the inconsistent results is the concurrent application of vertical unloading and lateral support forces. This manner of force application is inherent to the mechanics of most bodyweight-support systems. This experiment aims to study the independent effect of vertical and lateral bodyweight-support forces on lateral balance. A RYSEN (Motek Medical B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) bodyweight-support system was used, which allows the independent control of vertical unloading and lateral support forces. Fifteen participants walked overground in six different unloading conditions of the RYSEN. In the first part of the experiment, the vertical unloading force was increased, while no active lateral support forces were applied. In the second part of the experiment, the vertical unloading force was kept at a constant value, while the lateral support forces were changed. Gait characteristics related to lateral balance were extracted from motion capture and force plate data. <br/> Increasing the vertical unloading had a significant effect on the step width, center of mass displacement and velocity, margin of stability, foot progression angle, and the relative time spent in the double support phase. An analysis that used the equations of motion for human walking revealed that the contribution of the foot-placement and ankle strategy to the mediolateral ground reaction force decreased due to unloading. This decrease may have been caused by an increased use of the counter-rotation strategy to control lateral balance. However, further analysis showed how the lateral alignment of the body weight support force with the center of mass biased this analysis. Lateral support showed much less effects than expected from literature. This seemed to be caused by the lateral support conditions producing too similar support forces.","Bodyweight SUpport; Bodyweight Unloading; Lateral Balance; Frontal Plane Balance; Balance Strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The aim of this thesis is to determine whether Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a viable alternative to control the POC, and is able to cope with the constraints and variations of the system. First, a high-fidelity model has been made of the POC, used for simulation of the device and controller design. Comparisons with other suitable models of POCs have shown that the dynamics inside the POC have been modeled correctly. Because this model is too complex to serve as a predictive model, a simplified batch model has been created for that purpose. This hybrid automaton consists of 13 linear models, and encompasses the cycle-to-cycle dynamics of the plant. Finally, a switched linear MPC strategy has been designed and implemented on the high-fidelity model. Simulations show that this control strategy is suited to control the POC, although further research is needed to cope with system degradation.","Portable Oxygen Concentrator; Pressure Swing Adsorption; Model Predictive Control; Power Minimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Actors producing the CO<sub>2</sub> are interlocked into a system and do not have the resources to escape this.

Solving all these challenges separately is inefficient and impossible.<br/>This report explores the possible synergies between mitigating those challenges and the transition towards a CO<sub>2</sub> circular (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub> neutral) agrifood economy, while also taking spatial justice into account. A future is envisioned of an interconnected metropolitan landscape where CO<sub>2 </sub>is stored in the form of biomass and where knowledge about a biobased economy is gained and exported to the world. A cross-subsidy CO<sub>2 </sub>exchange policy based on creating synergies with other challenges is proposed as a catalyst policy for this transition. Furthermore, specific spatial interventions in the form of setting up knowledge parks are also contributing to the transition. The agrifood sector will become much more robust and sustainable by trading CO<sub>2 </sub>together. The production of biomass mitigates other spatial challenges too, and vulnerable farmers get an additional source of income.

CO2 capture and utilization has high potential as strategy to close the carbon cycle. An example of utilization of CO2 is the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to more valuable compounds. This thesis discusses the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to oxalic acid. Until now, oxalic acid as target product of the electrochemical CO2 reduction has not been studied in great depth, mainly because it only forms in non-aqueous solutions. The influence on several parameters, namely cathode material, applied potential,<br/>anolyte, catholyte, membrane, supporting electrolyte, and temperature, on the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to oxalic acid has been studied. The first step in scaling-up has been taken, from a batch reactor (H-cell reactor) to a semi-continuous system (flow-cell reactor). In order to investigate the feasibility and its implementation in the industry, several options for the downstream processing of oxalic acid are discussed and a techno-economic analysis is performed on the proposed process design.<br/><br/>From the parametric study that was carried out, the parameters that had a considerable effect on the performance of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to oxalic acid were cathode and anode material, catholyte and anolyte, membrane, applied potential and temperature. With the batch reactor optimal results in terms of faradaic efficiency and current density have been found, using lead as cathode, platinumas anode, propylene carbonate+0.7M tetraethylammonium chloride as catholyte and 0.5M H2SO4 as anolyte in which the cathodic and anodic compartment are separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. At higher temperatures, higher current densities were induced by reduction of mass transfer limitations. Within the range of -2.2V to -2.7V vs Ag/AgCl, increasing current densities and decreasing faradaic efficiencies were found with increasing applied potential. Semi-continuous flow-cell was investigated as a strategy to increase the mass transfer in the system. Although higher reduction currents were measured during CO2 reduction in a flow-cell compared<br/>to the batch reactor, the faradaic efficiency towards oxalic acid was lower. The oxalic acid produced during CO2 reduction in the electrochemical reactor is dissolved in the liquid electrolyte. A further separation step of the oxalic acid from the liquid needs to be present to recover the product in a solid state. In order to assess the feasibility of the separation of oxalic acid, several technologies were addressed. Liquid-liquid extraction followed by crystallization is experimentally proved to be a suitable method for the separation and recovery<br/>of oxalic acid from the electrolyte. Based on this separation method, a process design is proposed and a techno-economic analysis has been performed. The techno-economic analysis showed a favorable economic potential for this technology if certain key performance indicators can be achieved. However, the maturity level of this process is still in early stages. Some of those key performance indicators still need to be experimentally improved, further research should focus on increasing the obtained current densities and obtaining<br/>stable faradaic efficiencies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

Such traceability is not fully developed in the current design process at DMO due to divisions in the design process and between design tools. This thesis proposes to use a single information model to facilitate traceability by connecting the need, requirements and design in a single database. Besides enabling traceability, such an information model can also be used to support modern modelling design tools. In the early design stage of naval vessels â the preliminary design phase â the capability, technical feasibility and affordability of a new ship are defined. Interactions between these three aspects are opaque and rely on the need for a new naval vessel and supporting requirements and preliminary design(s). <br/>Determining the need, requirements and design is in this thesis considered to be a âwicked problemâ. In such problems, information gained by developing solutions helps define the problem itself. However, these solutions can only be determined with a certain interpretation of the initial problem. This results in many (evolving) interactions between the need, requirements and design in the ship design process as one is needed to define the other. With the help of Systems Engineering and Requirements Engineering information and relations in a ship design process can be determined and structured. These engineering fields are widely applied, and current technology enabled the development of computer aided approaches incorporating design theory, including computer aided traceability. One of the current developments in design approaches is the introduction of model-based approaches, which creates the possibility to actively manage more relations and interactions in the design process. Model based approaches such as the Design Structure Matrix are used to visualise relations between information, and Axiomatic Design enables the decomposition and creation of complex relations. A different approach to modelling in design processes is the use of Knowledge Based Engineering. Knowledge Based Engineering field aims to capture not only the relations and interactions between information in design processes, but also âknowledgeâ about the âhowâ and âwhyâ in these processes. Each of these model-based developments relies on, or enables, traceability of information. However, having a program capable of supporting an information storage to support these approaches remains difficult to achieve. For this purpose, Shipbuilder software was created to support transparent storage and management of information. In this thesis, theories for modelling approaches, Systems and Requirements Engineering and the DMO design process have been combined. This resulted in one information structure, applied in the Shipbuilder application, which enables traceability. To show that the proposed information model can model a ship and supports traceability, a case study has been performed. A small model of both an S- and L-frigate has been created to show how traceability can be performed in this information model.","Ship Design; Requirements; Concept Design; Concept exploration; Modelling; Traceability; Systems Engineering; Naval Ships","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

This has stirred the Chamber of Commerce to conduct a research on the economic and public value of these areas, establishing two facts: their overall good performance and their scarcity. Nevertheless, the heavy industrial port companies are still not included in the future vision of new urban redevelopment projects such as Haven-Stad. This raises many questions that, such as: Why are these companies treated as obstacles for the development? Are they still the source of environmental pollution, or is that based on old ideas? What value do these companies represent? And how can the city increase their retainment in future redevelopment plans? In order to provide answers to these questions, a value-based strategy has been developed. This will help to understand the port companies and will function as main source for the development of alternative mixed-use redevelopment strategies.","Industrial Area Redevelopment; Relocation Decision-Making process; Relocation Strategies; port regeneration; mixed-use areas; Haven-Stad","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Rivers transport large quantities of litter from land to the oceans. Plastics of different sizes and properties are widely present at various locations in river systems. Concerning macroplastics, previous studies mainly focussed on floating plastics, however, substantial parts of the litter can be transported underneath the water surface. Currently, this suspended litter load remains understudied. Submerged litter is presently monitored with the use of nets. The use of nets has several disadvantages. In large rivers, nets can usually, not be deployed over the full depth and width of the river. Moreover, using nets is labour intensive and requires fixed structures to be deployed. To overcome this problem, this thesis aimed to develop and test a new method for monitoring submerged riverine litter. In accordance with the fish detection abilities of sonar, it seems to have a high potential for identifying suspended underwater objects. <br/><br/>In this study, the litter detection ability of a low-cost single beam echosounder (Deeper CHIRP+) were investigated. Three different experiments were executed, in specific, controlled tests in an artificial environment, semi-controlled tests in a natural environment and litter monitoring in a naturally flowing river. The controlled tests, to get an insight into the scanning technique and detection abilities of the echosounder, were performed in the Kerkpolderbad in Delft. During these tests, the influence of actual object size, object depth and flow velocity on the sonar signal was investigated. The semi-controlled tests were carried out in the Rio de San Pedro, in Andalusia, Southern Spain. During these tests, several plastic targets were used and repeatedly released in the river, passing the sensor. For this, objects of different material properties and sizes were used. Lastly, plastic was monitored in the Guadalquivir and Guadalete rivers in Andalusia. In the Guadalquivir river, the sensor was operated together with nets for validation purposes. In the Guadalete river, monitoring took place for 18 hours from a pedestrian bridge, at different locations over the cross-section of the river and under varying tidal conditions. <br/><br/>The performed tests showed a significant relationship between the dimensions of the reflection signal, derived from the sonar observations and the actual object size. However, object orientation and deformation play a role and lead to deviations in the signal dimension results. A second relation, regarding flow velocity and signal dimensions, was observed. The larger the flow velocity, the smaller the sonar signal. Additionally, signal intensities can, for four out of the eight objects tested, be related to material properties but differences in signal intensities are relatively small. Regarding the river monitoring activities, suspended litter items can be counted, river tide is influencing litter transport and litter is present over the full river depth. <br/><br/>The following main conclusions are drawn based on this research: <br/>- Echo sounding can be used for detecting suspended riverine macroplastics. Litter items can be counted, and fish can be discarded from the sonar readings by their specific displayed shapes. <br/>- Litter size can be estimated when looking at the sonar readings, however, several factors, such as flow velocity, object orientation and deformation have to be taken into account when estimating litter size. <br/>- In the Guadalete river, significantly more suspended litter is transported when river water flows into the sea compared to river water flowing inland. The counted litter items were approximately uniformly distributed over the river depth. <br/><br/>In general, using echo sounding for suspended litter monitoring is potentially useful to gain a better understanding of the suspended litter transport, from which prevention and mitigation strategies could be optimised. For further research, it is recommended to use an echosounder for which the raw sonar data can be exported as a standard digital file. Moreover, the set of test objects should be extended, including more variation in object size. To separate signal size and signal intensity, objects of different size but same material properties and objects of the same size but different material properties should be used for testing. Finally, other types of sonar such as side scan or multibeam sonars may potentially lead to more accurate sonar readings regarding litter size and material estimations. <br","plastic; suspension; monitoring; rivers; echo sounding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The energy and transport sector generate a major share of greenhouse gases globally. Though renewable energy can supply some of the energy demands, fossil fuels are still considered as a primary source to balance the world energy requirements. CO2 is the major constituent of the greenhouse gases, carbon capture process (from the source of emission and from the air) has been proposed as a promising technology to alleviate the effects of global warming in the near future. Alongside, technologies have been developed to produce fuels or other useful chemicals from the captured CO2. This process is called carbon re-utilization. Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF B.V.) is a company in the Netherlands that is working towards developing a system that produces Methanol from CO2 and water captured from ambient air viz. Direct air capture (DAC).<br/>In the ZEF DAC process, polyethylenimine (PEI) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) are used as CO2 absorbents. These amines capture CO2 and water at ambient conditions (absorption phase). The CO2 and water is then stripped from the amine at elevated temperature (desorption phase) and the gases are used for methanol production. During the process of absorption and desorption, the amines undergo losses such as evaporation and degradation. This leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the DAC system over time. This thesis is focused<br/>on determining the evaporation and CO2 induced degradation losses that might occur of PEI and TEPA during the direct air capture process. To determine the losses in PEI and TEPA, it is necessary to understand the behavior of amines in a cyclic absorption-desorption. PEI and TEPA were subjected to 30 cycles of alternative absorption and desorption processes. Regarding evaporation losses, both PEI and TEPA showed significant loss of mass during the desorption process (80 âC, 120 âC were the selected desorption temperatures). Theoretically, the partial pressure of CO2 and water absorbed by the amine reduces the evaporation rate of the mixture (amine+water+CO2). But, during the desorption process, as the CO2 and water are stripped out of the amine, the evaporation rate of the mixture increases. To, determine the maximum evaporation that could take place under a negligible partial pressure of CO2 and water, pure samples of PEI and TEPA were heated at 80 âC, 100 âC, 120 âC. Results showed that, in a long term operation, both PEI and TEPA might undergo evaporation losses (relatively, TEPA evaporates faster than PEI) and replacing the amine frequently would increase the cost of DAC process. Another important observation was that a significant mass of CO2 remained in the sample after every desorption cycle. PEI accumulated more CO2 than TEPA. This suggested that the process of desorption carried out during the experiment was inefficient. A hypothesis was proposed to explain the accumulation taking place in both the amines. Furthermore, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out on the samples subjected to cyclic experiments to identify the formation of degradation products. Results showed that during the cyclic absoprtion-desorption process, TEPA might have degraded when desorbed at 120âC. PEI samples did not show any indications of degradation. Finally, future experiments are proposed to understand the degradation losses which might help in deciding the suitable amine for the DAC process.","TEPA; PEI; Amine degradation; Tetraethylenepentamine; Polyethyenimine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-07","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Building their brand to exploit this on expositions and eventually make a living as an artist. Every year 7290 graduates from creative studies enter the professional world (Vereniging Hogescholen, Den Haag, 2017). Besides the things that they learn about the profession on art schools there is a limited amount of time spend on marketing and business related aspects. As shown in research provided by Artists Interaction and Representation (2011) 90% of fine artists are self-employed. Artistic talent therefore seems not to be enough to guarantee professional career in the arts. This is where Makerting comes in. In this thesis the focus lies on the needs for makers to sustain a living in the art world. Throughout extensive interviews, with makers that are at the beginning of their career and makers that can already make a living of their art, a model is developed to display these needs and actions that makers should take. Together with a thorough exploration of the company and the context where Makerting in functions, the design framework was shaped. In this framework multiple concepts evolved that together lead to the company strategy for Makerting. This strategies is displayed in a strategic and a tactical roadmap. With eventually the goal for Makerting to fit in the future vision of the art world: ââCreating a marketing embracing maker society to act as leaders in the transformation of the art world.ââ The strategy has multiple layers, as Makerting will continue with the services that it already offers, the 1-on-1 coaching with makers and masterclasses at multiple institutions. On top of this Makerting should in the first stage of the strategy get a bigger following to create a marketing embracing community. Showing what marketing is to a wider audience by making tools like the âBlack hole exploreâ and âMaker Makingâ to let makers get acquainted with the company and lowering the negativity around marketing. In the second stage of the strategy Makerting should focus on building the platform to get makers together to enhance this community feeling. âMakerklasâ and âM - the maker platformâ are services that Makerting should add to share the marketing knowledge and minimize the individual feeling that makers encounter. In the last stage of the strategy Makerting should use this marketing embracing community to change the perspective in the art world. As the art world is slowly transforming, the Makerting community should act as leaders in this transformation.","Strategic Roadmap; Service Design; Marketing; marketing communication tools; creative toolkit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

One of the current issues of UAVs is the noise emitted by these vehicles. The purpose of this research is to offer a doorway towards understanding the behavior of drone noise with changing operational and design parameters.<br/>The radiated noise from four selected drones was experimentally measured under realistic environmental settings in an open field. The study dives through spectral analysis of a series of maneuvers, assesses the suitability of acoustic imaging algorithms for drone noise sources, explores adequate noise metrics, and lastly, identifies influential drone parameters essential for the modeling of drone noise in the future. Spectrogram and power spectral density analyses unravel the frequency range of interest between 200 Hz to 3000 Hz with dominant harmonics of the rotorsâ blade passage frequencies. Above this range, the ground reflection hinders the proper identification of noise sources. Further investigation is done with 4 beamforming algorithms. As drone noise may exhibit complex radiation patterns due to interference of multiple rotors, sophisticated beamforming techniques (i.e. Functional (FB), Dipole (DB), and Quadrupole Beamforming (QB)) were implemented which are potentially superior to Conventional Beamforming (CB) in the setting of drone noise. The results of the beamforming algorithms have been verified with synthetic data. Notably, FB was found to perform best on a source if a correction for the expected source type is applied first, however, it is outperformed by other methods if the source type is not known a priori. While all implemented algorithms yielded excellent results on synthetic data, their accuracy greatly decreases when applied to real-life data. This can be attributed to the multitude of external factors and imperfection in vehicle design, as well as the dependency of DB and QB on prior information regarding the pole orientation on the rotors. In conclusion, only CB could be applied reliably. Analysis of CB over snapshots of drones during different maneuvers shows that the rotors prove to be the main sources of noise in hovering and increasing height from Hover. The source identification, however, becomes unreliable with the change in height. To yield a complementary view on the sound characteristics of drones in specific maneuvers, the sound pressure levels and various sound quality metrics have been computed. The metrics reveal the effects of drone parameters (i.e. rotor size, distance to the observer, thrust settings, etc.), thus leading to a selection of possible candidates for a future noise model. This may be useful to assess the human psychoacoustic annoyance of drone noise in an environment where drones become a part of our everyday life.","Drone noise; Acoustic imaging; Beamforming techniques; Dipole beamforming; Sound quality metrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

They can spot small variations in a recent trajectory, take into account road infrastructure, traffic rules and other factors, which influence a future trajectory. As a result, they can interact with other drivers smoothly and safely. Even though human drivers are generally very good at driving, they still make a lot of errors, which lead to many accidents. Therefore, future technology should support the drivers in this task and eventually replace them, to increase safety on roads. The future vehicle should be able to understand and predict the behavior of the surrounding road users and react accordingly. However, predicting trajectories of other road users is an extremely complex task for an algorithm, because of many different factors influencing road users' decisions. Existing approaches predicting future trajectories are mostly based only on the past, observed trajectories, often resulting in very unrealistic predictions. The predicted trajectories are often not in line with road infrastructure, nor do they take into account other road users surrounding them. Moreover, current methods usually predict only one most likely trajectory, disregarding all other possibilities. The main objective of this thesis is to find a Deep Learning architecture that can predict a few most likely future destinations for a target vehicle, and generate accurate trajectories leading to each of them, while taking into account infrastructure, possible trajectories there, target vehicle's recent behavior and other road users around the target vehicle. This work uses a well-performing architecture for pedestrian trajectory prediction in crowded spaces and further develops it, by adapting it to a different domain - vehicle motion prediction in an urban environment. Moreover, this work extends the method, to predict a set of possible trajectories. This was achieved by implementing two-stage architecture. The first stage predicts several high-level destinations, which indicate an estimated location where a target vehicle will be after 3 seconds. Each high-level destination is defined with a probability indicating confidence of the prediction. The second stage uses those predictions to generate low-level trajectories, which are 30 consecutive locations, leading from the last observed position towards the high-level goal. This two-step architecture is trained on an extensive dataset, which was specifically made for autonomous-vehicle applications. To make even better use of the dataset, the network was pretrained on lane centerlines before it was trained on real trajectories. The centerlines were supplied with the dataset. The results show high prediction accuracy, both in terms of the high-level goals, and in terms of the low-level trajectories generated for each high-level goal.","Trajectory Prediction; Deep Learning; LSTM; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

A survey of Milkshake festival 2017 showed that 85 percent of the visitors are part of the LGBTQ+ community. Observation of Milkshake 2019, combined with interviews (appendix), showed that the festival provides a safe zone where visitors can love whom they want to love, dress how they want to dress and be whom they want to be. Apparently, a safe zone, secluded from society, is necessary for the LGBTQ+ community to express itself. Why is that?Although it is thought that the Netherlands is progressive, as it was the first country to legalise same-sex marriages (Wijnants, 2018), 30 percent of the population finds it disgusting to see two men kiss (Bos, Buijs and Beusekom, 2019). This is presumably caused by heteronormative behaviour (Duits &amp; van der Sanden, 2018), which leads to categorisation, and is maximised by upbringing and society. According to Bos, Buijs and Beusekom (2019), homosexuals and bisexuals feel more often unsafe, depressed and disrespected than heterosexuals. Psychological reasons for categorisation are examined, in order to understand why people display categorisation. At the biological level, the unconscious categorisation of objects and groups allows fast processing of information in the brain (McLeod, 2015). The downside is that such categorisation can lead to stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination. This is linked to the three principles (ABCâs) of social psychology; Affect, Behaviour and Cognition. Stereotyping is the cognitive side: âthe positive or negative beliefs that we hold about the characteristics of a social group.â (Jhangiani &amp; Tarry, n.d.). Prejudice is the Affect part: âan unjustifiable negative attitude toward an outgroup or toward the members of that outgroup.â (Jhangiani &amp; Tarry, n.d.). The behaviour part is discrimination: âunjustified negative behaviours toward members of outgroups based on their group membership.â (Jhangiani &amp; Tarry, n.d.). Stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination can negatively influence the way people interact with each other. The LGBTQ+ community wants to be treated like everyone else, and longs for respect and appreciation by the overall society. However, user research shows that stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination are also happening inside this community. For finding respect and appreciation in the heteronormative society, the LGBTQ+ community must perhaps first deal with its own behaviour. The design goal of this thesis is formulated through the 13 Universal Human Needs of Desmet &amp; Fokkinga (2017) (appendix), and aims at creating acknowledgement (respect and appreciation) between different groups of people at Milkshake festival by reducing prejudgment. The interaction vision works as an analogy to provoke specific emotions in visitors when they interact with the concept. These emotions are respect and appreciation, provocation, surprise and connection. An experiential journey is created through a spatial storytelling method.The ideas are created according to the three points of reducing prejudgment (Cherry, 2019), which are empathising with another person, reflecting on their behaviour, and having meaningful interactions. The ideas are evaluated and iterated into a concept proposal. This concept proposal is iterated and re-evaluated through tests with rough prototypes (appendix). The concept âHokjesgeestenâ ironically refers to thinking-in-boxes. It aims at developing an understanding for other groups of people by listening to stories, which focus on four different aspects of certain stereotypes, prejudgments and discrimination. These aspects explain overarching themes within different groups. In addition, the box forces visitors to reflect on themselves by questioning their current behaviour towards another group. For the final evaluation, the space of Hokjesgeesten was simulated by a real-size prototype made out of iridescent foil. Nine participants were asked to partake in this test. They filled in a survey to provide general information, such as age and gender (appendix). The test itself was recorded by audio. The results were analysed and evaluated to form a conclusion and recommendations. Results from the final evaluation suggest that participants felt more appreciative and connected after experiencing the Hokjesgeesten concept. Nevertheless, the concept requires fine-tuning to maximise the desired goal.","Festival; LGBTQ+ community; Stereotypes; prejudice and discrimination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The overhauling title of the graduation project is âRevitalizing Heritageâ, aiming at giving the Hembrug area a second lease of life.For this project, the vast terrain was split up in numerous ensembles, the choice for this project ended up being Campus South. This was grounded by the sensation given during the first site visit, Campus South was dynamic and open. Also, the play of light and shadow caressing the weathered interior walls gave the area a great industrial sensation full of potential. This part of the Hembrug terrain is located in the most southwestern corner, close to the North Sea Canal. The ensemble counts a total of 6 buildings, among which 4 of them are monuments. The project will aim at revitalizing the area, which implies (among other things) that it will be suited to host a new program and that it will strive for sustainable usage in the future. The buildings that are covered in this project are the so-called âHarderijâ and âKetelcentraleâ. The revitalization of these structures needs to be done while also maintaining the existing characteristics and atmosphere. Within the field of heritage, some factors are of great importance. Three important ones are Cultural Value, Design, and Technology. As a student, you have to be able to find a balance between these notions. Nowadays some buildings on the ensemble are vacant, while others are hosting entrepreneurs. The fact that the buildings are already there, and that they have their own unique atmosphere, is something wonderous about heritage. The Hembrug terrain has been bought by an investor, who is planning to revitalize this former secluded area and to open it to the public. The plans to do the latter have already commenced with the project of OMA (among others), who are redesigning the bullet factory into a museum and hotel. Mainly focused on the terrain's visitors it seems, but the investor also intends to give way to a thousand dwellings to be built. With the OMA project in the east and Campus South on the western side of the terrain, the latter should focus on facilitating this new âHembrugian communityâ. Creating communal facilities for the future inhabitants of Hembrug. The campuses are a natural gathering space for people and will function as such in the future, where the former distributing factory buildings in Campus South will get a second life by hosting communal facilities for the people of Hembrug:- A modern concept of a library with working spaces and offices in the Ketelcentrale;- A food market and a bar in the Harderij.Campus South will be a space where people can come together, work, study or recreate.

These subwoofer and satellite speakers will have a feature named Follow Me, which when enabled from a smartphone application, will play music only in the room where the user currently is. The BLEâs signals will encounter obstruction, reflection, and diffraction from obstacles such as people, walls, and furniture. These indoor propagation issues cause the received signal strength (RSS) to have more distortion and variate more. Indoor position systems (IPS) that make use of a geometric model, such as using the RSS in trilateration methods, will suffer greatly from the propagation issues. On the contrary, fingerprinting methods that use a statistical model are more robust. However, fingerprinting requires a time consuming setup that needs to be redone periodically and every time after the environment changes. We implemented a Naive Bayes Gaussian classifier that can distinguish whether the signals travelling between a pair of BLE speakers, which are placed in two fully furnished adjacent rooms, came from speakers in the same room or in different rooms. Subsequently, the speakers that are in the same room can be grouped together, which is a subtask for the Follow Me feature. The classifier uses two features derived from the RSS information. Namely, the mean of the sum of several RSS samples (MSUM) and the standard deviation of the RSS range of several sample sets (SRR). We have quantified the classifierâs robustness by evaluating its performance in 9 different environments that had obstacles or radio frequency (RF) interference or both. We chose the acceptable performance to be an area under the curve (AUC) of at least 80.00 %.

In this thesis, the helicopter industry is considered. Helicopters are complex systems capable of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL). Many companies and organisations are now looking to automate VTOL vehicles in order to break through the urban air mobility market. In order to transport individuals, strict safety regulations have to be adhered to. The goal of this thesis is therefore to address the event of engine failure of a helicopter. In the case of engine failure, a helicopter enters a manoeuvre, called autorotation, in order to safely land. To tackle this problem, a port-Hamiltonian (PH) approach is taken. Within the PH framework, energy transfers between system nodes are defined. By controlling the flow of energy between these nodes, control of the vehicle is possible. This is done by shaping the energy of the system through the use of Passivity-Based Control (PBC). Prior work on the topic of helicopter control using PBC has only been carried out on pointmass models. In order to understand why that is the case, this thesis attempts to derive the PH formulation directly from the Newtonian flight mechanics. It was found that doing so is not possible due to the presence of non-passive terms. These originate from the Blade Element Theory (BET), which is necessary to calculate the thrust and torque of the main rotor. A novel analytical tuning method has also been developed in order to minimise the rise-time and oscillations of the time-response for a PBC. This tuning method has been implemented on a 3-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) point-mass model. However, the degree of underactuation of the 6-DoF model has proven to be a limitation for this tuning method. Instead, the 6-DoF was tuned manually. The two models were verified against flight data of the Bo105 helicopter in powered flight. Finally, the first step of the autorotation manoeuvre has been performed. Further work is required to complete the manoeuvre.","Autorotation; port-Hamiltonian; Passivity-Based Control; helicopter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Perceptual Eigenmode Distortion (PEMD), an extension to the Eigenmode Distortion (EMD), is a method for objectively evaluating simulator motion fidelity, developed at TU Delft. EMD investigates motion cue distortions, imposed by the Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA), in terms of eigenvectors, which represent the dynamic modes of a linear system. In this paper, EMD is extended by a human perception model, which was assumed to help in assessing the various motion cue contributions. Additionally, a new automatic MCA tuning approach is introduced. The method is applied to a combined linear model of the Cessna Citation 500 for asymmetrical flight and the Classical Washout Algorithm (CWA). The automatic tuning algorithm is used to create an MCA parameter set and is compared to the current state-of-the-art method for objective evaluations, the Objective Motion Cueing Test (OMCT). A pilot-in-the-loop experiment was performed, with six pilots in the SIMONA Research Simulator, to assess three CWA motion configurations, which were compared in a double-blind pairwise format. Throughout each run, the Dutch roll eigenmode was externally excited with a gust of semi-random amplitude and direction. Two hypotheses were tested using subjective preferences and through measuring the Dutch roll suppression performance. Preferences varied between pilots and within-pairs, and similar results for PEMD and OMCT were found. A significant improvement in performance was found, however, between a no-motion condition and the PEMD. Therefore, PEMD seems to have considerable potential.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Agents upand download files to one another without the need for any central authority. If agents all contribute to the network and share roughly the same amounts of data as they contribute the network will operate, however if some agents decide to defect and consume far more resources than they contribute the file sharing will stagnate. In online networks with some kind of central authority, such as Ebay, Airbnb, etc. cooperation is achieved through a review system, which is maintained and secured by the central authority. P2P networks are however distributed and cooperation must be achieved without this central mitigator. One way of approaching this problem is by observing cooperative biological communities in nature. One finds that cooperation among biological organisms is achieved through a mechanism called indirect reciprocity. Indirect reciprocity is based on a reputation scheme in which agents share information about each otherâs cooperativeness aiding one another in deciding who to interact with and who to shun. In this work we analyse properties a reputation mechanism must satisfy in order to achieve cooperation in P2P networks, incentivising contributions and penalising excessive comsumption of data. In particular, we determine under what conditions reputation mechanisms are resistant to attacks on the P2P network. We focus on one attack above all, namely that of a sybil attack in which a malicious agent creates multiple fake identities who report high levels of cooperativeness about one another. We determine properties accounting mechanisms must satisfy in order to prevent attackers from obtaining arbitrarily high reputation and to consequently be able to consume arbitrarily large amounts of data. This thesis offers a theoretical framework for evaluating the effectiveness of reputation mechanisms on the basis of their ability to induce cooperation and their resistance to sybil attacks.","P2P Networks; Cooperation through Indirect Reciprocity; Accounting Mechanisms; Sybil Attacks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This is equivalent to the annual emissions of Germany. Besides greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ships engines also cause particulate matter, NOx and noise pollution. As a result, the shipping industry is already facing strict rules and regulations, and these are expected to become even more strict in the near future. These developments have led to an increased interest in zero-emission solutions and one especially promising area is hydrogen-electric propulsion. By combining hydrogen produced from excess renewable energy with oxygen in a fuel cell, water and electricity are produced. The problem, however, is the storage method for hydrogen, traditionally hydrogen is stored in compression tanks under 300 to 700 bar. But due to the low density of hydrogen, this still results in large installations. Additionally dealing with large amounts of hydrogen gas requires extra safety precautions. An alternative way of storing hydrogen is by binding the gas to another substance like sodium borohydride or NaBH4. This substance is in a solid form and reacts with water to produce hydrogen and sodium metaborate (NaBO2). The NaBH4 crystals can be stored as a powder and are safe to handle under atmospheric conditions. Also, the substance has a high energy density, even comparable to that of conventional diesel fuel.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data occurs in many ways like numbers, statistics, and documents in structured and unstructured forms. Companies consider data as one of their most valuable assets for decision-making and to increase performance. Still, often they do not see the direct results of their data-driven investments back into the organization. The volume of generated data increases so rapidly that it exceeds our capabilities if not managed well, leading to organizational data silos. Engineering companies have to deal with unique and complex projects, temporary teams, fragmented departments, and lots of unstructured data. Multicultural teams that work from dispersed locations increase the probability of miscommunication and misinterpretation of project data. Data sharing between employees of three selected case projects within one multinational portfolio have been analyzed. First, the quantitative social network analysis in Python programming exposed the structures of and the node types in the data-sharing networks. Secondly, supported by the extensive literature review, qualitative in-depth interviews identified enabling and limiting factors that determine intra-organizational data sharing in the project life cycle. It was found that balanced networks contribute the most to the exploration and exploitation of intra-organizational data. Also, the multinational context is not acknowledged to limit data sharing, but weaker links do exist between geographically dispersed teams. Measures to create and maintain balanced data sharing networks are suggested on organizational, portfolio, and project level. Future research can focus on network dynamics over time, the effect of data sharing on project success criteria, and the effect of cultural dimensions on data sharing behavior.","multinational engineering companies; intra-organizational data sharing; social network analysis, root cause analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Examples are the extracellular matrix of different tissues such as trabecular bone, different acini and blood vessels. As such, the ability to create complex curved structures is crucial in the development of biomimetic biomaterials that could be used, for example, for tissue regeneration purposes. Currently, most of these different curved substrates and porous materials are fabricated with 3D-printing techniques. These techniques, however, have limitations. The 3D-printed structures, for example, have limited resolution and the production process is not compatible with planar functionality-inducing processes. A solution for these problems could be the concept of shape-shifting. Shape-shifting is the process through which an object transforms itself into a different shape under the influence of an external stimulus, such as temperature or light. A special interest goes to shape-shifting of initially flat materials (2D) into different complex 3D structures. This method has as main advantage that planar printing, patterning or other 2D processing techniques can be used on the planar (non-shape-shifted) state. In this research, the most important principles of shape-shifting of curved hyperbolic surfaces are explored. With this technique, the benefits of both hyperbolic surfaces and shape-shifting can be combined and exploited. A new way of hyperbolic shape-shifting is introduced. This is done by using a passive rigid frame and an active shape memory polymer (SMP). The passive material determines how and where the structure will fold, while the active SMP generates the force in order to fold and forms a curved (hyperbolic) surface spanned between the frame. A simple square patch design consisting of four rigid beams and an SMP was used as the basis of this research. When activated, this patch forms a saddle shaped (hyperbolic) surface. The design, activation and materials of the patch were changed and manipulated in different ways in order to perform a parametric study and to analyse different important aspects of the process. In order to quantify and assess the quality of the different patches and the effects of the manipulations, different test set-ups were made and the most valuable output parameters were chosen. Lastly, a finite element model of the principle was developed in order to further analyse the concept.","Shape-shifting; Biomaterials; Minimal surface; Curvature; Porous materials; TPMS; 4D-printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-03","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The research has been focused on the aerodynamic shaping of the spinner in order to provide a better understanding of the nacelle-blade-spinner interaction in cruise conditions. The set of experiments were carried out by performing a series of steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations with k-omega STT as turbulence model. Generally speaking, the pressure drag reduction was related to large values of Cp nearby the spinner wall; however, the pressure drag of shorter spinners depended mostly on the formation of the hub vortex, while the pressure drag improvement on the longer spinner designs depended on the pressure recovery at the spinner. A tangent spinner design was introduced to reduce the peaks of the pressure distribution observed at the nacelle-spinner transition, at the same time that moved the expansion section of the spinner downstream ahead the blade root thus improving the pressure recovery. The tangent cases induced an average increment in the nacelle drag of 5.77% compared to the original value, while the torque was reduced by only 0.05%. The spinner drag was reduced by 47.82% on average and the relative propeller efficiency was improved at a maximum value of 0.88%. The tangent spinner design was tested with passive boundary layer control tools such as small baffles located close to the blade root trailing edge. The relative propeller efficiency was improved at a maximum of 1.89% and the spinner drag reduced 122.3% turning the spinner drag into a thrust component. The direction of the flow was significantly more aligned with the rotational axis (From a stationary perspective) which increased the spinner pressure recovery.

Our surrounding environments can be improved if architects and designers learn more about how multi-sensory stimuli can enrich our perception of space, and when these triggers can take a back seat. Hence, we should strive for a well-balanced design regarding sensory stimuli, instead of creating overwhelming environments that are unnecessarily stressing ourselves. Buildings affect behaviour and wellbeing of its users. The goal of my research to make architects and designers more aware that creating spaces has certain effects on mental health of perceivers. And more importantly, that these effects can be different for each person. A design for a building should serve every user, instead of designing for the average person. Architects should take into account that every individual perceives a space differently and reacts differently to environmental stimuli. They should implement this varying demand for environmental stimuli in the building/environment, based on an individualâs needs. A stimulating space is an environment that stimulates a personâs way of working, thinking and being, whether it is stimulated by internal or external factors. The role of the architect is getting more multidisciplinary, but the way students are educated at our faculty is falling behind this multidisciplinary approach. My design for an interdisciplinary design school at the TU Delft campus will contribute to this collaboration between students of various faculties. Besides that, it will show how we can design for every user, instead of for the average one, by offering a gradation of spaces, based on the order of interaction with the environment and the degree of environmental stimuli included.","stimuli; perception; space; personality; design school; school buildings; overstimulation; environmental stimuli; mental health; well-being; brain; TU campus; focus; creativity; stimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

However, not moving the legs comes with adverse health effects. Exoskeletons are one solution to get these patients walking again. One of the aims of exoskeleton research is the complete restoration of locomotion for paraplegic patients. The achieved gait must be stable, safe and comfortable for the patients. Most research goes into exoskeleton devices which require the use of balancing aids. In the form of crutches, these aids help the exoskeleton users to maintain stability. One of the goals is to eliminate the reliance on balance aids and let the robot do most work. Until now only two exoskeletons are able to achieve autonomous dynamically stable gait. The gait generation algorithms used in these device are based on inverse dynamics. trajectories are calculated and closely tracked. The main challenges of inverse dynamics control algorithms are slow and static movement, balance recovery issues or computational complexity. In this research the aim is to achieve autonomous walking without balance aids. The Project MARCH exoskeleton is taken as an example in this case study. This device has 4 actuated degrees of freedom per leg. The exoskeleton is modelled in OpenSim. Using predictive forward dynamic simulations, a gait algorithm is implemented and evaluated. The reflex-based control algorithm is based on proportional-derivative controllers. This control algorithm is implemented in SCONE and is optimized using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy method. A second simulation experiment uses the same method to achieve standing balance. After optimization of the control algorithm, dynamically stable gait patterns emerge. The exoskeleton model shows limit cycle behaviour and is able to walk for at least 30 seconds at a speed of 0.7 m/s. The controller can optimized to reject perturbations up to 300 N for 0.1 s. The emerging gait pattern shows two features, which complicate the implementation in the real exoskeleton. The model shows a back-heel rotation during stance phase and hits the joint limits during the liftoff phase. Standing balance is also achieved by a different controller. This research serves as a proof of concept on using SCONE (or more general, predictive forward dynamic simulations) to simulate and test an autonomous exoskeleton. The algorithms are completely feedback controlled require no predefined trajectories. Certain features seen in the emerging gait patterns remain to be resolved. This work demands more research to prevent back-heel rotation, to avoid approaching the joint limits and model the toe-off more adequately in order to reduce the peak torque. Furthermore, interesting research can be done on a randomized perturbation rejection and on how to model the inelastic collision at the joint-ends properly as well as on making a comparison between the gait patterns presented in this research and the patterns currently used in the exoskeleton. Only if these challenges are addressed, the gait algorithm becomes eligible to employ in a real exoskeleton.","exoskeleton; scone; predictive forward dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to the other two most common building materials, concrete and steel, the use of timber is however almost exclusively limited to bridges for lighter traffic, e.g. pedestrians and bicycles. Examples of timber traffic bridges in Germany, Scandinavia and even in the Netherlands, show however that, at least structuraly, timber can be perfectly used in the construction of bridges for heavier traffic. Although structuraly feasible, there are still a number of doubts and uncertainties that go hand in hand with timber bridges. One of them is the maximum reachable service life. This research focusses on the ability to estimate this service life with the help of so called factor methods. The service life of a timber element in the Netherlands, with respect to biological decay, is in the basis determined by two main factors: the natural durability of the timber specie, and the moisture and temperature levels of the timber during its service life. In the case of timber bridges, where the timber elements are subjected to the weather, this can be broken down in three main influencing factors, namely:<br/>1. Natural durability of the used timber specie 2. Local climate (Temperature, rainfall and humidity) 3. Detailing of the bridge (Protection against water accumulation) With these three main influencing factors in mind, factor methods can be used to estimate the service life of bridge elements. These factor methods estimate the service life based on reference situations, and use modification factors to modify these reference situations into the actual situation of the element. In this research two different factor methods have been reviewed in depth: the DuraTB method, developed in Sweden, and the TimberLife method, developed in Australia. The two factor methods have in this research been compared with each other and after that their usability and accuracy has been tested with the use of two reality checks on existing bridges in Amsterdam. For the reality checks, first an expected bridge condition was determined with the help of the two factor methods. After this the actual condition of the bridge was determined by an in-field visual inspection. Then the expected and the actual conditions were compared in order to obtain insight in the correctness of the service life estimation of the two factor methods. In addition, the role of factor methods in the processes of service life planning and especially during the calculation of the total costs of ownership (TCO) has been discussed. An example of a TCO calculation has been performed for two bridge designs, in which the focus was put on the incorporation of both the DuraTB and the TimberLife factor methods. Even though this TCO example is not representative from a total cost point of view (since the values of the different costs were guessed), it does show how factor methods can be used in the calculation of these total costs.","Timber; Bridges; Service Life; Total Costs of Ownership","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

Flatland is a design consultancy that facilitates co-creation sessions to overcome complexity in groups. Flatland has existed for 9 years and their service has moved from graphic recording to facilitation of co-creation sessions to create and activate strategies visually. The professionalisation of Flatlandâs services has resulted in a need to redefine their service offering. However, Flatlandâs growth has resulted in an increased variety of projects and project outcomes. Flatland indicated that a more explicit and systematic approach to session design could help to support their methodology. Such a systematic approach could support Flatlandâs methods as proof of concept. Thus, the initial aim of this project was to: develop guidelines to help Flatland design and facilitate their co-creation sessions more deliberately. Qualitative research of the context of Flatland showed that Flatlandâs facilitators are designing every session anew and completely based on their own experiences and knowledge. Besides, Flatlandâs facilitators have different focus points when designing for the same context. Moreover, Flatland is not sharing knowledge structurally about the core of their business, facilitation, and session design. Thus, these insights identified a threat of knowledge scarcity for Flatland. This means a potential loss of the companyâs capital will occur when facilitators leave the company without sharing their unique knowledge with other facilitators. To overcome this threat sharing knowledge is crucial. A reframe is proposed to overcome this threat. Thus, the central aim of this project became: Design a reflection process for Flatland in which their creative facilitators (and designers) can iterate on their visual thinking session design and tools, to enable a more deliberate design approach to Flatlandâs sessions. A structured reflection process is designed based on literature on reflection and helps to overcome the threat of knowledge scarcity of Flatland. This reflection process supports the facilitators and designers of Flatland in creating tangible insights from their session in order to share this knowledge about facilitation with other colleagues. By doing so, the facilitators become aware of the variety of facilitation styles, and their benefits. The threat of knowledge scarcity can be resolved if all facilitators know the Flatlandâs different session design approaches. The design of this thesis consists of three parts: the structured reflection process, an implementation strategy for this process and two reflection tools. The implementation strategy is designed to ease the reflection process into the Flatlandâs way of working. It starts with an awareness campaign to make Flatland aware of their lack of sharing knowledge about facilitation. The first tool is a reflection template that is designed to make Flatland go through a full reflection cycle.

Therefore, several floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) have been conceived in recent years. In deep waters, it seems logical to also harvest wave energy. One of the options to harness both resources is to use a floating offshore hybrid wind-wave energy converter (FOHWWEC), which physically combines a FOWT with a wave energy converter (WEC). Different studies have addressed the functionality, feasibility, optimization, control and survivability of FOHWWEC concepts. The majority considers a proven FOWT substructure to fit a certain type of WEC. Dynamic analyses in both, frequency and time domains, and laboratory experiments with models have been done. Nevertheless, the investigated studies have not considered the FOHWWEC concept as part of an extensive design space. In other words, they have not attempted to explore and compare the myriad design configurations that are possible in that space. Besides this, few studies have been able to deliver a comprehensive understanding on how certain parameters, intrinsic and extrinsic to the FOHWWEC system, influence its performance. The present study is the start of that space exploration and understanding. Three FOHWWEC design configurations (DC), based on the substructure stability principle, are proposed. Vertical cylinders are used as substructure and two spherical point absorbers are connected through a PTO without mechanical spring to the cylinder supporting the WT. The objective is to compare their performances, based on two variables: the annual average absorption width and the maximum standard deviation of the horizontal nacelle acceleration. Besides this, three draft levels are considered and their impact in the performance is also analyzed. The hydrodynamic analysis of the FOHWWEC with parked WT is performed in the frequency domain. Hydrodynamic coefficients and wave-excitation forces are obtained from the BEM solver NEMOH. The software FOHWWEC Analysis program, developed by the author, solves the EoMs and calculates the performance variables. The North Sea is the selected region and a JONSWAP spectrum has been applied. The results indicate that the design configuration 3 (DC3) FOHWWECs have a wave power absorption mechanism based on the heave resonance of both, substructure and WECs. This mechanism is more efficient than DC1 and DC2's mechanisms. This allows to maximize the absorption width. Besides this, DC3 FOHWWECs can also minimize the nacelle accelerations (DC3-D2 case). The effect of the draft on both performance variables differs depending on the DC. Wide-ranging deductions from the results can be summarized as follows. It is reasonable to design a FOHWWEC as a whole system, considering both, wind and wave power generation from the beginning. Using an existing substructure means to lose performance improvement opportunities. It is also reasonable to select a buoyancy-stabilized substructure for the design. This allows to reach the most efficient wave power absorption mechanism, while providing the required flexibility to thoroughly explore and find the balance between design parameters such as WPA, displacement, draft, size and position of the WECs, mooring, among others.","FOHWWEC; hydrodynamic analysis; wave absorption; nacelle acceleration; substructure; stability principle; hybrid; wind-waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The research has been done with the purpose of designing a usable, affordable and accurate injury-prevention tool, increasing both military wellbeing and operability. For years, researchers have gathered evidence of correlations between specific gait biomechanics of individuals and their influence on injury incidence. Using various types of laboratory equipment, such as pressure plates, walkways and treadmills, researchers found a strong correlation between parameters like cadence, vertical loading, (time to peak) heel rotation and local peak pressure values and different types of common overuse injuries in the lower limbs. However, laboratory tests often neglect the influence of footwear, distraction and fatigue. In addition, they are expensive and time-consuming tasks. One specific user group that suffers from a high incidence of overuse injuries is the military. About 3000 recruits follow basic military training each year, of which about 13% end up with one of three most common injuries: MTSS, iliotibial band syndrome and tibial stress fractures. Of those injured recruits, about 8% gets discharged from the military. This high rate is caused by the intensity of training, often accompanying high carried loads and pressure to perform. Specifically, the cumulation of repeated smaller impacts during marches is bound to cause overuse injury. The ability of commercially-used pressure-sensitive insoles to measure abnormality in injury-predictive gait parameters was tested in a series of studies. First, measurements from the insoles were compared to a commonly used gait-analysis tool: a GAITRite walkway (n=20). This study found no statistical agreement in sample-to-sample predictability. To validate whether those results could be caused by methodical differences, a second study was performed comparing the insole measurements of injured soldiers to those of control subjects (n=10). This test did result in significant between-group differences for all measured parameters. Furthermore, significant differences in parameters were found between walking on military boots and running shoes. A strategic study revealed that the product could find a competitive advantage in service and software innovation, with a focus on (a) accuracy while maintaining usability for specific user groups and (b) multi-diagnostic ability and spread market targeting (both b2b and b2c). Specific user demands were found and defined as a reduction in insecurity at various levels (e.g. where a soldier wants to be reassured about their personal fitness, a commander wants to ensure operation-readiness). A design proposal was created (Figure 1), based on research insights. The concept insole not only meets military-specific embodiment, hardware needs and improved sensor placement, but a service-design proposal enables both direct users and important stakeholders to use the data for injury prevention, rehabilitation, adaptation of footwear, operational management, training customization and general overuse-injury research. Besides meeting the needs within a military context, the product could be adjusted to meet the needs of other (occupational) overuse-injury sensitive users, such as police, hospital staff and factory workers. Clinical applications include automation of insole orthosis customization and prevention of ulceration among diabetic patients.","Injury prevention; lower limb; Biomechanics; Wearable Technology; gait analysis; plantar pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It is the result of years of investing in state-of-the-art technologies and putting in place the needed policies, and it seems to pay off: our country is likely to be amongst the early adapters as soon as these vehicles enter the market. Claiming this desired role of a frontrunner comes with many large challenges and responsibility, however. Being one of the first to be able to put autonomous vehicles on the roads, means that we should be one of the first also to have the right policies in place - there is no luxury of waiting and learning from good examples, or mistakes, made elsewhere. But what are these ârightâ policies then? And what other kind of â perhaps unexpected - moments of choice might appear? What happens after we have made the decision to allow private autonomous vehicles full access to our inner-cities. Or what are the consequences of leaving a large role for the market to experiment freely, whilst staying passive as a public sector? There is a need for forecasting studies that help to expose these kind of potential choices - projects that try to speculate about the future from diverse perspectives. Amsterdam 2049 is such a project that aims to generate insights into these required actions, through constructing and providing future scenarios that give an idea of the potential implications of autonomous vehicles on the city of the future. By doing so, it establishes a sense of urgency amongst policy-makers and planners, as well as providing them with recommendations, from policies to spatial interventions, on how to act. Structural behind these future scenarios is the development of a unique storytelling-scenario method, which will in its own way combine several useful theories and urbanism insights to produce informative, imaginative and compelling stories about Amsterdam and autonomous vehicles. The stories thus end up as a unique combination of urbanism - with maps, sections and impressions -, âcomplex system theoryâ â giving insight into âsystem transitionsâ that provides a structure and timeline â and the visual language of the graphic novel â with personal perspectives, dialogues and imaginative visualizations â which altogether lead to accessible, forecasts that can inspire and inform those involved in decision-making.","Autonomous Vehicles; Forecasting; scenario building; Storytelling; Amsterdam; Urbanism; Comics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The sharpness of an image is maximal when the incoming wavefront is flat, with aberrated wavefronts yielding distorted images of limited utility. In the particular case of astronomy, the flat wavefront of the light from a distant target is aberrated as it moves through the atmosphere, before reaching our telescopes. The field of Adaptive Optics (AO) is dedicated to the correction of these aberrations, with the goal of enabling the imaging of objects through turbulent media with as much detail as possible. Due to a delay inherent to the AO control loop, each control input is used to correct an aberration slightly ahead in time, which means that, for the correction to be effective, the controller must be equipped with predictive capabilities. Prediction demands a model, and fortunately, the dynamics of atmospheric turbulence can be effectively modelled using a linear system. This makes the Kalman filter, the statistically optimal state estimator for linear systems, a natural choice for prediction. However, the steady-state Kalman filter requires a solution to the computationally intensive Discrete-time Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE), which precludes its application to large-scale systems. Furthermore, the Kalman filter assumes a precise model with particular properties is available, which often is not the case in practice. The advent of extremely large telescopes demands prediction algorithms that can handle likewise extremely large system dimensions, which means that application of the steady-state Kalman filter, in its conventional form, is unfeasible. This thesis proposes a data-driven approach to Kalman filtering that exploits the intuitive sparsity pattern of the matrices involved in the modelling of an AO system. The developed algorithm replaces the DARE and, with knowledge of the system matrices, estimates the Kalman gain from measurement data, with the exploitation of sparsity providing a substantial drop in complexity when compared to the DARE, and with its data-driven nature inherently compensating, to a certain extent, for modelling errors. This thesis further proposes a two-stage approach to reduce the burden of the online prediction operation. While the measurement and state-transition matrices of the AO system are sparse, the Kalman gain is generally dense, consequentially slowing down prediction, which should accompany the sampling period of the loop. Our proposal splits prediction into a sparse stage for prediction of local structures in the wavefront phase, and a low-dimensional dense stage for prediction of the remaining low-frequency aberrations. The two-stage predictor is inherently suboptimal, but allows for quicker prediction and identification for extremely large systems. Via tuning, the user strikes a balance between performance and execution time.","Kalman Filtering; Data-Driven; Adaptive Optics; Large-Scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Through innovations over time, the province of South-Holland developed profitable productive food-landscapes which provided an important contribution to the Dutch food production and export, making the Netherlands one of the leading food-exporters worldwide. <br/><br/>However, the profit-oriented character of the productive landscape no longer fits well with the changing societal values, as the current pattern is destructive to the environment and people feel disconnected from the food production and the landscape. Society today does not only value profit, but also increasingly cares about the environment and social justice. The productive systems are locked into a path of environmental destruction and do not focus on the values of society, which show increased awareness of the importance of a healthy, diverse, environmental-friendly and inclusive approach towards future developments.<br/><br/>To resolve this mismatch between landscape and culture, this project aims to transform the current economic-driven food productive landscapes towards regenerative food landscapes that match with the values and needs of society today. To do so, this project starts from the perspective of the landscape, uses transition theory as a theoretical base, takes into account social justice, and investigates the spatial implications of regenerative development.<br/>The results are a vision that foresees regenerative landscapes for South Holland and a strategy with interventions to reach this vision by 2050. Both the vision and the strategy take into account the three different types of food landscapes of South Holland: agriculture on clay soil, livestock and dairy production on peat soil, and horticulture in a mixed peri-urban environment. The regenerative landscapes will not only mitigate the effects of previous destructions but reverse them by a cooperative relation between man and nature . The landscapes will revitalize the province to sustain modern values and to restore the inherent relation between landscape and culture.<br","circular economy; Province of South Holland; regenerative landscape development; productive food landscapes; destructive land use; spatial justice; societal values","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio â Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""
