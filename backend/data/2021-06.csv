However, with the delineation of water source protection zones, villages and small counties in the upper reaches of Chengdu have been affected a lot.<br/> The upstream of Chengdu, which is part of the Dujiangyan irrigation area, is the typical western Sichuan style village with its vernacular wisdom of living with water. But now they are expected to leave and move into a collective community with fixed reimbursement due to the water source protection policy. Local small industries and livestock raising are no longer allowed, and agricultural production is also restricted due to the risk of water pollution. A similar development limitation has a great impact on small counties as well. Besides the economic loss, the authentic lifestyle that carries water culture has also suffered the loss. Metropolis gains priority on water and the indigenous people are sacrificed. And this water injustice issue is even exacerbated when the new modernized neighborhood came since the informal development is intolerant by the government.<br/> Therefore, this research will explain the conceptualization of water justice and the key elements in this specific local urbanization context. Through the analysis of the impact by water extraction infrastructure, the tangible water value, the virtual value of water, and the cultural preservation, measuring the expulsion of this water project and the livelihood of the locals. Then clarifying the multiple-layer influence of the water conservation interventions in this irrigation area and emphasizing the importance of water justice especially for the indigenous people with the social survey, literature review, and comparison of other villages. And scenario testing of different possible new development in the perspective of different priorities to find a balanced solution for both sides.<br/> This research is aiming to engage flexible water conservation policies with the methods of tax reimbursement and local empowerment, explore a win-win way of both the water use cities and water source districts. And for this specific case, find out a sustainable development way with a comprehensive consideration for vulnerable groups which allows them to keep their positive way of living while doing the water conservancy.<br","Water conservation; Dujiangyan irrigation area; water justice; sustainable development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","30.86883, 103.91078"

To secure a resilient and sustainable urban environment, the city is forced to revisit its networks, systems and land-use. Especially with the growing trend of urbanization. One of these systems, which lies at the core of the daily operations of the city is the energy network. Large amounts of ener-gy are transported through power cables from large plants towards to their final destination, the end-user. However, with upcoming demand for renewable ways of energy production, and the increasing availability of ‘clean’ production methods, the city has the potential of becoming its own generator. <br/> Taking this stance, the confrontation with existing policies, methods, trends, can be sought; creating oppor-tunity for local production and storage of heat/electricity within the cities limits. In so doing, seeking integration with public and private program, and therefore tightly grounding it within city districts and urban life. By nestling into local communities and providing new program, the local production has the objective to create a broad support for sustainable energy. <br/> The techniques available to produce energy in a renewable and sustainable way are becoming increasingly more verifiably reliable alternatives. To be able to shorten the chains towards a more decentralized system, the city itself has to critically assess its scales and densities, and look for opportunities where renewable energy production can take place. Within the public eye, and with minimal loss of energy due to transportation, which is especially detrimental for district heating solutions. The framework proposed in this thesis therefore aims to combine the ap-propriate scale of the city with the proper scale of the production method to create symbiotic solutions. <br/><br/>The architect here, has a unique position in being able to work on the infrastructures of the future as infrastructures will overlap increasingly more with the urban tissue. Moving away from the traditional infrastructures which rely on exactitudes and centralized systems, the decentralized systems will aim to adopt a multifaceted approach, integra-ting infrastructural, social and operational systems. In so doing, local and regional opportunities for energy producti-on can be seized creating a tailored solution to the demands of the area, aiming to support its demand with renwa-ble energy. Architecture in this will take the position of innovator and integrater, embedding new approaches to infrastructures within the urban fabrics of the future.<br","Renewable energy; Energy systems; Decentralized Energy Systems; Infrastructure; Urban design; Public life; Land-use; Communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","Energy Hub Schiehaven","51.903704, 4.457141"

This thesis studies the usage of Deep Learning-based models to recognize different football activities in an accurate, robust, and fast manner. Several deep architectures were trained with data captured with IMU sensors placed on football players' bodies and their performances were compared. A combination of convolutional layers followed by recurrent (bidirectional) LSTM layers showed to achieve the best results with up to 96.71% of accuracy. When using normalized data via a calibration recording, these accuracies increased up to 98.2%. Results showed that deep learning models performed better in evaluation time and prediction accuracy than traditional machine learning algorithms. An end-to-end pipeline for football activity recognition was developed that can be extended to any other HAR task. With it, not only the training was explored, but also a sliding window evaluation procedure was proposed that can be used to efficiently analyze unseen IMU recordings and recognize the activities there present. This pipeline showed to be fast and robust especially with signals consistently calibrated and can be used to recognize movements on a real-time basis. It can be concluded that a combination of deep learning models and a sliding window evaluation procedure is suitable for fast and accurate HAR tasks and can be used as input for research on injury prevention. By training and evaluating the models with more data, ideally from uncontrolled experiments such as football matches, we expect to further improve the generalization property of the classifiers.","Human Activity Recognition; HAR; Deep learning; Machine Learning; Football; Soccer; Injury prevention; Sports engineering; Convolutional Neural Networks; Artificial Neural Networks; Recurrent Neural Networks; LSTM; IMU; Sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

The post-war reconstruction area is at a turning point in terms of safety and quality of life, having experienced a downward spiral of pollution, violence, crime, and social segregation for decades. In this context, the project hopes to activate the enormous potential of the community and empower residents to regenerate themselves. The project, therefore, wants the nature-based solution to be seen as a catalyst for space, not only advocating for the public to use NBS to activate the use of public space, but also to combat social isolation, build a sense of place, increase <br/>employment opportunities, attract investment, visitors and new residents, and together create a more sustainable and liveable city.<br/>The project has three tracks to create a participatory landscape. They are: in the first track, transformative place-making to increase social awareness; in the second track, motivation to participate through public policies, design tools, and the improvement of infrastructure systems; and in the third track, community empowerment through strategies such as the transfer of power and responsibility, the creation of garden operating organizations, phased development and the breakdown of responsibility zones. The project hopes to provide spatial planning and design strategies that can be used as a reference for similar areas and urban regeneration to transform into eco-cities.","Participatory planning; Nature-based solutoins; sustainable transition; spatial strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Veer, F.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This report encompasses a graduation project submitted to fulfil the requirements for the title of Master of Science at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology. This research was conducted to find an alternative use for waste plastic as building components, specifically for the residents of an IDP camp within the federal capital territory of Nigeria, Abuja. Shelter is a fundamental human right, and everyone deserves to have a home that gives them safety and comfort. Humans have created a consumption-driven system that widens the divide between very low-income earners and the rest of society. Thus, the housing systems used in these camps are of the lowest quality. Another problem facing the country is plastic waste. Plastic waste is a global problem that is particularly evident within Nigeria. Without a proper large scale waste management system, the plastic ends up in water bodies or landfills and contributes to environmental degradation. Therefore, strategies for recycling plastic effectively and efficiently need to be developed. This research aims to provide a possible solution for both issues. Although the materials used for the housing are of low quality, the residents themselves are pretty resourceful in terms of adapting their resources to suit their needs, efficiency of building techniques and spatial arrangements. Therefore, they serve as an essential knowledge source to derive recycling methodologies for sustainable building. A standardized system for building components from plastic waste is designed and developed within this research. These building components require low-income technology for production, and the camp residents could use them to generate income for the IDP camps and low-income earners. The findings within this report will be based on literature research, testing and on-site analysis of an IDP in Abuja and with a specific focus on the Kuchingoro IDP camp in Abuja, Nigeria . <br","plastic; recycling; PET; building component; low-cost; IDP; camp; Facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","9.07650, 7.39860"

To navigate through this paradox, residents constantly negotiate those regulations that keep communities closed (which they cherish as source of order and tranquillity) with their own experience and needs. This negotiation derives into actions of “overflow” that challenge the planned space and, under current conditions, are destined to remain unrecognised by formal institutions. <br/><br/>This research explores the ways in which these actions can be translated into and enhanced through a spatial and regulatory “framework for negotiation.” The goal is to create the conditions for the growth of open living environments through actions that prioritize horizontal interaction and spatial flexibility.

The topology design also considers theconverter requirements, wiring, and stability and safety considerations. A cost analysis is made ofthe entire grid resulting in an estimated total cost of around €100,000.

To unlock this potential, the technology must be scaled up and the errors at play must be reduced. As developments in scalable quantum computation devices advance, the demand for scalable benchmarking techniques that are able to reliably assess the fidelity – the complement of the error rate – of a device has increased significantly. Randomized benchmarking offers a single, concise number that reflects the average fidelity of multi-qubit operations performed on a quantum device. While this method is robust against state preparation and measurement errors, it still suffers from scalability issues. In this thesis, we present a protocol that efficiently predicts the multi-qubit fidelity obtained from randomized benchmarking by only benchmarking single- and two-qubit subspaces, greatly increasing the scalability. The protocol uses simultaneous randomized benchmarking with the aim of catching cross-talk effects while at the same time reducing the number of required benchmarking sequences. We have run numerical simulations of the protocol under two noise models, one depolarizing and one dephasing, to verify its performance. The results of these noisy simulations are promising and suggest that our protocol could offer a valuable tool on the road to developing large-scale quantum computers.","randomized benchmarking; multi-qubit fidelity; fidelity; protocol; Qiskit","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research is conducted through fieldwork observations and interviews in care home 't Kampje in Loenen aan de Vecht, as well as through literature and case studies. The anthropological research led to a conclusion that many people living in care facilities show passive behavior and are not as self-reliant as they used to be. Many of them don’t interact as much with each other and barely do something for each other. The goal of this research is to find out what it means to be self-reliant and how a person can remain like that with the help of architectural tools. <br/><br/>Self-reliance is about realising an acceptable level of functioning in the important areas of daily life. If necessary, by organising the right help at the moment that a decline in the performance level threatens or occurs that cannot be prevented or remedied by oneself. These important areas of life are called; ‘life domains’. <br/>Both healthcare institutes GGD and Vilans use these domains to value their clients degree of self-reliance- and direction. The domains differ in some areas, as the domains of the GGD are used for anyone in the Netherlands, and the domains from Vilans are more tailored for elderly. The 10 domains that Vilans describe are; daytime activities, living conditions, physical functioning, mental functioning, cognitive functioning, housekeeping, general daily, social network, mobility, and the financial situation.<br/><br/>Each domain has certain conditions for a person to be called fully self-reliant. Most of these conditions indicate a need for independence and a safe- and healthy living environment. Architecture alone can not provide all the answers for self-reliant living, the living environment around the building plays an equal role in the degree of self-reliance for<br/>a person. The extracted design tools for each domain show correlations between each other. Such as having places for gardening, the promotion of natural movement, the need for a diverse aged target group, homes that are compact and life-cycle proof, close proximity of shops, public transport- and other amenities, and the need for a social environment. These are the main architectural / urban strategies that can encourage elderly to become more self-reliant. These have to do mainly with being- and remaining healthy in a physical way, a mental way, and a social way.<br","Self-reliance; architecture; Elderly; Elderly housing; flexibility; nature inclusive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.984126, 4.360630"

The system also showed to be resistant to 'high levels' of noise on the communication channel as defined in the CELENEC standard. Furthermore, in order to decrease the bit error rate further, additional bit error detection and correction has been implemented using microcontrollers.

(mentor); Oud, Michelle (graduation committee); van Gijzen, M.B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), patients are irradiated with small spots, that deliver a local dose to the tumor. The number of possible spots to choose from is virtually infinite, but practically limited, which requires a spot selection. This spot selection should result in an optimal treatment plan, i.e., to deliver a sufficient dose to the tumor, while sparing the healthy surrounding tissue. These trade-offs make treatment planning in radiotherapy a multi-criteria optimization problem. The current approach for this spot selection by the Erasmus Medical Center (MC) is an iterative resampling method which uses a trial and error principal. A random sampled spot selection is made, bad spots are removed, and new spots are randomly added. The research goal of this project is to improve the current spot selection method, by inducing sparsity on spot selections with the L1-norm, without decreasing the plan quality of the current solution. Sparse solutions are beneficial for optimization problems since they reduce the problem size and have higher probability of producing qualitative solutions. To achieve these goals, the Sparsity-Induced-Spot-Selection (SISS) method was developed. Contrary to the iterative resampling approach, the SISS method uses a top-down approach. Starting with a large spot coverage, it selects as little relevant spots as possible through the use of the L1-norm to induce sparsity, until an acceptable treatment plan using as little spots as possible is made. The developed method was validated on a test set consisting of 10 head and neck patients. Using the SISS method, an average spot selection of 1159 spots was produced, compared to a solution of 1074 spots for the resampling method. For the average patient, 6 out of 10 Organs-at-risk (OAR) received a lower dose with the SISS method than with the resampling method. The remaining OARs all received a marginal dose surplus of 0.6 Gy, with a maximum of 2.6 Gy. The target volumes in the tumor also received a similar dose to the resampling method, with the near-minimum dose of the tumor receiving a dose shortage of 0.2 Gy, and the near-maximum dose of the tumor receiving a dose surplus of 0.5 Gy, both being considered as marginal differences. The SISS method produces a comparable spot selection and shows no decline in plan quality of the dose distributions. Using the L1-norm to induce sparsity on spot selections in treatment planning is feasible. The computation time of the SISS method could be reduced using a voxel reduction, although this reduction in computation time is not guaranteed in practice due to robust optimization being applied.<br","Radiotherapy; Optimization; Treatment Planning; Proton Therapy; L1 norm; Sparse matrix","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The Smart Teddy project is a multidisciplinary project aiming to create an interactive system, using a teddy bear as a focus point, which collects the data needed in order to enable seniors with dementia to live independently for a longer period of time. Over the last three years, three prototypes of the Smart Teddy have been developed. The Smart Teddy project was introduced as a final project for students following the BSc program Electrical Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. Starting in April 2021, a team of six students attempted to further develop the Smart Teddy over the course of 11 weeks. This thesis contains the Human Interaction &amp; Integration subdomain of the Smart Teddy thesis project, where Human Interaction refers to the aspects of the Teddy that encourage interaction with the user, and Integration refers to the combination of all subdomains into one fully functioning prototype. In this thesis, the design choices, implementation methods and verification are discussed. The contribution to the prototype regarding Human Interaction &amp; Integration are the addition of a movement system using pneumatics, the implementation of a flexible touch sensor, the ability for the Teddy to produce audio, to communicate wirelessly with the Base Station, and for all components in the Teddy to communicate with the main controller. The final prototype has been implemented using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, which was mounted on a custom PCB. All controls are provided by the Pico, and uses I2C, SPI, UART, and analog and digital inputs to communicate with the sensors and actuators. These sensors and actuators were implemented using off-the-shelf breakout boards and drivers, to allow for fast design and test iterations. The movement of the Teddy has been implemented using air pumps and molded silicon rubber, and the tail wagging is implemented using the same principle used for soft robotic grippers. The final prototype is fully functional and meets 16 of the 20 requirements - the requirement concerning speech recognition and the noise produced by the pumps have not been met.","human interaction; Integration; Dementia; companionship; microcontroller; soft robotics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","Bachelor Graduation Project",""

(mentor); Agugiaro, G. (mentor); Pađen, I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the Netherlands, the coastal dunes are essential to protect the country against flooding. However, the rising sea levels increase the risk of flooding along these sandy shores. Moreover, due to a combination of human and natural activities, dune erosion has increased and will continue to do so in the coming decades. Besides flood protection, the Dutch shoreline is important for preserving biodiversity, the generation of drinking water and recreation. In recent year, the number of recreational buildings on the beach, such as bars and holiday homes has increased. This is relevant because previous studies show that such beach buildings affect the wind flow and limit aeolian transport of sediment towards the dunes. <br/><br/>This research studies the impact of beach house configurations on dune-ward sediment transport to limit the adverse effects on dune development. We use CFD simulations to study the wind flow around a 3D model of a beach with holiday houses, based on a section of the Noordwijk beach in the Netherlands. We implement the CFD software OpenFOAM to solve the RANS equations for turbulent, steady-state flow. The sediment transport that occurs is calculated using the wind direction and speed near the ground surface of the solution.<br/><br/>The study consists of multiple 3D models in which the placement of the houses is varied systematically, to study the effects of beach house configurations. Variations are made by rotating houses, individually or within a row, and changing the distance between the houses and dunes. We determine the annual effect on sediment transport by applying varying wind conditions based on historical wind data from Noordwijk. <br/>As we have many simulations to run, and all need different parameters and settings, we automated the process. First, a PostgreSQL database is used to store all requirements for the CFD simulations, the metadata and the results the simulations give. Then, a Python script links the information stored in the database to the correct settings in OpenFOAM. This way, many simulations are run in a row, and the results area to compare. <br/><br/>The results show that rotating the houses individually towards the prevailing wind direction appears to improve the amount of dune-ward sediment that takes place, compared to beach houses placed perpendicular to the shore. Rotating a row of houses as a whole has a limited effect on the amount of sediment transport. However, combining the rotation of the row of houses and the houses individually towards the prevailing wind direction shows the best improvement in sediment transport. Changing the distance between the houses and the dune foot so that a row of houses forms a funnel shape pointing towards the dunes also yields promising results. <br/>Because we use a simplified model and do not take factors such as moisture levels or fetch distance into account, the results of this study overestimate the amount of sediment transport that takes place and might not quite resemble the reality. Further research using scale models or wind tunnels is necessary to confirm the suggestions made in this thesis. <br","CFD; Aeolian sediment transport; Database Systems; dune growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

We devise an experimental setup to test a selection of algorithms from three state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches; Hindsight Experience Replay, Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning and Distributional Reinforcement Learning.

The first two quarters of the graduation year were set up as a research phase, which was used as the starting point for the design phase of the second half of the year. “Heritage 4all: Univer-Cities” was chosen as the graduation studio. The focus of this graduation studio lies on the following four themes: Co-creation, sustainability, univer-cities and digital heritage. The involvement of stakeholders is of paramount importance to know what the citizens values and what their necessities are. Therefore the research question is the following: ‘how a co-creation approach can be applied for redesigning 20th century Industrial Heritage factories for adaptive reuse together with stakeholders?’ For the stakeholders involvement Minecraft is used as the heritage game to explore if it could be supporting the value assessment of the Kabelfabriek II. Other case studies (e.g. Westergasfabriek, DRU Industriepark, Stanley Mills, King’s Cross and The Tobacco factory of Madrid) were studied to find out how to make the Kabelfabriek II sustainable in terms of energy efficiency and social inclusivity. Furthermore sixteen interviews were held, both with expert and non-expert stakeholders. The old, partly abandoned, cable factory at the Schieoevers in Delft was chosen as the case study for this research and was redesigned in the second half of this graduation year. The cable factory, in Dutch called De Kabelfabriek II, is one of the factories of the former called NKF company. When discussing the cable factory in this research paper, Kabelfabriek II at Schieweg 15 in Delft is meant. It is not listed as a monument, however it is part of Delft’s industrial heritage. The city of Delft used to be known for its industry. Yet because of de-industrialization this image of Delft as an industrial city has changed. The design process and final design can be read in the design booklet “Kabelfabriek 2.0 – Working and living cabled in the factory”.","Industrial Heritage; Kabelfabriek; Minecraft; values & attributes; Stakeholders involvement; workshop; Co-creation; Sustainability; Univer-cities; Digital Heritage; Heritage & Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Heritage4all","51.99439308930994, 4.365949576710547"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This research begins with a fascination for nonhuman activeness. This is based within a theoretical framework of multispecies world, in which nonhumans are seen as active beings that continuously disturb. Seeing nonhumans as active beings causes some policies, or interventions, to look strange. One of these policies in the Netherlands is the new forest strategy commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture in the Netherlands: the expansion of forest by 37.000 hectares within ten years. Even though the goal of the forest strategy is to provide more biodiverse spaces, the new forest is still there because it is pleasant for us humans. The research therefore aims at an alternative to this forest strategy through researching the main question: How can new ways of connectedness between humans and nonhumans be generated in existing and newly constructed areas perceived as ‘natural’ or ‘nature’? <br/>In order to research new types of connectedness, the theoretical framework of multispecies world is further explored. This results in design principles on human, nonhuman, and abiotic movement, hybrid as an explicit human structure where there is a condensation of movement, and landscape as being, which is a forest structure designed as if it has legal rights. <br/>After this, the dune region, with in specific Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen is analysed in terms of movement, transitions and identity of the area, and problematic areas where a landscape as being is necessary. In terms of movement there are different movements found in the areas of the forest/savannah, the dunes, the water infiltration system, and the flower bulb fields. Transition zones are found between these areas. Hybrids are placed here in order to let make humans more aware of nonhuman movement. Problematic areas around Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen are considered to be the Oosterkanaal, that retrieves water from the dunes, and the cultivation of flower bulbs. <br/>These elements result in a research by design that tries to generate new ways of connectedness between humans and nonhumans. Time, and materiality become very important in the design. The hybrids have a timespan in which they need to be build anew or left to decay. Therefore, every thirty years there is a reassessment of the relation that humans have to the landscape. Through the design it becomes clear that the multispecies approach taken on in the design, does not generate new connections with the presence of movement, hybrid, and landscape as being. But it does generate different ways of connectedness because of the rebuilding of hybrids that are a direct response to the landscape and its corresponding movements, and the changes that happened in the landscape. A multispecies framework therefore proposes an alternative design for the forest strategy that instead of moving towards an end goal (which the forest strategy does), mostly marks a beginning of a relation to the landscape that is revaluated through a cyclical approach to time. This approach thus does not lead to new connectedness, however it does lead to different connectedness.<br","forest strategy; multispecies world; Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen; movement; hybrid; cyclical time; perception; human; nonhuman; legal rights for landscapes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.3319117,4.5423327"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">In this thesis, we start with giving a mathematical description of bipartite quantum correlations and how they are built up in the Tensor model. This is needed because we want to recover the state and the operators when only the bipartite quantum correlation is known. In the literature, there are see-saw algorithms to recover the state, but they are limited to only lower dimensions. In this thesis, we explore an alternative approach, where we directly minimize the function<br/> f(ψ,{E<sub>s</sub><sup>a</sup>},{F<sub>t</sub><sup>b</sup>}) = ∑<sub>a,b,s,t</sub>(P(a,b|s,t)- ψ<sup>*</sup>(E<sub>s</sub><sup>a</sup> ⊗ F<sub>t</sub><sup>b</sup>)ψ)<sup>2</sup>. Here, P(a,b|s,t) is the bipartite correlation,  ψ is the state vector, and E<sub>s</sub><sup>a</sup> and F<sub>t</sub><sup>b</sup> are the POVMs. Furthermore, ⊗ is the Kronecker product and <sup>*</sup> indicates the conjugate transpose of a vector. These variables are subject to constraints and some of them can easily be transformed into penalty functions. The matrices E<sub>s</sub><sup>a</sup> and F<sub>t</sub><sup>b</sup> have to be Hermitian positive semidefinite, for which we parameterize them by their Cholesky decompositions. The gradient of this (now unconstrained) problem can be explicitly determined with the use of Wirtinger calculus. This offers an elegant way to determine the gradient of real-valued functions with complex variables. Also, a total description of Wirtinger calculus is also given, including a proof that the gradient indeed points towards the direction of the steepest incline. We use first-order methods like gradient descent with backtracking line search and momentum-based gradient descent to find a minimum solution of the equation. If the cost function converges towards zero, we assume that the variables converge to a correct state and measurement operators.  These methods can find large correlations of approximately 3000 separate variables in 1.5 hours and are able to find many different other correlations and states. The algorithm had some problems finding the operators and state of a family of correlations that had four inputs and two outputs. For some correlations, the algorithms found states and operators of lower dimension than the correlations were build with. ","Bipartite Correlations; Gradient; Gradient descent; Quantum; Bipartite Quantum Correlations; penalty functions; Cholesky decomposition; momentum based; Wirtinger derivatives; Wirtinger; Complex derivatives","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewable energy provides not only environmental benefits but also societal advantages, namely lower carbon emissions/ reducing air pollution and employment.

In addition, developing such infrastructures can cause biodiversity loss and ecosystem change such as habitat loss/change, pollution, overexploitation, climate change and ntroduction of invasive species (Gasparatos et al., 2017). The negative effects of the energy infrastructures can be triggered by almost every renewable energy pathway. Hence, we need to consider the true ‘sustainable’ ways of the renewable energy landscape. <br/><br/>Rotterdam aims to be a carbon-neutral city by reducing 95% of CO2 emissions, and therefore the city introduces various renewable energy systems. In particular, Waalhaven has been a hotspot of many industries regarding renewable energy systems due to its geographical and industrial values. Waalhaven is in a transitional stage of actively altering energy production ways to make the system more sustainable. However, the port area has eight endangered species which are registered in the red list of The International Union for Conservation of Nature. In this regard, one may note that Waalhaven’s plant could produce threats to the current ecosystem. <br/><br/>Based on the above findings, this thesis suggests a spatial framework for a renewable energy landscape that can (1) strengthen the ecosystem, (2) bring robust biodiversity, and (3) provide sustainable energy production methods through utilising local resources. Other cities sharing similar environmental conditions and societal issues may also consider adopting this framework to resolve the problems. The final outcomes and goals present a vision for improving the environment and energy circularity in Waalhaven. The project describes a series of spatial interventions and detailed methods for integrating biodiversity and energy infrastructure and further introduces a scenario to build resilient planning for both human/non-human stakeholders.","sustainable landscape design; renewable energy; biodiversity; Waalhaven; Rotterdam; spatial framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The complex served for educational purposes until 2012 and then was sold by TU for redevelopment.<br/>The ambition of the city of Delft is to increase the housing stock, furthermore, the number of TU campus users has grown significantly in recent years. This brings up a dilemma between densification and quality of life. For these reasons, abandoned or non-used buildings like TU faculty building Gele Scheikunde is envisioned for housing purpose. According to the official regulations and the Commission for Environmental Impact Assessment (MER), there is great potential in this university area to develop an innovative sustainable neighbourhood. Thus, the question that arises is: How to redevelop the former campus buildings?<br/>The goal is to research on how to cope with abandoned campus buildings by including social and ecological values into the transformation and re-adaption design. The approach for the research was to involve stakeholders in the co-creation process. This co-creation process was facilitated through the Minecraft workshop. During the workshop, not only experts (e.g. architects, designers, planners) but also external parties (e.g. neighbours, users, ecologists), decided over the built environment. However, a co-creation approach is not limited to one method. There are various ways to involve stakeholders: interviews, surveys, questionnaires and workshops, with or without heritage games. For this research, a combination of the above was chosen: interviews, surveys and a gaming workshop with Minecraft.<br/>This approach provided information on what is valued in the case study, why it is valued, what should be kept and what can be demolished.

(mentor); Rietbergen, Daphne D. D. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Introduction: In daily practice, at interventional radiology (IR), percutaneous needle placement (e.g. biopsy and ablation) is generally performed under real time guidance of morphological imaging (US or CT). However, in some cases obtaining representative specimen can be challenging causing repeated biopsies or shift to open procedures. And so alternatively, needle placement can occur using computer-assisted needle navigation strategies that rely on pre-interventional images such as (PET-) CT scans. To unravel the impact of needle navigation strategies in addition to the use of ultrasound guidance, we recorded and analyzed the needle- and US-movements during exercises performed in a custom abdominal biopsy phantom.<br/><br/>Methods: custom abdominal biopsy phantom was generated using synthetic ballistic gel, bone-like structures, spherical targets and fiducials for both electromagnetic (EM) and optical tracking. Following administration of a mixture containing 18F-FDG and 99mTcO4- and prior to the needle interventions, the phantom was subjected to PET-CT and SPECT-CT imaging. After presenting them with the 3D imaging data-sets interventions were performed by both novices and experts (n = 20 in total). The exercise comprised of three consecutive steps: 1) US guided biopsy, 2) US guided PET-CT-navigated biopsy (US + Nav), 3) US guided PET-CT-navigated biopsy + virtual needle guidance (US + Nav + NG). Each step was performed on a different target and the exercise continued until the participant was successful. In all cases, we recorded the traveled paths determined in 3D (i.e., x, y, and z) of both the needle and the ultrasound probe. Tracking was realized by using a fiducial-based optical tracking system. Following the visualization of the traveled paths in MATLAB® (the MathWorks, Inc), we used custom software to analyze movement features such as speed, acceleration, jerkiness, straightness index, angular dispersion and curvature and related these dexterity (Dx) scores. We also analyzed missteps such as corrections and retractions and combined these with dexterity features to create decision making (DM) scores.<br/><br/>Results: Analysis of the needle trajectories indicated a decrease of jerkiness for the novices as a result of the additional navigational technologies (US vs Us + Nav + NG; p = 0.033). In this particular group US + Nav influenced both the dexterity and decision making more positively than US + Nav + NG (Dx80(US) = 20.0 (US) vs Dx80(US+Nav) = 5.19 vs Dx80(US+Nav+NG) = 9.73 and Dm80(US) = 3.03 vs Dm80(US+Nav) = 0.446 vs Dm80(US+Nav+NG) = 1.24). For experts, the navigational technologies negatively influenced the dexterity of experts similar but reversed with scores of Dx80(US) = 2.92 vs Dx80(US+Nav) = 12.1 vs Dx80(US+Nav+NG) = 9.33 and negatively influenced their decision making by increasing total pathlength, corrections and retractions (US vs US + Nav; p = 0.035, p = 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively), thus worsening decision making scores (Dm80(US) = 0.0259 vs Dm80(US+Nav) =1.06 vs Dm80(US+Nav+NG) = 1.26).<br/><br/>Conclusion: By recording and analyzing the movement paths of the ultrasound probe and biopsy needle trajectories it has become possible to make an objective value-assessment on the performance enhancement created by computers-assisted navigation strategies. These preliminary findings suggest that technological refinements have a different impact on novices and experts and that increasing the technological complexity can reduce its impact.<br","Navigation systems, Image-guided biopsy, PET, Computer assistance, Performance assessment; Navigation systems; Image-guided biopsy; PET; Computer assistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Even so, though, that doesn’t make it something less shocking, scary, and unwanted. Every time, every summer, the fear of a fire in the forests, in the mountains, in the pastures, a fire that spreads uncontrollably, and that can destroy landscapes, properties, lives, is deeply rooted in the Greek souls. <br/>However, it was, is, and will continue to be a natural part of the ecosystem. Yet, it is the human actions that are responsible for the most destructive, unnatural, fires and wildfires, intentionally or not, directly or not, in the current times. And along with the global problem of climate change, the consequences on all aspects of nature and non-nature are devastating. <br/>One of these most severe wildfires happened in Greece in 2018. The tragedy of Mati, in Eastern Attica, a once green, summery paradise, is recorded as the second-deadliest wildfire event of the 21st century, with 102 people confirmed dead. <br/>And it was this tragic event that changed everything. People were killed, thousands of homes were destroyed, and tens of thousands of acres of forest were burned. Mati will not be the same again. And three years now, the memories are still there, painful memories that are engraved on people’s souls, and recalled by the also battered landscape. <br/>This thesis project focuses on the two traumas that this fire caused, the Human Trauma, the human wound, caused by the fire experiencing, and the loss, and includes the Individual trauma, and the Collective-Community trauma, and the disrupted relationship of people and nature, and the Landscape Trauma, the trauma of the landscape that includes the direct and indirect tangible consequences of the fire, and the indirect tangible landscape degradation, when fires are repeated at relatively short intervals at the same place, and delay its regeneration.<br/>But what is the role of space and design in the healing processes of both traumas?

Yet, the consensus is that dwellings need to be intensively renovated, to provide thermal comfort with low-temperature heating. However, it can be argued that a more affordable renovation with less renovation measures can also provide the same level of thermal comfort as the original situation. To this day, it is unknown what the minimal combination of renovation measures could be. Thus, this research aimed to design combinations of renovation measures, which are both affordable, and are able to provide thermal comfort in Dutch terraced houses. These renovation concepts are referred to as LT-Ready concepts. Hence, the main research question answered in this thesis is: “What combination of renovation measures for residential buildings is affordable and provides thermal comfort when using a lower supply temperature for heating?” First, a literature study is conducted. It investigated the available renovation budget of house owners, as well as thermal comfort, including current guidelines and local comfort aspects. Also, possible renovation measures to enable low-temperature heating were researched. Second, to select the most cost-effective renovation measures, a cost analysis was performed. Using this, renovation concepts were developed and tested with dynamic simulation software. Here, the thermal and energy performance was simulated with an adaption of the ATG-method for dwellings. The renovation concepts included the placement of a ventilation system and additional renovation measures. Results provided a variety of renovation concepts that were LT-Ready within a budget of €10,000. Different scenarios were developed with building or budget limitations, after which the best LT-Ready option was selected. In general, it was concluded that demand-driven exhaust ventilation (C2) or balanced ventilation with heat recovery (D1) is preferable. Wall insulation and replacing windows also showed a large effect on improving thermal comfort and reducing the heating demand. Add-on ventilators can boost thermal comfort, while having only a minimal effect on energy performance. In case no insulation can be applied, LT-radiators are an option to provide thermal comfort. This however increases the heating demand. Additionally, local comfort was investigated for different measures on the room. It was shown that small interventions such as add-on fans and furniture placement could substantially influence the air currents and temperature distribution within the living room. Also a tool which compares the heating demand of a dwelling with the available heating capacity at a lower supply temperature to determine whether a dwelling is LT-Ready, or what combination of measures is needed to make it LT-Ready. The tool is based on ISSO-51 and has a general approach which can be used for every terraced dwelling It can be downloaded from http://ltreadytool.nl. Overall, it can be concluded that there is a variety of possible LT-Ready renovations that provides thermal comfort and is affordable, depending on the specific scenario. It is proven that deep renovations are not essential to provide thermal comfort with low-temperature heating.","LT-Ready; Renovation; Thermal comfort; Low-temperature heating; Dwellings; Affordability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","LT-Ready",""

Self-powered weather stations that use the many WiFi networks spanning the city to transmit their data are a promising solution to increase the amount of data on localized urban climate. Conventional weather stations often measure wind, rain and sun radiance, phenomena that are heavily influenced by the many objects present in an urban environment, which is why they are usually placed outside of the city or on top of buildings. Self-powered weather stations placed on street level can be used to gather data on temperature, humidity, air pollution and noise pollution. If a good trade-off is made between the sensing capacities, the battery capacity and the solar panel size, a weather station like this can do frequent measurements throughout the year, surviving the winter months of low solar panel power generation due to reduced irradiation. In the simulations done for this project, it was found that a simple algorithm that linearly varies the relative measuring frequency of the most power-hungry sensors with the available battery charge greatly improved the average measuring frequency and lifetime of the weather station. Thanks to the increased power budget, additional sensors can be added, such as gas sensors. Furthermore, the weather station can be made more compact and affordable by reducing the size of the solar panel and/or the battery capacity of the weather station.","Weather Station; PV; Solar Powered; WiFi; Pollution; Arduino; Self-sustaining; PM sensor","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","","","","Electrical Engineering","BAP",""

Urban densification<br/>implicates the development of new buildings and redevelopment of part of the<br/>existing building stock, to meet the aims of future cities and their populations.<br/>These alterations to intensively used urban spaces will evoke resistance from<br/>involved stakeholders. As such, this research aims to identify strategies to design buildings without resistance, by studying resistance throughout all phases of a building process and determining the power of architects in coping with these resistances. These strategies enable architects to design and develop buildings of non-resistance. Firstly, the most recurring definition of resistance is that it is an action that is executed against an opposition. The effect of resistance, in the degree of intention, visibility and recognition, varies. This study distinguishes between overt resistance, in which intention and recognition are clearly delineated, and everyday resistance, which cannot be clearly defined, which is often invisible, and not well articulated. The elaboration of resistance in the built environment is shaped by means of a focus group and several expert interviews. Outcomes are that resistance is inseparably linked to the built environment and shapes projects. The interviewee faced both overt resistance and everyday resistance. The strategy that interviewee applied, in response to resistance, can be divided into two categories. Intended strategy, where certain emerging resistances are solved from experience, protocols and premeditation and Emergent strategy, where mostly from an ad-hoc situation is responded to.<br/>Intended strategies for an architect to deal with resistance is mainly focused<br/>on existing, overt resistances. Where everyday resistance is often forgotten.<br/>Where a solution is often sought reactively. This research makes a proposal<br/>to deal with this everyday resistance. Whereby the strategy goes from mostly<br/>emergent to intended. And thus can be anticipated in advance. The proposed<br/>strategy looks for needs and values in the neighborhood. This is done by<br/>making an inventory of specific values of individuals and turning them into<br/>general values. These values are then a starting point to base design decisions<br/>on. It is up to the designer to give his own interpretation. When these values<br/>are adhered to, people may disagree about the elaboration of these values,<br/>but (if all goes well) the result will be in line with the original value of the<br/>environment.The goal with this strategy is to design a building that has as little resistance as possible. Also called a building of ‘non-resistance’. The proposed strategy is explored, further defined and used in a case study of Rotterdam.","resistance; built environment; densification; design strategy; architecture; non-resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","City of the Future","51.915671,4.480960"

Because of these observations, a wireless medical body area network (MBAN) has been proposed, which implements multimodal-data integration and closed-loop seizure suppression. The design and implementation of the MBAN introduces several challenges, such as data collection, seizure prediction and suppression, secure pairing and communication and the design of a user friendly interface.

This to decrease emissions and meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement in an effort to halt the global mean temperature increase. To provide heat to the houses they will need to be heated with electric energy. This heating system is most efficient using lower temperatures therefore the houses will need to have a building envelope which has the right insulation levels. Meaning that a lot of older houses will need to be insulated better and therefore renovated. To reach this goal more than a 1000 house will need to be renovated every day.

It has the potential to be used in a swarm carrying out objectives like exploring planetary surfaces. A new step towards autonomous navigation is made with the newly developed Obstacle Processing ALgorithm (OPAL) using primarily open-source libraries. This study showed that the initial iteration of OPAL could detect rocks and determine their absolute position to the rover’s low-positioned cameras using a stereo vision system. Obstacles and their relative distances are detected using the disparity map—the amount of shift of pixels in the stereo image pair. When translating the disparity to V-disparity, a histogram of the disparity per row, the ground and the obstacle could be isolated. It took six steps to realise this thesis goal.

This test model uses, along with Lunar Zebro’s hardware, mostly Commercial Off-The-Shelf products. With the footage, all the different components of OPAL were integrated into one algorithm. Hereafter, a pipeline on a server was created, and multiple test cases were run to establish results. The predetermined requirements of the algorithm were validated using measuring tape measurements and ground-truth bounding boxes tracked by a CSRT-algorithm.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Pick and place systems that operate in a warehouse setting have been studied a lot recently due to the high economic value for e-commerce companies. In this thesis, the focus is on the perception pipeline that performs object recognition given a certain input data stream (typically RGB-D images). Impressive results regarding object recognition have been reported in the last years, mainly driven by the development of convolutional neural networks. However, only very few proposed perception pipelines are suitable to adapt quickly to recognize new objects. This is considered a problem since large e-commerce companies add many new products to their inventory every day. In this thesis, efforts are made to solve this problem by proposing the use of a neuro-symbolic model in which concept learning is combined with symbolic reasoning. First, visual attributes are obtained from an input image by passing it through the neural part of the model, which consists of two β-Variational Autoencoders. The key element of the model is that the visual attributes can be recognized even if a particular combination of visual attributes have not been in the training dataset. Next, given a knowledge base and the visual attributes as inferred from the input image, a symbolic reasoner infers the most likely object ID. Hereby, the knowledge base is manually constructed and describes the relationships between object IDs and the corresponding visual attributes. The implementation of the neuro-symbolic model is first tested on a synthetic dataset which is similar to the dataset as used in the study that the neural part is based upon. Thereafter, the neuro-symbolic model is tested on real RGB-D images of the pick-and-place dataset and several iterations of the baseline model are evaluated. Hereby, the main research question is formulated as: Can a neuro-symbolic model be used to recognize unseen objects given RGB-D data as typically seen in pick and place scenarios? The best top-1 accuracy score on unseen images of the synthetic dataset was 79.5%. However, using the same neuro-symbolic model on the pick-and-place dataset, the top-1 accuracy score on unseen images was only 25.5%. In the following iterations of the model, the top-1 accuracy score was improved up to 32.4%. Analysis of the results of the pick-and-place experiments shows that the neural part is not very capable of recognizing the correct visual attributes. This likely be due (to some extend) to the simulation-to-real gap. However, further research is required to identify the exact cause(s) of the performance drop. Concludingly, the proposed neuro-symbolic model is capable of recognizing unseen images of the synthetic dataset, but is not very capable of recognizing unseen images of the pick-and-place dataset.","computer vision; robotics; pick-and-place; perception pipeline; zero-shot learning; unseen objects; unknown objects; unsupervised learning; symbolic grounding problem; object recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Within the composites family, discontinuous fiber composites (DFC) started to gain interest in the aerospace and automotive industry, due to their potential for high production rates. In order to make these materials more appealing for real structure applications, their mechanical properties have to be improved and predicted with higher accuracy. This can be achieved by modifying the fiber orientation inside the material so properties such as stiffness and strength can be tailored for the application. The present thesis has focused on the development of different alignment methods and investigation of the effect of the alignment of discontinuous composite tapes on the material properties. The characterization of the alignment methods is performed by quantifying the level of alignment in the manufacturing process with a digital image processing tool. Based on these results, one alignment method is proposed for the manufacturing of specimens for mechanical testing. Besides this, an outlook is given for the implementation of this method into an automated process. Multiple test samples with different tape orientation distributions have been manufactured and tested in order to quantify the effect of tape alignment on the strength and modulus under tensile and shear loading. It is found that aligned DFC have an average tensile strength and stiffness of respectively 96\% and 145\% above the average values of randomly orientated DFC. This research has proved the potential of aligned DFC by showing their enhanced mechanical performance and time-efficient manufacturing cycle. It is intended that the obtained results can help make the use of DFC more appealing for academia, but also for industrial applications in the near future.","Discontinuous Fiber Composites; Thermoplastic composites; Tow Alignment; Digital Image Recognition; Mechanical properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This research considers the optimization of the hyperparameters of this local search algorithm. We take contextual information, based on features of problem instances, into account to construct a mapping from contexts to hyperparameter configurations. General difficulties when considering hyperparameter optimization are the expensive function evaluations of the target algorithm that place a tight budget on the number of possible configurations to query; and noisy observations due to the stochasticity of this algorithm. Therefore, we resort to using Bayesian optimization to construct a surrogate that models our belief of the unobservable objective function. Additional encountered difficulties for this specific problem are heterogeneous problem instances and the underlying problem to be a constraint satisfaction problem (instead of the more commonly studied optimization problem). We show that these difficulties prevent an instance-specific approach and result in a poor generalization from the performance on the training set to test data. We also show that we can improve the performance of the default hyperparameter configuration by proposing strategies to construct portfolios consisting of different configurations.","Surrogate modeling; Bayesian optimization; Hyperparameter optimization; Train unit shunting problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">In this thesis we will for a quantum Markov semi-group (Φt)t≥0 on a finite von Neumann algebra N with a trace τ , investigate the property of the semi-group being gradient-Sp for some p ∈ [1, ∞]. This property was introduced in [12] (see also [9]) and has been studied in [9, 10, 12] for quantum Markov semi-groups on compact quantum groups and on q-Gaussian algebras. Beyond these classes the property gradient-Sp has not been studied; in particular for groups and their operator algebras no (non-trivial) examples were known before this thesis. The main aim of this thesis is therefore to construct interesting examples of quantum Markov semi-groups that possess the gradient-Sp property. The reason why we are interested in constructing such semi-groups, is because they can be used to obtain properties like the Akemann-Ostrand property (AO+) and strong solidity for the underlying von Neumann algebra. Over the last decade, these properties have become a topic of interest and have been studied for several von Neumann algebras, see [3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 23, 32, 33, 37, 41]. In this thesis we shall focus on group von Neumann algebras (L(Γ), τ ) for certain discrete groups Γ that possess the Haagerup property. Namely, for such groups there exists a proper, conditionally negative definite function ψ on Γ. We can then define an unbounded operator ∆ψ on the GNS-Hilbert space L2(L(Γ), τ ) as ∆ψ(λv) = ψ(v)λv and consider the corresponding quantum Markov semi-group (e−t∆ )t≥0. For this semi-group we can investigate for what p it has the gradient-Sp property. In particular we will be considering group von Neumann algebras of Coxeter groups. Namely, a Coxeter group W possesses the Haagerup property by [4], and a proper conditionally negative function ψ on W is given by the minimal word length ψ(w) = |w| w.r.t some set of generators. We will ‘almost completely’ characterize for what types of Coxeter systems the semi-group corresponding to the word length is gradient-Sp. Moreover, in the cases that we get the gradient-S2 property, we obtain the Akemann-Ostand property (AO+) and strong solidity for L(W). Hereafter, we will also consider other quantum Markov semi-groups on L(W). We consider word lengths that arise by putting different weights on the generators, and consider the semi-groups associated to these proper, conditionally negative functions. From this we obtain (AO+) and strong solidity for L(W) for some other cases. Thereafter, we will generalize some of our results obtained for L(W) to the Hecke algebras Nq(W), which are q-deformations of L(W). For the case of group von Neumann algebras L(Γ) for general groups, we shall examine for semi-groups induced by a proper, conditionally negative function ψ, how the gradient-Sp property of the semi-group (Φt)t≥0 := (e−t∆ )t≥0 relates to the gradient-Sq property of the semi-group that is generated by the αth-root ∆α of the generator. Last, we will also show a method that allows us, for right-angled word hyperbolic Coxeter groups, to obtain (AO+) and strong solidity for L(W) without building a gradient-Sp quantum Markov semi-group, but by using a slightly different method.","Quantum Markov semi-groups; von Neumann algebras; Strong solidity; Akemann-Ostrand property; Coxeter groups; group von Neumann algebras; Hecke-algebras","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Future social, economic and technological developments will determine both the amount of electrification as the central or decentral nature of the future supply of electricity. By investigating different reports with scenarios for 2030 and 2050, key uncertainties for the Extra High Voltage (EHV) network can be identified. As of now, no open source model of the Dutch EHV network is available for research. In this thesis a synthetic model of the Dutch EHV network is created from only publicly available data in DIgSILENT PowerFactory. The created synthetic model can be used as a tool to investigate future steady-state power flows considering the sensitivities of the topology, component parameters and different operational scenarios. Besides this, a method is created for generation of future scenarios in Python. Using this model and method, simulations were done to gain key insights into the Steady-State security of the future Dutch EHV Transmission Network. For the case study, it is investigated what the effect of future additions of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) and selected locations of 10 GW installed capacity of electrolysers would be on the Dutch EHV transmission network for 2030.","PowerFactory; Modelling; Dutch Transmission Network; Extra High Voltage; Scenarios; Electrolyser; Steady-State; Renewable Energy Sources; 2030; 2050","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-22","","","","","",""

One design loop for the complete design and the functional / spatial design and one design loop for the technical aspects of the design. These technical aspects are the morphology, hydrodynamics and the structural mechanics. In the end of this thesis, a total integrated design has been made. This design accomplishes the goal of this thesis and suffices the requirements and scores good on the criteria. However, to get to a fully functional and realisable design, more detail needs to be added to the design and the calculations. Some design steps should also be revised because new information is gathered over the course of this thesis.

In current DBS therapy, the stimulation parameters are manually adjusted based on a subjective assessment of patient’s symptoms. State-of-the-art DBS research focuses on recording brain activity to create a patient-specific neuronal profile that correlates with the patient’s symptom-severity. The neuronal profile could then be used as feedback signal for an adaptive DBS system that automatically adjusts the stimulation. The Medtronic PerceptTM is the first commercially available, fully implanted neurostimulator with sensing technology. In this study, the neuronal activity in the form of local field potentials (LFPs) of eleven patients were recorded with Percept during both stimulation off- and on. To obtain a reliable neuronal profile from the LFPs, the signals should be free from electrocardiography (ECG) artefact and should be synchronized with externally recorded data that informs us about the patient’s symptom-severity. A template subtraction method and a method based on independent component analysis were developed to suppress ECG artefact. Both methods were compared to the ECG removal method of the Perceive Toolbox. Three methods of synchronization were explored: externally tapping, using the stimulation artefact, and by ECG cross-correlation. Results show the template subtraction method to most effectively suppress ECG artefacts while preserving LFP frequency content. To save effort but assure accuracy of the synchronization, the ECG cross-correlation method should be applied though validated by confirming accurate alignment of the stimulation artefact. The development and evaluation of the ECG artefact suppression- and external data synchronization methods contribute to research focused on finding a reliable feedback signal for adaptive DBS.","DBS; Movement Disorders; Medtronic Percept; ECG Artefact; Synchronization; Local Field Potentials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Our project's goal is to help the TestCube project improve their plugin. A problem they face is regarding mutating and generating strings for new automated test cases. These strings can be long, random and hard to understand. Hence the question that is being tackled is `How can you design, implement and evaluate an extension to test amplification to generate easier to understand strings?'. To answer this question, first we research to see what other tools are available to mutate/generate strings. Next step, we see how we extend the current TestCube/Dspot plugin with techniques we research. After coming up with an implementation, we evaluate our tool by performing a user study through surveys. These surveys focused on a comparison between the output of TestCube's current approach and output of our approach of generating strings. We then conclude after receiving the results from the surveys that there is an improvement upon the pre-existing way that TestCube/Dpsot mutates strings for test cases at the moment.","Mutation Testing; Automated Testing; Random Strings","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Test amplification is a technique to improve a test suite by generating new tests based on manually written ones. Currently, these generated tests contain much redundant casting. Our study aimed to improve the readability of these generated test cases by reducing superfluous casting. To test this, we developed multiple cast deleters categorized into two types: simple and fine-grained cast deleters. A simple cast deleter removes casts based on limited knowledge but can make errors. A fine-grained cast deleter only removes casts if it knows they are redundant based on much contextual information. We compared these two types in terms of accuracy by gathering statistical data when running them against real-world examples of amplified test cases. We also discussed the types of casting cases for which they performed well or could be improved based on manual code inspections. In this study, when amplifying all the tests of four public repositories, we found 3,085 casts in 281 tests containing casts. Of these, 97.18% were redundant, and our fine-grained deleter detected and deleted 98.87% of these. We found this fine-grained deleter to be the worthwhile option compared to a simple cast deleter. This was not because the simple cast deleter was slightly less accurate at 97.18% rather than 98.80% but because it showed extremely inconsistent accuracy. The second benefit of the fine-grained deleter was that it caused no tests to fail, while the simple cast deleter caused 18.15% of tests to fail. This paper provides excellent insights and techniques to reduce vast amounts of redundant casting in test amplification. We hope it will make test amplification more developer-friendly and increase its overall practicality.","Test Amplification; Casting; test-cube","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In CAD, the coronary arteries, that supply the myocardium with oxygen, are narrowed or even blocked by a process called atherosclerosis. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CAD, as well as for intraprocedural guidance of percutaneous coronary interventions. At this moment, stenosis severity is determined via visual inspection by a cardiologist. This method has several important drawbacks: a significant inter- and intra-rater variability and a high positive prediction bias. Currently available additional assessment techniques improve results, however, they come with prolonged procedural time, complication risks and increased costs. Additionally, a relevant number of syndromes exists that cannot be diagnosed sufficiently with these techniques. Automated software that uses all information within the ICA images and relates it to the context of complaints and outcomes, could be a valuable tool for improvement. Since machine learning (ML) can find relations between patient groups based on images, this could be a possible solution. However, despite promising results, clinical implementation of ML is still limited. Limited clinical applicability of developed algorithms and a lack of large high-quality datasets are the cause of this. In this research it was investigated if ML can help in solving the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges encountered in interventional cardiology (IC) and what is needed to apply ML to ICA images and other sources of coupled medical data. This was done in several steps. First the expectations and perceived barriers by interventional cardiologists on ML-based algorithms in clinical practice were assessed. Next, the feasibility of health insurance code-based querying of electronic health records (EHRs) for the creation of ML datasets was assessed. Third, a proof-of-concept study on creating a dataset and a deep learning network for predicting lesion significance on ICA images was carried out. Last, a roadmap for the curation of data for the development of ML models in IC was created. <br/>Generally, interventional cardiologists have positive expectations for applying ML in their clinical practice. Furthermore, the willingness to collaborate in the development and clinical validation of ML algorithms is high. This is essential for translating ML models to clinical practice. Health insurance code-based querying of EHRs is not a feasible approach for creating datasets for the complex syndromes which currently pose diagnostic challenges in IC. However, the EHRs hold valuable data for the development of ML datasets. The same goes for the data collection strategy in the proof-of-concept study and it was shown that it is feasible to train deep learning networks on this data.<br/>ML shows promising results for solving the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges encountered in interventional cardiology and directions for further research were identified. For the creation of algorithms that can be applied in clinical practice, close collaboration between ML professionals and clinicians is needed. Besides this, further research is needed to develop scalable strategies for the creation of large datasets, containing adequately labelled patients that represent the real-life population.<br","Coronary artery disease; Coronary Angiogram; Machine Learning; Data; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

More precisely, the focus is to automatically detect roof obstacles - such as dormers, chimneys, and solar panels - to be able to determine the available roof surface for new solar panel installation, and therefore to perform more accurate solar potential analysis. For this purpose, three different methods are developed and implemented to increase the results’ accuracy, which are geometry-based, unsupervised, and supervised classification. While AHN3 point cloud and 3D BAG Level of Detail (LoD) 2.2 building models are used for the geometry-based classification, the input data of the unsupervised image classification consists of aerial images and BAG footprints. Finally, supervised image classification method makes use of the aerial images as well as the BAG footprints and a dataset of manually labelled solar panel polygons. The results show that the accuracy of individual methods is not sufficient; therefore, the outputs of all three methods are merged together into one pipeline, with the aim of obtaining one final end product. The latter is the 3D BAG LoD2.2 building model in CityJSON format, enhanced with three new attributes per building: the obstacle area on the roof, the available area for installing solar panels, and a Boolean value showing whether the building has existing solar panels or not. Additionally, an enhanced point cloud for future use is generated, with a new attribute per point indicating its distance to the 3D model and therefore its potential for being an obstacle or not. The assessment of the results with the ground truth illustrates that the algorithm gives promising results; however, the scope of the project can be broadened, and improvements can be made to increase the accuracy as well as the efficiency.","Solar potential; Roof semantics; Point Cloud; Machine Learning; Image Classification; Obstacle detection","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","Synthesis Project 2021",""

Gonçalves, Joana (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Clustering is a commonly used method in data analysis. It is a complex problem that can be very time consuming, especially when clustering large datasets with many features. Most clustering algorithms scale exponentially in time when increasing the dataset size, making it infeasible to use them for large datasets. Streaming algorithms do not have this problem as they will scale linearly. Evolving Local Means (ELM) is a streaming clustering algorithm based on Mean Shift. The ELM algorithm iterates over all data samples in a single iteration, updating an internal structure of clusters with each sample being added. Similar to Mean Shift, ELM requires only one parameter to be provided by the user: the initial radius of a cluster. In ELM, each sample can either be added to the nearest cluster or turned into a new cluster, depending on the distance to the nearest cluster. Clusters that come too close to each other will be merged to form a single cluster. There is one issue with this approach: the decisions are based on an intermediate state that is constantly evolving. This might cause incorrect clustering results when ELM merges clusters together prematurely. This research introduces ELM Decision Branching (ELM-DB) which extends ELM with decision branching. ELM-DB aims to reduce the chance of a premature merge by postponing important decisions. Instead of making a decision directly, it will branch and continue all possible options until the decision can be made. ELM-DB is able to improve clustering performance with only a small increase in runtime and produce consistent results for a larger range of radius settings than ELM.","Clustering; Streaming; Decision Branching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Meanwhile, our needs, demands and desires evolve over time. This makes sustainable development and adaptability more relevant than ever. However, a main problem with adaptability is the additional investment costs against the lack of additional revenues. This lowers the financial return and disincentivizes to invest in adaptable developments. This claim is based on linear financial models that calculate on a rather short-term basis and only take the first function into account. The added value of the possibility to adapt to another function is not included in these financial models yet. <br/><br/>The aim of this thesis is to investigate different approaches towards adaptability and business cases that are needed among long-term owners specifically to incorporate the added value of adaptable features.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented global challenge to social and economic life. This resulted in many corporations struggling for survival and exploring alternative strategic paths (Seetharaman, 2020). Additionally, these remote-work experiences triggered the rethinking of their future office use and space (Cushman &amp; Wakefield, 2020). The strategic execution of the real estate portfolio and the alignment with the business strategy is considered crucial for organizations in order to create maximum added value (Scheffer, Singer and Meerwijk , 2006). As the pandemic is expected to create a new normal and changed the demand for office space, this indicates that the current corporate office portfolio is expected to not be aligned to their future demand. Therefore, the aim of this research is to provide large corporations within different sectors within the Netherlands with a strategy to realign their real estate portfolio to their future post-pandemic priorities. This in order to maintain competitiveness and create a sustainable built environment by addressing the mismatch that could develop overtime. An empirical research is conducted, in which the changes in demand of nine large Dutch corporates with multiple locations in the Netherlands is explored. From this the most relevant priorities are selected to develop a realignment strategy for. The selected priorities of these case studies are: ‘support culture’, ‘increase flexibility’, ‘increase productivity’, ‘increase sustainability’ and ‘increase technology’. As the need for a post pandemic flexible solution has been expressed extensively, flexibility is considered the starting point for this realignment strategy. From this perspective, three different integrated flexibility solutions are developed that reduce core space of the office portfolio. These are ‘working from anywhere’, ‘external co-working’ and ‘internal co-working. Additionally, an assessment framework has been developed to define what combination of solutions contributes most to these selected priorities. Furthermore, the applicability of these solutions have been defined based on portfolio and company characteristics. At last, this strategy is applied on a case portfolio, thereby implementing the two solutions ‘working from anywhere’ and ‘internal co-working’. For this case is concluded that in the short term post pandemic, the amount of core office space will likely not be down- or upsized due to existing leases, but instead a repurposing towards collaboration space within existing offices is proposed. Thereby emphasizing the importance of proactive realignment even more.","Corprorate real estate management; Realignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Dutch municipalities majorly rely on market forces to stimulate redevelopment. Nevertheless, this does not result in desired outcomes. Different researches conclude that the local municipality has to fulfil a leading role in this redevelopment in order to achieve the desired outcome. This research focusses on how this leading role is defined and how the corporation between the local municipality and private property owners can be improved. Therefore, the following research question is formulated; How can the municipal leading role be defined during the redevelopment initiating phase and what improvements can be made in the decision-making process between the municipality and private property owners of retail space for the redevelopment to mixed-use areas? This research consists of a literature research and an empirical research to answer this question. The literature research provides an investigation of the initiative phase of project development, possibilities in organisational structures and the definition of decision-making. The empirical research consist of a case study considering a decaying monofunctional retail area with redevelopment in prospect. Stakeholder interviews are used as the main data source to investigate the project approach, organisational structure and decision-making process between the municipality and private property owners. The most important finding is that a key element of the municipal leading role was the proactive approach to the development of a masterplan for the case area in order to stimulate private stakeholder involvement.","retail space; Structural vacancy; area redevelopment; project uncertainty; organisational structure; decision-making; mixed-use area","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

In addition, the lack of resources and low capacity available accentuates the necessity of considering urban resilience. By exploring the possible relationship between adaptive reuse and collaborative strategies to stimulate the redevelopment of urban environments. In many cases, urban renewal is achieved through current market trends and outdated planning policies. Thus, either neglecting or underusing the existing urban fabric and old building stock. The research focuses on complex urban redevelopment, investigating the adequate long-term policy instrument to revitalize historical port cities. <br/><br/>The research utilizes as a case study the historical port-city of Willemstad, Curaçao, located in the Dutch Caribbean. This case study helps to emphasize the importance of preserving the cultural-historical identity using adaptive reuse of existing buildings and monuments. These heritage buildings offer the experience value of cultural heritage, which can prosper to create an identity or new brand image to the surrounding area. Yet, the implementation of adaptive reuse requires extensive criteria of financial, social and environmental aspects. This research outlines a policy instrument to address these challenges, presenting a co-creation process among stakeholders, by investigating the process of shifting from preserving the heritage buildings through legal protection towards conserving through stimulating redevelopment. Thus, stimulating to serve diverse functions contributes towards urban resilience by adapting to future environmental and socio-economic challenges in the long term. Also, using collaborative strategies between stakeholders as a driving vehicle towards redeveloping into a city that respects the past and represents the needs of today's and future generations. Historical port-cities such as Willemstad showcased the need to be redeveloped sustainably by mitigating economic, environmental, and social tradeoffs. To mitigate future tradeoffs it is vital to enhance the identity of the city by aligning stakeholder goals. Policymakers must provide the basis for a comprehensive and action-oriented approach to stimulate market parties to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which could be linked to positive incentives such as subsidies or tax reductions. By linking the findings from the empirical research to specific SDGs, helped to propose a policy instrument that manages urban resilience and stimulates it throughout diverse built environment scales and projects within Willemstad, Curaçao.<br/><br","urban resilience; urban redevelopment; adaptive reuse; heritage; collaboration; identity; SDG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","12.16960, -68.99000"

Despite these benefits, the application of DT-based CC is still in early development. Several gaps need to be addressed: the lack of information on building the DT model; the fragmented application of the DT concept across the project life cycle; and the lack of a framework in using DT to implement CC. Therefore, this thesis aims to analyze the role of DT and CC in a project's life cycle and to develop a framework for using DT technologies to implement CC. A qualitative methodology is applied in three phases: theoretical research, empirical research, and synthesis. A systematic literature review is conducted to develop the knowledge framework of using DT for CC. Focus groups and a case study are used in integrating stakeholder perspectives in the knowledge framework for practice. In the end, a DT-based CC management framework is proposed for benefiting circular project management.","Digital Twins; Circular construction; Construction Management; Managment framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We will generalise the idea of a convolution and try to find a formula for Fourier coefficients in such way that the coefficients of the convolution can easily be calculated. In the first section we will start off in familiar territory as we work our way through the Abelian groups. On the cyclic groups the comparison with the torus and the Fourier series is easily made and this enables us to easily copy the functions from the Fourier series and use them on our group. We then expand this idea by comparing the other groups to Fourier series on multiple variables. Here we can again copy the functions over and after some calculations we end up with our desired theorems. Then we will continue working on groups in general but sadly for the non-Abelian groups the idea of comparing it to the Fourier series does not work. To remedy this problem we will introduce representations, homomorphisms between the group and invertible matrices. After introducing the concept of a representation we will show some remarkable theorems from Representation theory, such as Maschke’s theorem and Schur’s lemma. With the help of these theorems we can find the irreducible representations, whose matrix entries from an orthogonal basis. These representations are what we will use to transform the convolution into matrix multiplication. In the last chapter we will go into more specifics on the representations of the symmetric group. The representations on this group can be found with the help of the Young tableaux. Among these tableaux we will find the Specht Modules, on which the group action of Sn action will give rise to the irreducible representations. To conclude we will show how to turn these irreducible representations of the symmetric group into matrices.","Representation Theory; Symmetric group; fourier analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The pandemic hampered the growth that could not be accommodated by the infrastructure. In Europe the future of rail looks bright, as it is essential to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, while in the Netherlands, train station areas were recognized as one of the main sites for densification until 2030, which aims to tackle the housing crisis.National ambitions are high, but at the same time there is no coherent national agenda for train stations. Municipalities are competing with each other, and stations acts as hubs of capital allocation rather than catalysts of sustainability transition. This results in growing disparities between small and large stations, and between Randstad and other regions. The disruption of the pandemic gives an opportunity to rethink this unsustainable, neoliberal development model. <br/>The key proposal of this project is to turn around the dominant paradigm of train station areas. Nodes consuming fossil energy and hectic places oriented on business could evolve into hubs of green energy and livable, equitable neighborhoods. The place-node model established by Luca Bertolini (1996) should be reframed by adding the dimension of livability and energy, to address housing and climate crises.<br/>A pattern language was chosen a method to integrate the observations from case studies, experience from practice, insights from literature, create a catalog of patterns - good practices, and apply it to site-specific design. Interrelated patterns forming a language offer more possibilities than a toolbox or a set of principles, and may help with decision-making and defining the program of a station area with multiple stakeholders.<br/>Applying patterns is in fact programming a station area during workshops with relevant stakeholders. Four design scenarios are demonstrating this process and speculating on future-proof train stations. Short-term (2026) and long-term (2040) scenarios were explored in Amsterdam Sloterdijk and Bergen op Zoom. Designs in two different contexts of large and small station were then assessed by the framework developed from Bertolini’s model, in terms of node, livability, place and energy, demonstrating how could development according to a new paradigm look like.<br","Train Station; densification; Pattern language; Energy Transition; Urban Design Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

Only the Bayesian parameter estimation is used, since it is illustrated to be superior, compared to Maximum likelihood estimation, for parameter estimation of statistical models consisting of random fields.

Additionally, the heart rate estimation can potentially be used to detect AF episodes using machine learning. Research has been done regarding an optimal reference signal for the adaptive filtering structure. Accelerometer data, being commonly used as reference signal for the noise did not showgood correlationwith the motion induced artefacts in the signal. Therefore, a reference for the signal component is generated from the PPG itself, which is achieved by applying a narrow bandpass filter. Here the center frequency is determined from an autocorrelation of the signal in a sliding-window. The optimal settings for the sliding window in AF context were found to be 2 seconds with 80% overlap. Furthermore, a comparison is made between NLMS, RLS and Kalman adaptive algorithms, in which RLS showed the best overall performance. The validation of the filtering structure is based on peak detection from the enhanced signal compared with the ECG reference peaks. The results indicates that the system significantly improves the heart rate error in signal disturbed by noise and during AF episodes.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How much capacity will be required? Until when the decision can be postponed? When to expand? What should be the magnitude of expansion? What is the position of such an investment? These are the kind of questions which a port authority is subjected to while making a decision to expand or develop a port. The decision to invest in the expansion of the port is based on the anticipation of the market in future. The port authorities try to bridge the gap between “What the port is doing?” and “What the port should be doing?”. The choice of timing and expansion is of extreme importance as it allows the port authority to ensure that the project is financially viable and at the same time they achieve its objectives. During the feasibility stages, while making these decisions, a static discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to calculate the financial outcomes of the expansion plans. However, such a model gives an impression that the decision-maker is obliged to the expansion decisions and cannot delay or alter their scale of investments. However, the reality is otherwise, the decision-maker is an active manager, who adapts the development/expansion plans to the changes based on the project progress. <br/><br/>The current study presents an alternative to the Predict and Control approach of the static DCF model. This is done using Real Options Analysis(ROA). Within the scope of the research, a conceptual framework for ROA for port decision making was derived. The conceptual framework is translated into a mathematical numerical model for a test case in Southeast Africa. The numerical model values the option of multi-stage capacity expansion for the port. Focus is maintained on incorporating flexibility “on” infrastructure based on timing and magnitude under the uncertainty of demand. Through the use of stochastic processes, Monte Carlo simulations, solution algorithm and sensitivity analysis a total of 96 strategies have been evaluated.<br/><br/>Through the analysis of results, it was understood that flexibility has a monetary value when the expansions are done using multi-stage sequential methodologies. Sequential expansions allow the port authority to gain more information based on which the supply can be adapted. In the short term, rather than installing extra capacity, optimising the current operations has a greater benefit for the port authority. While for the long term, the port authority should hold their flexible options until the boundary value wherein the probability of pay-offs exceeding the initial capital expenditures drastically reduce. The option value was seen to be influenced the time until expiration, lead times, number of stages of expansion, modal split factor and dwelling times. ROA was seen to be more of a decision support tool to understand the position of the investment rather than a financial valuation model.","Real options analysis; Uncertainty Analysis; Stochastic modelling; Probabilisitic Analysis; Value of flexibility; Case Study Research; Cpacity expansions; Financial modelling; Port Infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-29","","","","","",""

This thesis presents a feasibility study on the use of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel assisted electrolysis (SOFEC) for hydrogen production on an industrial scale. The biogas is supplied as a source of hydrogen to the anode of the solid oxide electrolyser where hydrogen gets oxidised and provides electrons for the steam splitting taking place at the cathode. This results in upgrading of biogas to hydrogen and reduction in the electrical power demand. However, steam reforming of biogas (methane) is an endothermic reaction and hence,<br/>heat has to be supplied externally.<br/>The SOFEC system is modelled in Cycle Tempo and the modelling results are used to perform the feasibility study based on technical, economic and social aspects. Further, to corroborate the results from the study, a case study scenario of integration of SOFEC in a steelmill is presented.<br/>With regard to technical aspects, the SOFEC cathode and electrolyte materialswere found to be in practice commercially, adequate biogas supply could be ensured by biogas production at waste water treatment plants and heat supply from high temperature waste heat sources was proposed to meet heat demand of methane reforming. Based on these conditions, the SOFEC system has high prospect of being technically feasible.<br/>Further, for economic analysis, the net production cost of SOFEC was estimated to be less than 4.5 Eur/kg H2 which is lower than that of low temperature (7.32 Eur/kg H2) and high temperature electrolysis (5.54Eur/kg H2). Considering high temperature heat, recovered from molten slags in steel mills, being used as heat supply followed by a predicted drop in electrolyser capital costs, the SOFEC is able to compete with lower production costs of steam methane reforming (3 Eur/kg H2). Thus, low electrolyser capital costs and availability of low cost waste heat supply are the main driving factors for SOFEC to be economical.<br/>In social aspects, the operational safety and social acceptance of SOFEC were investigated. It was concluded that for hydrogen storage challenges, existing commercial hydrogen storage solutions can work and with hydrogen fuel cells being socially accepted, the SOFEC was assumed to be accepted the same. Also the SOFEC was shown to have low CO2 (2 kg CO2 equivalent / kg H2) and low SO2 emissions provided sufficient desulfurisation of biogas is done. Therefore, it is concluded that the SOFEC has high potential to be socially feasible.<br/>Although, the SOFEC has been presented to be a feasible technology, uncertainties<br/>such as degradation in performance due to interruptions in biogas supply, absence of anode materials which can withstand reducing environments, absence of low cost high temperature heat and high costs of electrolyser systems are obstacles which have to be resolved.","Fuel Cell; Electrolysis; Solid oxide fuel cell; Fuel assisted Electrolysis; Feasibility assessment; Electrolyser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the algorithm suspects AF, a limb lead I ECG recording is requested from the user. The ECG recording can be analyzed by a clinician for official diagnosis. The Maxim Integrated Max86150 chip is used for the implementation of PPG and ECG. Acceleration data is gathered by means of the Adafruit MMA8451 accelerometer to allow for detection of motion artefacts. These sensors and the data they retrieve are controlled and processed by the ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller. From the results, PPG recordings have a higher quality when infrared light is used as compared to when red light is used.

AF is characterized by the rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart, which can cause lead to strokes and other heart-failures. To prevent these consequences the early detection of AF is paramount. Using photoplethysmography (PPG) heart activity can be measured from which the inter-beat-interval (IBI), the time between heart beats, can be estimated. Using data collected by a PPG sensor the aim is to classify the heart activity as either AF or Normal Sinus Rhythm in real time using machine learning and collect the outcomes for further analysis by medical professionals. For this a classification method is suggested which is able to be implemented on an ARM based processor. Using a Support Vector Machine and 10 features derived from the IBI's and the PPG signal this algorithm achieves the following accuracy metrics: balanced accuracy = 0.853, sensitivity = 0.850, specificity = 0.856 and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) = 0.643.

The Smart Teddy is a project founded in 2018 by a research team of the Hague University of Applied Sciences. It is an interactive, companion robot - disguised as a toy dog - that serves as a therapeutic promoter while simultaneously monitoring the quality of life of the senior with pre-determined indicators. It consists of a Teddy to provide the interaction with the user and a Base Station for data processing and charging of the mount-in battery of the Teddy. The Power Operations and Distribution group carried out research on and developed suitable solutions to supply power to the Teddy with rechargeable batteries, to integrate controlled wireless charging of the battery for user-friendliness and to provide a streamlined power distribution throughout the Smart Teddy’s system. Based on an iterated program of requirements and a power budget analysis on the set of installed electronics, a design is implemented for the power system of the Smart Teddy. A design sequence is followed consisting of four stages: (1) battery selection, (2) charger selection, (3) power conversion and distribution, and (4) safety and failure protection. A power system is developed for the Smart Teddy that is able to supply power with lithium-ion batteries with a battery life of at least 12 hours providing a battery capacity of 25.16 Wh. Thereafter, the installed batteries located in the Teddy can be charged wirelessly by placing the Teddy on the Base Station (a dog bed) to reinforce the less robot-like and a more natural look of the Teddy. Furthermore, this system ensures that all electronic modules with different operating voltages and current draws are provided with the necessary power specifications through power-sharing paths and the usage of power converters. Lastly, safety measures and failure protection methods are developed to ensure the safety of the user through the usage of fuses, switches and, cable and PCB management. The design has been verified using the appropriate verification methods where the program of requirements is used as a guideline and assessment tool. The Power Operations and Distribution is largely complying with the program of requirements and is performing according to the predetermined functionalities. Consequently, the power system of the Smart Teddy is integrated in a real, spatial prototype, namely in a toy dog (the Teddy) and its dog bed (the Base Station).","dementia; wireless charging; therapeutic robot; companionship; power system; safety; lithium-ion battery","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Smart Teddy",""

The H2GO project is a project that researches the role green hydrogen can fulfill in our society through eight different scalable sub-projects. One of these projects is making the local fishing fleet of Goeree-Overflakkee CO2 neutral. Due to technical limitations, adaptations to make the fishing vessels CO2 neutral will not be possible for the coming years. For the shorter term, the project is therefore also looking for different ways to make the fleet more sustainable. A substantial polluting factor for this type of fishing vessels is the refrigeration unit, used to cool the freshly caught fish. A technology, called thermally driven metal hydride cooling, shows potential to provide an alternative for the current refrigeration system. In this thesis, the technical feasibility is explored of replacing the conventional ice slurry machines that fishing vessels currently employ with this technology. In order to do this, a literature review on different types of metal hydrides and the state-of-the-art on metal hydride cooling systems has been conducted. After this, a numerical model is presented and validated with an equivalent model and experiments. The model shows good similarity regarding overall system performance compared to the experiments. Finally, a metal hydride cooling system, containing another low temperature metal hydride is proposed that is capable of achieving a cooling capacity of 16 kW at a cooling temperature of -10 to -20 ◦C. This leads to the conclusion that the system has some efficiency drawbacks, but that the metal hydride system is technically feasible for use in the fishing vessels at Goeree-Overflakkee. This, in return, reveals a significant opportunity for employing this new technology to lower the environmental impact of the Goeree-Overflakkee fishing fleet.","Metal hydride; refrigeration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

In the Base station, a mmWave sensor is implemented that tracks the position, velocity, and direction of the persons present in the room. Also, a processor is implemented that gathers and stores the data from the mmWave sensor and the data from the Teddy which is sent via a LoRa connection. In addition, the designed system can store the collected data for more than one week. The collected data can be used by an expert in dementia to extract meaningful information about dementia progress, after that, an expert in digital signal processing is needed to develop algorithms that estimate the quality of life of a senior suffering from dementia.","Dementia care; Data Acquisition; Sensors; mmWave; Monitoring system; non-intrusive; Social Robotics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","The Smart Teddy",""

Recent advances in light­-emitting diode (LED) technology have brought UV LEDs to the consumer market. These offer many advantages over traditional gas­-discharge lamps, allowing UV radiation to be generated with higher reliability in a much smaller form factor. In this thesis, the design of a portable battery­-powered sterilizer based on UV LEDs is described. The sterilizer is intended for the sterilization of personal items such as mobile phones, face masks, and keys.<br/><br/>The design of the sterilizer consisted of two parts: the LED array and the LED driver. For their design, a model­-based approach was taken to ensure high performance and low cost. For the LED array, a radiometric model was developed and applied in an optimization procedure. The design of the LED driver was based on an analytical loss model in MATLAB and LTspice simulations. <br/><br/>The UV LED array provides a radiant power of 113 mW to the disinfection area, resulting in an irradiation dose of 195 μW/cm2. This allows for more than 99.9% disinfection in less than 15 min. The LED driver is a boost converter operating at 750 kHz in the discontinuous conduction mode. This converter supplies the array with a nominal input power of 4.3 W at a simulated efficiency of 91%. <br/><br/>The design of the LED driver is verified with a prototype.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis describes the design process of a new instrument that can be used to perform a fetal aortic valvuloplasty procedure. Congenital heart defects occur in 8 to 12 out of every 1000 live births. Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common congenital heart defects. When AS occurs, the opening and closing of the aortic valve does not work well. This is often caused by two leaflets being fused together. If left untreated, aortic stenosis could have severe consequences such as the development of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). To prevent this, the fetal aortic valvuloplasty (FAV) procedure is performed. In this procedure, a balloon catheter is advanced percutaneously into the fetal heart at   26 weeks of gestation. The problem with this procedure is that still many complications occur, of which some can be attributed to the used instruments. The currently used instruments are designed for an angioplasty procedure in adults, and therefore quite large. This led to the need for the design of a dedicated device for FAV, which was the goal of this thesis. The thesis started off with a literature study and clinical interviews to determine the design focus, requirements and wishes. It was found that reduction of cannula diameter reduces the risk of complications, which therefore became the aim of this project. Currently an 18G cannula is used, which has an outer diameter of 1.27 mm. It would however be preferable to use a 20G cannula, which has an outer diameter of 0.91 mm. The 18G cannula is now required due to the crossing profile of the balloon that is used, which does not fit through a smaller needle. The crossing profile of a balloon refers to the maximum diameter found between the proximal and distal end of the balloon catheter, while it is still folded. To be able to use a smaller needle, this crossing profile needs to be reduced. Therefore, it was determined that the design focus should be on reducing the crossing profile of the balloon catheter, while still being able to reach the required diameter at inflation. After exploring multiple ideas and concepts, the final concept was generated. This concept is based on the fact that the FAV procedure requires other balloon properties than an angioplasty procedure. Less pressure is required, the procedure is performed under ultrasound instead of x-ray guidance and the guidewire does not have to be changed and used for complex steering. Based on these differences, several design choices were made that lead to a smaller crossing profile and enhance the performance of the FAV procedure. Amongst others, this new design contains a fixed guidewire, longer cones and a low wall thickness. Multiple prototypes were developed for testing and validation, which was done on both clinical and mechanical level. The clinical tests gave insights regarding preferred shape and configuration, and established that there was enough control and steerability provided with the fixed guidewire. The mechanical tests provided information regarding the force exerted by the balloon, (burst) pressure and diameter of the balloon. The prototypes had crossing profiles of around 0.6 mm, which is a significant reduction compared to the crossing profile of 0.8 mm of the current balloon. This allows for the use of a 20G cannula instead of an 18G cannula, which has an outer diameter that is almost 0.4 mm smaller. The final design fulfilled all requirements and wishes, and therefore a proof of principle for a suitable alternative instrument for the FAV procedure was provided. Further research is recommended concerning the production of a more accurate prototype and elaborate clinical testing to optimize the design and gain more insights in the behaviour of this balloon.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-29","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

However, this changed after the 1960s when the shopping window passages were closed, views through the windows were blocked and escalators were installed. To make matters worse, the store went bankrupt in 2016, which meant that the shops also literally had to close. However, this large and flexible building at a prominent location in the centre of Haarlem asks for a re-design to open up the building. When researching the department store, it was noticeable that although Haarlem is a city surrounded by green, the centre lacks this quality. Therefore the design tries to open up the building by creating space for learning, social encounter and biodiversity. This is done on the ground floor by bringing back the window passage halls as an intermediate space between city life and the interior of the department store. In this way, these shopping window passages open up the department store by blending the outside with the inside and enhancing flows of mobility. In addition, a butterfly garden is installed in the core of the building, which opens up the building by maximizing views, inviting more natural daylight and integrating green. Also, large squares are installed on the higher floors, which open up the building due to the mixed and diversified programme. Lastly, the use of the roof and balconies is encouraged by adding green spaces to the building.","heritage & architecture; department stores; Vroom & Dreesmann; biodiversity; green architecture; opening up; butterfly garden; Haarlem; 20th century heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Spatial Building Typology","52.37957462126848, 4.633069370121007"

(mentor); Khademi, S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Three-dimensional building models play a pivotal role in shaping the digital twin of our world. With the advance of sensing technologies, unprecedented data acquisition capabilities on capturing the built environment have surfaced, with photogrammetry and light detection and ranging being the two important sources, both of which can acquire point clouds of buildings. A point cloud is anisotropically distributed in space, which---though conveying spatial information itself---has to be converted into a surface model for a wider spectrum of usage. This conversion is often referred to as reconstruction. Despite the enhanced availability of point cloud data in the built environment, how to reconstruct high-quality building surface models remains non-trivial in remote sensing, computer vision, and computer graphics. Most reconstruction methods are dedicated to smooth surfaces represented by dense triangles, irrespective of the piecewise planarity that dominates the geometry of real-world buildings. Although some works claim the possibility of reconstructing piecewise-planar shapes from point clouds, they either struggle to comply with specific geometric constraints, or suffer from serious scalability issues. There is no versatile solution yet for building reconstruction. In this thesis, we propose a novel framework for reconstructing compact, watertight, polygonal building models from point clouds. Our approach comprises three functional blocks: (a) a cell complex is generated via adaptive space partitioning that provides a polyhedral embedding as the candidate set; (b) an implicit field is learnt by a deep neural network that facilitates building occupancy estimation; (c) a Markov random field is formulated for surface extraction via combinatorial optimisation, where an efficient graph-cut solver is applied. We extensively evaluate the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods in shape reconstruction, surface approximation and geometry simplification. Experimental results reveal that, with our neural-guided strategy, high-quality building models can be obtained with significant advantages over fidelity, compactness and computational efficiency. The method shows robustness to noise and insufficient measurements due to occlusions, and generalise reasonably well from synthetic scans to real-world measurements. Moreover, our method remains generic to not only buildings, but any piecewise-planar objects.","3D reconstruction; Compact building model; Point cloud; Deep neural network; Implicit field","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Usually, municipalities aim to recover the costs of these services from developers that initiate projects that benefit from these services. Many countries have implemented various value capturing instruments to be able to achieve this. However, only fragmented data is available about the use of financial contributions from developers in practice. This study focuses on the situation in the Netherlands and researches whether negotiated financial contributions are mentioned in municipal policy reports and if these are incorporated in development agreements. The research provides insight into the use of financial contributions and the results of its usage in practice. Although the legislation in the Spatial Planning Act on cost recovery is extensive, the practice of recovering above-plan costs is messy. Different types of above-plan costs are used inconsistently and interchangeably in various municipal policies. The policy analysis conducted for 50 municipalities shows that only few municipalities have stated a cost allocation for financial contributions and indicated explicit contribution sums. Municipalities can have different approaches towards the allocation of costs for off-site works, whereby some policies are more detailed than others. The contributions for above-plan costs that are mentioned have a broad bandwidth, in height and type of investments. With case studies, the implementation of these policies is analysed. The research shows that financial contributions are an important topic in negotiations in some municipalities, while others barely negotiate on it and incorporate the stated contributions from their policy in almost all development agreements. Municipalities are willing to lower contributions if developers can show their project becomes infeasible by them. It then depends on project characteristics if contributions or lowered or weaved entirely. Most municipalities do not expect that the new Environment and Planning Act, which introduces publicly enforceable financial contributions, will result in more received contributions, although they think the new legislation could potentially improve their negotiation position. This research has provided an overview of how municipalities deal with financial contributions in practice and has thereby contributed to the knowledge on the implementation of cost recovery policies in the Dutch context.","Netherlands; Land policy; Value capture; Developer contributions; Development agreements; Cost recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Yu, H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The pond is a low-lying ground intended to retain or detain both stormwater. In the past, building ponds was a common way to keep fresh water for livestock and irrigation. Due to the rapid urban development and the emergence of centralized water conservancy facilities, the traditional ponds have largely disappeared. One of the crucial examples of disappearing ponds is in Taoyuan Tableland, in the North of Taiwan. After economic development and the demographic boom, the number of ponds rapidly declined from 4521in 1904 to 745in 2020. (Yu, 2017) The phenomenon weakens the resilience of cities in the face of extreme weather conditions. When heavy rain comes, covered ponds lose water storage space, resulting in flooding, and when it has not rained for a long time, they can only rely on reservoirs for water supply. Therefore, this project explores the design interventions with landscape architecture, incorporating with the existing ponds, making the city more climate adaptive and enhancing public space quality.<br/><br/>Under rapid urbanization, the land use in the Taoyuan area is divided into urban and peri-urban areas. The test area includes the emerging urban area and the surrounding peri-urban areas. The applied design principles are robust, reflective, and flexible. The first principle focuses on integrating a robust pond system as a mediator between drought, too little, and flood, too much water. Reflective aims to ponds in the emerging urban area and the peri-urban area as models and transform traditional characteristics of the pond into four guiding design strategies: topography, hydrology, vegetation, and recreation. The ponds can transform into a pleasant public space through these strategies. Lastly, from a large scale, integrated pond water systems to individual ponds can be flexible to the changing circumstances. Sometimes, the ponds can be full of water, dry, and be a wonderland for people.<br/><br/>By reviving the pond system in the urban network, the project's tangible quality is making the city more resilient. On the other hand, the intangible quality gives withering traditional water systems an important role and re-overlap with people's living spaces.","Landscape architecture; Research for design; Strategy; regional landscape; rural area; urban area; public space; scale continuum; water systems; green structures; ecosystems (flora and fauna); climate adaptation; resilience; ponds; Taoyuan Tableland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The pandemic overwhelmed hospitals and forced rapid and radical changes in healthcare organizations' working practices and management structures (MASS Design Group, 2020; Ramboll, 2021; Capolongo et al., 2020). The virus led to unfamiliar environments, new spatial configurations of hospitals were necessary to cope with the surge capacity, new protocols and strategies were fundamental to respond to the crisis. Past pandemics have occurred, and other infectious diseases and viruses might come. COVID-19 is not going to be the last challenging situation for the health sector. Thus healthcare systems could become more resilient. Hospitals need to be resistant to future outbreaks, maintaining and adapting critical functions during crises (Ramboll, 2021). It is essential to learn from the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic to be more prepared for future events.<br/>This practice-based research aims to gain insight into the pandemic experience to provide recommendations to future-proof hospital design. A qualitative approach is proposed for this study. First, through a general questionnaire, information on building adaptations and working practices of hospitals in the Netherlands during the pandemic was assessed. Then follow-up in-depth interviews with chosen facility and real estate managers that answered the survey would be conducted to reflect on the crisis period and understand the decisions and choices taken regarding planning, design, and engineering during the different waves in the country's hospitals.<br/>According to findings, the pandemic in the Netherlands increased cohesion and collaboration between healthcare organizations. The national government advised the coordination of the emergency response, and the decisions within each organization were driven by independent Crisis Management Teams (CMT). Clear guidance facilitated the decision-making process of the measures and services that needed to be implemented. In general, hospitals felt well prepared for the pandemic, although changes and improvements were made regarding building, technical and employee-focused modifications to respond to the surging demand of covid-care.<br/>Additionally, an analysis considering three spatial characteristics of hospitals: type, building year, and urban density, was done to determine if there was a distinction in the measures taken. It was found that most hospitals implemented some top measures and that there is also some differentiation between groups of hospitals. Based on the findings and the lessons learned from the interviews, some suggestions for future renovations and developments were made. Recommendations could help build up towards future-proof facilities to a virus-like COVID-19 increasing spatial flexibility, robustness and adaptive capacity of healthcare buildings.","Future hospital design; COVID-19 pandemic response; Hospital characteristics; Building interventions; Technical interventions; Employee-focused measures; adaptability; flexibility; Robustness; Healthcare resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Keusters, Guus (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The aim of this research was to investigate if and how the project performance of integrated construction projects can be improved by focussing on empathy during the preconstruction phase. Big infrastructural construction projects often face a poor project performance which causes the sector is aimed at searching for strategies to deal with this. Looking at what drives project success it is said the people involved and their competences are main factors of influence. These people need to integrate working processes and collaborate with each other to successfully deliver the project. Experiences from practice and a literature review resulted in a strong expectation that especially the competence empathy is important to this in construction projects. This would be important during the preconstruction phase in specific to support the alignment and integration between project team members. The research focusses hereby on the preconstruction phase of integrated construction projects and follows the Integral Project Management (IPM) structure to describe the structure of construction project teams. Empathy is defined as ‘the ability to understand and share the feelings of another’. The research adopts a difference in internal empathy ( = empathy between people within the project organization) and external empathy (= empathy with the client and/or stakeholders). <br/><br/>The research first investigated in interviews with experts from the industry if and where during the preconstruction phase it would be important for the involved people to be empathic. Second the empathic ability of a construction project organization has been measured to indicate how empathy is distributed across project participants. The results showed that the construction professionals on average score low on empathic competence and that in certain situations it would be important for project participants to be empathic for a good project outcome. This results in a gap in the construction sector between required empathy and actual empathic competence which demonstrates there’s room for improvement in this area.<br/><br/>Based on the results of the research it seems that the project performance of integrated construction projects can be improved by focussing on stimulating more empathy between client and contractor and towards stakeholders during the preconstruction phase (= external empathy). Especially in the relationship between client and contractor there’s room for improvement as there’s a gap in required empathy of the contractor. The reason that the performance of construction projects can be improved via external empathy is that when looking at what mostly causes projects to perform badly, it is said this is often related to a bad collaboration between client and contractor and/or insufficient involvement of stakeholders. The research results also showed that project performance can be improved by focussing on stimulating more empathy internally in the project organization within teams and between people from different disciplines. However, this has a lower effect on improving the performance of the project compared to stimulating external empathy. The research finally presents The Empathy Framework as a recommendation for the construction sector to be used as a strategy to improve project performance via empathy.<br","Empathy; Project performance; Collaboration; Construction Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, the average time a United Nations (UN) planned refugee camp functions, is seventeen years. This temporal disparity is not necessarily a problem on its own, however during these protracted situations the need for normalcy, perspective and especially dignity grows. <br/>Besides a reduced level of livability, a lack of dignity also leads to both physical and psychological health issues. This leads to the main aim of this project, namely, to enhance dignity in planned camps. Taking the mandate of the UNHCR into account, the focus will be on UNHCR planned refugee camps. Based on a literature review conducted in the theoretical framework, the premise of this graduation project is that dignity is positively influenced by self-determination, which in turn is enhanced by spatial self-determination and (informal) economic activity in a situation where first needs (e.g. food, water, shelter) are met. This results in the main research question: “How can a modular framework of interventions enhance a sense of spatial self-determination and foster (informal) economic activity in UNHCR planned refugee camps while maintaining a non-permanent character and remaining adaptable to scale changes?”. This question will be answered through eight sub-questions that reflect the different phases of the iterative ‘analysis-design process’ of this project. In this process four methods will be used to answer these questions by providing insight in the involved concepts, current practices and how (informal) economic activity and/or spatial self-determination is improved in other (urban) contexts. These methods are: a literature review, a best case review, interviewing and a multiple case study (using the Syrian Conflict as umbrella case). <br/><br/>The final product of this graduation project will consist of two perspectives, a flow-related perspective and a spatial design perspective. With regard to the flow-perspective, a guiding principle for each UNHCR camp construction phase to enhance foremost (informal) economic activity and to a lesser extend spatial self-determination is presented. Besides, a strategy consisting of multiple modular interventions on how to implement each of them is included, using Qushtapa Refugee Camp as test-case. With regard to the spatial perspective, three frameworks of design-principles are given. Each framework enhances (informal) economic activity and/or spatial self-determination in the context of a UNHCR planned refugee camp on a specific scale (communal scale, block/sector scale and camp/settlement scale). Regarding all three frameworks, a design is made in Qushtapa Refugee Camp, including a strategy on how to implement them throughout the standard UNHCR phases, to test and illustrate the design principles. Both perspectives have a modular nature. However, they also have multiple interfaces and can be integrated into one another. <br/><br/>In general, all proposed interventions are deemed realistic by an expert panel and regarding three different topics, material wise, labor wise and with regard to the UNHCR-Mandate and UNHCR standards. Last, since the UNHCR strives to provide the same ‘service’ everywhere, the proposed principles and designs, may also be applicable in other cases than cases relating to the Syrian conflict.","Dignity; spatial self-determination; economic activity; UNHCR; refugee camps; spatial interventions; flow related interventions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The introduction of autonomous and stimulated autogenous self - healing of concrete cracks has been a wonderful technological breakthrough for our built infrastructure. By reducing manual dependence on repair and maintenance activities on concrete public structures, the application of self-healing can potentially save millions in public economy. However, despite the existence of a large body of research on the domain, the judgement to choose one out of several potential strategies to effectively heal a crack is still met with heavy contestation. Currently, the approach to biologically heal a crack by promoting bacterial precipitation of Calcium Carbonate crystals, is deemed the most environment friendly of all. Research on this has proved that this approach is indeed successful in closing cracks up to at least 0.4mm. However, the bacteria responsible for the precipitation is dependent on the constituent precursor and the nutrients of the healing agent. The bacterial precursor that has been successfully applied so far in OPC cementitious composites is often based on lactic acid derivatives, that involve substantial costs in its production process. Recent studies have also demonstrated some incompatibility of the same precursor on low pH environments, such as that characterised by the addition of supplementary cementitious materials like blast furnace slag. For instance, a higher dosage of the lactic acid based precursors lead to negative effects in strength in blast furnace slag cements. In the Netherlands, CEMIII/B (slag cements) finds reason- ably larger market share than OPC cements. As such, the incompatibility of lactic acid based bacterial self-healing agents presents a discouraging scenario. <br/><br/>Polyhydroxyalkanoates or PHA extracted from waste streams, have been suggested to be a low cost biodegradable polymer that can effectively replace high cost polymers such as PLA (poly lactic acid). It is also established in recent literature, that PHAs can be metabolically converted by bacterial species to form Calcium Carbonate. Besides, unlike the PLAs, these are hypothesized to be applicable in higher dosages in even low pH environments. Taking these into consideration, the current study delves into the potentials of this possible new alternative for bacterial precursor. Scientific questions and objectives based on the probable effects of the PHA on functional properties, healing efficiency, durability, sustainability and economy, were explored. It was found through a number of experimental and analytical data, that the new healing agent demonstrates ample promise to be used as an effective healing precursor for the bacterial self-healing of cement based applications. This holds true in both OPC and Slag rich cement types. With this, numerous novel possibilities are now open for further research into the large - scale application of PHA based self-healing.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials across the world. Although, the traditional construction techniques are being improved for efficiency, cost and material optimization, there are disadvantages as well, such as the use of formwork, highly labourintensive and limited architectural freedom for design and material savings. 3D printing of concrete structures is one of the emerging technologies promising the automation in construction industry. However, 3D printed concrete structures pose higher risks of shrinkage as compared to the conventional concrete structures due to their different construction techniques and material composition. Shrinkage can raise issues such as reduction in strength of the structures, poor durability and aesthetically unpleasant structures. The research aims to study the shrinkage behaviour of the 3D printing concrete mixture in different restrained and curing conditions. Based on the experimental data, a finite element model has been developed to predict the shrinkage behaviour over time. The free shrinkage test was performed on cast samples and 3D printed samples of dimensions 160x40x40 mm3. The specimens were kept in two curing conditions: covered with plastic sheet and (2) uncovered or exposed to environment from the time of casting. The shrinkage behaviour was studied for up to 60 days at relative humidity of 65% and temperature 20°C. A higher shrinkage values as compared to normal and highperformance concrete is observed in both 3D printed and cast samples. The 3D printed samples showed a higher shrinkage of 1518% as compared to cast samples due to the 3D printing processes. Restrained ring test were performed for three curing conditions: (1) exposed to environment, (2) covered with plastic sheet and (3) sealed with waterproof tape. The sample exposed to drying cracked within 3 days followed by covered with plastic sheets in 4 days and the specimen in third condition cracked within 8 days. The experiment indicated that the autogenous shrinkage is so high in the concrete mixture to induce shrinkage cracking. A finite element model has been developed to simulate the shrinkage behaviour of the concrete mixture based on the experiment results of the free shrinkage test of cast specimens. The capillary tension approach has been used as the theoretical framework. It uses the KelvinLaplace equation to calculate the capillary stresses and the Bentz deformation model to calculate the corresponding shrinkage strain. It is applicable for ambient relative humidity of more than 40%. The required input for the model are: degree of hydration over time, elastic modulus and distribution of relative humidity over time. The degree of hydration has been calculated using HYMOSTRUC software. The experimental results of the free shrinkage test for cast samples have been simulated in ANSYS. An inverse analysis has been used to obtain the material parameters required to model the moisture diffusion process. Transient heat equation has been used to model the diffusion process. Since the concrete mixture has a low watercement ratio, the effect of autogenous shrinkage has been taken into account as well. The calibrated finite element model gave an error of 810% as compared to the experimental results. The moisture profile obtained from the model has been compared to an analytical model to validate the model. It shows good agreement, especially for upto 28 days. Finally the developed finite element model has been applied on three case studies to assess the accuracy of the model. First, the restrained ring test has been simulated to validate the model based on the prediction of the cracking time. It showed that to accurately predict the shrinkage induced stresses, the creep and the relaxation phenomenon plays a crucial role as well. Second, the model has been used to simulate the shrinkage in a 3D printed flower pot restrained at varying time. Third, a parametric study has been designed using the developed model. Overall the study concludes that the shrinkage in 3D printing concrete mixture is quite high as compared to the normal concrete even if conventionally cast. The 3D printing processes can increase the shrinkage further. The developed finite element model can be used as a tool to estimate the shrinkage strain.","Shrinkage; 3D printing concrete (3DCP); FEM simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","","","","","",""

For M2M communication, IoT devices need to be able to authenticate each other. However, IoT devices cannot take over traditional authentication mechanisms. This problem is due to the expected growth in the number of IoT devices and the varying resource capabilities of these devices. In this work, we introduce Bubblechain, a generic, decentralised, and scalable IoT authentication system. In contrast to existing works, Bubblechain can update and remove identities of IoT devices that allows them to authenticate each other in a dynamic setting. Bubblechain also creates a higher trust level for devices that belong to the same Bubble. A Bubble refers to a group of devices that belong together, such as a home or office setting.

In practice, elderly frequently use compensatory arm-strategies in sit-to-stand. However, the specific advantages of these compensatory strategies are unclear. The focus of this research is to study the influence of thigh push-off, a common compensatory strategy, on the stability of sit-to-stand for both the young and elderly. Motion data was retrieved from 50 young and elderly participants who performed sit-to-stand with and without thigh push-off. To mimic realistic daily-life strategies, participants were not restricted in sit-to-stand style in any way but arm-use. The experimental sit-to-stand data was fitted to a pendulum model with feedforward and feedback control to simulate the stability limits of the observed sit-to-stand strategies. The model allows us to explore stability limits without the need of perturbation. For each arm-strategy and participant a stability basin, i.e. all potential trajectories of motion, was formed. We compared the stability basins between arm-strategies and between age-groups. The size of the computed stability basin for thigh push-off was larger than for no arm push-off implicating thigh push-off is a more stable sit-to-stand strategy. The difference between arm strategies was larger for the elderly than for the young participants. Overall, the stability basins of the elderly were larger compared to those of the young participants, for both arm strategies. The resulting stability basins suggest that thigh push-off increases the stability of sit-to-stand and thus could indeed be an effective compensatory strategy. Stability basin shape differences indicate that without thigh push-off elderly compensate for possible early sit-down and a step halfway sit-to-stand, and with the thigh push-off strategy only for early sit-down. The age-groups differences confirm stability basins quantify the stability of the observed movement strategy rather than the stability of the participants. We observed that elderly use more precautious sit-tot-stand movements.","Sit-to-stand; Stability; Thigh push-off; Elderly; Simulation-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

It is therefore important to correctly detect as many leads as possible to obtain more SSH references. This paper studies 12 different classification methods including supervised-, unsupervised machine learning methods and thresholding method, being applied to the Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimetry data collected in March/April of 2017-2020 and June/July of 2020 from areas all across the Arctic Ocean. These are compared and assessed with respect to images taken by Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), also on board Sentinel-3, ensuring a perfect temporal alignment between the two measurements. The supervised Adaptive Boosting, Artificial Neural Network and Linear Discriminant classifiers showed excellent and robust results in March/April with overall accuracies up to 91.82%. The unsupervised K-medoid classifier produced excellent results achieving up to 91.51% accuracy and it is an attractive classifier as it does not require ground truth data. The classifiers perform poorly in the summer months, as sea ice returns show more ambiguous reflections due to melting. Therefore on summer data, classifications that are solely based on waveform data from SAR altimetry is unsuitable and auxiliary information is required. Furthermore, this paper attempted to identify off-nadir leads (ONL) by adding an extra class in supervised learning methods, intending to reduce the falsely detected leads. Most classifiers failed to detect leads and did not improve their false lead rate. However, as RUS Boost classifier was able to identify 61.6% of total ONLs, this can be used to initially reject these points for more conservative lead detection.","Arctic; Lead detection; SAR altimetry; Sentinel-3; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Initially, the trajectory calculation method of CDA and the boundary cases were defined. Then, a two-fold interface was designed for planning and execution, based on Ecological Interface Design (EID), with a Vertical Situation Display (VSD) playing a central role, and it was tested by five pilots over different wind conditions. The pilots' on-time performance was satisfactory, while they worked with the cues and suggested enhancements to accommodate their strategy.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Biochemical reactions play a crucial role and tell us many about the behavior of the biological regulation processes . We will apply several methods of order reduction to describe the overall dynamics in a more compact way. For modelling a set of biochemical reactions is rewritten as first order differential equations. This set of first order differential equations defines the state space model. This rewriting is based on mass-action kinetics and Michaelis-Menten (MM) theory. With the Stoichiometry matrix the conservation laws and flux distribution in steady state can respectively be deduced. The systems we are looking at can be distinguished in many different biochemical regulatory networks . Examples of these networks can be found in gene expression, protein production and/or hormone production. The system that includes all given biochemical reactions of the network can be seen as a Coherent Feedforward Loop or CFFL. In synthetic biology these CFFLs are studied to gain insight into the desired production/expression: think about medicine production, agriculture and manufacturing. In biochemistry mostly a set of biochemical reactions can be given as a family or combination of CFFLs. To realize this a so called AND-gate or toehold switch is used.<br/><br/>First of all we use conservation laws to reduce the system in order equal to the dimension of the left nullspace. Afterwards we have the option to reduce the system even more by applying the Quasi Steady State Approach in a given network like the CFFL. This method suggests that some species concentrations will reach its steady states much sooner than other species concentrations (if we look at slow timescale). Therefore it is assumed that some species already have their steady state at the beginning of the experiment. This is the so called classical QSSA. Another way to reduce the system order is by applying the Kron reduction order method. This method assumes a complexes network that reduces the complexes and thus the number of species. Here the concept of complex balancedness will determine whether the steady states for both models will be the same. Eventually we will also deal with alternative modelling where the cycles and feedback mechanisms will be replaced by more simple ones. Then afterwards mass-action kinetics along with classical QSSA can be applied. To get an optimal reduction order model the way in which parameters within the model are estimated can be discussed by optimization techniques. Furthermore we will see how the system can be transformed if we also have to do with in-and outflows. It actually means that we will need to add an extra term . One term will be in matrix-vector form while the other method merely uses vector-scalar notation. We will also look at the relation between these two forms. A future challenge would be to make an auto based system that directly converts the given system into its reduced order form. Here the best reduction order model will be selected automatically and applied in the best determined<br/>sequence.<br","Order reduction; Coherent Feedforward Loop; CFFL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Nowadays, approximately 45% of the train passengers in the Netherlands access the station by bike. Therewith, the focus of policy makers shifts to the total “door-to-door” travel experience. Bicycle usage is stimulated, and the facilities are adapted accordingly. From a lot of perspectives, this can be seen as a positive trend. Unfortunately, it also has negative consequences in terms of capacity problems in parking facilities and costs. To be able to guide a better service to multimodal travellers, more insights should be gathered regarding their experience and willingness to pay for certain aspects. Most studies focus on the characteristics of bike-train users and their behaviour. In consequence, the quality of the parking facility is considered very limited. The impact of this quality on the user experience is considered even less. For example, the impact of a free of charge parking period is not known. More aspects influencing the users’ experience and behaviour might exist as well. Studies also often focus on one station or one area, which makes it hard to draw general conclusions. Lastly, the relationship between the willingness to pay and the expected subscription price is unknown. By getting a better understanding of the attributes influencing the choice behaviour of facility users, an insight is given into the preferences of passengers concerning bicycle parking. The effects of pricing policies on the user experience and utilisation at various facilities are of great interest to NS (Dutch Railways). For a full overview, there has to be differentiated to types of facilities and types of stations. The following research question is answered during this thesis: What is the willingness to pay of various types of bike parking-users at train stations for different types of facilities and at different types of stations? Literature addresses several attributes which are influential when using the bike-train combination. Attributes can be split into user characteristics, parking facility characteristics and station characteristics. Based on an ongoing data collection effort (Keten Belevings Monitor or KBM), user characteristics of guarded bike parking users can be analysed. It can be found that young people, between 18 and 24 years old, are the main bike-train users, while people over 65 are less present. Furthermore, users are often frequent travellers (at least once a week) and going to work or school. Of all commuters, 90% travels frequently. Social and recreational purposes are performed on a less frequent basis and are in general performed by older people. Based on these characteristics, five traveller profiles can be identified which each consist of at least 5% of the current bike-train users. These can be labelled as commuters to work, students commuting to school, youth travelling for leisure activities and adults with a leisure purpose, divided into medium and low frequent travellers (respectively between 1 and 3 times a month and less than once a month). Distribution of users towards different types of stations can be made as well. Suburban stations tend to be more used by commuters to work. This also results in more frequent travellers at suburban stations. Social and recreational travellers tend to be more attracted to intercity stations. Also, long-term parking occurs more often at intercity stations.","Bike-train; Multimodal tranport; Access mode; Discrete choice modelling; Stated choice; Adaptive choice; Railway stations; Public transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The offshore wind industry has progressed in recent years, with larger wind turbines being installed in deeper oceans. The construction of such large-scale wind farms necessitates more modern foundation design technologies to increase operational safety while also lowering total structure set-up costs. The environmental load applied to offshore piles are of great complexity. Currents, wind, waves, and even earthquakes are very common dynamic loads in an offshore loading environment. Of course, when a wind turbine is working normally, it also has significant operation loads. The design of offshore wind turbine support structures often involves some universal criteria, e.g., the pull-out capacity of jacket structures on piles. Wind turbine foundation capacity is determined by the qualities of the offshore soil as well as the properties of support structure configurations. Therefore, it is necessary to take account of the potential cyclic impacts of soil-structural interaction to guarantee dependable responses of the wind turbine structure. This thesis aims at evaluating soil−structure interaction of offshore wind turbine foundations under cyclic loading, with emphasis on the tension capacity of axially loaded displacement piles, under different load conditions (cyclic-to-average ratios) on Fontainebleau NE34 sand in France. A newly developed constitutive soil model SANISAND-MS (2018) is applied to model sand stress-strain evolution. In this thesis, the soil is assumed a homogeneous linear elastoplastic material for the sake of simplicity. The SANISAND-MS constitutive model used in this thesis can capture sand ratcheting after considerable cyclic loading cycles. Furthermore, drained and undrained compression triaxial tests performed at DTU GEO−Lab were used to calibrate the model parameters of the constitutive model for Fontainebleau NE34 sand. The finite element model adopted here is built in an open-sourced platform, the OpenSees. The Small-strain approach is adopted in the finite element modelling part. The pile is simplified as a wished-in place which does not include the installation effect and the time effect after the installation and before cyclic tests. Finally, the modelling results are compared to the experiment results recorded by Tsuha et al. (2012). Clear stable, metastable, and unstable response types are recognized in the model results. However, the initial stress state of the sand at the soil-pile interface differs a lot compared to the experiment results. This is the consequence of not including the pile installation effects in the finite element modelling. Recommendations are given to use large-strain soil modelling techniques to include the pile installation process.","Cyclic Axial Response; SANISAND-MS; Interaction Diagram; Offshore Jacket Structures; FEM modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

MCMs are materials whose temperature changes on the application or removal of a magnetic field. This effect is known as the MagnetoCaloric Effect (MCE). Magnetocaloric heat pumps have the potential in replacing the conventional vapour compression technology for Dutch dwellings, since they have minimum environmental impact due to the absence of the coolant fluids that can harm the environment. A model of the regenerator of the magnetocaloric heat pump is developed in this project having in mind the application of this type of heat pumps to Dutch dwellings. The magnetic field that is used in the development of the model is 0.875 T, with permanent magnets being the source of the magnetic field. A sensitivity analysis is carried out in order to obtain the methods to optimize the regenerator for improving the performance of the heat pump. The performance of the heat pump is measured through its average cooling capacity, average heating capacity, temperature span and Coefficient of Performance (COP) for heating. TheMCM used for the regenerators is Gd with a totalmass of 1.18 kg. The parameter that influences the performance of the heat pump the most is the porosity of the regenerator. The heat losses through the casing have the least impact on the performance of the regenerator. The frequency of the cycle also has a profound impact on the heating capacity and cooling capacity up to temperature spans of around 18 K, but it does not have such an impact on the heating COP. After increasing the frequency, decreasing the particle diameter and decreasing the porosity, the heating capacity and the temperature span are optimized.

(graduation committee); 't Hart, Marcel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to the recent increase in traffic capacity requirements, the need for larger spans in immersed concrete tunnels has become a pressing matter. Although commonly used in Europe, reinforced concrete has a structural capacity limit when it comes to the transverse span length. The implementation of post-tensioning could allow for longer spans and a reduction in the overall concrete used. This technique is however rarely used in industry due to the complexity of applying it to underwater environments and the varied loading conditions an immersed tunnel element is subjected to. When implementing post-tensioned tendons, the curvature creates additional distributed loads which compensate for the high hydrostatic pressures and backfilling weight present at the final immersed stage of the tunnel. Due to the absence of these loads during the initial stages, prior to transportation, high tensile stresses are exhibited which can lead to severe cracking. Crack mitigation can be achieved by implementing permanent additional reinforcements in the opposite face of the post tensioning tendon. Additionally, another method is installing a temporary system connecting top and bottom slabs to replicate the final loading conditions. The objective of this research is to investigate the governing limitations of implementing transverse post-tensioning and evaluate when it is a structurally viable option. Using finite element modelling, a linear analysis was carried out to evaluate the behavior of the structure after implementing post-tensioning loads in the cross section and to identify the critical areas. The assumptions for the analytical moment distribution were found to overestimate the rigidity of the structure and made for larger moments at the wall-top slab connections, which were adjusted for the remaining parts of the study. An analysis into the effect of adding post-tensioning in the lower bottom slab revealed a substantial improvement in the final stage stress distribution, and was observed to be in full compression. A nonlinear analysis was used to provide insight into the global structural behaviour for both final immersed and dry dock stages. The final immersed stage exhibited linear elastic behaviour, whereas, the onset of cracking was observed at the top of midspan at the dry dock stage. In a further analysis of the critical dry dock stage, the relation between partial prestressing, curvature of post-tensioning tendons and the effects on the cracking behaviour at midspan was explored. The results showed that when maximum curvature and percentage of prestressing are simultaneously present, the crack width limit is reached. When slightly lowering either of these parameters, a substantial decrease in the amount of reinforcement is needed to mitigate these cracks. Lastly, a case study was carried out on the Fehrmanbelt Fixed Link to compare two methods to mitigate cracks at midspan in the dry dock: additional reinforcement and temporary tendons. This study found that implementing transverse post-tensioning was feasible when reducing the curvature of the tendons, reducing amount of prestressing and implementing additional reinforcement, which helped increase structural capacity of the critical areas in the dry dock stage.","post-tensioning; concrete; Immersed Tunnel; prestressed concrete; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Over the last years advantages in autonomous agent systems and technology have created many potential applications for large numbers of collaborating robots in the field of surveillance, mapping, mining, farming and (space) exploration. The underlying principle that enables robots to collectively solve complex tasks is that of minimal interference: the basis of swarm robotics. In nature, swarms of insects use stigmergy, communication through environment marking, to connect individual and collective behavior. Many have tried to implement this stigmergic principle in swarm robotics, though it remains a challenge to implement stigmergy in robotic systems suited for real applications. In this thesis we present a biologically inspired minimalistic design for a foraging robotic swarm based on stigmergy. Our self-guiding swarm requires only very restricted robot capabilities: Robots do not require global or relative position measurements; the swarm is fully decentralized; and the robots need no infrastructure in place. Additionally, the system only requires one-hop communication over the robot network, we do not make any assumptions about the connectivity of the communication graph and the transmission of information and computation is scalable versus the number of agents. All this is realized by letting the agents in the swarm act as foragers or as guiding (beacons). We analyse the characteristics and performance of our swarm by our own developed so called 'particle'-simulator and the realistic \textit{Webots} simulator using a swarm of Elisa-3 robots. We show how the swarm self-organizes to solve a foraging problem over an unknown environment and converges to trajectories around the shortest path. In addition, we study directions of future improvements of the swarm design regarding the minimization of resources, optimality of the created paths and the convergence speed. At last, we derive formal results regarding the reachability, coverage time and hitting times of the swarm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Recently, it has become popular to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in embedded and portable devices. The popularity is based on their high accuracy rate in the field of Computer Vision (CV). However, CNNs are computationally intensive due to the convolutional layer, which accounts for over 90% of the operations. To overcome this problem, many researchers have exerted efforts to develop parallel and customised accelerators. Methods utilised in the accelerators range from bit optimisation to using fixed-point arithmetic, and to reducing the size of the network. Some researchers have also explored alternative computing paradigms such as Stochastic Computing (SC). The great advantage of SC is its ability to perform complex arithmetic with simple hardware. However, a major problem of SC is the trade-off between latency and accuracy. Thus, there have been several attempts to mitigate this factor, ranging from improving the generation of stochastic numbers to parallel bitstreams, to early terminations. This thesis proposes StoHej, a new SC multiplier design that combines stochastic bitstreams and complementary events. The multiplier has two input types, the first is the neural network feature value and the second is the weight value. The weight value determines how many iterations the computation requires. A complement event is utilised if the weight value is greater or equal to $0.5$ since the complement of the event yields a smaller number. Thus, the worst-case latency has been reduced from O(N) to O(N/2). The proposed multiplier was compared with a Conventional Stochastic Computer (CSC) multiplier and the BISC-MVM multiplier, which is the state-of-the-art for SC multipliers that uses an early termination mechanism. All multipliers were first tested in a software simulation in a general context. Accuracy and latency were measured in a software simulation. The results from these simulations showed a 3.2x speedup for the proposed design compared to BISC-MVM, with no increase in computational errors. Then, StoHej and BISC-MVM were tested in a CNN inference application with the MNIST dataset. The multipliers were used in a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) array that was implemented on an FPGA. The results from the experiment show that StoHej had a 1.7x speedup and no loss in accuracy compared to BISC-MVM. StoHej's energy consumption was reduced by 40% when compared to BISC-MVM. The Area-Delay Product (ADP) of StoHej was 30% smaller than BISC-MVM. StoHej's Area-Delay-Energy Product is 2.3x smaller than the BISC-MVM multiplier.","Stochastic Computing; Computer Arithmetic; Multiplier; Artifical neural networks; Convolutional Neural Network; StoHej; Complement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

There are few comprehensive ways to do so however, which often leads to conservative estimates. This thesis presents an integral framework with which the fatigue of flood gates due to dynamic waveloading can be described in much more detail, while also being efficient and adaptable to different circumstances. First, the fatigue experienced by a single load event is evaluated based on readily available data. This was done by creating a phase-amplitude model from a wave spectrum based on the site properties and environmental conditions. These wave loads can then be transformed to pressure spectra with linear wave theory and pressure impulse theory, which will dynamically excite the fluid-structure system. The gate is then parametrically modelled in a FEM software package in order to export the in-vacuo response modes. These are combined with a fluid-structure interaction model to derive the response of the system to external pressures. The fatigue was evaluated with the standard Eurocode method to find a fatigue damage factor. Next, the load events imposed on the gate over its lifetime were probabilistically defined. This was done by fitting two independent probability distributions to historical wind- and water level data, the latter of which was also adjusted for climate change. These probability distributions are then split into segments which are integrated to obtain discrete load cases with representative values for the average wind velocity, water level, and probability of occurrence. Two filters were also applied to remove the load cases which cause a negligible amount of fatigue. Computing the fatigue damage caused by the average values of each of these load case bins then gives a set of fatigue damage factors with an associated probability of occurrence, which can be used to perform a Monte Carlo analysis. A case study for a hypothetical parametrically defined gate with an overhang located in the Afsluitdijk was performed, where the response for different gate configurations and environmental conditions was evaluated. The fatigue response was evaluated for fatigue across the gate, at the critical coordinate, and per mode. A ULS check was also done for the chosen design. Results following from the model were also compared to those of methods commonly used in practice.The method gives insight into the relative importance of different modes and load events, can compute fatigue for the entire gate or just a critical coordinate, and does so in a much more time-efficient manner than current numerical models. It gives a more comprehensive view of the fatigue over the lifetime of the gate by modelling its entire lifespan rather than a set of design load events. The modular structure of the integral framework allows for easy adaptation to other use cases in hydraulic engineering where fatigue due to hydrodynamic loading is of interest.","Fatigue; Wave impacts; Probabilistic design; Structural Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Latest advancements in next-gen and high throughput sequencing technologies have resulted in significant growth in the data produced and made available for further research. These advancements can help scientists dive deeper into the analysis of uncultivated microbial populations that may have important roles in their environments. Gap: However, analysis of such data requires multiple preprocessing and computational steps to interpret the microbial and genetic composition of samples. For most researchers, configuring these tools, linking them with advanced binning and annotation tools, and maintaining the provenance of the processing continues to be extremely challenging. Moreover, the most common issue with current practices of metagenomics is the reproducibility of the research due to the complexity of setup and configurations. Aim: Our aim is to get a big-picture understanding of the common practices and approaches for metagenomic analyses and to find out which ones are more often used by researchers and why. Further, to compare some of the existing tools and look into possibilities of developing and/or using a reproducible pipeline and give some general recommendations for it. Methods: For this purpose, three main methods were used. First, a literature survey was performed on metagenomic analysis approaches, methodologies, and tools. Next, researchers and scientists with different educational backgrounds active in this field were interviewed. Lastly, the process of pipeline construction and bottlenecks were evaluated through hands-on experience. Findings: By conducting this research, several common pitfalls and shortcomings of metagenomic analysis practices were identified. Since the expertise of most researchers in this field is lacking a fundamental computer science and programming background, very few would attempt developing a pipeline from scratch. Therefore, if instead, they would opt for using “ready-made” General Purpose Pipelines (GPP), they would also face various difficulties in setting up and configuring them to their needs. Also, it has been observed that many of the existing metagenomic tools are not developed and maintained according to computer science code production standards. Therefore, even the more popular tools can suffer from detrimental bugs that can render them broken and consequently deprecated. However, with the emergence of the new “all-in-one” interface-based online platforms such as Kbase.us that enable simple point-and-click set-up and sharing of workflow, there is hope for entering a new era of reproducible metagenomic analysis.","metagenomics; metagenomic tools; Bioinformatics; Standard Operating Procedures; SOP","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Geldermans, Bob (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Over the years, the extraction and consumption of raw materials have increased radically, with a 60% increase since 1980. About one-fifth of the material extracted worldwide ends up as waste, corresponding to 12 billion tonnes (Gt) of waste per year. To tackle the increasing consumption and waste in the economy, the Netherlands government introduced the ‘Circular Netherlands in 2050’ plan in 2016, aiming to reduce 50% consumption of primary resources by 2030 and 100% by 2050. As a result, 95% of the secondary materials from the end-of-service-life demolition process of commercial and non-residential buildings in the Netherlands are recycled. However, comparing different R-option on an R-hierarchy model shows a gradual decrease in value retention of the material with recycling. The research focuses on shifting the facade industry from recycling to reuse by moving up the ladder to retain a higher material value. The thesis explores the research question through design research to support the strategic design and development for reusing secondary materials.<br/> <br/>Two cases, ODS Jansen and Buurman, are analyzed for their secondary material flow of steel and timber, respectively, through interviews and inventory analysis. A reuse process is systemized and further elaborated on stakeholders’ role (what, how, and when) to support it. A set of design explorations for facades is done to identify potential scenarios for reuse, considering the functional and technical factors that define office building facades in the Netherlands. The proposed hybrid system using the primary and secondary material stream is compared to an alternate non-reuse scenario. The assessment presented a 60% restorative material flow with the MCI score and a saving of 91% for embodied energy (renewable and non-renewable) and 93% for Global Warming Potential with LCIA with reuse of steel mullions in the curtain wall facade. <br/><br/>The research concludes that the reuse of materials for the same function is feasible through R-strategies of direct reuse, repair, refurbish, and remanufacture as long as the embodied value of the material does not change. Furthermore, it is essential to match the demand and supply of secondary materials for establishing the reuse practice at an industrial scale. For this, original material suppliers must take up the role of material resellers in the market. At the same time, manufacturers and architects need to shift their mindset from the use of abundant to ‘scarce’ resources by altering the design process with the three stages of material sourcing, material processing, and material reuse. Sufficient safety margins in design, material inspectors to overcome lack of information, working with the form of supply, changing design habits, and using materials differently are proposed as design solutions to organize the reuse of materials for facades. Lastly, when the existing materials decline, reuse will happen through materials entering the market now. It is essential to consider their design for future reuse to ensure this flow does not face the same set of challenges. <br","Circularity; Reuse; Residual Material Value; Reuse Process; Stakeholders to Support Reuse Process; design for reuse (DfR); Reuse of Curtain wall facades; Circular Value of Reuse; Environmental Impact of Reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","52.377956, 4.897070"

With air travel and transport in general being a large polluter of CO2 gases, the transition to electric flight becomes more prominent every year. This transition is starting small with non-commercial airplanes. Several companies are starting with development of eVTOLs, electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing vehicles. The idea behind them is that they can easily move into and out of the city through the air, speeding up transport and travel in urban areas while keeping CO2 emissions at the vehicle level at zero.<br/>This thesis, together with two other theses, will elaborate on the design of such an eVTOL. Its design is created by looking at the layout of the propellers, the wings and the fuselage and the internal layout is composed by working out the electric drivetrain from the energy storage to the electric motors and by drafting up the control systems. In specific, this thesis dives into the external design and the internal electric energy storage. It does this by settling on a design and calculating certain specifications, like wing area and propeller and fuselage size. From there the necessary powers and energies are calculated. With these powers and energies, a battery pack is designed together with a battery management system and a charging system. The other two theses will design the propulsion system and the control system of the eVTOL.<br/>The result of the thesis is a theoretical design that states the possibilities of Lithium-Sulfur cells inside an eVTOL. An efficient tandem wing design with fixed wings and fixed rotors makes sure there is a healthy balance between the maximum power and total energy needed to take off vertically and fly 125 kilometers. With the Lithium-Sulfur cells a battery pack is made with its accompanying battery management system that monitors and manages the cells' characteristics. Next to the battery pack, theory on charging and a simplified charging simulation has been done to show that charging in 15 minutes should be possible by the time the eVTOL enters into service.","eVTOL; Electric Energy Storage; Charging; Battery Management System; Lithium Sulfur","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Passengers and residers move through the neighbourhood with shifting motives related to four domains of social life, living (1), labour (2), learning (3), and leisure (4). Urban planning documents are dominantly textual and theoretical, while they involve creating physical places with a practical outcome. No-boundary-botu could be the solution. By embracing asset-based community development and co-creating with the unusual suspects, an Asset Atlas could strengthen local networks and fit the needs of the different domains, aiming for true cross understanding. Through scenarios, synergies within the initiatives' network will be displayed to reclaim the (semi)public space, encourage encounters, and create safety, trust and, most important, rest.","Urban Politics; (Semi)Public Space; Urban Deprived Areas; Societal Discourse; Reclaiming Space; Neighbourhood Settings; Stigmatization of Disadvantage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","51.908961, 4.441932"

Redesigning old department stores to be used as housing is a necessary solution. So how to fit appartments in a large building, that is so unfit to be used for housing in its current condition? While researching the V&amp;D department store in Leiden it was confirmed that the building needed thorough changes to adapt to a housing function.To adapt the building for its new function the building block is changed into an open-block structure. Resembling the structure used in most high density urban environments. At the same time this open structure compliments the already existing connection between the Aalmarkt and Breestraat side of the building. While opening up the building it was important to preserve its valuable elements, and where elements were removed or introduced, to relate to the original department store. The result is a building with a stepped open-block structure to balance the amount of light, floorspace and functions. The open structure creates terraces for the apartments which also serve as traffic space. An open public courtyard is introduced on the ground floor, reintroducing the old connection through the building. The inside of the building and the Marsmansteeg get new facades, using materials that relate to the main facade at the Aalmarkt. Using the valuable old V&amp;D store a building is created which mixes public functions and housing in the heart of the city.","heritage & Architecture; Vacant building; housing; High density housing; mixed use; public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","52.159234, 4.490963"

It is one of the largest cities in China where the socio-cultural identity stands out with a unique local lifestyle. Also, it is a city facing overall urban regeneration since 2020, when the establishment of an urban regeneration system at the city level was just started. <br/>In the past decade, the TOD redevelopment including the fast construction of metro lines and stations has been one of the core strategies taken in this city. Soon, this will cause a possible rush of urban regeneration in terms of demolishing and rebuilding around the metro stations in the inner city of Chengdu. The local public lifestyle could be threatened not only because of the absence of tools to maintain it in the incomplete urban regeneration system but also because the values of socio-cultural identity can be always easily compromised in the decision-making process for its “less urgent” position. <br/>This project aims to build an integrated strategic framework for extending and flourishing the local public lifestyle in future urban regeneration in Chengdu in the long term, strengthening the socio-cultural sustainability of the city.<br/>In this project, the research consists of four sessions. Firstly, the research about understanding the local public lifestyle, including representative scenes and the supporting factors, has been done. Secondly, the research about the possible influence on the scenes of lifestyle from the business as usual of demolishing and rebuilding has been conducted. Thirdly, the exploration about strategy development to extend and flourish the local public lifestyle in the selected site has been done. At last, the research about how to make those strategies feasible by institutional planning has been done. <br/>It was found that there can be three groups of supporting factors categorized by “people”, “space” and “service” for the local public lifestyle, and eighteen representative scenes have been concluded. Also, the business as usual can generate much more threats than opportunities on the existing scenes identified in the design testing. To avoid the threats and fully use the opportunities, in urban design, to identify the scenes in status quo, analyze how to extend and flourish the scenes and assess the performance of design strategies are important. This can help to inform what needs to be done in demolishing and rebuilding projects. However, to really make sure the intention of extending and flourishing the local public lifestyle can be integrated into the realistic project process, planning tools are also demanded. Therefore, a toolbox containing eight tools has been carried out. At last, institutionalization is demanded to regulate the project process and plug the tools developed into the conventional project process. <br/>To provide better and more practical support in the decision-making process of demolishing and rebuilding projects, further research about the lifestyle model is needed both at the theoretical level and in practice. <br","Socio-cultural identity; local public lifestyle; urban regeneration; inner-city; Chengdu","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","30.657000, 104.066002"

It investigates the theme of collective living and social responsibility for the inhabited spaces. Design focus lies in providing spaces that enhance social interactions between the residents and spaces for their individual appropriation. Since designing for diverse cultures does not refer to one dwelling system, the building offers maximum flexibility in order to provide appropriate apartments for future tenants. This strategy is based on the concept of open building introduced by John Habraken. The concept of responsibility for the inhabited spaces is also reflected in the integration of architecture and nature. The building provides biodiversity and aims to put focus on the current issues of the climate change. Architecture of the building integrates with nature and creates a healthy and sustainable living environment not only for people, but also several animal species.","Inclusive design; Collectiveness; Diversity; Urban Nature; Sustainability; Open Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.908757, 4.434656"

Academic studies have covered a wide range of issues including economic, social, political and cultural incorporation of immigrants in arrival cities. However, few examines the role of immigrants in reproducing urban, art and cultural scenes by their practices and experience of migration. This research examines on how immigration transforms a city’s spaces and reshapes the arts and cultural scene, particularly in Rotterdam, a city of world trade and cultural diversity since the 19th century. Under post-war restructuring, Rotterdam has been an arrival city since the 1960s. With the development of harbors and port industries, rural-urban and international migration brought an influx of guest workers and families, shaping South Rotterdam into an international working-class neighborhood. While immigration has provided the city with labor force and enriched cultural diversity, it has also caused social, economic and cultural contradictions. Facing discrepancies and segregations, immigrants and non-immigrants often face challenges in associating with each other. The research aims to explore the role of a museum as a platform to foster intercultural exchanges across boundaries, so as to rediscover the inherent and multifaceted depth of South Rotterdam. Based on immigrants’ experience on migration and acculturation, the research introduces how migration practices and cultural integration process contribute to the production of art and culture. In view of problems brought by cultural differences and social segregations in South Rotterdam, the project aims to facilitate intercultural understanding through art and spatial experience in a local museum. In the age of frequent migration, the museum can be seen as a place that offers opportunities for immigrants and their respective cultures to be displayed and experienced, reflecting the heterogeneity in a city. The design of spaces are aimed to be flexible and adaptive, responsive to human movement, reflecting the migratory and transient nature of contemporary life.","Immigration; Migration; Multiculturalism; Boundlessness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Public Building","",""

Moreover, 3d-printing represents a flexible fabrication technology that could play a relevant educational and developing role in growing communities. The goal of the research is to propose a solution for a mono-material building envelope component designed to enable and maximize atmospheric water collection in developing countries. The design aims to be adaptable to different climatic scenarios and easy to replicate locally. The task is approached systematically by defining all necessary functions and exploring the best strategy for each of them. Every step is performed considering both the optimization of functionality and 3d-printability. Functions are then combined in one element which is prototyped and tested. Computer simulations for the city of Rabat (Morocco), show that the combination of a dew and fog collector in one component would reduce by half the surface required to fulfill the water needs of one person. A feasibility analysis is also performed and the price of one module is estimated. The result is comparable to the cost of standard solutions in the field of atmospheric water harvesting and represents therefore an interesting achievement in the development of such technology.","Atmospheric water harvesting; Water scarcity; rPET; Additive Manufacturing; 3d-printed roof; fog harvesting; radiative condenser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

In history, the development of Guangzhou city was inseparable from its canal system, which was developed from the natural dense river network. On the one hand, this system had played its role in water management very well. It could quickly discharge rainwater into the Pearl River during the rainy season to prevent floods, and it could also function in water storage during the dry season. On the other hand, the canals were also an important part of people's daily life. It carried most of the people's main activities, such as sailing, trade, and socializing. The historic canal system was the lifeline of Guangzhou. However, in the rapid development of the city in the past 100 years, due to the rise of the automobile road system and the improper planning of the drainage system, the historic canals in Guangzhou have gradually left only a single drainage function. Different kinds of industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater are discharged into the canals, causing the canals and the surrounding environment to become bad; at the same time, the river is narrowed and the drainage function has deteriorated. In the rainy season, the surrounding area of the river is often flooded. The historic canals have gradually become the backside of the city, the disease of the city.<br/>In recent years, the government has begun a series of restoration projects for historic canals. However, these projects just aimed to copy-paste the historic scenes to attract tourism and did not pay attention to the historic canal itself and the surrounding communities.

Since the 1980s, the construction of labor-intensive industries has accelerated the expansion of urban areas. Numerous traditional villages in suburban areas were surrounded by newly built urban areas and became the so-called “urban village”. People in the urban villages could no longer earn from agriculture as their farmlands had mostly been requisitioned, while luckily the increasing housing demand of migrants enabled them to earn from rental. The villages are empowered to elect village committees and self-organization for public issues, while there are still a lot of things that are difficult to manage by villagers without official guidelines and investment. Many villages lack public services and public spaces, suffer from living unsafety, and social segregation. A policy was carried out in 2009 for regenerating the old towns, old factories, and old villages in the city, in which the urban village is part of the focus. However, currently, the market-led redevelopment approach did not work well on balancing the interest among different stakeholders, for which the housing demand of migrants is always ignored. Some projects even led to gentrification in the city center. Here the thesis aims to explore strategies for upgrading the living environment and mitigating social segregation in urban villages. It reveals the current challenges and potentials of redeveloping urban villages in Guangzhou. Finally, spatial and managerial strategies are given to improve the livability and enhance social integration between locals and migrants in the redevelopment process.","Urban villages; Guangzhou; Redevelopment; Informal settlement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Noise pollution is a growing health concern in cities, especially in busy streets with parallel reflective facades, known as urban street canyons. Here, high flows of vehicular traffic generate a broadband noise, with high noise levels in the low-frequency (LF) spectrum. In the canyons, noise decays slowly due to multiple reflections. To counter this, vertical greening systems (VGS) can be applied as multi-disciplinary solutions. Not only can these systems attenuate noise, they can also e.g. decrease the urban heat island effect and increase biodiversity. Yet, the shortcoming of VGSs is the lack of LF-absorption. Hence, the following research question was asked: “How can the acoustic absorption of vertical greening systems in urban street canyons be improved, especially for low-frequency noise?” Four concept designs were developed consecutively, and evaluated on the basis of design criteria. These criteria included specifications on acoustic absorption, manufacturability, and durability. The final design consisted of a living wall system (LWS) based on hydroponic rock wool, with a parallel array of Helmholtz resonators integrated in its structure. This array was added to increase the LF-absorption of the VGS below 250 Hz. The Helmholtz cavity volumes were not physically subdivided, but rather filled with a locally reactive material with a low flow resistivity, to enforce propagation that is normal to the surface. Additionally, plants can also absorb sound in the visco-thermal boundary layer around their organs, depending on the leaf area density. It was found that sciophytes (shade-loving plants) had most acoustic potential due to their large leave surfaces. Analytical, experimental, and numerical validation was performed. A Matlab script was developed that applied Delany-Bazley-Miki equations in an equivalent fluid model, and a transfer-function approach for the multi-layer complex impedance. The design yields near-unity absorption for f&gt;500 Hz. The resonators extended the LF-absorption (a&gt;0.5) down to 80 Hz. Impedance tube and reverberation room measurements demonstrated that piercing the porous substrate layer with the Helmholtz resonator necks can yield a combined acoustic absorption. Finally, acoustic simulations showed that applying the proposed LWS to the facades in a reference urban street canyon in Rotterdam can substantially decrease sound levels, both inside the street canyon, as well as in the adjacent courtyard canyon. However, the window-to-wall ratio of the facade largely determines to what extent sound levels can be decreased, since vertical greenery cannot be applied in front of windows.","Vertical greening systems; Acoustic absorption; Urban street canyon; Green wall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Human-to-human transmission is often the dominant viral transmission vector, and therefore the spreading of the virus is inextricably linked to human mobility. The Markov-modulated process (MMP) model has recently been proposed as a novel method for modeling mobility processes. Yang has developed a so-called ""aggregated MMP model"" which is able to capture several key dynamics of mobility processes with high accuracy. This research builds on Yang's results and proposes the ""quantized MMP model"" as an extension of Yang's aggregated MMP model. Compared to the aggregated MMP model, the quantized MMP model reduces the number of required states by a factor equal to the quantization step size <i>q</i>, improving the efficiency of the model.<br/><br/>The behavior of the quantized MMP model for different step sizes <i>q</i> is compared with the aggregated MMP model. The results show that the quantization error has zero mean, allowing the quantized MMP model to achieve similarly high model accuracy. The SIR dynamics of the quantized MMP model for different step sizes are tested extensively and the disease spreading performance is compared with the mobility process. The suitability of the MMP model for forecasting the evolution of epidemics is evaluated and discussed.","Markov-modulated process; MMP; Markov processes; Modeling; Human mobility; Epidemics; SIR model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the increasingly complex, uncertain nature of the power system creates challenges for investors and requires advanced research and modeling. An exploratory analysis is preformed to determine if and how energy system optimization modeling can be used to explore the long-term economic feasibility of investments in the power sector in light of the energy transition. A modeling framework is developed utilizing energy system optimization modeling paired with the uncertainty analysis, modeling to generate alternatives, to explore and provide insights into the profitability of investments in the range of possible near-optimal power system configurations that meet government emission reduction targets. We apply the modeling framework in a case study of the Dutch power system, focusing on investments in the 2030 time frame. The case study is used as a proof of concept of the developed methodological. The case study finds that the developed modeling framework can provide insight into the range of near-optimal power system configurations that meet emission reduction targets and, through an economic analysis, can shed light on the economic feasibility of different technologies. In the particular case of the Netherlands, the case study finds a wide range of possible future near-optimal energy systems exist to meet emission reduction targets, but a lack of profitability of investments indicate policy mechanisms or alternative market arrangements are needed to ensure economic incentives exist for the necessary investments. Further research should include a parametric uncertainty analysis to provide a complete and comprehensive overview, including all types of uncertainty in the system and to identify the affects different types of uncertainty have on the profitability of investments.","Power System Modelling; Uncertainty; Investment; Energy System Optimization Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If AVs are implemented in our daily lives, this could have many advantages. Before this can happen, safe driver models need to be designed which control the AVs. One technique that is suitable to create these models is Reinforcement Learning (RL). A problem here is that an RL agent usually needs to execute random actions during training, which is unsafe when driving an AV. Two shields are proposed to solve this problem: a Safety Checking Shield (SCS) and a Safe Initial Policy Shield (SIPS). The SCS checks whether an action is safe by predicting the future state after taking that action and checking whether that future state is safe. The SIPS checks whether an action is safe by comparing it to a safe action from a Safe Initial Policy. Based on the safety of the current state and this action, a safe range of actions is created in which the chosen action must fall. Furthermore, two shield-based learning techniques are proposed which are part of the RL algorithm and allow the agent to learn to avoid proposing actions that would be overruled by a shield. For the first method, experiences are fabricated, and for the second method, an alternative loss function is adopted. In the CARLA driving simulator, two scenarios were created to test the systems. In the first scenario, the agent needs to learn to drive straight, and in the second scenario, it needs to learn to not hit other vehicles on a straight road. The two shields are built around a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and compared to it. It is shown that both shielding systems have zero collisions during training and execution, while having a similar or even better performance in terms of efficiency in comparison to the baseline DDQN. Furthermore, it is shown that both shield-based learning techniques effectively enable the agent to learn to not propose unsafe actions.","Reinforcement Learning; Autonomous Vehicles; Shielding; Deep Q-Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The vehicle needs to plan a smooth and collision-free path. An essential aspect of a safe path is to predict the motion of the surrounding vehicles of the GRT to guarantee a smooth adaption to the constantly changing traffic scenario. The smooth adaption to the changing traffic scenario is essential for the GRT. The GRT cannot brake with the same magnitude as surrounding traffic due to standing people inside the vehicle. The importance of the smooth adaption to the traffic scenario resulted in the following problem statement; is it possible to create a motion prediction model for the surrounding vehicles of the ego vehicle to allow for pro-active velocity planning of the ego vehicle itself. From the literature, motion prediction models can be divided into physics-based motion models, manoeuvre-based motion models, and interaction-aware motion models. Each level has a certain amount of building blocks, with each level being an extra addition of situation awareness to the previous level.<br/>An interaction-aware motion model is the most advanced prediction model taking the infrastructure and interaction between the vehicles in the traffic scene into account. Therefore this principle of motion prediction is chosen for the motion prediction of the surrounding vehicles of the GRT. First, all possible state and route information of the surrounding vehicles are gathered. Secondly, a tree is created based on the vehicles' routes in the traffic situation, with the unique combination of manoeuvres known as a single branch of the scenario tree. Hereafter, the possible conflict areas between the individual manoeuvres are determined based on the desired trajectories for a specific route. The first vehicle passing the conflict area will influence the second vehicle's trajectory for passing the same conflict area, which will influence the third vehicle's trajectory and so on. Each vehicle can avoid a collision by passing in front or behind the previous vehicle(s) at the conflict area. Evaluating all passing possibilities will result in the velocity trajectory with the lowest cost, constrained by comfort. The sum of all costs for each branch of manoeuvres is used as a metric to determine the possible velocity profiles for each vehicle in the current traffic situation, resulting in a better understanding of the traffic scenario and ensuring a comfortable adaption to a changing traffic scenario. This thesis will evaluate several methods found in the literature to built a motion prediction model suitable for the application at 2getthere. The chosen motion model will be evaluated by two scenarios in a T-junction intersection. <br","Motion prediction; Interaction-aware; Trajectory planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Such a system can reduce the time it takes for help to arrive by automatically alerting predefined contacts with the location of the accident. I developed a systematic method for the practical implementation of bicycle accident detection in connected bicycles and present the performance of a prototype system. The method uses accelerometer and gyroscopic measurements as well as localization and velocity estimations. Supplementing existing research, a bicycle accident detection system is validated on normal cycling, edge cases, and three types of single bicycle accidents with constraints set by a bicycle manufacturer. Edge cases are movements of a bicycle that occur during regular usage, but can not be described by normal cycling. This method uses a data¬driven approach. For the prototype system, the input signals are collected during 71 different simulated accidents and 54 hours of normal cycling and edge cases. A three¬layer detection algorithm determines if an accident has occurred and sends the last known location to a set of predefined contacts. Multiple combinations of thresholds and classification algorithms are compared. This resulted in a prototype system with a K¬Nearest Neighbours classifier which detects 75% of accidents. Normal cycling and edge cases are correctly detected 99.997% of the time. From all warnings send, 85.7% are true accidents. The prototype system proves that the proposed method can be used to integrate reliable accident detection in connected bicycles. Bicycles with such a system automatically inform emergency contacts with a message containing the location of the accident, in a time where every second counts.","Bicycle; Accident; Crash; Detection; Fall; Emergency; Localisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Working from home became the new standard, forcing the whole world into the biggest remote working experiment ever. The already existing remote working trend caught wind and changed the future of work to hybrid working in an office ecosystem. With a large number of companies and employees being inexperienced with hybrid working, new challenges and unfulfilled needs came to light. Literature research and more than 50 interviews with people from 31 companies were done to identify these challenges and develop a deep understanding of them. The three problem categories are asymmetrical communication, disconnected office ecosystem and unprepared companies. The decision was made to focus on asymmetrical communication in hybrid meetings. Hybrid meetings are meetings with both online and in-office participants. These types of meetings make the online participants feel invaluable. This is caused by them not feeling involved and struggling to give input. In the long term this can lead to a decrease in employee satisfaction. Communication science helps explain why hybrid communication is hard, especially for the remote attendees. We humans collect countless information points from each other, which we unconsciously process and use for smooth and natural conversation. With video communication crucial information is filtered out, with eye contact and (selective) gaze, body language and life-sized scale being the most impactful ones. The goal of the project is to develop a product that enriches hybrid communication by supporting previously lost information. The technology developed in the design phase is coined artificial eye contact, which is based on the science of eye contact and selective gaze. Through validation experiments artificial eye contact was found to be successful in establishing similar effects. These effects are involvement, group dynamics, trust and convincement for eye contact, and more attention towards online participants, better group dynamics and a higher turn taking frequency for selective gaze. The retail price is 300 euros, but an additional data driven dashboard with a subscription model will still be validated. The product will form the foundation for a Startup, called Be There, with the mission of enabling natural and equal communication between meeting participants from different locations in the office ecosystem. Raising capital and patenting the technology are the next steps in the company planning. To conclude the project, validate the problem solution fit and partially validate the product market fit a pilot was done with Delta Capita, a technology consultancy from Amsterdam. The Be There One proved its value and collected the first Letter of Intent.","Remote work; Hybrid work; Hybrid meetings; Artificial eye contact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-28","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Lane markings are used by both human drivers and machine vision to stay on the road, but factors contributing to lane marking detection in different driving conditions are mostly unknown. A field test was conducted on Dutch provincial roads to evaluate lane marking visibility properties in relation to the LKA detection performance of different sensor types. The LKA detection performance of the mono camera was found to be higher in most weather and illumination conditions than the detection performance of the mono camera with infrared. The mono camera with infrared had a higher detection performance during rain in nighttime conditions than during dry daytime conditions. The highest detection performance for the mono camera and the mono camera with infrared were 97% in dry nighttime conditions and 91,4% in sunset conditions, respectively. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the effect of lane marking properties on the lane detection performance. A profiled lane marking type was found to increase the detection likelihood by 6-8 times as opposed to a smooth lane marking type.

Ebb-tidal deltas have an important function within the coastal system that make them of interest for coastal defence as a source and transport path for sand to the back-barrier basins and the island coastlines. As part of the Kustgenese 2.0 project, a pilot nourishment of 5.5 million m3 has been placed on the Ameland ebb-tidal delta. Improved understanding of sediment bypassing processes and the interaction with a nourishment is needed for strategic placement of nourishments in the future. In this thesis we analyse the high-frequency bathymetric dataset available at Ameland inlet between 2005 and 2020 and model the tide- and wave-driven transport pathways using to SedTRAILS to determine how sediment bypassing works under natural circumstances and under the influence of a nourishment. A new series of conceptual models has been proposed. These show that the formation and growth of a series of ebb-shields on the western side of the ebb-tidal delta plays an important role in sediment bypassing. Their development gradually results in transport pathways connecting the western side of the ebb-tidal delta to the major transport pathway along the ebb-delta front, which forms a direct connection to the Ameland coast in 2017. The influence of the pilot nourishment on sediment bypassing processes is limited, adding volume to the system but not altering the existing transport pathways. Transport pathways show that sediment from the nourishment eventually reaches the Ameland coast and is unlikely to feed the Terschelling coast or the tidal basin. This is valuable knowledge for the future sustainable coastal management of Ameland inlet, which can also be extended to other inlets.","ebb-tidal delta; Ameland Inlet; nourishment; SedTRAILS; Coastal Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

An iterative design process led to (1) creating a theoretical model that provides a structured, understandable, and descriptive design journey, and (2) a physical toolkit to offer a low-barrier, engaging and memorable usage of this model. The final concept is the COEVOLVE toolkit which includes the COEVOLVE approach. This approach provides grip on the process of redesigning a medical practice more inclusive and circular. The intrinsic value of a medical device/service increases by being beneficial to the planet and being prosperous to people. Likewise, the concept encourages designers in education to change their mindsets to tackle our future challenges. The developed theoretical model provides design students with a design process fulfilling their ambition to have an impact. It aids in exploring the different perspectives needed, creating awareness of the life cycle of a medical device/service, and finding opportunities that emerge to improve its circularity and inclusivity. Likewise, the model facilitates the exploration of trade-offs necessary to design a more inclusive and circular medical device/service, for a specific context of use. The model was tested by facilitating two workshops with design students which confirmed the impact of the model. However, the participants of the workshop also expressed that simultaneously addressing the three design domains is perceived as overwhelming. Hence, its usage needs to be as understandable as possible and, to effectuate the mindset, memorable as well. Thus, the model was transformed into the COEVOLVE toolkit. This toolkit provides the next generation designers with a fun and collaborative way to engage with the complexity and uncertainty of designing medical practices more inclusive and circular. The toolkit consists of an understandable and engaging Design Guide and a series of canvases. Furthermore, it includes Inclusivity and Circularity Card Decks, which encourage new ideas in a homogeneously thinking group, and a Circled Map, a physical experience resembling the complexity of the COEVOLVE approach. The COEVOLVE toolkit, developed for modular usage globally, encourages dialogue and discussion. Multiple evaluation activities with design students and experts were conducted, and the outcome was clear: the impact of the model and the toolkit on its users can be guaranteed.","Design approach; Toolkit; Educational tool; Medical design; Inclusive design; Circular design; Holistic approach; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kets, W.F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This graduation project investigates the opportunities for the design of a new floorplan concept for the Flying-V aircraft. The aircraft’s unique V-shaped layout brings about limitations for how seating and other interior elements such as lavatories and galleys can be placed in the floorplan. Meaning that a different approach needs to be taken regarding the placement of these elements. Regulations for example dictate that aircraft seating cannot be placed at an angle greater than 18° from the direction of flight (DOF), without the need for additional safety precautions such as airbags. Because the passenger cabin of the aircraft is angled at approximately 26°, seats cannot be placed in rows perpendicular to the cabin wall such as in conventional aircrafts. Additionally, with the design of a new floorplan, opportunities arise for the design of a differentiating passenger experience through improvements in passenger comfort. As described in this report, literature research and an online questionnaire resulted in the definition of five main passenger comfort aspects that are of interest to tackle with the design of a new floorplan: legroom, personal space, boredom, sleeping, and walking or being physically active. Research has shown that these five aspects are considered highly important for passenger comfort, but that they score low with regard to this. Indicating that, if these aspects are improved, overall passenger experience can be improved as well. Using these outcomes, along with research into the Flying-V’s cabin design and geometry, aircraft interior trends and developments, and approaches to aircraft floorplan design, four different design directions were developed. The floorplan concept that is further elaborated on in this report focusses on three of these passenger discomforts: legroom, personal space and the possibility for passengers to walk around the aircraft. Further development of this floorplan aimed to find an appropriate balance between improvements in these aspects and required passenger capacity. The resulting floorplan proposal contains three different seating configurations, with each seating section dedicated to different types of travel groups: individual travellers, couple travellers, and group travellers. Firstly, staggered seats facing the DOF are placed at the front of the aircraft and along the outer cabin wall. These seats are dedicated to individual travellers, as they have proven to increase a passengers’ sense of individual personal space and legroom. Secondly, seats dedicated to couple and group travellers are minimally staggered (similar to conventional seating), as this still allows the passenger to easily communicate with their travel partners, one of the drawbacks of seats that are staggered at larger distances. Keeping passenger capacity in mind, the extent to which seats are staggered affects the width of a seating row. So by using a combination of differently staggered seating configurations the width of the aircraft’s cabin can be used most optimally. In this floorplan, making the difference between a 9 or 10-abreast configuration. Additionally, a walking route around the front of the aircraft is created, allowing passengers to be more physically active on long-haul flights, while highlighting of one of the aircrafts unique design features.","Flying-V; Floorplan; Interior Design; Passenger Comfort; Passenger experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The shift towards greater extremes in both wet periods and dry periods requires a more dynamic policy. It is investigated what effect the placement of a permanent water barrier in the Rijnmond has on the water levels in the Rhine branches, and if this can be an opportunity to help the drought prone area in the east of the Netherlands.This study shows that replacing the Maeslantkering with a permanent barrier has no influence on the water levels upstream of Nijmegen in the Waal at average to low Rhine discharges (2000 - 600 m^3/s), and thus has no effect on the water distribution at the Pannerdensche Kop. If the fresh water demand to stop the salt wedge is eliminated, a different water distribution over the Rhine branches is possible, but structural changes at the bifurcation point have to be made in order to achieve this. River water can be used to supply the east of the Netherlands with water. In this study, three options to do so are examined. The most promising options of these is placing a pumping station in the Rhine nearby Lobith and supplying the streams in the area with water, many of which fall dry in summer. From there, the water can be used for irrigation, infiltration, and other fresh water demands, relieving the stress on the groundwater during dry spells. Building a permanent storm surge barrier is not a requirement, but because it increases the navigability of the Waal river, water can be extracted more often with a permanent barrier. A solution to combat drought in the east of the Netherlands seems to be more urgent than a solution to mitigate sea level rise. However, a permanent barrier can help in mitigating the effect of drought on groundwater levels in the east of the Netherlands by allowing for more flexibility in using river water extraction.","drought; climate change; Rhine; discharge distribution; permanent water barrier; groundwater; east of the Netherlands; SOBEK; mitigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Aniche, Maurício (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The convenient service offered by credit cards and the technological advances in e-commerce have caused the number of online payment transactions to increase daily. With this rising number, the opportunity for fraudsters to obtain cardholder details via online credit card fraud has also increased. As a result, according to the European Central Bank, billions of Euros are lost due to credit card fraud every year. Since verifying all transactions by hand is infeasible, automated Fraud Detection Systems (FDSs) are needed. Currently, financial institutions create such systems by training machine learning algorithms on transaction data. However, the performance of these systems is obstructed due to a lack of positive (fraud) samples in the collected transaction data. To improve performance, an ideal solution would be to merge data of all institutions and to train an FDS on the resulting data set. However, privacy reasons concerning the sensitive customer information in this data, and security risks associated with transferring data, render this solution unrealistic. Therefore, the need rises for novel protocols that allow financial institutions to collaboratively train FDSs without sharing private data. Previous research in the field of collaborative learning attempts to solve such problems by requiring participants to train local models, which are aggregated into a global model by a trusted central entity. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of these settings to inference attacks restricts their applicability. Inference attacks aim to extract additional secret knowledge from a model. These are especially powerful when performed by participants in a sequential setting, where participants train the same model one after the other following a given order. This is because in this setting participants have white-box access to the model itself and to the data used to train it. Naturally, these attacks are considered a breach of privacy and hinder collaboration. In this work, we propose a novel protocol leveraging secure multi-party computation techniques to prevent inference attacks in a sequential setting. To achieve this, we require participants to jointly determine a training order. While doing so, we ensure participants only receive information on whom to send their data to. This means participants are unaware of whose data they are receiving. With this work, we contribute a practical protocol that is robust against inference and timing attacks to facilitate privacy-preserving sequential collaborative learning. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to prevent inference attacks using a secure multi-party selection protocol with overhead of only a few seconds.","Secure Multi-Party Computation; Collaborative Learning; Privacy; Applied Cryptography; Inference Attacks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In orthopaedic and dental surgery, bone grafts are used by surgeons as substitutes for the patient’s own bone. A bone graft provides support to the skeletal structure and stimulates the ingrowth of new bone. There is a growing demand for bone grafts due to an increasing world population and an ageing demographic. Tissue banks produce bone grafts originating from either human bone or animal bone. Bone grafts have been investigated profoundly. However, there is no literature that provides a standard protocol for the production process of bone grafts. The current production processes for bone grafts are inefficient because of many manual interferences by humans and consist of many complex production steps. This thesis aims to provide a bone processing protocol and investigates the first steps to developing an automated production line for bone processing. The automated production line must transform fresh donor bone to an end-product that is a clean and sterile allograft consisting of bone mineral and collagen. There is a hiatus in the knowledge about processing bone with multiple ultrasonic frequencies. This thesis provides new insights in processing bone with ultrasonic frequencies. Acoustic cavitation is produced by ultrasound and is used as a mechanical cleaning force. The literature review suggested that combining ultrasound frequencies is beneficial for cleaning. Low ultrasonic frequencies of 35 kHz have a better potential in removing large particles such as blood clots. High frequencies of 130 kHz are better for cleaning small particles such as small lipids and virus particles. This thesis researches the combination of multiple ultrasonic frequencies which should lead to optimal cleaning results. This thesis solves these research goals through an iterative process based on an extensive literature review, numerical modelling, testing and analysing cleaning procedures for bone samples. Human femoral heads were used as test samples. This thesis contributes new knowledge for cleaning bone with ultrasound and generates a new design for an automated process for cleaning bones.","automated production; ultrasound; ultrasonic cleaning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

However, the cost functions of these routing protocols are currently too deterministic, making it possible for curious transaction participants to comprise the identity of sender and receiver by computing the optimal path themselves.<br/>Here we show that we can increase the anonymity of this network by adding randomness to these routing algorithms. More specifically, during path computation we will randomly deviate from the optimal path by hopping to a random node and continue by computing a new optimal path from there. The unpredictability of this process improves the anonymity of the network, such that malicious nodes can identify the sender and recipient of transactions with negligible probability in most cases.","Payment Channel Networks; Lightning; Routing; Anonymity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Automation is realised by Allaart in the form of a conversational agent (CA), but needs a better schema classification algorithm to improve its efficacy. The goal of this study is to evaluate the k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) algorithm along with Allaart’s dataset. The main question of the study is as follows: How well can a schema be automatically classified from a text using KNN? The method comprises of an experimentalpipeline consisting of 4 stages: Labeling of dataset; pre-processing of the data; schema classification; and evaluation. kNN performed satisfactory in multi-label binary classification with a mean accuracy of 71% and a mean weighted f1-score of 0.62. kNN did not outperform other classification algorithm and performed inadequate in ordinal classification. Results indicate a contrast between majority and minority classes and found a recall of 100% on one of the majority classes. Hence, the data set is concluded to be imbalanced. Due to limitations on the dataset and the CA no reliable conclusion can be made on the performance of kNN in automated schema classification.

Often times people will further ’process’ milk for other food products. Examples of these include boiling milk to make hot chocolate or freezing it for ice-cream. These temperature changes can have great influence on the bio-availability of the Calcium. The goal of this thesis was to find the effect of temperature on the bio-availability of Calcium in milk. This was done through 2 experiments. Dialysing skim bovine milk at temperatures between 4-90°C and heating or cooling the bovine milk to temperatures between -18°C-95°C and then dialysing at room temperature. The dialysis separates the soluble and insoluble phase of milk allowing for the calculation of percentage soluble calcium which is a good indicator for bio-availability of calcium in milk. It was found that there is a linear relationship between the temperature of the milk and the percentage soluble Calcium, the higher the temperature of the milk the lower the amount of bio-available calcium in the milk. Furthermore when looking at the heated milk it was found that heating to 60°C and above all showed a similar drop in percentage soluble calcium indicating some permanent loss of bio-available calcium. This permanent loss is however lower than what can be observed to be lost in the milk whilst hot indicating that a portion of the calcium that becomes insoluble upon heating returns to the soluble phase once returned to its original temperature.","bioavailability; milk; calcium","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Science and Technology","",""

Therefore, everybody works at home with either a suitable or an unsuitable home work environment. During this ‘mass experiment’ new insights can be gathered on the experience of homeworking and the influence the home work environment has on productivity. Employees are sometimes forced to carry out certain work activities at home that were considered unsuitable beforehand.

First, a literature review is conducted to have a clear overview of what already has been researched on the topic of homeworking and the work environment related to productivity. From the literature study, a theoretical model is developed. This theoretical model includes the home work environment, divided into the physical home work environment and the social environment, the satisfaction with the home work environment, and individual control variables being of influence on the perceived productivity. It was predicted that all these elements affect productivity, both directly and indirectly.<br/><br/>The findings from the literature review are tested by statistical analyses (N = 36,102). Bivariate and regression analyses were performed, followed by integral path analysis.

(mentor); Geurts, E.H.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This research investigated the determinant effect of public green spaces (PGS) on high-rise housing prices in Rotterdam. The growing population and tendency of people to gravitate towards city centers, have led to an increase in high-rise residential buildings in The Netherlands. It is therefore of high importance to optimize the integration of these buildings within its surroundings to increase the liveability, an important aspect of this is PGS. The gap in literature and social problems showed that there is a current mismatch with the desired and current needs of PGS regarding residents of high-rise buildings. The importance of PGS for residents of high-rise buildings is reflected by the housing price. The housing price indicates how much residents are willing to pay for certain variable of PGS and was used to evaluate different variables of PGS. The variables of PGS are divided into five domains: the environmental, social, cultural, functional and safety domain. Each of the domains indirectly affects the liveability of residents and citizens. The domains are identified by a comparison between international studies and Dutch municipal vision documents. The identified variables of the domains are further analyzed by a quantitative research, performed by a hedonic pricing model (HPM). Within this HPM, nine high-rise buildings were selected in the city of Rotterdam that provided an input of 977 apartments for the HPM. The regression showed a generally positive determinant effect of PGS on the housing price for high-rise buildings in Rotterdam. The strongest effect is the presence of having a PGS within 300m from the apartment, which impacts the housing price with a maximum of 17.7%. The view effects included in the HPM show a positive effect for both the number of green views and the specific PGS. The effects of the other PGS domains are correlated with the distance and view variables which makes it complex to quantify the effects of these domains separately. Interviews with developers of high-rise buildings, Stichting Hoogbouw and the municipality of Rotterdam were conducted to validate the results of the regression analysis and to assess the variables and aspects that are more difficult to objectively measure, such as the attractiveness of PGS. The main take-away of this research is that PGS have a positive determinant effect on the housing price of high-rise buildings which emphasizes the importance of having PGS nearby high-rise buildings. This study could be used as part of a reference approach for marketing research or during approval sessions regarding investment decisions to make stronger argumentations to implement PGS in the surrounding of high-rise buildings.","Public green space (PGS); high-rise building; residential; housing price; regression analysis; liveability; Hedonic pricing model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

There are many ways a computer could aid the creation of this form of art by determining how the image is being distorted, but in most cases a regular artist would not know specific geometric details of the scene.

These are protocols used to reach an agreement on common values, action or datum in a distributed system through sending it in a message for other processes to accept it \cite{bracha1987asynchronous}. Byzantine processes are processes that hinder the network from reaching the agreement by sending malicious (malicious processes) or faulty messages(faulty processes).\newline \newline Many broadcast protocols for distributed systems have been presented, depending on the topology, synchronicity(the network is asynchronous or synchronous), etc. One of these protocols, we are going to refer to as Bracha-Dolev, has been presented in the paper Practical Byzantine Reliable Broadcast on Partially Connected Networks\cite{bonomi2021practical}. Bracha-Dolev protocol can be used to reach an agreement in at least 2f+1-connected, asynchronous network \cite{bonomi2021practical}.\newline The second protocol we're going to come across in this paper is a protocol we're going to refer to as Bracha-CPA. Both Bracha-Dolev and Bracha-CPA are built by combining two protocols. Bracha-Dolev is built through combining the protocol presented by Gabriel Bracha \cite{bracha1987asynchronous} and the protocol presented by Danny Dolev et al \cite{dolev1982efficient}. We're going to refer to these protocols with Bracha's and Dolev's protocol. Bracha-CPA is built combining Bracha's broadcast protocol and the protocol presented by Chiu-Yuen \cite{koo2004broadcast} called Certified Propagation Algorithm.\newline There are two important metrics when talking about broadcast protocol the first one is the average message complexity which is the average number of messages until all processes accept the message. The second is the average delivery time, which is the average time until all the processes deliver the message. This paper demonstrates that by applying some of the optimizations applied to Bracha-Dolev \cite{bonomi2019multi}, we can decrease the average message complexity of Bracha-CPA up to 20\%. the average delivery time doesn't seem to decrease. The paper will also demonstrate that CPA has the highest probability of succeeding on a network with a k-diamond or k-pasted graph when we have a maximum number of Byzantine nodes.","Bracha-Dolev; Bracha-CPA; broadcasting protocol","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Their total length surpasses 150 Km and was completed in four stages, with lack of data forcing stage two’s exclusion. The stages modeled are separated in a Local and Regional system, the latter is assumed to connect the Zagros mountains foothills and Bandawai area with the capital of the era (early 6th century BCE) Nineveh, through a mix of artificial channels, canalized rivers, and streams. Two models were used AquaCrop and Sobek, with the former for crop and latter for flow simulations. Two feeder channel widths (1- 2 m), along with three inflow (“Wet”- “Reference”- “Dry”) and control (Absent, Maximum, Limited) choices are modeled with Sobek, adding up to 14 hydraulic scenarios. Noteworthy is that “Dry” year agriculture requires irrigation throughout the hole region and both seasons (Spring-Autumn), with results presenting around 60% gains in harvest amounts when control is applied for the Regional<br/>System. Although navigation feasibility was not thoroughly explored, “Reference”<br/>(and consequently “Wet”) year inflows show water depths rising to or higher<br/>than the accepted. Concluding a decisive answer to the “archeological debate” of<br/>Sennacherib’s motivation for construction of such massive infrastructure is impossible with present data (Environment, canal, social) available. Circumstances favoring control and therefore planned rural irrigation (rather than capital-centered) for Nineveh’s hinterlands are analyzed and discussed. Lastly a few interventions seen as valuable for further modeling studies were suggest towards the members of the LoNAP team as a contribution to their upcoming field survey.","ancient Mesopotamia; irrigation systems; watercourse networks; SOBEK; AquaCrop model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Resources Engineering","",""

TU Delft campus is part The Hague-Rotterdam metropolitan region and an important green-blue connector with the surrounding forest-meadow-river landscape. However, there is limited opportunities in the human-centric campus to accommodate other species. Also, with the added pressure of climate change, the campus experiences more intense precipitation and longer drier periods. The lack of a stimulating environment falls short in igniting a sense of environmental stewardship which would contribute to sustainable practices for the urban ecosystem. In view of the situation, TU Delft is envisioned as a biodiverse, climate resilient and playful campus that engages humans, the built environment, plants and animals. The approach of the project is guided by the key principles and tool kits generated from case studies and theories. 20 existing fauna species in Delft are identified to allow for the consideration of potential species to be accommodated in the campus. Strategies of different scales are implemented to achieve the redefined campus. Through understanding the landscape characteristics on the regional scale, the surrounding landscape characteristics of forest, river and wet meadow is extended and introduced into the campus. Patches and corridors are improved and increased through methods such as multi-tiered planting. A living machine is designed on the TU North with a cleansing biotope system to ensure good quality water for habitat creation and play. Mobility network is redesigned to transform streets into parks and introduce green tram lines. Buildings are involved in the creation of vibrant campus by providing opportunities for human play, hosting habitats and storing water. The project involves stakeholders through engagement with the Green Manager of the Campus, Rene Hoonhout and received consultation from specialist of landscape engineering, landscape architecture and biologist. There is an ONSITE construction plan for the improvement of the banks of a canal within the campus. This project creates a framework for cities that aspires to become more biodiverse, climate adaptive and vibrant. TU Delft campus shall become an exciting and fun campus city for all, with an ecosystem that supports other species apart from humans. During extreme climate scenarios, the campus is also able to cope with heat and water stress with its self-regulating system.","Landscape Architecture; Urban Ecology; Ecology; Ecocity; Urban Nature; Biodiversity; Circularity; Climate adaptation; Resilience; Play; Playscape; Architecture; TU Delft; Delft; Campus; ONSITE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","52.0022, 4.3736"

Meanwhile, the coastal zone is exposed to several climate change disasters in the context of a sensitive environment dominated by water. It is considered with limited resources and capacities to respond to stress, thus the coastal zone is also one of the most vulnerable ecosystems. This master thesis in Landscape Architecture focuses on the Northern Java island, specifically Pekalongan city, Indonesia. The local see a dilemma between natural resources and batik development, for this dominant industry is highly reliant on water. Pekalongan people actively fight against natural disasters and try to boom the cultural significance. But, without understanding the natural process and resilience thinking, the interventions are slightly ineffective, and even could be counterproductive from a long-term perspective. Therefore the objective of the thesis is to create a resilient landscape framework to facilitate water safety and batik development in Pekalongan city by focusing on the three dominant water-related design assignments, known as water circulation, discharge capacity, and coastal protection. Moreover, the project aims to consolidate and enhance the cultural significance of batik and raise awareness of landscape potentials. Under the resilient landscape theoretical framework, with the guidance of landscape- based solutions, the project seeks to build a new relationship between people and nature to mitigate the threats of climate change disasters and batik development from a long term and sustainable perspective. Design research and research by design provide the methods to conduct the investigations. The design work is conducted in three different scales, proposing strategies on a regional scale; detailed elaboration on selected sites; infrastructure design. Besides, a toolbox is also included to provide inspirations and glues for coastal zones which face similar threats and dilemmas as Pekalongan city.","Resilient coastal landscape; Research by design; Water safety; Batik; Indonesia; Water circulation; Discharge capacity; Coastal protection; Landscape architecture; Nature-based solution; Sponge capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","-6.888701, 109.668289"

This report covers Markov chains on a finite space that are homogeneous in time and mainly follows the structure of ''Markov Chains and Mixing Times''. Markov chains exhibit a strong connection with electric networks. We exploit such a connection and apply the laws of physics to answer several probabilistic questions about random walks, which are certain types of Markov chains. This connection is then called the electric network approach and is built on translating the random walk into an electric network by relating the transition probability to the so-called conductance. The electric network approach provides problem simplification tools, such as the Series/Parallel Law, and powerful inequalities, such as the Nash-Williams inequality. These tools are based on physics and are often more intuitive than their probabilistic counterpart. <br/><br/>We simulate a two-dimensional random walk that starts at the center of a square and ''escapes'' if it reaches the perimeter of the square before returning to the center. We then compare this escape probability to an upper bound, which results from using the Nash-Williams inequality. The sharpness of the upper bound depends on the choice of edge-cutsets. We find that choosing edge-cutsets with a minimal amount of edges gives a sharper upper bound, than choosing edge-cutsets that contain all the edges of the square. The relation between the upper bound and the escape probability seems to be independent of the size of the square. Furthermore, we provide proofs that are not explicit in ''Markov Chains and Mixing Times'' and ''Reversible Markov Chains and Random Walks on Graphs'' and add to the contents of ''Markov Chains and Mixing Times'' by studying random walks from a graph theory perspective.","Markov chains; random walk; Nash-Williams inequality; electric networks","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two of the most prominent ones are Cirlinq, an asset management platform for documenting building facades, and FaSA (Façade Service Applicate), a collective of stakeholders aiming to use drones and image recognition technology predict the maintenance requirement of facades. There are also attempts to extend the producers' responsibility by developing new business models in collaboration with TU Delft, resulting in developing a Façade Leasing Business model. However, despite these several initiatives and the emergence of new technology to facilitate them, there was still a lack of clarity on how they can be integrated to collect, organize and use façade information to enable decision-making at its End of service. <br/><br/>The first steps of the research involved conducting a literature review on the current state of the art in Circularity, the façade industry, and digital technology in the lifecycle of a façade. A preliminary framework was generated that conceptually maps out the information generated in the lifecycle of a façade, a data structure to store this information, and a conceptual framework for a façade product passport. Based on this preliminary framework, several hypotheses were tested and validated or refuted using surveys and interviews, which helped develop a more detailed framework. This contains detailed process maps of stakeholder roles in the supply chain of the façade, the digital methods used, and information exchanged in the process.<br/><br/>Several criteria are identified by referring to additional literature that can influence the End of Service (EoS) scenario of a façade and are categorized and arranged into decision trees, which eventually can form a framework for a computational tool. These are then grouped into modules which, when processed together, results in a decision. The criteria were then co-related to the information currently exchanged by the stakeholders to determine what is most crucial to making a decision. During this process, it was found that most information required to make a decision is un-processable by computational methods; firstly, they are in unstructured data formats such as documents, and secondly, the necessary criteria to make a decision are subjective and still need human interpretation. Therefore, the decision-making framework can either be used to evaluate existing facades scheduled for demolition or determine the crucial information to be entered in the passport for facades that are not yet constructed. <br/><br/>The entire framework from information capture, organization, and end-of-life decision-making is then demonstrated with information received of the CiTG Façade in the TU Delft campus as part of the Façade Leasing project TU Delft. During this evaluation, it was found that several essential information about the façade not available, and hence the façade was evaluated by assuming industry-standard processes and references to external databases such as the Granta Edu Pack. Information that is available and information generated is noted, which indicates the most crucial information required for EoS Decision making. During the EoS assessment process, while the façade can be disassembled and reused, it can be done early to design a new building, as it had fixed non-modular dimensions. Many conditions have to be considered, mainly regarding sizing, geometry, positioning, and structural system of the façade while designing the building for the CiTG façade to be reused. It was also found that recycling and energy recovery of the façade is only possible if the separation between the aluminum profiles and the thermal barrier is achieved. Although specific modules such as the condition assessment and the performance assessment could not be thoroughly carried out, a table with results of the assessments is generated and therefore acts as a starting point of how this framework can eventually be used and adapted to assess different facades. This framework can be eventually be developed in an iterative manner which can expand it to cater to multiple façade typologies and eventually forming a basis for an EoS assessment tool. All the research questions are answered at the end, acting as a summary of findings. As this research is just a starting point for further in-depth research, conclusions are made regarding recommendations to the Dutch Metal Façade industry and the following possible research stages. <br","Facade; Digital Twins; Industry 4.0; Supply chain; Circular Economy; Material Passports; Database; Information Model; End of life; Decision Making; Data structure; Information Management; Framework development; Information Infrastructure; Product Passports; Circularity assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Big cities are characterized by the steady sub-urbanization of young middle-class families. Households often leave the city as soon as they want to have children, or shortly after their child is born. In the Netherlands this steady trend of out-migration has occurred since the 1960s, and will certainly continue in the 21st century (Wouden, 2001). CBS Netherlands reported in 2018 that, in the case of the four largest cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Den-Haag), some 30% to 40% of families with young children leave the city within four years of the birth of their first child (CBS, 2018). The reason these families leave the city is because the available housing is either too expensive or doesn’t meet their needs. Therefore, they are forced to move to the suburbs, leaving behind their job, family and friends in the city. Meanwhile, the city loses this middle class workers and the social cohesion that families provide. Living in a city like Rotterdam is beneficial for the development of the child since cities offer children exposure and better opportunities to experience public spaces (museum, cinema, etc.) and interact with a diverse range of people. Living in a city is beneficial for parents since they can live near their work, family, social life. Reasons why young families are leaving the city is because their housing needs are not met. By translating the needs of children (space to play, learn and living) and parents (work, leisure, peace of mind and living) into a design proposal, families will stay in the city.","Young families; M4H, Rotterdam; Modern families; Collective Housing; Dutch Housing; Children; family dwelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.907639, 4.432083"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Refurbishment is a critical strategy in the circular economy (Bocken et al., 2016). Despite the environmental and financial benefits, refurbished products are not a popular consumer choice (Mugge et al., 2017). Refurbished products are seen as old, used and of low quality, and consumers worry that products are contaminated with traces of a prior user (Mugge et al., 2017). This lack of consumer acceptance is perceived as too risky for companies to make the financial investments needed for refurbishment. In theory, refurbishment can be implemented in any product category. But, not every product category is equally popular. Partly due to the lack of consumer interest, the refurbishment of personal care products remains unexplored (Mugge et al., 2017). Because of this, many products and components go to scrap before the end of their functional life. To exploit this potential, consumers need to see the value of refurbished personal care products. To this end, this project has aimed to explore ways for designers to enhance the consumer acceptance of refurbished products through product design. This raised the question of how hygiene perception influences the will to buy refurbished. Hygiene is related to the consumer’s fear of contamination. Consumer interviews suggest that hygiene is mainly perceived in relation to complexity. Features like buttons, small corners, and split lines negatively influence the refurbished product’s acceptance. This suggests that product complexity negatively affects the perceived ease of cleaning. Findings also show that the colour white and smooth surface finishing are favourable for a refurbished product due to their associations with hygiene and medical products. From this research, it can be stated that improving the hygiene perception will cause a slightly increased willingness to buy refurbished. The research findings led to the following conclusion on the influence of design aesthetics on the acceptance of the refurbished product: ‘Aesthetics influence the acceptance via associations but will not be the deciding aspect for solving the overarching societal problem that stands in the way of refurbished product acceptance; misconceptions about refurbishment’. That does not mean that aesthetics have no influence at all. Creating positive associations through aesthetics can increase the willingness to buy refurbished (Huang et al., 2020). This project concludes that, for the Lumea, especially associations with luxury, hygiene and durability positively influence the acceptance of the refurbished product. Based on this redesign process, it was concluded that design for refurbishment is not a quick fix or stand-alone design activity. It is a mindset best developed through experience. Every product and context is unique. There are no guidelines or rules to follow, which apply in every situation. The proposed skills for designers to incorporate the refurbishment design mindset are (1) consumer empathy, (2) product lifetime management and (3) ecosystem thinking. To help designers to develop these skills, a tool was created in the shape of a canvas. Each box on this canvas focuses on a different aspect of refurbishment, ranging from the different consumers in different lifetimes to ideation on aesthetics features and concerns.","Consumer Products; Refurbishment; Design Tool; Consumer research; Disassembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double Degree in Strategic Product Design and Integrated Product Design","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

To make wind energy more cost-effective, new wind turbines are becoming larger in size and are placed further offshore. This results in deeper waters, making the installation more difficult. The current methodology uses a jack-up vessel, butt will not be capable of installing the next generation of XXL wind turbines. The legs will simply be too short and the monopile too heavy. Floating vessels with a dynamic positioning system are believed to be the solution since they are able to operate in deeper waters and are assumed to be more time efficient. The foundation of a windturbine needs to be installed within an angle of tolerance of 0.25°. In order to control the position of the monopile during the installation, a Motion Compensated Gripper Frame can be used. This research focuses on the control design of such a gripper frame. The goal is to design a robust multi-model controller for the gripper frame which will guide the monopile during the installation. The controller should minimise the angle output of the system, the used control force and the resulting force which is experienced by the vessel. One of the main challenges is the unknown soil stiffness. This model parameter has large effects on the system dynamics and will show large uncertainties during installation. The robust stability property is shown for the designed cascade controllers. The implementation of these controllers in a multi-model controller show stable results. The fast inner-loop measures the position of the gripper and is able to reject any vessel motion disturbance. The slower outer-loop compensates for angle deviations of the monopile. The optimal controller is activated for the different operating points using gain-scheduling. Compared to gain-scheduling with two controllers, three controllers reduce the mean resulting force on the vessel with 50% and the total required power by 0.06% during the installation. But the deviations of the angle of the monopile increases with 5% but does not violate the set constraints. The results show a stable system for all the changing degrees of soil stiffness. The developed method makes it possible to install the next generation XXL wind turbines in deeper waters, and replaces the current limited method which uses jack-up vessels. Using the designed cascade multi-model controller will result in a robustly stable controller which minimises the used control forces and power. Which in the end minimises the costs of this gripper construction and making the wind-industry even more cost-effective.","Winturbines; multi-model; motion compensated; PID control; Robust Stability Analysis; gain-scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-06-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Automation support in the form of gaze-contingent feedback might be the solution for these errors. Using the SEEV model, operator’s attention allocation can be predicted and using live gaze data, the driver’s attention guided towards areas of interest.<br/>Methods: An experiment was designed in which twenty participants monitored an automated vehicle and performed a secondary task: either indicating cars driving next to them or monitoring dial crossings. Using an Eye tracker, gaze data was measured and compared to a predictive attention allocation model, gaze-contingent visual feedback was provided when deviating to much from the SEEV prediction. Participants performed each task with and without gaze-contingent feedback in three different driving situations.<br/>Results: The results showed that participants were more actively allocating their attention over all areas of interest with the support of gaze-contingent feedback. They performed more saccades and fixations distributed over the monitor. The fit of the observed percentage dwell time (PDT) on the predicted PDT also improved using gaze- contingent feedback. The task performance of the dial crossing secondary task decreased significantly with feedback on, while the task performance of the hazard perception task did not change.<br/>Conclusion: Attention allocation in complex environments can successfully be predicted using the SEEV model, and implemented in a gaze-contingent feedback model. Attention was divided better and more in line with the predicted PDT with gaze-contingent feedback on, but the current implementation did not improve the secondary task performance.","SEEV Model; Gaze-Contingent; Attention Allocation; Visual Feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the aviation, maritime and oil&amp;gas sector, the potential benefit in yearly savings deriving from the reduction of turbulent skin-friction drag through active flow control are estimated in the millions of U.S. Dollars and million tonnes of CO2 emissions. Research in this topic has brought forward numerous techniques, offering enticing drag reduction performance. However, no technique has yet proven to be suitable for large scale application in the aviation sector. A small research stream has been initiated in the field of rotating disc actuators for skin-friction drag reduction. Currently, research on this topic is limited to low Reynolds number numerical simulations, that are not representative of flight conditions.This thesis project aims at investigating the disc actuator performance in terms of drag reduction and power balance at friction Reynolds numbers higher than current literature on disc actuators. This has been achieved through direct numerical simulations, using an incompressible channel flow solver adapted for the implementation of the disc actuators. In total two disc configurations have been tested at friction Reynolds number Reτ=180, 550 and Reτ =1000. The disc diameter and tip velocity scaled in viscous units are kept constant across the Reτ range. The simulation results confirm the positive drag reduction performance observed in previous literature at Reτ =180. With increasing Reτ, a decrease in drag reduction performance is observed, with skin-friction drag reduction going from 21.6% at Reτ =180 to 16.01% Reτ =1000. The net power saving of the disc actuators show small variation with increasing Reτ, with an optimal net power saving at Reτ =1000 at -3.2%. Visualizations of local velocity profiles and local time averaged velocity have highlighted the disc influence to be limited in the region below y+&lt; 400. Thus, the performance of disc actuators at friction Reynolds number higher than Reτ =1000 should be less influenced by the Reynolds number. Comparison with experimental testing of disc actuators from a parallel thesis study have shown good qualitative agreement between experimental and computational results. Lastly, the consistency in the drag reduction, net power balance result and disc velocity distribution within the boundary layer seem to reinforce the hypothesis that the disc performance scales with the disc diameter and tip velocity expressed in wall units.The outlook of this research shows that the performance of disc actuators at friction Reynolds numbers more representative for flight applications puts disc actuators on par with other passive skin-friction drag reduction techniques such as riblets in terms of net power saving. However, the reinforcement of the hypothesis that disc performance scales in wall units may result in too small actuators for flight conditions, resulting in more difficult full scale implementation.","CFD; DNS; Drag Reduction; skin-friction; Numerical Simulation; Flow Control; Disc actuators; Turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Optimal decision trees omit this heuristic and exhaustively search - with many optimization techniques - for the best possible tree. In addition, training an ensemble of decision trees with some randomness has proven to outperform a single decision tree. This technique is called random forests. This research brings the techniques of optimal decision trees and random forests together to construct Forests of Optimal Trees. The two most important categories of random forest generation techniques are tree-generation randomization and input-data randomization. Whereas the first is not directly applicable with optimal decision trees as that would disqualify every guarantee of optimality, the latter technique is compatible. In terms of accuracy, Forests of Optimal Trees outperform the heuristic random forests in some cases but are inferior in other cases. This difference is data-dependent. The main disadvantage of Forests of Optimal Trees is that the generation of these forests can be a few orders of magnitude slower than the heuristic forests. Nonetheless, in scenarios where a small gain in classification accuracy can have important advantages, and the cost of the time and computation power are worth it, Forests of Optimal Trees can be useful classifiers.","Optimal Decision Tree; Random Forest; Decision Tree; Machine Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The layout concludes with some of my critical conclusions to design with the aim of diffusing the concept of bricolage as a guiding approach that everyone should consider, and find the bricoleur hidden in them.","bricolage; reuse; nijmegen; alterity; authenticity; molenpoort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

TabFuzz reproduces the BigFuzz implementation and extends on it, by improving the generation of random input files. TabFuzz can generate a valid input file based on an input specification. It then mutates this file using high-level mutations. These mutations generate new test inputs that mimic real-world problems. This is an improvement over bit or byte level mutations. These mutations are supposed to mimic real-world problem, which is an improvement over random bit or byte level mutations. Most fuzzing programs start from a user-defined initial input file, called a seed file. TabFuzz offers the possibility to generate such a file. This research shows that these generated files are just as effective as starting from a seed file.","Tabular data; Fuzz testing; Test generation; Automated testing; Big data","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(Wilson, 2020) Like this quote, cities are constantly changing. After development, it declines and regains vitality through urban regeneration. These cities are sometimes likened to living organisms. Cities that have lost their vitality and declined due to these characteristics seek ways to revive the city. After World War II, industrial cities introduced art and culture as catalysts for urban regeneration. Art, which was introduced to revitalize the economy, has expanded its meaning to ideas about community, urban history, artists, and aesthetics. Art is now used as an industrial city and as a means of urban regeneration in various urban contexts. What is art in art-led urban regeneration? Art appears in various forms in the city. It is not limited to visible paintings, performances, or music, but more appearances. The Heesterveld creative community shows that in a nutshell. Here, art sometimes appears as an artist community, a neighborhood party where residents perform together and combined with Suriname culture. There is something here beyond the art of painting and music that we commonly perceive. The project is a new project to portray the various forms of art and the potential of art in the urban area. It is also a project to test what role architecture can play to root those various arts in the community deeply. <br/>Like the project's title, BEYOND ART BEYOND COMMUNITY, the project aims to create a more expanded community by planting various art forms beyond what we commonly think of as paintings and music in the community. After all, it is a project that aims to draw a new value on the canvas of cities beyond art and community.","heritage & Architecture; Urban regeneration; artist community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

Two design strategies were developed for both activities and evaluated by PhD candidates and a design practitioner. This concluded that the strategies meet most of the requirements of a strategy (Wiese et. al., 2020), and could support designers. Recommendations to improve the strategies were composed and presented in the report. The conducted research and developed strategies contributed to existing knowledge by showing how designers can promote sustained well-being on an activity level.

Thehigh number of trips by car within cities lead to challenges related to the accessibility, livability, and sustainability of cities. Sustainable mode alternatives in this research are the bicycle, shared bicycle, and urban public transport whichhave potential for being an attractive alternative on short trips (&lt;5 kilometer). Therefore, this study researches factors that influence car users’ mode choice towards those three sustainable modes, for stand-alone trips with trip purpose shopping. Through a stated preference survey amongst car drivers in a Dutch mid-sized city (N=360), preferences are gathered with respect to the mode choice. A panel mixed logit model with error component and interaction variables is used for the analysis of the stated preference data. The factors with most impact on mode choice are (shared) bicycle travel time, bicycle parking costs, shared bicycle availability, public transport travel costs, and public transport in-vehicle crowdedness. The non-mode factor with most impact is attitude towards tram, which is negatively correlated to car frequency. Car users tend to switch towards public transport, so a guaranteed seat in public transport, a more positive attitude towards public transport and higher car parking costs can achieve the switch. The switch towards bicycle can be made if the bicycle travel time is lower than currently.","mode choice; car users; stated preference; discrete choice modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Multi­-material 3D inkjet printing has great potential for rapid prototyping and manufacturing of functional mesoscale structures when novel inks are combined into a fully integrated AM-process. This process can be faster and cheaper than conventional methods to produce functional structures. Research is conducted on a large range of potentially inkjet­-printable materials to extend current possibilities with 3D inkjet printing. Material incompatibility together with strict fluid properties limit the range of multifunctional inks available for an integrated print process. This raises challenges such as printing with three or more materials, and finding inkjet printable materials that can be cured simultaneously using the same curing method. The aim of this research is to print functional structures using at least three materials consisting of a structural, support, and conductive material, requiring only one curing technique involving UV light exposure. An experimental setup of PiXDRO LP50 inkjet printers and various printhead assemblies are used to conduct experiments. Suitable off the shelf available inks are selected after a state of the art literature review. Stratasys Vero­series and Stratasys SUP706B are industry standard, compatible materials and cure using UV induced photopolymerisation. They are chosen as structural and support material, respectively. Novacentrix Metalon JS­B25P and Mitsubishi NBSIJ­MU01 silver nanoparticle inks are chosen as conductive inks. First, multi­material printing is set up and extended to 3D printing using the structural and support material inks only. Afterwards, conductive inks are tested for resistivity and behaviour on different substrates before integrating with the structural and support material ink into a multi­material 3D print. Conductive nanoparticle inks show good conductivity on photopaper substrate, but not when printed on top of structural material. Several experiments are performed to document ink behaviour and optimise performance. A workflow is designed allowing the conversion of complex CAD models to inkjet ­printable files. Custom support material density for stronger supports can be generated using an in-­house developed conversion application. Proof­ of ­concept multi­-material functional structures are printed showcasing success of the proposed methodology.<br","inkjet; printing; 3D Printing; UV; sintering; photopolymerisation; Multi-Material; Additive Manufacturing; microstructure; Conductive 3D printing; Support structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Our client for this project, the Dutch National Police, requested a variety of potential solutions for visualising (unfamiliar) indoor environments that can be viewed by both external command centres, and internal operations units. Currently, unknown interior layouts (or layouts that are different in practise to what is stated on paper) can have serious, sometimes even life-threatening, consequences in time-sensitive situations. This project uses a game engine to directly visualise point cloud data input of indoor environments. The primary aim is to find ways of clearly communicating a point cloud of an environment to a layman viewer through intuitive visualisations, to aid decision-making in high-stress moments. The final product is a variety of visualisation concepts, hosted within a game engine in order to allow users to navigate throughout (part of) a building, and customise certain interaction features. To aid the layman viewer, various interpretation methods (e.g. cartography) are considered. The Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project was designed and developed based on the requirements given by Dutch Police, and consisted of 4 modules: data preprocessing, render style, functional module, and User Interface (UI). An indoor point cloud dataset is used for the implementation, while corresponding mesh and voxel models are also respectively generated and evaluated as reference objects. The implemented software product is evaluated based on a Structured Expert Evaluation Method and finally our project result demonstrates that point cloud has unique advantages for visualisation of indoor environments especially in pre-processing efficiency, detail level, and volume perception.","3D visualisation; 3D Perception; Unreal Engine 4; Point Cloud; Crisis Environment; Indoor Environment","en","student report","","","","","","https://github.com/peterliu502/IndoorPointCloudViewer Repository link The GitHub repository of this project.","","","","","","Geomatics","Synthesis Project 2021",""

These requisites render them incompatible with early-stage design decision-making pertaining to form-finding. By performing solar energy potential simulations at the pre-conceptual design phase, the necessary time for later-stage environmental assessments and design improvements is reduced considerably, while building designs with high performance but low environmental footprint are attained.<br/><br/>This research proposes a computational framework to navigate voxel-based morphologies of building envelopes in a performative design space. It investigates a generative workflow through an embedded multi-criteria optimization of solar-related indicators, which are mapped in a solar energy potential field. The formulation of this field consists of an a priori assessment of the solar energy potential in every discrete volumetric unit (voxel) and a vectorized description of the interdependency of them. The astronomical size of this solution space renders the use of metaheuristic methods more appropriate. More specifically, a subtractive strategy that incorporates an MCDA approach is being applied in order to reach user-defined optimization targets. The novelty and potential of the proposed methodology lies in streamlining the early decision making process for designers and architects and expanding the morphological possibilities. Through this framework, the performative design space is effectively navigated and nearly optimal solutions are generated, to act as suggestive mechanisms for informed architectural decisions.<br","Generative Design; Computational Design; Solar potential; Topology Optimisation; Multi Criteria Decision-Making; sustainability indicators","en","student report","","","","","","","","2023-06-25","","","","","",""

Moreover, it also has a transformability quality, in which the neighbourhood’s function shifts, enriches and organically grows over time. This project believes that time is the dimension that allows people to add layers of growth to their environment. Understanding the Kampung qualities can help create intervention and framework to tackle Hoptille’s socio-spatial issues, hence improving its resilience. Based on the qualities mentioned above, Clipping Kampung is designed as an intervention that offers flexibility and option towards future needs by accommodating the change of functions or size in the Hoptille neighbourhood more flexibly while also promoting higher adaptability.","Heritage & Architecture; Hoptille; Amsterdam; Dutch Housing; Kampung; 80s; Open Building; Participatory Design; Resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","52.309502, 4.954290"

The ingredients making up the concrete mix and the curing age can be used as predictors for the com­pressive strenght.<br/><br/>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are machine learning algorithms that have been used since the nine­teen sixties and were inspired by the way neurons work in the brain. Previous researches suggest that ANNs have great potential to predict concrete compressive strength.<br/><br/>In this research, an Artificial Neural Network was set up using the Keras framework and was trained with concrete composition data consisting of examples of concrete recipes and their respective con­crete compressive strenghts. Then, three hyperparameter optimization methods (for loop, grid search and Bayesian optimization) were implemented in several runs. The resulting hyperparameters were used to create ANNs. Afterwards, the three methods were compared with respect to several met­ rics (R­squared score, root mean square error and running time) to see which one is the relatively best method to provide hyperparameters for the predefined ANN that learns from concrete composition data.<br/><br/>The best runs of the three hyperparameter optimization methods show similar goodness­of­fit (with negligible difference). Among these best runs, grid search has the shortest running time. Bayesian optimization provides the highest R­squared score, and has root mean square error of 4.45 [MPa] and a reasonable running time of 73 minutes. Therefore, Bayesian optimization is considered the preferable hyperparameter optimization algorithm for the concrete compressive data used as goodness­of­fit is in most cases to be considered the decisive metric for this application.

It was intriguing to see how cargo-architecture had been used to address student housing demands within the temperate climatic region. Considering the tropical climate of Ghana, this proposed project will serve as a basis for experimenting how to create a climate and eco-friendly living experience for students, thus achieving both indoor and outdoor comfort for the users. Ghana is enriched with diverse cultural values and traditions especially with respect to traditional architecture.

This reveals opportunities to build on good relationships, promote co-creation, facilitate discussion and interaction, stimulate long-term investment and commitment, and develop awareness of existing businesses. However, challenges are portrayed in the dependence of private land ownership and public support for businesses development, the urge for space availability and affordability, and the lack of operation awareness between neighbors. Hence, it is possible to recommend that place-making strategies should be implemented in a timely manner, within the relevant arena and involving the respective actors. Within industrial urban areas, it is essential to activate businesses to exploit positive interests and prevent place-breakers, while unlocking new opportunities to implement strategies that facilitate community engagement and socio-economic interaction.

It is in this block, similar to what happened along the Sava and Danube river with the Splavovi, where spontaneous citizens’ initiatives created a vivid environment in which locals together responded to their needs and desires. Due to the bankruptcy of the former Bajloni Brewery (B.I.P) in 2006, multiple empty spaces came available. These spaces were later on filled in with a large number of cafes and bars, clubs, cultural and creative centers, as well as concert halls with large, small and improvised stages. Many of the new owners used to have a place located in the Savamala district until it was demolished in the beginning of 2016, paving the way for the controversial Belgrade Waterfront project. There were rumors that the vacant industrial buildings of the old Brewery would also be turned into a luxury hotel and a shopping mall, but none of that happened. As a result, a clear statement could be made in the ongoing debate of “Don’t let Belgrade d(r)own”. The ideology behind this statement would be completely in line with the ideas of many activist groups in Serbia, who choose “The Right to the City” as their slogan, as an act of resistance against the untransparent process of the Belgrade Waterfront project. The somewhat capitalistic ambitions showed in several architectural competition entries for the infill and rehabilitation of this block offered the change to search for better solutions for this block and the city itself. As Henri Lefebvre sees the city as an Oeuvre, I believe that the artistic democratic expressions which can be experienced in Skadarlija, created by citizens themselves, can influence the future of Belgrade’s city. For this reason, a function had to be brought in that doesn’t stand far from the local people and could foster and protect the current environment – the activities, the social qualities, the enjoyment, everything that is already there. To eventually keep Skadarlija in the hands of local, from the citizens of Belgrade, from the people who built the city and its Oeuvre and everybody else who would like to contribute in all its diversity. The outcome is a residential (collective) building to give the place owners, to protect it from commercial purposes and to correctly intervene amid all kinds of bars, clubs and restaurants, to in the end prevent alienation to happen in Belgrade Bohemian Quarter.","Belgrade; Residential; Brewery; Skadarlija; Alienation; Democratic; Lefebvre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","44.817663, 20.465668"

As these issues had a particular impact on tourism around the world, government and businesses in tourist-driven cities lost their main source of income. Consequently, under these excruciating circumstances, many local entrepreneurs are not able to pay the usual high rents, hence forcing shops, restaurants, and lodging facilities to close their doors. Moreover, in these monofunctional cities, the lack of alternative markets makes finding a different use for real estate properties a difficult task, thus building’s vacancy rates are on the rise. Therefore, this research aims at developing a managerial strategy for the built environment capable of coping with the issues derived from the pandemic, while also providing relief to other intrinsic problems that these cities are facing, such as gentrification and lack of economic diversification, due to overtourism. Accordingly, by studying and analyzing the city of Venice, this research seeks to identify market trends for future scenarios in which plausible solutions can be developed and implemented. Thus, delivering a comprehensive urban strategy and policy recommendations that could help Venice and other local governments to improve their own urban resilience, in hopes for a brighter future.","overtourism; tourism gentrification; monofunctional cities; urban resilience; tourism resilience; adaptive reuse; real estate management; scenario planning; policy steering; Venice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","45.4408,12.3155"

With around 80% of the Dutch housing built before 1995 a huge portion of the energy share is tapped in the old housing stock. While new housing constructions had to be nearly energy neutral as of 2020, a large portion of the existing housing stock has a higher relative energy consumption. The old housing stock thus needs urgent energy-retrofitting that is instrumental in reaching the goals targeted by the Dutch government by 2050. The Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (EWF) system developed by Dr. Ben Bronsema (2013) during his PhD research can play an effective role in this aspect. Therefore, the research focussed on investigating the applicability of the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire system for the Housing buildings in terms of energy-efficiency and thermal comfort potential. A case study building is selected to carry out the said investigation. Several design strategies were incorporated for the case study building to design the EWF system with highest technical performance. The study also incorporated dynamic simulations to evaluate the energy performance of the building after installing the EWF system. The study concluded that the integration of the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire system has a great potential to reduce the energy consumption of the apartment buildings and improve the indoor comfort of the building and thus is a highly effective energy-retrofitting system for the housing buildings. The efficiency of the EWF system in improving the performance of the apartment buildings is thus highlighted. The effectives of the EWF system in reducing the energy consumption is dependent on the existing façade of the apartments and thus it is essential to refurbish the poor-performing façade to maximize the benefit. Thus, the study also concluded that apart from the installation of the EWF system several more improvements are needed in the existing buildings to achieve the goal of a nearly energy-neutral design.","Earth, Wind & Fire system, energy neutrality, housing refurbishment, nearly energy neutral design, indoor comfort, energy efficient buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","Sustainable design graduation studio","51.992844, 4.357422"

(mentor); Onderwater, M.C. (graduation committee); d’Hont, Floortje (graduation committee); Lazar, M. (graduation committee); van Sante, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since the Brouwersdam was built as part of the Delta plan, the Grevelingen outer delta undergoes large-scale morphological changes. These changes led to the formation of a shoal adjacent to the dam, which is referred to as the Brouwersdam beach. The beach has been eroding and shifting towards the northeast ever since. The beach has no safety function, as the hinterland is protected from flooding by the Brouwersdam. However, the beach has a large recreational value, which will decrease if no human interventions are taken. Consequently, many stakeholders demand the preservation of the beach. For the Municipality of Schouwen-Duiveland, the loss of recreational value of the beach is estimated to decrease the yearly financial benefits by 0.8 to 5.4 million euro. Hence, their interest in the preservation of the beach is large and therefore they have commissioned this study. This study aims to design nature-based solutions for the ongoing erosion and coastline shift to which the Brouwersdam beach is subjected. The design approach of this research is based on the Building with Nature (BwN) design steps. A thorough analysis of the physical, ecological and social system is followed by the set-up of a Program of Requirements (PoR) for the design. Insight in the physical system is partly obtained by a modelling study in Delft3D-WAVE and UNIBEST-CL+. Based on the PoR, designs are identified, evaluated and selected iteratively. The design iterations, based on the systems’ insights and the PoR, led to the creation of three Nature-based Solutions. The alternative solutions include the creation of a shellfish habitat by making structures of layered brushwood fascine mattresses filled with shells or other hard substratum. The shellfish reef, in which mainly Japanese oysters are expected to settle, provides many ecosystem services such as enhancing biodiversity. Moreover, the structures can be constructed CO2-neutral. The different configurations of the solutions, ensuring coastal protection, are: A groyne configuration, creating multiple pocket beaches, of 1 straight groyne and 4 L-shaped groynes with an orientation slightly tilted towards the west, i.e., the dominant wave direction (Solution A) ; A straight groyne with a west-east orientation, combined with a sediment beach fill between the current coastline and the groyne (Solution C) ; A fishtail groyne, which is a structure with a slightly curved, shore-normal groyne arm and a shore-parallel breakwater arm (Solution E). These solutions were compared with frequent nourishing (solution F) and to the reference situation, i.e. taking no action. The assessment of the solutions by means of a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), based on the categories functionality, costs, recreational value (water and beach recreation separately), ecological value and aesthetics, led to the conclusion that the designs are equally feasible but score differently on the categories. The results of the MCA thus illustrate that the conclusion on the most feasible solution depends on priority. The study concludes that preserving the Brouwersdam beach in a nature-based way is feasible. The MCA tool can potentially support future decision-making processes following this study by clarifying the trade-offs between the different designed solutions. Further exploring the economic benefits of recreational functions will contribute to validating the weight factors in these categories. The results of this study contribute to the discussion on the preservation of the Brouwersdam beach and to the strive for knowledge on ecosystem-based projects within the field of hydraulic engineering.","Nature-based solutions; Unibest-CL+; SWAN; Brouwersdam; Coastal protection; Building with Nature; Brushwood structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","51.762791, 3.843919"

(mentor); van den Boom, A.J.J. (graduation committee); van Essen, J.T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The introduction of Robotic &amp; Autonomous Systems (RAS) in modern combat seems inevitable, with clear advantages like reduced risk and extensification of personnel. To scope this research, persistent reconnaissance with heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is selected, being one of the more prominent applications. Despite continuous efforts developing advanced hardware and algorithms, real-world implementations are still lacking. The root cause seems to be that state-of-the-art algorithms deal insufficiently with the high dynamics and uncertainty in a military environment. Currently, the military uses intent-based Command &amp; Control (C2) to deal with precisely these challenges, as they are inherently tied to combat. Therefore, a conversion of the communicative principles of C2 towards a mathematical approach applicable to RAS seems promising, of which intent-based coordination is the result. To be able to deal with the high dynamics and uncertainty, three requirements are formulated. First, flexibility is needed to revise the solution locally. Secondly, robustness against unreliable communications is necessary, and thirdly, scalability is required to ensure the performance can also be maintained for larger Areas of Interest (AOIs) and larger teams of UAVs. The Single-Agent Reconnaissance Problem (SARP) and Multi-Agent Reconnaissance Problem (MARP) are formulated as a compact combination between the visitation frequency and coverage level approach for persistent reconnaissance. Based on advancements made on teamwork and organizations for Multi-Robot Systems (MRSs), a coordinative method is formulated. This coordinative method partitions an AOI for the MARP into smaller disjoint subsets, such that separate SARPs can be solved independently by each UAV. The key contribution of this research is that this coordinative method functions based on intent, enabling the required flexibility, robustness, and scalability. It does so by constructing a hierarchy of supervisors that perform distributed cooperation on overlapping subsets. This distributed problem is solved using the novel Complex Concurrent Bounding (CCB), which is an adjusted version of Concurrent Forward-Bounding (ConcFB) for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) with complex local problems. Additionally, a lower bound is generated to benchmark the obtained solutions, based on the pricing step of branch &amp; price, by applying column generation to a reformulated version of the MARP. Intent-based coordination shows flexibility against perturbations of the AOI. Especially when changes are spread out, it is not necessary to revise the solution as a whole immediately. Furthermore, if the cooperation is preemptively terminated due to failing communication, robustness is observed against the resulting suboptimal subsets. Especially for higher levels in the hierarchy, the suboptimal solutions can partially be corrected by lower levels. Lastly, the method shows a sublinear growth in computation time for increasingly larger problem instances. As such, intent-based coordination provides an exciting approach to maintain the performance of RAS even in more challenging environments.","Persistent Coverage; Coordination; Command and Control; UAVs; partitioning; Surveillance; Branch-and-Price; Multi-robot systems; Fuzzy Clustering; Task Allocation; MILP; Intent; ISR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The warehousing sector is among the top when it comes to the risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), in particular low back pain (LBP). In this sector, LBP is a prevalent issue, due to the nature of the job of lifting and moving (heavy) objects around. The issue has significant implications for the workers’ health, in terms of quality of life. Companies and society feel the consequences in terms of financial costs. This issue could be tackled by introducing smart technology in the form of a smart safety shoe. The concept has been developed by a strategic product design student and the strategic direction has been determined. This project explores the concept further and validates the idea of smart safety shoes to reduce the risk of LBP during manual handling, through technological means. <br/><br/>To understand the problem of LBP in context, extensive literature research was conducted on ergonomics. Understanding what causes it and the current methods to reduce the risks. Further, looking into the possibility of detecting causes through technology. The research results were used to build a prototype for validation of the concept.<br/><br/>The causality of LBP is not easy to point out, as multiple factors (physical, psychosocial, and individual) play a role in its development. Research does conclude that physical factors play a major role, which is related to heavy lifting, repetitiveness, and awkward postures. Manual handling can be performed safely as long as the weight is below 23 kg and correct postures are adopted. Though not all workers adhere to correct posture, and it is hard to track through observational methods.<br/><br/>Postures can be tracked or detected through plantar pressure distribution (PPD), by using pressure sensors. These sensors can be placed within safety shoes and will collect PPD data of workers. The PPD data shows certain patterns and have characteristics that can be linked to different postures. The data can be analysed using machine learning, to automate the process and could be able to give feedback to the user when a risky posture is adopted. <br/><br/>A pressure insole has been prototyped with the conducted research to collect PPD data of different postures (stoop lifting, lifting above shoulder height, and asymmetrical lifting). The collected data were manually analysed to understand how patterns may look like. A machine learning model was made, using a tree algorithm, to analyse the data as well. It can classify all the measured static postures with 100% accuracy. Dynamic lifting data were not analysed by the model yet as it needs additional data preparation. At this point, the concept needs more development to analyse dynamic data and to implement the hardware in the safety shoes. <br/><br/>Based on the results, the core components of the concept have been proven to work and able to detect different postures with great accuracy. The idea of a smart safety shoe that can detect and warn the worker of potential injury is not far-fetched. <br/><br/>This project is the first step in the development of the concept. Due to the complexity of the issue and required knowledge, additional research is needed for the continuation of the project. The posture database has to be set up, improving the machine learning model for dynamic lifting data, hardware design and a live feedback system. With these developments, a smart safety shoe could be brought to market that could improve workers' lives and save additional costs for companies.","Smart technology; Protective footwear; Smart product; Occupational safety; Ergonomics; Manual handling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Following the Paris Agreement, the national government of the Netherlands reached the Climate Agreement together with more than 100 organizations. As part of this agreement, the industry sector is faced with the ambitious goal of 59% CO2 reduction in 2030 with respect to 1990 levels. Since the naphtha cracking industry is one of the most emission-intensive industries worldwide, decarbonization of this industry can deliver a significant contribution to reaching the climate goals. Among other transformations, electrification is regarded as an important decarbonization strategy. However, electrification in the naphtha cracking industry currently faces several barriers. For an important part, these stem from fundamental uncertainties concerning the future markets, the availability of renewable electricity and the capacity of the electricity grid. Moreover, high investment costs combined with a lack of financial and fiscal incentives and low carbon prices make the business case for electrification currently unattractive. In addition, the high degree of systems integration onsite and the baseload nature of the cracking process make the implementation of electrification challenging. Government policy could play a pivotal role in resolving these barriers. The purpose of this research is therefore to explore policy options at a national level that enable an acceleration in the chemical industry’s electrification while being robust against uncertainty. For this purpose, the Robust Decision-Making (RDM) framework was applied. As part of this framework, a system dynamics (SD) model was built to describe the behavior of the socio-technical system of the naphtha cracking industry. This model was then subjected Exploratory Modelling &amp; Analysis (EMA) to simulate the impact of various policy options on the electrification rate against a large number of plausible future scenarios. Moreover, a robust policy search was conducted using a multi-objective robust optimization algorithm.The analyses of the simulation results suggest that profound changes in current policy instruments are required to achieve a significant degree of electrification in the naphtha cracking industry with sufficient certainty. It is advised to increase government funding for electrification, implement a fiscal shift away from gas towards electricity and to increase the effective carbon levy imposed on the industry. However, though the analyses show that government policy has a significant impact on the development of electrification, its success appears conditional on external factors, most importantly, developments in the energy and carbon markets. In fact, the electricity price and the ETS carbon price turn out to be more influential on emission reduction than most policy interventions. The availability of renewable electricity is the single most influential factor affecting CO2 emissions and hence, is considered paramount in achieving emission reduction. Therefore, policy aimed at accelerating electrification should be accompanied by decisive government action regarding the development of renewable electricity sources.","naphtha cracking; electrification; Chemical Industry; System Dynamcis; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Robust decision making; decarbonization; Klimaatakkoord","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Generally it means a point where two systems, subjects, organization, etc. meet and interact. A good interface would effectively raise efficiency and improve experience of the users. In concepts it also helps to interpret museum as interface, related with question: what an art experience should be in the future? Firstly, museum should interface spectators with arts. We need to think from spectators, that they are varied from different cultural and educational contexts considering the international immigrant background of South Rotterdam. Art is abstract and sophisticated for non-professionals, who would be the major group among visitors. Thus, museum should take responsibility to interface people with different levels of knowledge in order to improve their experience when encountering art. Why is their experience so important here? Here I would refer to Rosalind Krauss’s “Late Capitalist Museum” theory. Better art experience is the demand in this consumer society, take example as MoMA. In terms of spectators’ experience, Nanette Snoep’s curating theory also helps to support my position. To improve experience, the method is to create an immersive environment, which means let spectators participate into artwork during visit. The suitable art collections here would focus on interactive art, performative art, installation art, process art and folk art. Secondly, museum should interface physical space with virtual space. It is a bilateral relationship. On one hand, the aura of contemporary artworks is descending, while their interrelation with space is enhancing. Virtuality is the basis of Minimalism’s hyperspace theory, or “the fourth dimension”, also the new demand of museum space in the digital future. What museum should do in the future is to interface spectators with this “fourth dimension” space. On the other hand, people’s life is virtualizing by new technique. Majority of communication and social interaction are happening on the Internet through smart phone and PC. Although it frees human from restriction of physical condition, it also locks human in his or her own limited space. The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating this problem. Disconnection of social bonds would impair mental health, causing loneliness, anxiety, inferiority, alienation and so on (Mendelsohn, 2020). In this sense, museum should turn from a cultural institution into a social infrastructure, dragging people from virtual world into physical interaction, like Gaillard’s installation work the recovery of Discovery.","museum architecture; Interface; New media art","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Public Building","","51.896417751314246, 4.488446762002161"

Therefore, this research focuses on improving the energy consumption of an office building in the Netherlands by implementing the Earth, Wind and Fire system which utilizes the environmental energy of earth mass, wind and sun to generate and supply energy throughout the building by eliminating the use of HVAC systems. The research adopted basic and dynamic simulation models to evaluate the energy performance of the building with EWF system and ATG method to evaluate the Thermal comfort. The research concluded that the EWF system is an efficient way to reduce the energy performance of the Provinciehuis Utrecht building and by refurbishing the façade and adding PV panels, the energy consumption of the building can reduce further.

When thinking about a possible future identity, the city must cope with its complex history, present memories alive in the city and a range of different narratives that interweave with selfsame. Looking for a physical presence of Belgrade's vivid past, the Kalemegdan fortress, on the confluence of the river Sava and Danube, embodies such agglomeration. It was for centuries that Belgrade's population was concentrated only within the fortress walls. Thus, until most recent times, the fortress's history reflects on the history of Belgrade itself. Located in Belgrade's municipality of Stari Grad, it is the oldest section in the urban tissue and symbolic its core. Besides these city-specific attributes, Belgrade's artificial environment has- as for every big city- grown to an enormous extent. Therefore, the boundary between natural and artificial, these contradictions, has frown ever-expanding. However, as every large city witnesses climate change and its aftermaths, they can no longer afford to antagonise and keep nature out. Zoos have always reflected the current relation of humans with flora and fauna. In doing so, Belgrade Zoo might need a rethinking of its initial function. Partly situated in the fortress's heritage, the moats of the zoo can become an example in the city for multi-species encounter.","Anthropocene; Nature Inspired Design; Human-animal encounter; Co-habitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Methods and Analysis | Positions in Practice","","44.823200, 20.449500"

V. (mentor); Vos, F.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A child’s bone age is important for the diagnosis of a wide range of growth disorders. The most often used manual method for bone age assessment (BAA) consists of comparing hand-wrist radiographs with ’ground-truth’ atlasses. This method is criticised for being time-invasive, prone to inter- and intra-observer variability and not applicable to the present-day multicultural population. Therefore, much research has been conducted in creating automated methods for BAA, using machine or deep learning (DL). Instead of using radiographs, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans could also be used for BAA, which have the benefit of a lower effective dose. This study focuses on two gaps in current research on automated BAA: developing an automated method for the<br/>use on DXA scans and incorporating ethnic information into the algorithm.<br/>For this purpose, a DL network was constructed and pre-trained on a large data set of radiographs. Transfer learning was adopted to a data set containing DXA scans. The performance of four different models was measured in mean absolute difference (MAD) to observe the effect of adding gender and ethnic information as extra inputs. Final performance was measured on a lock box, which was kept aside during the entire training and tuning process. To gain more insight, regions important for the assessment by the automated model were being visualised using a modified version of Class Activation Mapping (CAM). Furthermore, a comparison was made with software created for automated BAA on radiographs.<br/><br/>Whether or not adding gender and ethnic information as extra inputs did not show a clear effect on the performance. The final performance on the lock box was an MAD of 6.8 months. The activation maps showed that the carpal region was the most important for the automated BAA. The comparison with the radiograph software showed it was not applicable on DXA scans and emphasised the need for a DXA-specific method.<br/><br/>This is the first study that developed an automated BAA method for the use on DXA scans rather than radiographs and the first that incorporates ethnic information inside the algorithm. An MAD of 6.8 months on a totally independent test set (lock box) is comparable with the inter-observer variability of manual BAA and performances reported for state-of-the-art automated BAA methods on radiographs. This method can contribute to reducing radiation exposure and time-intensiveness of the current BAA procedure.","Bone age; Skeletal maturation; Transfer learning; Deep Neural Networks; DXA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Abstract—During the transition from manual driving to (partially) automated driving, conflicts between human and automation should be minimized. An important factor to reduce the human-machine interaction risk is by increasing the trust drivers have in the system. A system including human-like behaviour tends to be trusted more. Accurate models of human driving behaviour are important in safety studies and the development of human-compatible automated driving. While global models exist showing the relationship between road geometry and speed control, research on models that use observable visual inputs for drivers is scarce. Previous research used a heuristic approach to develop such a model. This work extends on that basis, using machine learning to develop a model for speed control based on angles and time margins that can be extracted from the driver’s visual field. The model is developed using two optimization methods with a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network structure and training data obtained from 14 participants in a fixed-base driving simulator. Validation runs have been done by the same participants in order to validate the individual and general (one-size-fits-all) longitudinal driving models. The validation shows that a general model is able to accurately capture human longitudinal acceleration behaviour on single-lane curved high-speed roads (100km/h).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

Western Garden Cities Amsterdam orWestelijke Tuinsteden is a post-war neighbourhood considered heritage by the Municipality of Amsterdam.Currently, Westelijke Tuinsteden of Couperusbuurt fails to provide a liveable built environment forits residents. Its heritage status causes the neighbourhood to be alienated from development which ledthe neighbourhood to be outdated to the current needs. In contrast, the neighbourhood’s heritage form isalso vulnerable due to the municipality’s densification agenda. Simultaneously, some residents in Couperusbuurtare vulnerable socio-economic groups, contributing to social segregation issues in Amsterdam.This situation has pushed them out of social comfort and spatial comfort due to their dissatisfaction withtheir neighbourhoods. This research aims to identify the heritage importance of Westelijke Tuinsteden,integrate it with the spatial planning &amp; development of Couperusbuurt and translate it into possible designelements to achieve socio-spatial cohesion and a liveable Couperusbuurt.The methods used in identifying heritage are built upon theoretical studies that indicate the dynamic approachto heritage, which means that heritage value is not limited to its form. Thus, heritage has a flexiblelayer that could be integrated into the future redevelopment as long as it could transfer the initial value ormeaning. The investigation found that the heritage value in Couperusbuurt is collectivity through community.Then, in integrating it with planning, the collectivity value is translated into spatial and social planningstrategy which are community-driven spatial strategy and participatory planning. Later, these strategies areelaborated into design exploration process.The design exploration in this research is done through scenario design. Design by scenario is beneficial tovisualise extreme possibilities, accommodating different needs from different stakeholders, and as a toolof participatory planning. In doing so, there are two design scenarios which are centralised collectivity anddistributed collectivity. Each scenario shares the common ground value that is collectivity as the heritageimportance for the neighbourhood’s renewal.The output of this project will be used as a material for the ongoing Couperusbuurt’s renewal projectwhich is conducted by the Municipality of Amsterdam and Housing Corporation, Stadgenoot.","adapting heritage; neighbourhood renewal; design by scenario; participatory planning; Westelijke Tuinsteden Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","52.3563° N, 4.8096° E"

The focus of the project was on finding fitting leadership styles, structures, or behaviors that stimulate learning and help develop a learning mindset in a transdisciplinary collaboration context.To deal with the increasing complexity and urgency of societal issues – such as the aging population, climate change, and the energy transition – a new collaboration revolution has taken shape. This revolution, also referred to as convergence, is still very new. Articles available on what convergence, and the transdisciplinary collaboration as the new collaboration type therein entail, are rather vague and abstract. The HOW of the matter is not yet clear. Learning is inextricably linked to transdisciplinary collaboration due to its novelty. However, explicit attention has not been given to building in learning and a learning mindset in relation to transdisciplinary collaboration. Leadership and learning have had an existing link in literature, but have not been regarded in a setting of transdisciplinary collaboration. Taking leadership into account will enable the formulation and implementation of more concrete actions to move away from a still rather vague idea of transdisciplinary collaboration and towards actionable steps. Therefore, the combination of transdisciplinary collaboration, learning, and leadership is not only interesting and relevant from a research point of view but it will also directly influence the effectivity of convergence endeavors of the Erasmus Medical Centre (EMC), Erasmus University of Rotterdam (EUR), and Delft University of Technology (TUD) that are currently taking place. Research on the relation between transdisciplinary collaboration, learning, and leadership has not been conducted, and thus forms the main focus of this Master Thesis project. The main research question therefore is: What leadership styles, structures, or behaviors, suited for the transdisciplinary collaboration context of the Digital Twin project of the Health &amp; Technology branch of the Convergence Agenda of the Erasmus Medical Centre, the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and the Delft University of Technology, stimulate and facilitate learning and help develop a learning mindset?Based on an extensive literature study, a qualitative study composed of semi-structured interviews with people involved in My Digital Twin – one of the flagships of the Health &amp; Technology theme of the Convergence agenda of the TUD, EUR, and EMC – and analysis of the qualitative data using structural coding in Atlas Ti 9, core elements of transdisciplinary collaboration and core elements of learning in a transdisciplinary collaboration context were found. Based on these elements, a long list of appropriate behaviors for leaders to portray to stimulate learning or work towards transdisciplinarity was established. Appropriate leadership styles and structures were concluded to be rotational distributed leadership consisting of formal and informal leaders. The discussion shows ideas for tools to stimulate learning and help develop a learning mindset, discusses the quality of the research, and provides recommendations for future research.Key words: transdisciplinarity, transdisciplinary collaboration, learning, leadership, duality, distributed leadership, convergence","transdisciplinarity; transdisciplinary collaboration; leadership; learning; convergence; duality; distributed leadership","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

In order to promote the sustainable transformation of cities, the Chinese central government promoted “new industrialization” in 2002. This concept aims to eliminate heavy industry enterprises to create a better urban environment. Due to the imbalance in the industrial structure and loss of talent and labor, these resource-based industrial cities are facing the dilemma of industrial upgrading. On the other hand, as regional cooperation is considered extremely important in the new stage of industrialization, the central government started to promote “urban agglomeration” as a key approach to such cooperation. However, due to the complex administrative system and the unequal competition between the central and other cities, the secondary cities cannot really benefit from regionalization and are gradually spatially marginalized. The two problems form a vicious circle, hindering the sustainable upgrade of these secondary resource-based industrial cities. This project aims to study how to use spatial planning and strategic interventions to help secondary (post-) resource-based industrial cities seek better sustainability and development. To achieve this, Handan, a secondary city with a nearly 10 million population surrounded by four mega-regions, is selected as the research object. This city suffers from the development limitation of “in-between megaregions” and the threat of hindrance of heavy industrial enterprises. Except for the disadvantages, it is a city with a long history and splendid culture which could provide great potential to develop into a new type innovative metropolis.","secondary cities; resource-based industrial cities; transformation; innovative urbanism; Strategic Planning; integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","",""

By comparing the future effect of radar actions using model predictive control (MPC), the POMDPs are solved in a non-myopic way. The model predictive control problem can be decoupled into sub-problems using Lagrangian Relaxation to reduce the computational complexity of the solution method. An algorithm based on golden section search is employed to find the Lagrange multiplier. An interacting multiple model filter is used to allow the method to be effective in RRM problems involving the tracking of targets performing a broad number of maneuvers. <br/>The novel approach is compared to an existing solution method based on policy rollout and Monte Carlo sampling. Through simulations of dynamic multi-target tracking scenarios in which the cost and computational complexity of different approaches are compared, it was shown that the computational complexity is greatly reduced while the resulting resource allocation results remain similar.","Radar Resource Management; POMDP; Stochastic Optimization; Filtering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

This means that more than 1.6 billion students, representing 91% of all students in the world, have felt the impact of COVID-19 on their study environments. The Smart Campus Tools and SCT 2.0 research has revealed that the use of SCTs is well known among Dutch and foreign universities. But, because the COVID-19 crisis is a recent and still current event, there is a gap in the literature with the insights on how universities and organizations have utilized SCTs during this period. This research aims to reflect the use of SCTs in the COVID-19 period at universities and other organizations. In addition, it identifies differences in the use of SCTs in the intervening years between the SCT 2.0 research and this study. This was ascertained through a literature study, the first brainstorming session, a case study at nine Dutch and five foreign universities and at three other organizations, and finally a second brainstorming session. Based on the outcomes of this research, it can be concluded that since the changes around the COVID-19 virus, existing or new SCTs have contributed to the ‘back-to-campus/office’ phase. This has been achieved through reservation tools for individual study places and/or tools that display crowding indications in the buildings. This has facilitated the monitoring of the number of users in the buildings and the ability to regulate capacity.

By 2050, this number should even have risen to 95%. Part of the greenhouse gas emissions is the generation of electricity by means of coal and natural gas. In order to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the Dutch government has set a target that 70% of electricity must be generated from renewable sources by 2030. Last year, 18% of electricity was generated from renewable sources. 24% of this was generated by solar power. Solar power can be generated through solar panels on roofs, on the ground, and on the facade. Solar panels on the roof are often sufficient for a single-family dwelling to generate enough energy for their own use. However, there are many buildings where the roof surface is limited in relation to the user surface. The facade surface is often larger than the roof surface. In order to make optimal use of the energy potential of facades, new facade claddings are needed that make it possible to generate energy through the facade. One of the possibilities is the integration of PhotoVoltaics in a High Pressure Laminate (HPL) facade panel. However, this has an impact on the installation of the product and has other requirements. In this master thesis, research has been done into the requirements, design and development of an easy-to-use facade system for mounting High Pressure Laminate facade panels with integrated PhotoVoltaics on the facade. The research is divided into several phases. In the first phase, the requirements for the High Pressure Laminate Building-Integrated facade system are researched trough literature research. This included the properties of the material High Pressure Laminate and the relevant aspects of solar panels, but also the regulations for facade claddings. Furthermore, research has been done into comparable systems for mounting High Pressure Laminate and solar panels. The program of requirements has been formulated based on the result of the literature research. First, the systems from the literature research were evaluated against the program of requirements. However, none of the systems met all the requirements. Additions were made to the program of requirements and these were used as a guideline for the development of the new system. In the second phase, the concept for the facade system has been developed. The design problems of the facade system are subdivided into different aspects. For each aspect different designs were made that were tested against the different criteria of the program of requirements. For each aspect, a design got the highest score and combined the designs with the highest score form the concept proposal. In the third phase of the research, prototypes were made for each aspect of the concept development.These prototypes were made with a 3D printer. This allowed the prototypes to be analysed in terms of their functionality. Because this method was very accessible, there was the possibility to make many prototypes. Next, a material analysis was made to determine the most suitable materials for the facade system. The material PLA, used to develop the prototypes, did not meet all the durability properties. In the material analysis, only materials that satisfied the durability properties were analysed.The mechanical characteristics of these materials were then compared with those of PLA, and the materials with approximately the same characteristics as PLA were selected to be used in the facade system. After that, the prototypes were structurally tested. This was done by means of a Finite Element Analysis. The first analysis was with the final prototype from the chapter 'prototyping'. Next, several iterations were made until the design met all the requirements. The last iteration was used to do a practical test. This practical test gave a good insight into the actual structural strength of the design. With the information from the practical test, the design was adjusted again and analysed by means of a Finite Element Analysis. After all parts met the functional and structural requirements, they were combined into the final design of the High Pressure Laminate Building-Integrated PhotoVoltaics facade system. The system is functioning, the tolerances have been taken into account and there are technical drawings of all components of the high pressure laminate building integrated photovoltaics facade system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

However, instead of sparing healthy tissue, the conventional FLASH approach, using transmission beams, damages the tissue behind the distal edge of a tumour. Therefore, this approach is less attractive in some clinical applications of FLASH proton therapy. To solve this problem, the use of a ridge filter and patient-specific range compensator, to shift the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) of the proton beam to the tumour, is proposed. In this research, the clinical feasibility and acceptability of FLASH-compatible treatment plans, optimized with multiple, Monte Carlo-simulated ridge filter beams, is analysed. An SOBP-database is generated using energy spectrum approximations and interpolations of energy spectra retrieved from Monte Carlo simulations in TOPAS. To obtain optimized FLASH-compatible treatment plans for neuro-oncological targets, this database is implemented in the in-house treatment planning software of the Erasmus Medical Center, iCycle.  The resulting treatment plans show that it is possible to generate FLASH-compatible treatment plans using a ridge filter. A FLASH enhancement ratio between 1.4 and 2.1 would potentially give clinically acceptable plans for the three patients considered. In some optimized plans, the homogeneity of the tumour dose is also increased. A limitation of this research is that configuration of a stable ridge filter beam treatment plan optimizer appears to be challenging. Besides this, the FLASH enhancement ratio and the dose rate are not taken into account to find the regions in the patient where the FLASH conditions (dose &gt; 8 Gy, dose rate &gt; 40 Gy/s and treatment time &lt; 0.1 s) are met.  Recommendations for future research include: implementing the FLASH enhancement ratio and the dose rate optimization in treatment plan optimization; investigating the influence of fractionation ofa FLASH treatment plan on the tumour control and the healthy tissue irradiated; study the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and the biological character of FLASH radiotherapy, and investigate the clinical potential of a combination of FLASH and non-FLASH treatment.","FLASH proton therapy; Energy modulation; Spread-out Bragg peak; SOBP; Ridge filter; FLASH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

RS datasets can perfectly be applied in distributed conceptual hydrological models. In this study, several RS datasets are applied in the calibration of a distributed conceptual hydrological model, and the influence of this approach on the overall model performance is assessed. The RS data applied in this study include terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, and soil moisture (SM) data. Also the input and forcing data for the hydrological model consists of datasets based on satellite observations. This data is used in a wflow hbv model, which is applied to the Volta basin in Western Africa as a case-study. In this study, not only the effect of including RS data in the calibration of a distributed hydrological model on streamflow is assessed, but also the effect on a set of internal components of the system, directly related to the datasets used for calibration. These internal stocks and fluxes are the TWSA, the actual evapotranspiration (AET) and the amount of soil moisture in the unsaturated zone. Together with streamflow, the assessment of these stocks and fluxes make up the overall model performance of the system. The effect on the overall model performance is examined using different scenarios, in which different combinations of datasets are used for calibration. Not the absolute values, but the spatiotemporal patterns of the remote sensing datasets are used for model assessment. This is done using the spatial pattern efficiency metric (ESP ). Model optimization was done using the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm. The results show that the hydrological model developed for this case-study is already able to simulate streamflow and the temporal patterns of the RS datasets quite well, when it is calibrated on streamflow only. However, the spatial pattern representation of the RS datasets was found to be inadequate and the differences in streamflow simulation performance for the different subcatchments is large. When SM or TWSA data was added to the calibration procedure, the temporal and spatial pattern representations only changed minimally, which is attributed to limited model complexity and flexibility. However, generally a trade-off effect was observed in which the spatial and temporal pattern representation improved, but the streamflow performance decreased. This effect was stronger for the addition of the SM dataset to the calibration than for the addition of TWSA dataset. Although there is definitely a strong connection between NDVI and AET, the physical relation between the two variables was found to be too weak to be used for hydrological model calibration, even when only the spatial and temporal pattern information was used. The overall model performance did improve most in the calibration catchments in the scenario in which Q, SM and TWSA data were combined in the calibration procedure, but the differences with the baseline scenario were only small. For the streamflow performance however, the differences between the scenarios are quite significant. It was shown that calibrating a hydrological model on the spatial and temporal patterns of RS data only (non-Q calibration) can accurately represent the temporal pattern of streamflow observations, but not the magnitude of the flow values. It is recommended to repeat this study using a more complex and more flexible model setup, which allows the model to use the freedom it is given to better represent the spatial patterns observed with RS.","Hydrological modelling; Remote Sensing data; Calibration; Spatial pattern; Temporal pattern; Volta; wflow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Because of this property protons are sensitive to uncertainties. Since the tumour is not stationary throughout the treatment, multiple scans are essential. With the current dose calculation technique (Monte Carlo simulations) this is not possible, since the simulations take too much time. This report therefore proposes a new deep learning algorithm to calculate accurate proton dose distributions much faster than the currently used methods.<br/><br/>The developed deep learning model consists of a convolutional encoder, two transformer encoder blocks and a convolutional decoder. Slices of a Computed Tomography (CT) image are processed through the model to output a corresponding dose distribution. The model is trained using gradient descent with a mean squared error loss function. The total dataset used to train, validate and test the model consists of 9,940 samples which are created using slices of a patient's CT scan and Monte Carlo simulations. Only a proton beam energy of 134 MeV is evaluated.<br/><br/>The model yielded a mean gamma-analysis index pass rate of 99.87 +/- 0.16 \%, which is much higher than any other model or method available. The model struggles most with predicting complex dose distributions but is excellent at predicting the general beam shape and the Bragg-peak location of the dose distribution. The average run-time of the model lies around 75 ms, which is much faster than Monte Carlo simulations and is even faster than the Pencil Beam method. The run-time is roughly equal to the fastest deep learning alternative when considering image dimensions.<br/><br/>For future researches it is suggested to train the model with more data to improve the accuracy, train the model with different proton beam energies to see if it generalises well and find the optimal convolutional encoder and decoder parameters to decrease run-time.","Transformer; Dose Calculation; Deep Learning; Proton Therapy","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2030-05-15","","","","Applied Physics","Bachelor End Project",""

But the local communities are facing some difficulties in the past decades. These include over-development, flooding, and unstable living quality. The built environment had changed a lot on the site. Developers keep filling soil to the fishponds and build more and more highrises for apartments or hotels. This also changes the relationship between humans and nature. The aquaculture industry is disappearing too. The culture is vanishing. To reserve and even renovate the culture of living with water, this thesis aimed to create a systematic method to build a water village for local fishermen, in relation to the aquaculture industry and flood prevention. In my research paper, I utilize the SWMM model, which is from the United States military system. It can help me modeling the existing drainage system. And also analyze the hydrograph of the selected area. For flood prevention, I turned some fish ponds into detention basins and constructed wetland, to create an additional flow that can reduce the pressure of the main drain line. By this, I can control the water in the detention basins and construct wetlands during disasters. And move it back to the main system afterward. For the circular flow, I try to explore the possibility that the schedule of aquacultural activities and the schedule of construction can integrate perfectly together. I proposed a three-year schedule that local farmers can build their own house while continuing their industrial activities. For all the material, I want it to be recycled or biobased as much as possible. For example, To deal with the overheating problem in summer. I design two layers of the roof which have different functions. The first layer is a bamboo roof, which can prevent direct sunlight, and also the rainwater to go inside the building. The second layer of the roof is made of piled oyster shells. Which can let the interior heat go up and emit below the bamboo roof. These butterfly roofs can guide the rainwater to the gutter tower below, acting as water storage. After filtering and purifying, the water can be brought up and reused in the kitchen, bathroom, and workspace as well. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br","Fish industry; Water Village; Low-cost housing; Self-built; Pre-drainage; Anna district","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Micro-propulsion technology is under rapid development and considerably extends the mission capabilities of small spacecraft. However, the flow in conventional nozzles on a microscale is relatively viscous, which, combined with the bounding nozzle walls, leads to low efficiencies. Aerospike nozzles, on the other hand, offer free-flow expansion and mitigate the boundary layer effects.  The research objective of this project is to investigate the losses and output efficiency of micro-nozzles by optimizing a 3D axisymmetric aerospike in the μN-mN range. Planar nozzles, typically found in micro- propulsion subsystems, limit the flow radial expansion and considerably suffer from viscous losses, as well as momentum loss. In addition, in lower thrust settings, the boundary layer massively limits the performance of conventional nozzles – conical and bell layouts –, whereas aerospikes do not bound the flow and, subsequently, inherit better gas expansion. The design optimization relies on numerical analyses, with the free and open-source OpenFOAM’s solver, rhoCentralFoam, and self-developed Python scripts that automate the simulations in various machines.  This study comprises three design iterations. The first contour parameters derive from Delft University of Technology’s Vaporizing Liquid Micro-thruster (VLM) requirements and the preceding work. However, since this work considers axisymmetric geometries, the aerospike’s throat width is reduced from 45 μm to 15 μm to preserve the original thrust magnitude (&lt; 10 mN).  The initial results show that, at the same throat Reynolds number, the aerospike outperforms the bell nozzle, especially towards lower Reynolds, where the specific impulse efficiency variation tops 25%. However, at equal thrust levels, the conventional design surpasses the aerospike thrust and specific impulse efficiencies. The Mach contours reveal that the small throat width and high area ratio ineffectively mitigate the viscous losses and lead to extreme momentum loss.  The following iterations with four truncation percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) prove the first hypothesis right: when decreasing the area ratio from ~17 to ~3 and raising the throat width to 30 μm, the efficiency of an 80% long aerospike reaches ~94% for the specific impulse and ~89% for the thrust. In addition, the aerospike yields the best performance when it is the least truncated (highest truncation percentage, i.e., 80%).  Finally, a ±100 K temperature sensitivity study shows that the aerospike performance oscillates up to 3%, with a maximum thrust efficiency of 91% and specific impulse efficiency close to 98%, rivaling macroscale performance. With a small area ratio and a wide throat, the aerospike nozzle outperforms an equivalent bell nozzle by more than 10% in terms of specific impulse and thrust efficiencies.","Micro-propulsion; Aerospike; Optimization; CFD; 3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A solution that minimises cost per RPK can be found by varying the minimum RPK level. The solutions describes how many aircraft are needed, as well as a schedule for each aircraft for a single day. We consider a set of airports where charging infrastructure is assumed to be present. All aircraft must start and end the day from the assigned hub airport. Next, we consider a discretised time space between a start time and end time with constant time steps. The problem is represented on a time-space network where each node uniquely defines a location (airport) and point in time, and arcs connect the nodes. An arc connecting two consecutive nodes at the same airport are ground arcs and represent waiting on the ground. An arc connecting two nodes at different airports are flight arcs. The cost, duration and energy consumption on flight arcs is determined in advance. A schedule is represented as a sequence of arcs. The number of passengers on a flight is limited by the demand. We developed a method to find a schedule that minimises costs while meeting a minimum RPK constraint. This method was then illustrated on a network with 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 airports. The results show that our method is much faster than a traditional linear programming model. The obtained solution is a local minimum and is very close to the global optimum. We found that cost per RPK shows a sawtooth pattern, gradually decreasing as aircraft utilisation increases but spiking up when an additional aircraft is added to the fleet. Furthermore, the sawtooth pattern shows an increasing trend. The schedule shows a strong preference for connections with a longer distance and with high demand. The algorithm first fills up these connections, often using back-and-forth flights, until they are largely saturated. When there is little demand left on these connections, the algorithm starts adding flights on connections with a shorter distance or less demand.","Scheduling; Electric Vehicle; Electric aircraft; thin-haul; fleet sizing; linear optimisation; column generation; large neighbourhood search","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Human annotators are known to be subjective when giving similarity judgements. The Audio Music Similarity task in MIREX uses human annotators to collect similarity judgements. The annotator gives judgements to a list of candidate songs that are similar according to the participating system. The annotation protocol has no clear guidelines, and on top of that, literature shows psychological effects which can influence the similarity score. Studies show that disagreement exists between different annotators in the Audio Music Similarity task. It is argued that the disagreement is due to the natural subjectivity of human annotators, but how much of the subjectivity is natural?<br/><br/>In this work, context effects are explored, which are the over- or underrating of candidate songs due to specific properties of the annotated list of candidates. The properties of the list of candidates are called factors and will be used as dependent variables. The exploration of context effects is split into two parts, 1) recognizing context effects and 2) measuring the impact of the context effect. New similarity judgements are collected through crowdsourcing, this data is checked on reliability before analysing the context effects. For recognizing context effects, the changes of previous judgements made by annotators are taken as a metric to see if the annotators are noticing potential context effects. The second part is measuring the magnitude of the over- or underrating by looking at the distance of the set of judgements to the ground truth. Hypotheses are made for the dependant variables change and distance, based on the factors Order, Trend, Location, Spread and Outlier. It seems that the collected data shows signs of context effects, with the Trend and Outlier hypotheses being in line with the data. The Order hypothesis seems to be the opposite of the data. When changes are made by an annotator, the final scores of the judgements are closer to the ground truth than before the changes.

When a build fails, a developer often has to scroll through hundreds to thousands of log lines to find which test is failing and why. Finding the issue is a tedious process that relies on a developer's experience and increases the cost of software testing. Providing CI build test results with additional context in the developer's local development environment could help solve failing tests more quickly. We propose TestAxis, a test result inspection tool that brings CI test results to the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) offering an experience similar to running a test locally. Moreover, it surfaces additional information that is too expensive to collect in local development, for example, a unique view of the code under test that was changed leading up to the build failure. We implement TestAxis as a plugin for IntelliJ and conduct a user study to evaluate its usefulness and performance benefits. The participants solve programming assignments evaluating the three main features: the test results overview, the test code editor, and the changed code under test display. We show that TestAxis helps developers fix failing tests 13.4% to 30.4% faster. The participants found the features of TestAxis useful and would incorporate it in their development workflow to save time.

Additionally, CPPs can be controlled such, that operational limits of the driving machinery are not exceeded.<br/><br/>As vessels have become increasingly diverse with respect to their functional abilities, and complex with respect to their propulsion configurations, design of combinator curves becomes increasingly labour intensive. Earlier developed software applications, that aim to support the matching process or combinator settings, lack clear insight of important performance indicators and their impact on the combinator curve design. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a Combinator Curve Generator(CCG) is developed to support the design of combinator curves for vessels that employ CPPs, in order to decrease the labour intensity of the combinator design process. Further, approaches are developed to optimise combinator curves for operation modes of a vessel in terms of four performance indicators; propeller efficiency, cavitation inception, engine efficiency and fuel consumption. The approaches are implemented in the CCG such that a combinator curve can be designed, optimised and evaluated. Additionally, a trip simulation tool is developed and added to the CCG, in order to determine and evaluate the total fuel consumption of a trip for different cruise speeds and a certain time duration, whilst taking into account the distance, the operational profile of the vessel, the combinator settings and the hotel load. <br/><br/>Important recommendations for further development include extension of the database of inception diagrams for propellers with different blade area ratios, and the broadening of the propulsion configuration scope, such that different main engines and power supply systems can be considered.

Migration can be understood as a dynamic process from the perspective of the moving object, or idea; however, it may also be a study of change of factors in the given area. In order to enclose this definition within urban context, it can be said that the migration is the multiplication of the architectural idea with variable alterations in time and space.

This research focusses on a particular site in Rotterdam Zuid in terms of climate change. The research question is the following: How can both- social and hard infrastructure contribute to the creation of a climate proof, resilient community? This question will be answered in the form of a building. Starting with a research about the climate change that has to be dealt with in Rotterdam Zuid. As a group we defined a new vision for the area and we all designed one building that contributes to that vision. In this case solutions for climate change contribute to the vision. This research about the location determined the location of the intervention. After this a research is done into the subject social infrastructure, changing the habits of people from an individual mindset to a communal mindset. This can save lives during a disaster. This research determined the target groups and the function. The elderly and the children and the function should be a combination between an aid organization and a communal center. The Red Cross Social Center. Then a reference research started, different types of communal centers and red cross headquarters have been analysed to come up with a program bar for the project. Along with the program bar, different ambitions have been established in terms of function, site and design. Having all these guidelines set the massing could start. After trial and error the final massing has been established. A rectangular shaped building with a courtyard in the middle. The courtyard can be reached through a large (water)square which creates passages underneath the building. The large green roof is connected to the ground floor to make it accessible to the public to reach the second floor. The ground floor, second floor, third floor, and fourth floor contain public functions for people to establish this social connection, this social infrastructure. On the first floor the headquarters of the Dutch Red Cross is placed. This location and the design of the building will increase their visibility. The aim of the design was to create a building that deals with climate change in terms of hard- and social infrastructure. The hard infrastructure is achieved by various interventions. The social infrastructure is a more difficult topic, the building offers the ideal circumstances for people to create this social infrastructure themselves and create this resilient community.","Social infrastructure; Climate change; Rotterdam South","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Complex projects, Collage city",""

From this follows the main research question: How can the regeneration of a waterfront into a cultural area add social and cultural value to the Tarwewijk and Rotterdam South? There is a strong cultural division between the North and South of Rotterdam what leads into the fewer access to culture and lower demand for culture in the South of Rotterdam. Knowing this, the redevelopment of an underused unconnected waterfront in the South of Rotterdam into a cultural area can lead to unwanted social effects, like no social and cultural connection to the neighbourhood and by this it could lead to gentrification. It is important to develop a cultural area that adds social and cultural value to the neighbourhood and that this area is part of the neighbourhood (tangible and intangible). This can narrow the (cultural) gap between the North and South of Rotterdam. This happens because both culture becomes more inclusive and approachable for the local people and the population of Rotterdam South become culturally richer. In order to investigate this, The research that follows focusses on three hypothetic parts of the solution. The first one is multifunctionality. This subject will be researched through the questions: What does multifunctionality entail? How can multifunctionality benefit the cultural area? How can multifunctionality be beneficial to the neighbourhood? And how do multifunctionality and multiculturality relate to each other? The second subject is identity. The sub questions for this are: What creates this identity? How can identity benefit the museum? How can identity be beneficial the neighbourhood? The last subject is connection. In this part there will be focus on how can tangible and intangible connections can be established between the site and the neighbourhood with as main goal to integrate the museum with the neighbourhood. For every of the three subjects firstly there will be done a literature research to theorize the subject and get a grip on the main principles of the subject matter. I will research what others have done in the field of multifunctionality, identity and connection and from there I will try to come up with my own hypothesis about these subjects. After that case studies will be conducted where the aspects of multifunctionality, identity and connection will be analysed. After that site specific research will be done to form a conclusion about the information that is gained from the literature and the case studies. In this research and design I want to redefine the way cultural area’s and museums are looked upon to make them more attractive to a wider audience that normally wouldn’t visit a cultural area or museum. It aims to create an alternative to the classic typology of the museum. The research and design try to show that a museum or cultural area can also function in a more social and inclusive way. This case can then be an example for future projects.","Architecture; Public building; Multifunctionality; Museum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Public Building","THE NEW MUSEUM | Art + the City Re-Wired",""

Before modernism, the appearance of architecture had more decoration on façade and different style design from contemporary architecture. Since the development of industry and technology, the appearance of today’s architecture is not very different from those of the 20th century. However, the value of buildings is not just aesthetic and historical values. Kuipers and Jonge said in ‘Designing from Heritage’: “In fact, the aging monuments of the Modern Movement have proven to be less flexible in practice when adaptations to new needs are required, than promised by the original designers. The built legacy of the twentieth century demands innovative approaches to heritage analysis in combination with creativity if it is to meet the ‘challenge of change’ it is faced with.” (Kuipers &amp; Jonge, 2017)In other words, the heritage architecture in the future can be designed for different uses based on various values. Therefore, Dordrecht Vroom and Dreesmann could be a good example of ‘Modern Heritage’. Because it had designed by architect Jan Kuijt in the 1931 and it was renovated in 1999 based on public demand. ‘Heritage Park 2.0’ project focused on the cultural-value, use-value, and social-value of Dordrecht V&amp;D department store. The ground floor of the department store is blocking two main squares, Statenplein and Scheffersplein, and before the department store bankrupted, people walked through the ground floor from Statenplein to Scheffersplein as a shortcut. This spatial value exists, although it is less clearly revealed than the visible heritage of the past. Therefore, the graduation project is researched and designed what is the value of Dordrecht V&amp;D buildings that are important to people even after 100 years from now. In particular, people’s interests and uses will change, and the project was carried out with a focus on what attitudes as an architect should renovate heritage buildings. Therefore, this project has been researched and designed with a focus on the values of modern heritage renovation and, in particular, how the public space should be designed in the future. Furthermore, I think that this method of linking research and design can be used as a reference when developing modern heritage in the future.","public space; Park; Socializing; Plaza; V&D; heritage & Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

Mobility as become more and more relevant to people’s daily life and also plays an important role in city planning. With the rapid development of mobility modes, more facilities are also needed to fulfill a complete transportation network. Nowadays, more and more infrastructures such as highways, railways, are built to connect different districts. These infrastructures are usually built elevated from the ground and create a large amount of leftover spaces underneath. Various problems such as lowquality space, divisions in urban planning, and safety issues will arise because of these leftover spaces. Therefore, my research question becomes: How to activate the leftover spaces caused by infrastructures in public places? From the researches, to activate leftover space, four aspects need to be paid extra attention to. The primary aspect is accessibility, which is the capability and opportunity of leftover spaces to be reached and entered. The second aspect is diversity, the fact of many different types of atmosphere, activities, people can be included into the leftover space. This aspect could attract users to these spaces while allowing them to stay. Thirdly, inclusivity, which is the capability of including people from all groups, especially vulnerable groups such as children, elderly people, and disabled people, and treat them all fairly and equally. By improving inclusivity, it could allow leftover space to be used by people from different groups. The final aspect is reconnection, which is to link the leftover spaces together and reconnect with the city and become part of the urban planning. In this study, Tarwewijk district in Rotterdam South was selected as the site for designing a new mobility hub to solve the leftover space problem at site, while targeting to increase the four elements of leftover space from the research outcome.By comparing the research and design, this thesis can provide a new perspective for rethinking the characteristics of leftover space and provide could further a new methodology for activating the leftover spaces in other districts as well.","Leftover space; Infrastructure; Mobility hub; Public space; metro station; bicycle storage; various programs targeting different users","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Tarwewijk mobility hub",""

The city we know now is characterised by the commodification of city centre. With the proliferation of shopping in the city, the community and neighbourhood became overlooked. However, the people's mentality is still very much rooted in the social activism that identified the city of Nijmegen during the 80s. The need for commons stems from a global socio-economic crisis on the inability of market and state to govern the city. Commons is about building working systems for the subsistence of households outside of the market and state. It is also about the political dimension of approaching the space for non market functions in our neoliberal society, instead focusing on local industries, initiatives and communities. Increasingly there is an idea that architectural projects are not single-authored ventures, but rather complex and layered processes that depend upon multiple agencies that establish a commonality. Commons are constructed in the sense that their creation, existence, operation and persistence are matters of not pure accident or random chance, but instead of social practices and institutional design. An architecture of the commons should be understood as an intervention in these commons resources and in the collection of people, skills and knowledge that are part of them. The process of making architecture is strongly rooted with the notion of constructing commons and sharing between different people, skills and materials. Engaging in local material industries is not only important for the material itself, but also holds knowledge on the processing and construction techniques of the specific context. Memories, secrets and craftsmanship are part the network that commonalities of architecture are focussed on. It consists of different people with different knowledge, skills, materials and construction techniques. The artist community in Nijmegen has been pushed to the margins of society and the city due to exponentially rising market prices in the past decades. Whil Nijmegen promotes itself as an artistic city, it does little to actual facilitate the community. On the other side, while there are many artists and creative organisations present in the city, they rarely communicate or interact with each other. The program and location of the art school thus tries to address these two problems by providing an institution in the city centre. Being part of a collective urban plan, the art school presents, together with a public library and collective housing, a new urban proposal for the city of Nijmegen at the site of the Molenpoort. The urban plan fragments the bigness of the site into smaller pieces and changes the focus of the current program from shopping to more community oriented and driven functions, a more sustainable and habitable future for the city of Nijmegen. The thesis proposes an alternative look at how architecture can be part of the rise in bottom up iniatives in urban settings. As practice of architecture takes a turn towards the community and the local, architecture can provide a spatial foundation to bring different agencies to assemble a new network of commonality in the city. The shared knowledge of people and local industries can come together. It is about reconnecting the pieces of today's disconnected society.","bricolage; assemblage theory; Commons; Architectural Ethnography; Re-use; Brick; art academy; shopping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","51.84362879219013, 5.863423228629784"

(mentor); Reinders, M.J.T. (graduation committee); Hauff, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Methods for learning vector space representations of words have yielded spaces which contain semantic and syntactic regularities. These regularities mean that vector arithmetic operations in the latent space represent meaningful and interpretable relations between words. These word vectors have been so successful in capturing such relations, as well as transfer between domains almost seamlessly, that they have become central in the foundation of modern natural language processing. There have been multiple proposals for extending these methods to sentences and documents, as well as entirely new approaches based on modern sequence models. So far, none of these methods have demonstrated the same kind of widespread applicability as word vector methods, instead being constrained to a single domain. The question that emerges is then whether these document vector methods yield spaces with the same kind of regularities as are observed in the word vector models. This work focusses on whether these spaces encode a particular relation, that between a word and its definition. Since most of these methods allow only for a conversion from sentence to vector and not the reverse, the problem has been phrased as a ranking problem over a set of candidate words. In the strict case where the relation is assumed to be linear as with the word vectors this yields a model which ranks the correct vector first $26.6\%$ of the time, with a median rank of the correct answer of $19$ out of $2000$ options. Relaxing this requirement and using a 3 layer Multi Layer Perceptron yields an improvement in this metric, predicting $37.8\%$ correct, and improves the median rank to $3$. The performance of these models suggests that words and sentences can be naturally thought of as occupying a single space. The results in this work suggest that it may be possible to generate correct definitions of words in a way that comes very close to being unsupervised, needing only a mean difference between words and definitions. When this was attempted, however, the decoder ended up converging to a fixed output.","sequence modelling; natural language processing; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is despite the visible shortcomings of these neoliberal urban development models in delivering the required human development alongside economic growth, specifically for majority of the urban residents in African cities - the urban poor. The political, external agency of cities to global economies at the expense of the internal cultural-economic capacities of local communities continues to propagate inequality, with the urban poor being the most affected by these unjust systems. Continued rural-urban migration, and the growth of the peripheries in urban areas, has seen reduced productivity in traditional integrated agroecological lifestyles and this is unfortunately happening against weakened industrial and manufacturing industries within local urban contexts while propagating a producer-service industry that has fewer opportunities for the rapidly increasing vulnerable populations. The witnessed result of this for the urban peripherals is a growing impermanence of urban lifestyles and the persistence of rural-urban links, as not only escapes from the terror of rigid developmental states mindsets, but also as crucial links for producer-consumer relationships in the splintered regional food system. Unfortunately, the current governance impetus is the propagation of neoliberal models of modernization and gentrification of the urban poor, putting a strain on this crucial cross territorial relationships that sustain urban life. This rural-urban relationships therefore begin to expose the urgent need for reconciling production and consumption landscapes within sustainable city-region governance and planning practices in order to advocate for just urbanisation processes that caters to all populations. This research, critically analyses the symbiotic relationship between the current informal urbanisation structures prevalent in primary cities through the case study of Nairobi, and specifically within the peripherals, and their culturaleconomic identities associated with rural-urban transitory patterns. This investigation makes an attempt to reconnect the future of Kenyan urbanisation to social-cultural production capacities and processes as advocated by critical spatial production and governance literature. Through the main stay of Kenya’s economy - agriculture- and the critical need for sustainable transitions in agricultural and urbanisation systems, we suggest a reconciliation between the emerging social movement of agroecological urbanism at a city-region scale and the adaptiveness of prevalent cultural-economic rural-urban relationships, to suggest a regional, inclusive and adaptive approach to planning practice and governance.","City-region; Peripherals; Rural-urban links; Agroecology; Adaptive Governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","-1.292100, 36.821900"

The corresponding seismic shocks and vibrations can be transmitted to jack‐up vessels and their cranes used for the installation of these offshore wind turbines. Since a potential collapse due to seismic activity carries large human and financial risks, the main objective of this thesis is: ”To determine the best solution to mitigate the dynamic response of cranes for offshore wind turbine installation in seismic prone areas.” Therefore, we study existing mitigation measures and find that the dynamic absorber and base isolation systems are promising solutions. However, we only find the dynamic absorber to be feasible for implementation. Subsequently, we investigate the influence of the dynamic absorber on the dynamic response of the crane by performing seismic time history analyses. We find a mitigating influence for the vast majority of simulated cases. More specifically, the dynamic response in the out‐of‐plane direction is reduced by 10 percent on average. Furthermore, the dynamic absorber is highly effective in the mitigation of harmonic vibrations such as those that are induced by Rayleigh waves that occur near the end of earthquakes. This finding suggests that a dynamic absorbers might also be suitable for mitigating wave and wind loads in the crane as these loads prescribe a rather harmonic signal. The conclusions of this thesis give the offshore wind industry a clear indication that a dynamic absorber is an effective measure to mitigate the dynamic response of a crane that is based on a jack‐up.","Offshore wind; Jack-up; Crane; Installation; Earthquake; Mitigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The Dutch have protected their land against seawater since the 10th century. Nowadays, the Netherlands is protected by 3800 km of primary flood defences. Since the Flood Defences Act was included in the Dutch law in 1996, all flood defences are tested against the national safety standards every twelve years. In the latest assessment round, a 47 kilometres long stretch of a Wadden Sea dike in the northern part of the Netherlands dike section, from Koehool to Lauwersmeer, did not meet the requirements. It is rejected to multiple foreshore influenced failure mechanisms. The dike area of Koehool-Lauwersmeer consists of cultural heritage in means of historical dikes and historical land reclamation structures. The (embanked) salt marshes that are present at the foreshores of the dike section, are of great value for both ecology and water safety in the area. The length of the dike section and the unique project location, provide an opportunity to explore alternative solutions for the dike strengthening project. Innovative dike strengthening solutions can potentially minimize the anthropogenic influence of the reinforcement projects, increase the systems adaptability potential to sea level rise and contribute to the ecological values of the area. In this research, an explorative study is conducted to find an alternative dike strengthening design and to assess the morphological developments and ecological opportunities of such a design. Based on the criteria to contribute to both flood safety and ecological value, a slufter alternative is chosen to be studied further. The slufter alternative engages an inland area between two dikes into the Wadden Sea by an artificial dike breach. The area is regularly inundated, creating opportunities for ecosystems to evolve. A depth-averaged (2DH) Delft3D model is used to explore the morphological developments of the slufter area and the potential to add to the ecological value of the area. The project area is characterized by a sediment-rich environment and a flood dominant tide. Higher flood than ebb velocities are present, causing an import of sediment into the slufter area. Model results indicate that the net sediment import of the slufter area mainly depends on the suspended sediment concentration, the critical shear stress and the tidal prism of the slufter area. A geometry that causes an increase in the flow velocity shows higher suspended sediment concentrations that lead to higher amounts of sediment import. Under the influence of a sea level rise (SLR) of +1m, the sediment transport increases with a factor of 2 to 3, depending on the initial geometry. SLR enhances the sediment trapping of the area. The slufter area can potentially keep up with SLR. Assuming an equal distribution of sediment over the slufter area, the average growth rate of the bed level is between 0.22 (minimum sediment import, maximum SLR) and 21.12 (maximum sediment import, minimum SLR) times SLR. Applying the slufter intervention adds 60 ha to the intertidal area of the Wadden Sea. Depending on the applied geometry this results in 30-50ha between MLW and MHW (lower marsh) and 10-30ha above MHW (middle and upper marsh). The slufter alternative creates opportunities for new ecosystems and contributes to the Natura2000 goals to create more gradual transition areas between the Wadden Sea and the surrounding land by creating an area with a gradual wet-dry transition. These potentially add to the biodiversity of the area as they create opportunities for specific plant species and waders. It is concluded that creating a slufter area at the Koehool-Lauwersmeer dike, provides opportunities for sediment trapping due to the flood dominance of the system and the high sediment concentrations. The amount of sediment trapping is influenced by the critical shear stress, the area’s tidal prism, and the suspended sediment concentrations. SLR increases the amount of sediment trapping. Depending on the applied geometry, the bed level growth rate is larger than SLR. Creating a slufter area creates an opportunity to improve both the flood safety and the ecological value in one design.","DELFT3D; Wadden Sea; Slufter; Coastal morphology; Building with Nature; Nature Based Solutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","53.25680, 5.52895"

Physical processes such as storm surges, tides, currents, and waves play an important role in the design of these structures. Several variables characterize the relevant physical processes (e.g. significant wave height, mean wave period, water level, wind speed) and a thorough analysis of these variables is required when dealing with offshore and coastal dynamics, durability, and reliability assessment. <br/><br/>Traditionally, a critical loading condition is defined by characteristic values of environmental variables that are determined based on the highest loads previously experienced. Modern design methods seek to derive loads that correspond to specified reliability by considering the frequency of a specific loading magnitude.Traditional design approaches do not take into account the interrelations and dependencies among the variables of interest. Hence, wrong representations of the physical processes and unnecessary conservative representations of the design loads might occur. This may severely limit their effectiveness and can lead to expensive and inappropriate decisions. Multivariate frequency analysis approaches currently receive much attention within the academic community, however, advanced statistical concepts such as regular vine copula are slow in being taken up by engineering practice.<br/>This thesis presents a practical assessment and further development of a vine-based methodology, used for the derivation of design values, in continuation of the work performed by Sell´es Valls (2019). Regular vine copulae are advanced statistical models for high dimensional distributions using (conditional) bivariate copulae as building blocks. This study contributes to bridging the gap between the academic community and engineering practice on one hand, and on the other hand, contributes to a better understanding of the potential added value of incorporating dependence information in the design process of coastal and offshore infrastructure. It has a conceptual point of view where the concept of using dependence information by applying advanced statistical techniques is explored and the required adaptations throughout the entire design process are evaluated.<br/>In this research, it is found that the multivariate vine-based methodology can be successfully incorporated in the design process of a breakwater structure, and on average results in minimal required dimensions of elements of the cross-sectional design that turn out to be smaller and the corresponding costs up to 25% lower compared to the univariate traditional approach. This is realized by adapting the framework enabling an offshore-nearshore transformation of the wave conditions using SWAN software. Furthermore, the theoretical framework is extended by introducing Kendall’s measure providing a suitable definition of the critical region from which the critical loading conditions can be obtained. It is concluded that the vine-based approach could act as a tool providing extra information about the behavior of the system and insights on the degree of conservatism of the traditional approach. The considered role of the vine-based methodology in the design process of a breakwater structure (or coastal infrastructure in general) is to provide the practitioner with additional insights supporting the traditional design approach and possibly optimizing the design.<br","Vine-copula; Structural reliability; Multivariate return period; Design Values; Probabilistic design; Civil infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This research concerned the design and implementation of a system to perform the 3D conversion of a national road network using airborne Lidar data and land-based road elevation measurements, preserving its topology and quantifying output elevation accuracy. While the system was designed with generality in mind, specific Dutch open data datasets were used as input which were also used in a commercial project with the same goals. In addition to designing a scientifically sound equivalent of the commercial implementation, this research also explored purely academic goals, such as selecting road surface laser reflections accurately and using them for 2.5D road surface modelling purposes. Our system was based on decomposing the 3D conversion task into individually solvable 2.5D sub-problems to enable the use of efficient terrain modelling methods, and to prove that scaling via multiprocessing would be possible. At the 10-30 points per m<sup>2</sup> sampling density we worked with, the road surfaces are oversampled. We found that because our elevation estimates are based on road reflections only, and because road surfaces are smooth and relatively flat, the output quality and accuracy depends only on the specific technique used to extract the elevations from the Lidar data. Using our methods, the output elevation accuracy represents a 30% increase relative to the Lidar input data, amounting to 10.6 cm at 95% certainty with our specific datasets. This is assumed to be violated only where local density drops below 3 points per m<sup>2</sup>, which occurs where roads are occluded by opaque objects, unless the land-based road surface measurements can provide enough additional data. Elsewhere, more than 98% of the road network conforms with the minimum point density. The 2.5D-based decomposition was found to be an effective means of simplifying the problem and terrain modelling methods were successfully used in the procedure. More than 90% of the traffic-occupied road surfaces are included in the resulting surface models, and about 75% of the total paved surfaces. We extracted the output elevations from them, using linear interpolation where they were unavailable. Our 3D conversion quality and accuracy represents an improvement relative to the commercial results, mostly due to the better prioritising of the input elevation sources, in addition to our solution's capacity to handle complex small to medium-scale occlusion better, including complex relationships between roads such as multi-level motorway junctions.","Point clouds; Feature extraction; Open data; Digital road networks; Airborne laser scanning; Surface modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The aim of the project is to re-design the building in order to house a series of new uses which include public facilities (such as an urban park and a public interior space), retail shops and two hotels (one student hotel and a boutique hotel). All of these functions respond to the qualities and needs of the area and the people of Leiden. The main architectural interventions that are carried out in order to make the old department store suitable for the new programme are the creation of a courtyard in the centre of the building, the design of the facades surrounding this courtyard as well as the reshaping of one of the exterior facades of the building. The new facades in the courtyard are cladded with prefabricated steel panels which are filled with bricks. This is a contemporary form of craftsmanship in brick facades, which ultimately aims to add a sustainable character to the new interventions as these panels can easily be disassembled and re-used in other projects. The new facades refer through their composition to historic buildings and facades that used to exist on the site but were demolished with the expansion of the V&amp;D in the 1960’s. The interventions in the exterior façade also partly aim to refer to older architectural objects that used to exist before the expansion. The design principles of craftsmanship and reference which were fundamental in the original composition of Van der Laan became the main starting points for the new design through their re-interpretation and transposition in our time. For example, the principle of reference which was used by van der Laan in order to connect his building to the surrounding architecture, was used in the new design to refer to demolished historical buildings, in order to shape a historic consciousness to the people of Leiden about the transformation of the site throughout the 20th century. The principle of applying craftsmanship in brick facades, which was pursued by Van der Laan in order to make the building appealing to the upper classes of the city, was reintroduced in the new interventions but with the aim of making these sustainable, one of the most important issues that architecture faces today. Two basic principles, craftsmanship and reference, were transposed and looked upon from a different angle in the new interventions with the aim of creating an architectural outcome where old and new harmoniously co-exist as well as giving a new meaning for the whole composition relevant to our own unique time.

This project stems from an interest in people. How they live and interact with each other through exploring their likes and dislikes, their needs and wishes. To explore this notion of people and their interaction, the research undertaken looked at compiling people’s stories and contextualising them within the city of Nijmegen. Considering the context of Covid-19 and a pandemic aware society, this thesis explores the coexistence of live and work activities within the home. Prior to, but enhanced by the recent pandemic, we increasingly find more people living and working in the same spaces and therefore this thesis project looks at creating a solution to the issue of designing for the contemporary family lifestyle. To adequately create design solutions for these current issues, the thesis relies heavily on the observation and study of the everyday mundane activities that take place within both the private and public realms. The studio theme Bricolage sparked several topics of interest within the working home thesis project. On a social scale, this thesis took the stories of the people of Nijmegen and began to stitch them together in order to create a broader picture of the essence of the city. Architecturally, the existing building stock was a starting point for the design. With the knowledge that the majority of our cities are built to capacity, why don’t we look at the current building stock for future use. Here we can create opportunities through interventions that repurpose and reimagine spaces within our cities by giving old buildings a new lease of life. Through the retention of the ramp and the structure of the Molenport Shopping Centre, my thesis project explores this avenue of repurposing.

This global process highlights relevant questions about the future of our cities and the inclusion of the shopping heritage. Are these places valuable? How can these places offer a spatial quality within the city? Departments stores are the consequence of an absolute process which does not establish a sensitive relationship with the physical and social context. With a similar condition of big infrastructures such as airports and stations, a shopping passage is a “non-space” since it consists in a mere place of transit. People are treated as individual and numbers. They are not human beings. They are their passports or credit cards. Even if this process has a global nature, the solution cannot consist in a methodological response. The rule of the Architect-Bricoleur refuses to apply a general idea or theory to a specific condition. On the other hand, his approach establishes a syntonic relationship with the urban fabric and starts with the art of seeing things looking for opportunities that are apparently invisible. The rule of the architect is to create something new with the physical and emotional materials offered by the site. It is impossible to overtake the ambiguities of the city. We need to deal with contradictions and inconsistencies trying to find their posture within the urban fabric. Our focus needs to shift towards the existing heritage. Demolition is not an option. New interventions need to alter existing conditions re-using materials, traditions, and techniques. Ambiguities can become qualities.

Unfortunately, current real-world data presents a significant disparity between predicted and actual gathered energy consumption results. Thus, this research aims to develop an approach to accurately predict total dynamic Energy Consumption (EC) using real operation voyage data for the improved early-stage design of future yachts. A grey-box modelling (GBM) solution combines: physics-based white-box models (WBM); and black-box model (BBM) artificial neural networks to provide estimations with high accuracy and improved extrapolation capacity. The study utilizes ten months of onboard continuous monitoring data, hindcasted weather, and voyage information from a Feadship fleet yacht. Upon applying a sequential modelling methodology, predictions are compared between the three model categories, which ultimately indicated propulsion and auxiliary estimates fall within 3% and 7% error of operational conditions. The study is then continued using external range datasets to evaluate the extrapolation potential. While GBM improvements are seen over the BBM, limitations were directly related to the strength between dynamic WBM input-output correlations. Finally, a general consideration decision structure is detailed to provide naval architects with practical knowledge and confidence in future applications of the GBM modelling approach and when such methods are appropriate.","Grey-box modelling; Artifical neural networks; Energy demand; Ship design; Yachting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Because of the huge distance to other stars, such exoplanets will appear as single unresolved pixels. A single pixel can, however, provide information about what the planet looks like because its brightness varies in time as it rotates about its axis and orbits its star. Several researchers have shown that these changes in brightness can, indeed, be used to retrieve a map of the planet. Their methods use the Lambertian model of diffuse reflection to retrieve albedo maps of the planet's surface. We aim to develop new algorithms that can retrieve maps of non-Lambertian planets with a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere, clouds with water droplets that cause rainbows and oceans that exhibit a glint feature. We also aim to evaluate the validity of the Lambertian assumption for such non-Lambertian planets. We numerically compute reflected light curves with the previously mentioned non-Lambertian effects, including the polarization of the reflected light. Instead of retrieving albedo maps, we classify facets by their surface type and cloud coverage, using convolutional neural networks. We show that a convolutional neural network can classify facets on a non-Lambertian planet with an accuracy of 87% for an ideal geometry and no noise, when the rotation axis is known. Using another neural network architecture, we show that the rotation axis can be constrained with a mean squared error as low as 0.006 for our training data and similar results are seen for a model Earth. Including polarization in the retrieval improves the rotation axis retrieval's mean squared error (MSE) by roughly 15% and the classification accuracies of ocean facets and cloudy facets by 2% and 1%, respectively. We show that a retrieval algorithm that relies on the Lambertian assumption causes concentric artefacts about the poles when applied to light curves of a non-Lambertian planet for all inclinations besides face-on. The MSE of the rotation axis retrievals increases by roughly one order of magnitude for these inclination when making the Lambertian assumption.","Exoplanets; Neural Networks; Exocartography; Artificial Intelligence; Astronomy; Planetary Sciences; Planetary System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

And the COVID-19 outbroke from Wuhan (China) at the end of 2019, offered an up-to-date perspective as an opportunity to investigate and improve the vulnerability of metropolitan regions in highly contagious global diseases. Metropolitan Region Amsterdam, is one of the most developed regions in the Netherlands and the world, who is playing a significant role in globalization. However, in this emerging public health crisis, MRA has been the most vulnerable region as the current epidemic hotspot. The concentration of corona cases in the region has resulted in various negative impacts, both directly and indirectly.<br/>Considering these problems, this project is a research-oriented design in MRA for the post-pandemic vision. Firstly, through a series of theoretical, political, and spatial analysis, the main problem of MRA is that it is vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic due to a vicious cycle of urban vulnerability which has been exposed and intensified by the hazard of COVID-19. And the basic reason is related to its attachment to continuous economic growth. The government of MRA has also paid attention to this problem and attempted to transfer its development from a pro-financial model to a pro-well-being model with a theoretical underpinning called “Doughnut Economics”. However, like many other experimental tests, this transformation follows the traditional planning method which is not suitable for dynamic risks like the pandemic. Therefore, this research is aiming at spatial and political strategies based on the methodology of dynamic planning to improve urban resilience facing the pandemic in the post-COVID MRA. And the final concrete outcomes will be on different scales. There will be a vision of post-COVID MRA through a set of strategies of municipalities and institutions to improve urban resilience. And on a local scale, there will be a resilient design for different pandemic vulnerabilities for an equal and sustainable community.","Globalization; Metropolitan Region Amsterdam; COVID-19; Urban vulnerability; Urban resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","52.370216, 4.895168"

Time overrun is a serious issue facing projects over the globe, each day of overrun would lead to negative consequences on the other success factors of the project and vice versa. This Saudi vision 2030 have imposed a lot of pressure on public organizations to deliver their development plans and projects on time. Hence, this research addresses the time overrun by investigating the underlying causes of the phenomenon in Saudi public projects of building type. To reach the goal and objective of this research a case study under the Saudi Ministry of Commerce is investigated. The research starts by conducting desk research on existing literature. This is used to develop guidelines and govern the case study investigation. Then, the case study investigation commence. The data collection in the case study is derived from 3 main sources. Document analysis, semi-structured interviews, and participant observations. Finally, the analysis of data continuous through rationalizing findings and combining results from the case study and literature. After rationalizing and combining all findings in this research, two groups of factors are believed to be the critical issues which drives delays in Saudi’s public projects of building type. The first group is related to organizational culture. Client engineers focus on delivery deadline rather than the deliverable quality, at least prior to construction. Moreover, a lot of friction is present in communication and collaboration during construction due the traditional organization structures practiced in a bureaucratic and centralized manner. The second group is related to technical aspects. Unsuitable contractors are awarded projects due to Contractors Classification System not being able to reliably gauge the actual performance of the contractor in practice. Lastly lack of local labour with required skill, high reliance on foreign labour, strict regulations on working visas, and the Kafala system, have caused the lack of productivity&amp; availability of skilled labour.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Moreover, this housing, like all of our stock, should meet the future standards of energy performance, which leads to an urgent need for energy upgrading. The question arises if keeping this housing is feasible, when taking into account the complexity of technical, social, economic and aesthetic issues.“ (New Heritage, 2020) During this studio the aim has been to develop an answer on the housing stock of H-Buurt, an area within Bijlmermeer, and if it is suitable for further use or not? To make decisions on this, value-based design shall help to extract existing values as well as challenges to get a good understanding of the needs of H-Buurt.   THE PROJECT IDencity is located in Hakfort as part of H-Buurt in Amsterdam Zuidoost. The project addresses the non-used car park Hakfort. The car park has been built as part of the expansion plan of Amsterdam in the mid 70’s and was originally connected to the high-rise dwelling Hakfort. The once facilitating function to society is nowadays not given anymore, since the car park finds itself empty and faces demolition in 2022 in order to make space for a new development driven by the municipality of Amsterdam. As original part of Bijlmer’s master plan, the car park incorporates the characteristics of the functional city approach, which puts the car into the centre of the city and gives Bijlmer part of its identity.  Therefore, IDencity aims to draw an alternative solution to the demolition by analysing its value from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Programmatically, the project proposes an adaptive, low-carbon transformation of the existing structure into a social hub, while offering an answer to the national housing shortage by adding 120 dwellings.  In summary, IDencity aims to push circularity on both a building and a society level by creating places and spaces where the existing is complemented by additions to serve both environment and society.  RESEARCH QUESTION How can the adaptive reuse of car park Hakfort offer solutions to current challenges while strengthen the genius loci? Sub question 1: How can the transformation provide an answer to the national goal of carbon neutrality by 2050? Sub question 2: What possibilities of serving the one million homes challenge can be achieved while keeping the existing car park’s structure?  Sub question 3: How can the adaptive reuse enhance the buildings’ value to society?  CONCLUSION Environmental challenges as well as societal needs have been extracted as key elements of the proposed project. To deal with an existing structure, which is currently not used and to re-dedicate it to society can show value in keeping existing buildings rather than demolishing them. Additionally, environmental goals, like carbon neutrality and circularity can give impulses to confront oneself with the building in depth. In the framework of “New Heritage”, this results in a value based design that extracts values, enhances them and can result in valuable proposals that helps to transition towards a more sustainable built environment. In the case of car park Hakfort, high environmental value of its structure, historical value as part of original Bijlmer, as a functional city, can be used to develop a highly connective building, which interacts with society and surroundings.  With its holistic approach, the project tackles relevant themes while offering flexibility to its solution.","Circular Design; zero carbon; Passive Design; Adaptive Reuse; Transformation; Bijlmermeer; Hakfort; Social housing; Car park; Community Centre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","52.306452, 4.9550303"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This graduation project focuses on the livability issues in the historic neighbourhood under the Chinese context. The current Chinese heritage preservation focuses on conserving material, while livability means adapt physical settings for present use. Therefore, the living condition in the historic neighbourhoods is often neglected. This thesis aims to solve the conflicts between heritage preservation and livability by using a broader definition of heritage value. Literature suggests that the community is also a part of the heritage. The well-being of the local community will add a unique identity to the heritage site. So heritage preservation and residents' livability should be linked together. The value of heritage is attributed to the material and shown in the social aspect. There are multiple values attributed to a heritage site, and the spatial transformation process is actually the consequence of prioritizing specific values. By comparing three heritage management approaches that prioritizing different stakeholders and values, a hypothesis is made. The hypothesis states that the value-based approach can be used to improve livability in historic neighbourhoods under the Chinese planning context. This thesis uses Meiyuan Xincun as a site to test this hypothesis. There are three steps in the research by design process. Firstly, research on the broad heritage value will be done to understand the values based on perspectives from all stakeholders. These values overlap or even conflict with each other, and prioritising certain values will lead to different spatial transformation strategies. Secondly, the material-based approach (prioritizes the value of the physical element) and the living heritage approach (prioritizes the local community) are tested to explore the conflicts between the current heritage preservation approach and community needs at the spatial level. Then the value-based approach is adopted to solve the conflicts and come up with spatial strategies. Lastly, design scenarios are developed based on these strategies and are assessed by livability indicators. The outcome of this thesis is a set of methods to elicit heritage values, spatial transformation strategies, and design scenarios to show the livable future in historic neighbourhoods. The research concludes that the local community's livability is vital in preserving historic residential areas' true value. The value-based approach can be used in the current Chinese planning context to improve livability.","Heritage value; Livability; Historical neighborhoods; Heritage management; Chinese context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Design of the Urban Fabric","","32.0603,118.7969"

Site analysis is strongly supported by spatial data analysis in both 2D and 3D, which offers a more comprehensive understanding of urban settings. Furthermore, 3D city modeling and 3D web technologies not only help visualize design scenarios but also promote communication among the stakeholders for better decision-making. The first version of a GIS-supported design tool for new urban development areas was developed in a previous study (which we refer to in this thesis as the “Buurt Generator”). The tool works with the Netherlands’ data context to assist the realization of the 3D models of urban development projects in an interactive computer environment. The pre-design stage of the tool was based on the semantic 3D city model with different urban KPIs stored in the 3D City Database. Template neighborhoods that match the development goals of the project were then selected to extract design KPIs. The design KPIs, together with the development goals of the sites, form the basis and guidelines for generating different scenarios in the design stage. The scenarios are then integrated back into the 3D city model and visualized in 3D and are disseminated via web platforms. This thesis aims to test, critically review, and propose extensions and improvements for the “Buurt Generator”. It starts with a general review of the tool and literature reviews on related concepts and technologies. Then, the thesis investigates the accuracy of the generated 3D City model in estimating buildings’ volumes. Since volumetric measurements play a critical role in deriving urban KPIs and design KPIs, their accuracy is highly concerned. Hence, a volumetric comparison approach with other existing 3D city models is employed. The second focus is on the expansion of urban KPIs and design KPIs. The work bases on a data-driven approach that considers spatial and non-spatial, volumetric, and non-volumetric urban parameters. Moreover, the thesis proposes a comprehensive understanding of the city context and the project site based on available data. Then, it would be the task of the urban practitioners to reason the design KPIs for the new urban development project. The third focus is to develop a framework to study the impacts of the design solutions on the urban tissue. The framework is developed chiefly based on integrating the design into the 3D city model to perform (spatial) analysis. One of the energy-related criteria – the solar radiation factor - is chosen for further elaboration. The thesis contributes to the further integration of 3D city models into the urban planning process and explores its possibilities in assisting urban practices. It confirms the usability of the generated 3D model in estimating buildings’ volumes. It expands the list of urban KPIs and assists the information query to understand the city context and extract specific information. It bridges 3D City Database and Grasshopper for post-assessment of designs regarding solar radiation and opens the way for other urban simulations.","GIS-supported tool; 3D Model; urban development projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Described as ‘old city, young vibe’, Nijmegen is known for its left-wing politics, stimulated by the presence of Radboud University. It has a heterogeneous population of different subcultures, social groups and nationalities that create a vibrant community. However, the public realm does not currently reflect the bricolage society of Nijmegen, instead mirroring the capitalist agenda of the global retail industry. Shops dominate the city centre, providing a limited realm for social participation or interaction between residents. Furthermore, ownership analysis of the city highlights the poor participation of the residents in making the city. Local organisations are instead situated on the border of the city, absent of footfall or public engagement. With the acceleration of loneliness, isolation and unemployment arising during the global pandemic, the value of the community needs to be reaffirmed in Nijmegen now more than ever. My design proposal aims to provide an alternative solution by democratising the public realm of Nijmegen to harness the social potential of the city. Inspired by Lefebvres notion of ‘The right to the city’ which called for a reclamation of public space back to the community, Common Ground aims to provide an alternative public realm for Nijmegen residents to create a new relationship to their city and community. The Molenpoort mall personifies the commercial city centre of Nijmegen, opened in 1972 as the as the first enclosed shopping centre in the city. Today, the Molenpoort is a void in the city, unloved by residents with a high number of abandoned shops. The current state of the Molenpoort represents the changing needs of society. No longer are people interested in shopping for leisure, instead favouring the convenience of online shopping. I therefore propose a redefinition of the Molenpoort plot from a dilapidated shopping mall to a community centre and coworking space for local businesses, aimed at strengthening the social and economic structures of your city.","Urban Architecture; Bricolage; Reuse; community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Urban Architecture","51.8126° N, 5.8372° E"

This quality has led to the development of hollow glass blocks during the industrial revolution. These blocks are durable, fire-resistant, exhibit heat resistance, and sound deadening properties. In recent years, new explorations have begun to uncover the structural potential of glass. It is no longer just a cladding material but is also being used for load-bearing applications due to its high compressive strength. One of the most significant drawbacks of cast glass bricks’ current systems is the unsatisfactory thermal performance due to the absence of a cavity and the thick cross-section, which acts as one thick single glazed unit. On the other hand, hollow glass blocks are non-load-bearing due to their thin cross-section of the inner wall which results in buckling under a load and thus, the system is susceptible to failure. A promising solution to these problems is to develop a block that can exhibit structural strength and thermal insulating properties. To do this, design guidelines were developed by carefully studying both the systems followed by different design options which were analysed for their thermal performance. It was observed that the incorporation of cavity, inert gas and coatings greatly influences the thermal property. Also, the presence of continuous glass cross-section is important for structural integrity which generates thermal bridges that negatively impacts the thermal performance of the system. This analysis resulted in two different design options; the fusion block and the lattice block. To fabricate these blocks, careful consideration was taken in the design of the moulds and the chosen glass type. For the two designs, two separate connection systems are employed; one an embedded connection and the other an interlocking pattern. Both connections generate a dry assembly system which is reversible, easy to assemble and easy to maintain. To understand the feasibility of the proposed design solutions, a case study of Ports 1961 store in Shanghai was considered. The blocks were applied on the façade of the building and this was then analysed based on the developed design criterions. The proposed blocks have better thermal performance values, optical and aesthetical qualities. The installation process is much simpler and reversible. The fabrication process is however complex but that is due to the absence of standardized manufacturing system for cast glass bricks. The present research does not conclude in a single suitable design option but rather two concepts. The exploration of different concepts for thermal performance, it’s fabrication and installation results in a general understanding of the parameters that affect the development of this technology. To realize the proposed system, structural verification, fire safety and acoustics still need to be carefully considered and additionally this need to be validated experimentally to derive statistical data for its safe application. Nonetheless the performance values indicate a great potential in the technology.","glass block; cast glass; interlocking geometry; Thermal Performance; embedded connection; hybrid glass block; load bearing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

To achieve this goal, solutions must be found to store large amounts of cleen energy on board of ships and convert the chemical energy in an efficient way with these drive-trains. Hydrogen is considered as a promising solution for this. However, storing hydrogen is complicated and requires much volume. To overcome this barrier, hydrogen can be stored in dense hydrogen carriers (DHCs).

Many abatement strategies have been adopted for its combat in all these different fields. This graduation project focuses on the built environment and tackles the application of TiO2 on facades of existing buildings with historical significance in the city of Athens. TiO2 is a promising photocatalytic material, capable of neutralizing air pollutants via the mechanism of photocatalysis and under certain environmental conditions. Its use aims at a wider application in urban landscapes, in order to alleviate the air pollution levels. This widespread application can be achieved by the creation of 3 different TiO2 application levels that can be applied on the different facade components. The choice of application is realized mainly via the assessment of their NOx efficiency, the assessment of values employed in the field of conservation as well as their effect on cost. This evaluation takes place through a number of steps that a designer can follow for the selection of the suitable level as well as for the components that can eventually be modified.<br/><br/>In the current thesis, this set of steps/roadmap is presented and validated with the help of an actual case study, where the balconies are the main chosen facade element undergoing alterations of the 2nd level. It goes without saying that the flow can be followed and applied for different components, different buildings or even in different cities and locations. Athens is simply a representative example for this cause. Since the main goal of the project is the optimum performance of TiO2, a series of different balcony panels are designed via the manipulation of surface area and roughness, two very crucial factors for the successful activation of photocatalysis and pollutant neutralization. The panels undergo 3 different analyses: radiation, wind and NOx removal with a successive evaluation, resulting in one ideal geometry, whose NOx levels are compared to those prior to its implementation and those of the 1st application level.<br/><br/>The final part of the graduation project focuses on the results yielded by these different analyses and the conclusions that are pointed out and could prove pivotal for a designer. After the application of the panels to the chosen street canyon, the evaluation of the NOx abatement efficiency, the value and cost of each tested scenario, results indicate that the 2nd application level of TiO2 is more efficient than the 1st in terms of NOx removal efficiency. Nevertheless, a combination of both levels could considerably balance all 3 criteria, namely the aspect of NOx removal, values and cost.<br/><br/>Keywords: Urban Facades I Air Pollution I TiO2 I Air Purification I Historical Significance<br","Urban facades; Air Pollution; TiO2; Air Purification; Historical Significance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","37.983800, 23.727500"

The development of urban logistics industry is increasingly important for the overall development of the city. At the same time, in the context of China's remarkable improvement in urbanization and the rapid increase in urban population, the development of urban logistics is also facing many problems. First, high-density logistics demand in cities has increased the difficulty of organization and management. Second, urban logistics has to face urban land use planning and limited resource allocation. Third, urban logistics will have an external uneconomic impact on the urban environment, transportation as well as economy activities. The sustainable development of urban logistics and the interaction between logistics activities and other aspects have become an urgent research subject. The urban logistics system is taken as the research object in this thesis. In order to solve the problems existing in the modern urban logistics system in China, scientific planning methodology and feasible strategies are proposed in this article, aiming at improving the development of the logistics industry and promoting the sustainable development of cities in China. In order to be more realistic, a case study is employed. Chongqing, the representative city of the central and western regions of China, is selected as the study case object. Unlike other old-fashioned first-tier cities in China, Chongqing has experienced the process of rapid industrialization. The analysis of Chongqing has a good reference for many of China's quasi-first and second-and-third-tier cities. Through the analysis of the background of urban logistics development and literature research, the core research question of this thesis is put forward. “How can we propose a reasonable development strategy to promote the sustainable development of modern logistics in Chongqing while ensuring the optimal results of the entire system?” In order to explore this problem, this paper begins with an analysis of the urban logistics system architecture, the role of public policy, the evaluation standard for the development of urban logistics system, and conducts an in-depth study on the status quo and challenges of the logistics industry in Chongqing. The analysis results show that Chongqing logistics faces four major difficulties. Firstly, the global trade volume and logistics demand is shrinking. Secondly, logistics corporations is scattered and lack of modern technology and services. Thirdly, there is a greate shortage of senior logistics talent. Fourthly, the traffic congestion in the main urban area is severe. Based on the theoretical analysis and research, a system dynamics model is constructed. The model highly simulates the internal supply and demand structure and historical data of the logistics system in Chongqing. Through the analysis of the model operation, the comprehensive effect of several strategies on various evaluation criteria are simulated and analyzed in this paper, including promoting the growth of trade demand, improving modern service capability, attracting logistics talents and alleviating traffic congestion. Based on the simulation results, the optimal policy suggestions for the sustainable development of urban logistics in Chongqing are put forward.","Urban Logistics system; system dynamics; demand & supply","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Therefore, a main point of developments and research in the aviation sector is regarding the reduction of its climate impact. The climate impact of aviation can be reduced by making use of alternative fuels, such as liquid hydrogen. A suitable candidate for the use of liquid hydrogen may<br/>be the Flying-V. The Flying-V is a flying wing aircraft with the fuselage sections inside the wings. The wing are swept back to form the shape of a V. The original concept of the Flying-V promised improvements in aerodynamic efficiency and a lower mass compared to its reference aircraft, an A350-900. The Flying-V is in further development at the TU Delft. A liquid hydrogen fuel tank is integrated into the concept of the Flying-V. The objective of the research is to contribute to the development of a Flying-V with liquid hydrogen, by making an assessment of the implications on the fuel system and the effect on mission performance resulting from the change of fuel. A parametrization of the fuel tank is defined while keeping the outer mold line of the Flying-V constant. The fuel tank is located in the tapered part of the wing and is designed to be an integral fuel tank. The mechanical and thermal design of the tank is analyzed for a range of pressures and insulation thickness. Using a thermal resistance analogy the heat transfer rate of the ambient temperature to the liquid hydrogen is determined, resulting in the performance of the fuel tank. The main performance parameters of the fuel tank are the available fuel volume and the fuel tank weight. The influence of the integration of the fuel tank on the mission performance is analyzed and compared to the flight performance of a kerosene based Flying-V, the FV-900. The flight performance analysis uses fuel fractions and the Breguet range equation to determine the available cruise range fromthe available fuel volume. The FV-900 is compared to two case studies each using three different configurations. The first case study consists of a retrofit case, where an existing Flying-V is retrofitted with a set of hydrogen fuel tanks. The second case study allows an iteration of the structure to take into account the portion of the maximum take-off weight that is not used due to the decrease in fuel weight when changing kerosene for liquid hydrogen. Regarding the different configurations, these include different combinations of fuel volume and cargo volume. Configuration 1 has the largest fuel volume with a minimal cargo volume. Configuration 2 ensures there is enough cargo volume for the luggage of 440 passengers in exchange for fuel volume. Configuration 3 increase the fuel volume slightly, compared to configuration 2, and has enough cargo volume for the luggage of the design number of 328 passengers. It is concluded the available fuel volume is not enough for liquid hydrogen to have equivalent flight performance compared to a kerosene based Flying-V. In case of the retrofit the operating empty weight is increased up to 8.7%. All configurations have a lower range. Regarding the largest fuel volume, the range is 35%, 42% and 51% lower for 440, 328 and 250 passengers, respectively, compared to the FV-900. In case of the structure iteration the take-off weight is reduced by 32%, 37% and 37% for configuration 1 to 3, respectively. All the configurations have a lower range compared to the FV-900. Again, regarding the largest fuel volume, the range is 18%, 23% and 32% lower for 440, 328 and 250 passengers, respectively, compared to the FV-900. The configurationswhere the payload volume is sufficient have a significantly lower range. This research provides usable designs of a Flying-V using liquid hydrogen if one is willing to compromise on the range and available payload weight for no CO2 emissions. However, keeping the payload weight up, the available volume left is not enough volume for liquid hydrogen to have equivalent flight performance.","Flying-V; Liquid Hydrogen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying V",""

(mentor); Myers, N.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the field of Adaptive Optics (AO) a new development has been introduced recently: the Wavefront Sensorless Adaptive Optics (WFSless AO) approach, which only uses camera measurements to optimize image quality and does not use a Shack-Hartman (SH) Wavefront Sensor (WFS) [Booth, 2006, Débarre et al., 2009, Hinnen et al., 2008]. In order to optimize the image quality of a point source or an extended object, the residual wavefront should be minimised as much as possible. The Model Based Approach [Booth, 2007, Linhai and Rao, 2011] is a very promising approach which can be used for this optimisation, resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of measurements. This approach uses an initial measurement and then excites all the modes that need to be optimised separately and takes a measurement of the intensity distribution after each excitation. Then, the Second-Moment (SM)’s of the measured intensity distributions are computed and used for the computation of the optimal control input, which is the coefficient vector in a Zonal representation of the wavefront. The control vector can be used to minimise the residual wavefront and thus optimise the image quality. However, in this approach it is assumed that the incoming wavefront does not change between the first and last measurement. This assumption is called the frozen window time and it is not valid for real-time problems. In [Lianghua et al., 2017] a solution was proposed for this problem, by using a precomputed independent set of modes, which allows a decoupling of the modes and computations and reduces the frozen window time. Unfortunately, this research introduces more measurements which leads to more delay. In this thesis a new approach will be presented, the Continuous Model Based Approach. This approach tries to solve both problems simultaneously: a reduction of the number of measurements and a reduction of the frozen window time. The number of measurements will be reduced by combining the excitation and optimisation step and the frozen window time will be reduced by using a two step optimisation, based on [Lianghua et al., 2017]. First, the validity of this approach will be proven mathematically and with simulations, then it will be tested in experiments. In order to make the step to real-time experiments, also an online calibration method will be introduced, proven and tested. This is also a new technique, based on the Model Based Approach [Linhai and Rao, 2011] and can be used to obtain the correlation matrix for any set of modes, focussed on actuator responses.","Adaptive Optics; Deformable mirror; Wavefront Sensorless; optics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

As a consequence, our sensitive data is in danger of getting exposed. The field of multi-party computation attempts to mitigate this by studying protocols that enable parties to perform their operations digitally, without the risk of privacy-violating data leaks. Among those operations are multi-party private set and multiset operations. In such a scenario, multiple parties, each with their own input set or multiset, want to collectively find the result of an operation over their inputs, without revealing these original inputs. Such operations are the cornerstone of many complex privacy-preserving protocols. For example, a two-party private set intersection forms the key to several privacy-preserving contact tracing protocols.<br/><br/>While multi-party private set and multiset operations have been studied for almost two decades, these privacy-preserving alternatives are often impractical: one limitation is that, to the best of our knowledge, all known protocols require several interactions between the cooperating parties. This means that rather than simply submitting their input, each party must actively take part in the protocol. In this thesis, we propose the first non-interactive protocols for privately computing set and multiset operations between multiple parties,<br/>which rely on two constructions for non-interactive secret sharing. In addition, for operations that cannot be trivially performed using our non-interactive primitives, we propose minimally-interactive alternatives that instead rely on a homomorphic cryptosystem over elliptic curves. By using elliptic curves, this cryptosystem is faster and requires less bandwidth than the commonly used cryptosystems over integers, while retaining the same level of security. We provide proof-of-concept implementations of exact and more efficient approximate protocols that take on the order of seconds to minutes to compute, depending on the number of parties and possible inputs. Finally, we give formal proofs for the security of these protocols, so as to offer practical and provably privacy-preserving alternatives to otherwise sensitive operations.","Privacy-Enhancing Technology; Set operations; Multiset operations; Private Set Intersection; Private Set Union; Multi-Party Computation; Non-interactive; Secret Sharing; Homomorphic Encryption; Elliptic Curve Cryptography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); de Jonge, F.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Our relationship with money is a complicated one. Whatever your stance is, it is clear we all need money, whether we like it or not. It allows us to buy our basic necessities to survive. Food, heating, a roof over our heads. Next, it also allows us to thrive, by enabling us to buy things and experiences to help us develop as individuals. So, if we need money, why not try to get more than the minimum, so we can actually thrive? Take good care of ourselves and our loved ones? This thesis, set out to help achieve that. To help and enable more people to set themselves up for a life of less worries and more financial security and thus freedom. <br/>Young adults reach a phase in life where they start earning a proper income, often quite a hike compared to living off their parents or as a student. The question that arrives en masse then, is what to do with that extra income. It is easy to also start spending more, but that’s not always the wisest decision. Many turn to their savings accounts, but with interest rates close to 0 and inflation devaluing your money’s <br/>worth, parking it all at the bank is not the smartest move either. <br/>After building up a safety net of cash, investing should be brought into the equation, to help young adults build wealth and take care of themselves, today and in the future. People seem to realize the necessity of investing more and more, as seen by the latest increase in the amount of retail investors, both here in The Netherlands (17% increase in 2020 as reported by Centraal Beheer, 2021) as internationally: 15% of the current investors started in 2020 said CNBC (Fitzgerald, 2021) <br/>The problem here is that many retail investors invest in a risky way. 44% of new investors said they were trading short-term in 2020. 2021 then has seen the rise of many ‘meme-stocks’ such as Gamestop (GME), AMC, BB and many others, where retail investors just “yolo” into buying them, regardless of any fundamentals. Incentivized by the massive gains they see others post, as well as peer pressure, newbie investors massively pile into bets (it is called Wall Street Bets for a reason), treating the stock market like a casino. <br/>On the other side, we see individuals who are scared away from investing even more, because the situation described above confirms their biased opinion that investing is very risky and dangerous. It is clear that both groups need to be taught how to invest the right way: long term, diversified and slowly. Investing a little bit each month (Dollar Cost Averaging). This method may be the most boring, but it also the most successful. <br/>Furthermore, investing and finances in general have a lot to do with psychology. How can you resist the Fear Of Missing Out, the ups and downs of the stock market and stick to your plan? Research made clear that a mindset should be taught to young investors. <br/>Many of the users surveyed stated they were ready to start investing, but didn’t because of a lack of knowledge (34%), not knowing how to start (21%), thinking it was too risky/scary (17%) or thinking it was too complex (15%). The existing solutions, such as YouTube videos, Podcasts and books didn’t take these issues away, as became clear in the user interviews and the context research. <br/>After the research phase was done, a precise User Journey was created, pinpointing the issues people phase when trying to get started with investing. The following conclusion was drawn: users want to get more knowledge on the subject of investing, from a source they trust and offered to them in a gradual, guided manner, with their starting knowledge in mind. People often feel overwhelmed and lost. <br/>After the phase ‘from research to design’, the report follows with the design solution: MoneyMinds. An online platform on financial education that is mindset-focused, gives fundamental knowledge and gives people the confidence to be independent. Through video courses, exercises, personal coaching and a helpful community, MoneyMinds aims to empower young adults to take control of their financial lives, to learn about and start investing the right way, with the right mindset. <br/>The report finishes with a strategic part, that describes how MoneyMinds can be realized: the value proposition, the business model and a full brand manual, allowing for a consistent online presence and matching the audience. <br/>All things considered, this Master thesis offers interesting insight into a relevant problem of today, with a clear path forward. I hope you enjoy reading it.","investing; finances; education; platform; community; money; mindset","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A CM is a structure designed with the intention to deform: motion is achieved by deformation of flexible members of its body. CMs are designed by topology optimization (TO) algorithms, which use boundary conditions as an input and give a design as an output. Additive manufacturing (AM) is used to fabricate the designed CMs, as geometric complexity is much less of a problem compared to conventional methods. One issue with AM is that local overheating during printing can cause defects in the design, specifically for metal designs, as the temperature is very high during printing. In this thesis, a CM is designed using TO and fabricated using AM. The design is then printed and analysed for overheating defects to determine if any defects due to overheating are present. Also, a computationally inexpensive AM model is integrated into the TO for CM, which can detect zones prone to local overheating. Next to that, the robust optimization method is used to obtain a design which needs much less post-processing. The obtained designs are compared to existing TO methods and it is found that the added constraint can reduce overheating by a large amount while maintaining a relatively high CM performance.","Compliant mechanisms; topology optimization; additive manufacturing; Hotspot constraint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thesis explores the potentials of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) for the design of autoreactive facade systems without using additional energy. The exploration is conducted and assessed through the design of a facade concept for the city of Athens in Greece, aiming to improve both the indoor and outdoor environment by means of a kinetic autoreactive system, with a focus on the building’s direct and indirect impact on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. The methodology follows a feedback-loop logic informed by environmental and energy performance evaluation studies conducted in the Grasshopper environment to optimize the shape, geometry and movement of the proposed shading component. Throughout the facade design development, a comprehensive and systematic computational toolset is being developed, targeted on the abovementioned performance evaluation studies with the goal to compose a combined digital tool to facilitate designers and other specialists in the area. The proposed facade system, as a case study application and outcome of this iterative process, features a dynamic seasonal response, triggered by the temperature changes and exhibits a dual function. During the cooling-dominated periods, the aim is to reduce the cooling demands, by increasing the reflective surfaces directing the incoming solar radiation to the atmosphere, while also increasing the shading and self-shading effect through undulated geometries. In the contrary, during the heating-dominated periods, the system adapts a double facade function with multiple-cavity zones for heat amplification, with a higher solar absorption enabled through larger sun exposure. The system’s mechanism composed of two SMA wires, operates in coordination with a pivot axle and rotating mechanism, in combination with elastic steel threads and membranes that can accommodate the dynamic deformations. The activation of the SMAs, due to the environmental temperature changes, causes their linear deformation and initiates with a single movement the linear and rotational movement of the components involved, in a cause-effect internal system, while also controlling the cavity aperture. The design aims to minimize the need for actuators and mechanical parts with no additional energy, while the study evaluates in parallel the energy and environmental performance in the urban microclimate and the potential for passive operation. Through the development and assessment of the facade concept, the objective is to explore the potentials and limitations for the application of autoreactive envelopes in the facade design and development. At the same time, the aim is to exploit the possibilities and optimization potentials offered through the developed iterative computational workflows. This is realized through an interoperability logic of the digital tools used for the data interchange, which can be developed and used as a toolset in a broader range of applications, with the studied facade design as one demonstration example of its use in practice.","smart materials; Shape Memory Alloys; passive; autoreactive; adaptive facade technologies; kinetic; shading strategies; environmental response; Urban Heat Island effect; computational workflows; Grasshopper; performance-driven optimization; thermal; energy performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","37.983810, 23.727539."

(graduation committee); Helmons, R.L.J. (mentor); Chassagne, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to the increased demand for materials like cobalt and nickel, there is an interest to mine polymetallic nodules from the deep-sea. These nodules are abundantly distributed along the abyssal plains, e.g., the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the North East Pacific. These nodules lay spread on top of a seabed consisting of very fine clayey sediment and will be collected by a seafloor mining tool (SMT). During the operation, the seabed will be disturbed, resulting in a suspended sediment plume discharged by the SMT. This plume can have a significant environmental impact through a blanketing effect on the abyssal fauna and create a disturbance in the water column affecting the entire food web structure. Hence, identifying the critical processes and quantification of sediment plume dispersion is essential to predict the potential environmental impact better and determine what technologies would enable a lower ecological impact. Spearman et al. (2020) investigated turbidity plumes generated by deep-sea mining experiments and discovered faster settling velocity than the theory described. They hypothesize that this is due to flocculation. The settling speed depends on the density, concentration, shape, and cohesive properties of the sediment. Flocculation in the deep-sea can occur in two ways, by salinity or by organic matter. Gillard et al. (2019) showed that the flocculation response of CCZ sediment strongly depends on the concentration and applied shear rate. To analyze to what extent aggregation could influence the plume dispersion, experiments are conducted in which the effect of aggregation can be adjusted selectively. Lock exchange experiments are used to analyze the impact of aggregation by comparing results with illite based on freshwater, saltwater, pre-existing bed, and added flocculant. Additional experiments with artificial CCZ sediment are done to ensure that the illite experiments are not too idealized. To prove that the settling velocity is increasing in saltwater, settling velocity tests have been performed. I performed experiments with illite suspensions in a settling column. An increase in settling velocity is observed due to the rise in salinity up to 75 g/L of illite. Lock exchange experiments are performed to mimic the particle-driven currents. The lock experiments involve a lock release of a fixed volume suspension of sediment from the mixing section into the outflow section. Similar observations were made by doing lock exchange experiments. A decrease in average head velocity is shown for all experiments up to 75 g/L of illite in saltwater. To further induce flocculation and mimic organic matter in the water column, experiments with flocculant were done. Mixing the flocculant, Zetag 4120 or Zetag 8125, in the mixing section will further decrease average head velocity compared to saltwater. Zetag 4120 even ensures very fast settling as the end of the tank will not be reached For low concentrations in saltwater, flocculation is shown as the tail decreases more rapidly than freshwater. Flocculation with higher mass concentrations of illite is shown when flocculant is added to the mixing section. Adding Zetag 4120 to saltwater makes the current even settle quicker. As the SMT will move over a pre-existing bed, experiments were done to see if a pre-existing clay bed has consequences for the behavior of the flow. A clay bed has been made by running a lock exchange experiment with a concentration of 100g/L. This test then had, depending on the next experiment, one day or two days settling time before it was used for the new experiment. One-day bed experiments overall encountered a decrease in average head velocity. Two-day bed experiments overall experienced an increase in average head velocity. To mimic the existing sediment in the CCZ and determine if illite experiments are not too idealized, experiments were done with artificial CCZ sediment. The currents behaved differently compared to illite, as they produced more coherent flows for low concentration. Also, it showed better effects on lowering the ecological impact when looked at mass concentrations of 100g/L of artificial CCZ sediment as gelling occurred. To minimize the environmental impact created by deep-sea mining, the SMT should produce a discharge between 50 and 100 g/L of artificial CCZ sediment. Gelling will occur, which has a positive effect on minimizing the plume dispersion.","plumes spreading; Deep-sea mining; Flocculation; Settling behavior; Settling; Turbidity currents; gravity current; Particle-laden flow; Offshore mining; sediment flows,; Entrainment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-21","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The reliability and safety of the applications are entirely dependent on good design which in turn rely heavily on predictable materials performance. Where at these low temperatures the fracture toughness is of importance to be known (alongside mechanical properties such yield and tensile strength). At CERN at the materials and engineering department (EN-MME-MA) a testing facility is being commissioned for the measurement of mechanical at cryogenic temperatures. A tensile test facility has been realised, yet no such set-up is available for fracture toughness measurement. The aim of this thesis was to develop a test set-up for the measurement of the fracture toughness in order to realise a universal cryogenic testing system, which can be used for both tensile tests and fracture toughness test at low temperatures. A design for a set-up is proposed for the measurement of the fracture toughness which can be employed within the current cryostat. The design of the tooling and cryostat have been extensively verified using numerical methods taking into account thermal effects (such as conduction and contraction) and the varying material properties at these low temperatures. A modified C(T) specimen is proposed for more robust and reliable set-up. For this modified specimen it is shown with numerical methods that the modification are expected to have a negligible impact on the fracture toughness measurements. Tests have been performed using the proposed design with four specimen fabricated from two different materials (SS316L and Ti6Al4V), at both room temperature and at 4 K (using liquid helium). The set-up is shown to provide sufficient data for the characterisation of the fracture toughness for both Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics tests as well as Elastic Plastic Fracture mechanics tests.","Cryogenic; Cryogenic Tanks; Materials; Material Research; Mechanical Testing; Engineering; low temperature; Fracture mechanics; J-Integral; Stress Intensity Factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Such a survey can also reduce the large safety margins during the design and optimize the conservative inspection and maintenance schedules. One of the emerging variants of structural health monitoring are the so-called digital twin systems that not only allow the monitoring of the structures, but can also simulate the past or the future state of the structural integrity. In the context of this thesis, the feasibility of a digital twin system for the structural health assessment of marine structures based on machine learning algorithms and utilization of big data is examined. The main research question is if the digital twin technology can be enhanced with machine learning to accurately monitor the structural health of marine structures in terms of loading and fatigue damage accumulation. In order to answer this question four modules have been developed and tested. The first module uses artificial neural networks trained on operational data to predict the fatigue damage accumulation and the frequency that corresponds to the maximum stress power density. The error of the developed networks turned out to be negligible in the investigated cases, with standard deviation of less than 4% in the predictions. The peak frequency of the stress power density is predicted using a random forest regression algorithm. The optimized version of the algorithm has led to an accuracy of 93% with standard deviation of less than 1% in the predictions.<br/>The second module is used to recalibrate the design response amplitude operators of the structure using the predictions of the first module or the operational data, if available. The design response amplitude operators are scaled and shifted in order to minimize the deviation between the spectral fatigue calculations and the predicted (or measured) data.The third module is a static/quasi-static load-reconstruction module. Using on-board strain measurements it is able to calibrate the loading of the structure based on a reformulation of the conventional finite element problem for static and quasi-static loading. A sensitivity analysis of the algorithm effectiveness have been performed using multiple load cases in which the reconstruction error turned out negligible. The fourth and final module relates to structural reliability analysis. This module is based on the estimation of the Hansofer-Lind reliability index as a minimization problem. The employed optimization engine is a variation of the particle swarm optimization algorithm using chaotic system behaviour to iteratively calculate the user-defined parameters. The limit state equation is formulated in a way that it takes the uncertainties related to the fatigue damage accumulation prediction model and Miner's Rule into consideration. Uncertainties related to the material and the fabrication process are not taken into account. The developed modules have been tested on structural details of a vessel monitored in the scope of Monitas Joint Industry Project (JIP). About a year's worth of data has been used to train the machine learning algorithms.","Digital Twin; Machine Learning; Structural Health Monitoring; Big Data; Marine structures; Fatigue Life Prediction; Load Reconstruction; Structural Reliability Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The project site, where currently the shopping mall of Molenpoort in the city of Nijmegen, has a long history of transformations with different buildings emerging over the centuries and tangible traces of events embedded in the materiality of the surroundings. Together they compose an urban collage with distinctive fragments and historic layers. The resulting mixture of functions that usually do not appear in close relation: the church of Petrus Canisiuskerk, the shopping mall with the parking roof, the coffee shop street, and the surrounding housing, offered a great set of tools for us as architects bricoleurs. Therefore, accepting the existing collage in Molenpoort has led to a concept of the interweaving of the shopping mall, the church, the new intervention, and fragments of the surroundings into a complex urban entity so as to create a civic centre for the diverse subcultures present in Nijmegen. As a result, the project is symbolized by a circular path that ties together the different typologies, functions, and users and provides a full circular walk around. It is, as well, a gradual walk through the history and the present day of the site that gives the possibility to experience at close hand the bricolaged fragments. The selected program is questioning the role of the church and the shopping mall as truly social spaces in today’s society by introducing primary social activities. Such primary activities will happen in a dinning room, a community centre, a student housing, a learning centre, and a stage, all with the aim to stimulate social interaction between people with different backgrounds, social status, or religion. The project, that stems from a careful observation and appreciation of the context of Nijmegen – in terms of not only its urban collage with the available at hand materials but also of its colourful palette of inhabitants, aims at creating an architectural intervention in which the existing people of the city and the existing material structures could come together in order to generate a new public ground for the bricolage of society.","bricolage; urban collage; civic centre; community; layers of time; diversity; appropriation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Rotterdam urban fabric is built in an area of amalgamation of very interesting landscape conditions surrounding it. Defined by the rich natural and cultural history, this structure has been home to different habitats for a variety of flora and fauna. However, the urban core disconnects these areas due to the lack of diverse ecological green and blue networks. The urban core of Rotterdam is abundant with characterless and unused spaces that can be termed as urban voids. The paved and stony surfaces, large infrastructure, abandoned structures, etc in these spaces heat up the unbuilt (or are they really ‘unbuilt’) spaces and create hotter environments. This, with the changing climate also poses a risk of disasters like flooding, heat islands, and habitat loss. These Urban voids are not designed for ecology and resilience to the changing climate. This project envisions creating an ecological spatial design framework through landscape architectural principles for the urban fabric of Rotterdam by making use of the urban voids, thereby also making it resilient to climate change. This is achieved by identifying the urban voids on a regional and local scale and intervening at the right degree with the desired toolbox of landscape architectural principles generated through case studies of different typologies. The voids are extended into the surrounding habitat conditions so that the ecological connections become stronger. Theories, mainly the patch-matrix-corridor theory, create the backbone of the framework strategy. Target species based on the relevance and location of intervention are identified and incorporated in design generation. Design elements tackling issues of heat islands and flooding are incorporated in site design based on the existing situation on site. These are combined with the local characteristics of cultural, ecological, and functional layers. This results in creating a landscape design framework for the Rotterdam urban area connecting the ecological biotopes around the region and catalyzing climate change resilience in the region, by making use of the urban voids. The design will look at creating a network through the urban area on a regional scale by studying the overall regional ecological composition. This is important to create a larger network for biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Rotterdam region that is home to different types of habitats, evolved through historical, natural, and cultural processes. This will be followed by detailed spatial design on local scales in the urban voids by taking into account the various characters native to these voids, like the morphological, socio-cultural and ecological values. This will result in the creation of a toolbox of different typologies that could be used to reanimate these voids ecologically as well as for climate resilience. These new spaces will bring identity to these spaces and use them to create new local flows respective to the area of design.","Landscape Architecture; Landscape Ecology; Urban Ecology; Urbanism; Urban Voids; Green Cities; Future Cities; Nature Based Urbanism; Tidal Park; Ecology; Resilience; Recreation; Tidal Nature; Architecture; Identity; Rotterdam; Urban Nature; Heat Islands; Flooding; Species; Biodiversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","51.924400, 4.477700"

It answers the design question: “How to transform the current neighbourhood in such a way that both insiders and outsiders would live in Hoptille by a neutral or positive choice?”. This transformation balances the interests of insiders and outsiders resulting in image enhancement in combination with the preservation of identity. Finally, densification has been taken into account regarding the topical question of 1 million homes by 2030.","Stigma; Charisma; Identity; Densification; insiders; outsiders; 1 million homes; Hoptille; H-buurt; Bijlmermeer; Amsterdam South-east; Amsterdam; Almere Haven; New Heritage; preservation of identity; image enhancement; demountable; characteristics; orientation; circulation; postmodern; architecture; 80s; negative; low-rise; mid-rise; posters; ghetto; safety; energy neutral; Bijlmer; Residential; transformation; social problems; ethnic background; poverty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","New Heritage","52.309433, 4.954407"

(mentor); Labetski, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Historical 3D city models have been increasingly used for the preservation and communication of the cultural heritage to a wider and more diversified public. In the recent years, they have also been of a growing interest in other domains such as in urbanism or in economy. However, their potential for supporting new use cases has been restricted by the difficulty to generate these models. Historical 3D city models can only be reconstructed from historical sources, such as historical maps, and this means dealing with all sorts of constraints and inaccuracies. As a result, reconstructing historical 3D city models is a challenging process that is to date still essentially manual and time-consuming. This thesis investigates to what extent the reconstruction of historical 3D city models can be automated. Several existing methods for extracting building footprints from historical maps have been tested and compared so as to identify the pros, cons and use cases of each method and all the challenges of working with historical maps. Based on these experiments a fully automated methodology was developed. It relies on three main stages: (1) the processing of the historical maps to extract the building plots, (2) the subdivision of these building plots into individual building footprints and (3) the reconstruction of a LoD2 historical 3D city model using 3D procedural modelling. This methodology was implemented with historical maps from two different study areas, Delft and Brussels, and for different epochs in order to reconstruct a dynamic historical 3D city model for these cities. The results show that the methodology workflow developed in this thesis allows to reconstruct automatically historical 3D city models for different historical maps collections and for different study areas. The main differences between the two case studies, Delft and Brussels, regard the implementation details (i.e. data availability, running time and user-defined parameters) but similar results are obtained, which show the suitability of the methodology to be applied for other study areas. Two elements are identified as main factors influencing the quality of the results obtained: the quality of the scanning process and the symbology of the historical maps. For historical maps that were properly scanned, with sufficient spatial resolution and strict symbology rules, the methodology provides accurate results by identifying more than 84% of the building plots in the ground truth and classifying properly more than 89% of the building plots. In addition, all historical 3D city models reconstructed have their geometries valid at more than 99%. Overall, this thesis provides a methodology for reconstructing automatically historical 3D city models from historical maps along with guidance and hints about this process and about a series of other methods, so that any user can find the most suitable method for their needs.

(mentor); Vuik, V. (mentor); Gijón Mancheño, A. (mentor); van Wesenbeeck, B.K. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The risk of flood risk is increasing with global trends such as rising sea levels, land subsidence, increasing populations in coastal areas and economic growth. Traditional solutions to reduce flood risk are a levee or a dam; however, the research on hydraulic engineering is increasingly promoting nature-based solutions for flood protection. Salt marshes and mangroves can attenuate waves and could thus help to reduce failure probability. This research focuses on the attractiveness of mangroves in flood risk reduction. The essence of the reasoning followed in this research is that mangroves in front of a levee enable a lower levee and therefore reduce costs while maintaining the same failure probability. There are three aspects related to this assessment: the biological behavior of mangroves; the physical behavior of waves and storm surge in a mangrove forest; and the economics of flood risk, levees, and mangroves. Mangroves grow under specific conditions, such as high temperatures, saline water with fresh water input, between mean sea level and high tide, and with low wave impact. Mangroves attenuate waves, with the attenuation rates depending on mangrove height, stem diameter and density, in addition to the water depth, wave height and wave period. Lastly, the costs of restoring mangroves and building levees have been considered. In this thesis a method has been developed to define the optimal configuration of a levee-mangrove system. The goal is to reach a desired safety level while keeping costs as low as possible. Costs consist of building a levee, restoring mangroves, and the expected annual damage and maintenance. This depends on the ratio of mangrove and levee costs, the ability of mangroves to attenuate waves, and levee characteristics. Although all variables have equal significance in defining the mangrove forest width, the variety in levee and mangrove costs and significant wave height are the variables most likely to affect the optimal mangrove forest width. Mangroves are only useful to decrease the height of waves, thereby reducing wave run-up. This wave-attenuating effect decreases exponentially with the mangrove forest width. all Based on the literature, when considering common values for levee costs and mangrove restoration costs, levee characteristics and wave attenuation, wave attenuation is strong enough such that the optimal mangrove forest width is larger than zero. The costs of restoring mangroves depend on the required measures to enable mangroves to grow back. Hydrological restoration involves returning the mangrove area to the natural condition where mangroves are able to grow. This could, for example, be restoring a fresh water source that has been blocked by human intervention. If hydrological restoration is required and can be done cheaply, then this is the most effective option. Planting mangroves can also be a cost-effective option. Sheltering the mangrove area by using a permeable structure requires more financial resources. If large-scale filling or excavation is required, costs may increase significantly, and it is likely to be too expensive to use mangroves in flood-risk reduction. However, this cost assessment may change if the ecosystem services of mangroves are taken into account. As a rule of thumb, for mangroves to be economically effective, restoration costs [USD/m/m] in case of a 1 m wave height should remain below 0.003 times the variable levee costs [USD/m/m]. This value increases linearly with the wave height. For levee costs of 1 million USD/km/m, of which 0.6 million USD/km/m variable costs, the mangroves restoration costs should not exceed 0.18 USD/m/m, or 18,000 USD/ha. For Kaback, Guinea, the optimal mangrove forest width and height of the levee are assessed. These are 900 meter and 1.1 meter respectively, with the levee located just behind the mangroves. 900 meter is the maximum width possible, considering the physical conditions where mangroves grow. Since mangroves are growing back naturally already, costs for mangroves restoration is limited to fixed costs. The model developed in this study can be used to create a ``mangrove opportunity map”. This map can indicate—based on physical attributes—the costs, hydraulic conditions such as storm surge and wave height, and whether mangrove restoration for flood risk reduction is effective. Governments or organizations such as the World Bank can use this method to explore whether mangrove-based strategies are an option. Further research can focus on improving the cost estimates on levees and mangroves. In this study, costs are assumed to be linear with the levee height or mangrove area. In practice, levee costs might especially increase exponentially with the levee height, which would make mangroves more effective.","Flood risk; Mangroves; costs; dike; Levee; economic; Ecosystem Services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Implementation of the circular principles is riddled with regulatory, cultural, financial, and other sector-specific barriers that stall transition efforts and delay their benefits. However, entrepreneurial actors perceive these barriers as potential opportunities, as they are able to create value in a highly uncertain environment. Entrepreneurial Behaviour has historically steered new and disruptive innovations across industries. It is shown in new and incumbent organisations at three conceptual levels: the individual level, the business model level, and the network level. This paper conducts an empirical study based in the Netherlands to suggest that actors who are key decision-makers for construction projects need to show entrepreneurial behaviour to overcome the barriers, making it a key driver for change.

(graduation committee); Qian, QK (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Collaborations and partnerships between supplying parties are of great importance for adopting circular principles in the built environment and should be investigated within the development of circular supply chain management (CSCM). Therefore, the focus of this research is on collaboration opportunities within CSCM, where the need for active and dynamic actor networks, supply chain learning, future visions and circular business models will be discussed in more detail. During this research I worked together with the Municipality of Rotterdam through an internship. They also found research into collaboration opportunities within CSCM interesting and necessary. Besides, they added that they wondered what the role of the municipality could and should be in supporting (local) circular supply chain collaboration (CSCC) in order to scale up the circular renovation of the private housing stock in Rotterdam. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this research is advising the Municipality of Rotterdam on their position in this innovative process of CSCC. To achieve this goal, this research focusses on the following research question: How could CSCC be facilitated by municipalities to achieve upscaling of circular renovation of Dutch owner-occupied housing? First, an analysis into the state-of-the-art has been carried out, which has looked into the current circular construction and renovation concepts and principles being used in Europe, the Netherlands and the city of Rotterdam. Based on this analysis, the following research variables have been identified, which needed to be further investigated: adoption of innovations, actor networks, supply chain learning, future visions and circular business models. Second, a literature review is given of relevant theories and concepts related to these variables, which has identified the main research indicators that I wanted to use to reflect upon during and after the empirical part of the research (listed in the theoretical framework). Third, a stakeholder analysis has been carried out, consisting of two phases of semi-structured interviews, an (additional) internal survey and a focus group discussion. In the first interview phase, interviews were held with public parties, including municipalities, universities and knowledge institutions. In the second interview phase, interviews were held with private parties and civil organizations, including actors of different (local) market parties, branch organizations within the building sector and interest groups for homeowners. This analysis has resulted in four main barriers of CSCC in which the municipality could exert influence: insufficient internal integration, insufficient communication, insufficient realisation and insufficient facilitation. To find more clarity with regard to the first main barrier, an internal survey was circulated within the municipality, which provided more insights from a broader group of employees from different clusters and departments. The remaining three main barriers have been discussed within a focus group, where I have investigated from a management perspective whether the suggested opportunities in terms of (more) concrete strategies mentioned by different stakeholders, will work or not to solve these identified barriers and mismatches in practice. Fourth, the results of the stakeholder analysis have been compared with literature, examining the importance of obtained solutions for the identified mismatches in more detail. This has resulted in an advisory action plan for the Municipality of Rotterdam, which states that the municipality should act as a director and should focus more on the following main tasks: (1) Internal integration: stimulate and coordinate internal integration between colleagues, visions, ambitions and social challenges of different clusters and departments. (2) Communication: create an open, transparent and accessible local communication network between public and private parties, including the municipality, knowledge institutions, market parties, interest groups for homeowners and residents. (3) Realisation: implement developed circular and modular building and renovation ideas, principles and concepts, starting with designating municipal buildings and public space where the local market is given the opportunity to experiment. (4) Facilitation: offer various municipal (learning) tools to help the local market in the start-up phase, like (online) theme sessions, comprehensive courses and teaching programs/workshops. The full advice is drawn up on the basis of these four main tasks. Practical recommendations are given that could be a positive stimulus for CSCC to achieve upscaling of circular renovation of Dutch owner-occupied housing. These recommendations answer the main research question.","Supply Chain Management; Circularity; Sustainability; Renovation; Housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Due to a phenomena of pressing urbanization undergoing in the city, the majority of the old industrial, harbour areas or structures are demolished and replaced by new ones with different functions and forms so that the memory of the past urban structures gets erased. Some lands instead are used and then abandoned or even never used and left uncultivated. These, usually covered by wild vegetation, can host a high range of biodiversity, especially in not polluted soils. So what is the future of the Wastescapes in the city of Rotterdam? The reuse and regeneration of abandoned spaces in the city can offer great potential for urban biodiversity and also for the improvement of socialization. For example, a wasted space can also be converted into a community garden where people can meet up and explore nature. The sense of belonging to a place is fundamental and it can be discovered again via urban landscape design. Any space can represent a point of integration and be perceived with its own identity. Citizens should be led to understand that a space can represent a place of sensorial and mental experience. At large scale, the transformation of four critical industrial areas along the River Maas into new ecological hotspots leads to the increase of urban vegetation (biodiversity), the depollution of the soil, water and air. At medium scale, a Southern area of intervention is chosen : Waalhaven and surroundings. This represents a crucial crossing point where the contrast between city and harbour/industry is much stronger and more evident . At small scale, the district of Oud Charlois is chosen as an experimental area to intervene and test the success or failure of the intervention. The design framework applied to the project site represents a resilient, efficient, sustainable, circular system that can adequately show the potential of Wastescapes in the city in urban, social and ecological terms. This consists in the selection of particular zones of intervention where various design eco-components are applied according to duration, scale, site issue. This “Toolbox” represents a set of flexible urban elements capable of promoting biodiversity, addressing climate change and easing urban fragmentations. In particular, the quality of people and species’ life is improved by some processes of phytoremediation of polluted soils which, combined with plant gradients, can lead to the improvement and enjoyment of the urban environment (water, soil, air).","Wastescape; Reuse; Regeneration; Circularity; Sustainability; Identity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

(mentor); Roukouni, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this thesis, the significance of the so-called ‘induced demand’ phenomenon is discussed. This phenomenon can occur when a stretch of road which is prone to congestion is widened. Although this widening should in theory solve congestion problems, it can often spawn additional effects, typically undesired and occasionally unforeseen. These effects could include shifts of travel in route and time (people formerly avoiding congested roads by departing at another time or taking a detour will now return to that road), but also new travels might be made which were not made before road widenings. All of these effects might eventually converge to raise traffic amounts to levels with which the widened road is just as prone to congestion as it was. This additional traffic demand which a widened or new road creates is commonly denoted as ‘induced demand’.<br/>Although this induced demand phenomenon has commonly been acknowledged to exist, it seemed like there was little agreement on both its amount as well as its significance. Some readings seemed to suggest that for every percent of road capacity added, a percent of new traffic will occur, whereas other readings suggested that the effects were much smaller and might be limited to, e.g., merely a third of a percent extra traffic for a percent extra road capacity. A semi-systematic literature review has been carried out, enabling to compare writings of various origins, ranging from scientific papers via documents from governmental advisory bodies to newspaper articles for the general public.<br/>These writings help to determine the significance of induced demand. It has been found that there are major discrepancies, even amongst scientific literature, concerning the ways in which the induced demand is measured, both in terms of the actual quantities which are compared to each other, as well as the time span over which the aforementioned effects are measured. These discrepancies do not aid in creating an unambiguous message for policymakers, nor do they facilitate a straightforward approach in avoiding new congestion on widened roads. Combined with the remark to be found in many scientific writings that the induced demand topic is in need of more research, a relayed recommendation from this thesis is therefore that more research be performed into this topic. However, the main recommendation is that the newly done research be more standardised, both in terms of the measured quantities and the time span over which the effects are measured.","induced traffic; road design; BREVER","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

When real estate managers and designers team up with hospital stakeholders, it results in better project outcomes. This collaboration benefits from appropriate visualisation tools. Both physical mock-ups and virtual visualisation tools are no longer an exception in such projects with various stakeholders. Therefore, maximising the contribution of the visualisation tools becomes more critical. Currently, there is a limited knowledge on how visualisation tools are used best to involve the stakeholders within hospital (re)construction projects. This thesis addresses the following research question: ‘How can visualisation tools contribute to the involvement of stakeholders in hospital (re)construction project?’ Four underlying questions are studied to address this question: 1) which hospital stakeholders are involved and how; 2) which visualisation tools are used and how; 3) when in the design process are the visualisation tools used; 4) what impact the visualisation tools have in hospital (re)construction projects. A systematic literature review and three hospital case studies, including 21 stakeholder interviews, have been conducted. The resulting findings are validated by an external expert panel. The findings show that visualisation tools support the involvement of hospital stakeholders by enforcing communication and improving stakeholders understanding. The visualisation tools positively impact: 1) gathering stakeholders design feedback; 2) forming compromises; 3) creating design support and enthusiasm. In general, visualisation tools have a positive effect on stakeholders' involvement; however, it depends on when in the design process and for what purpose the tools are used. Inadequate use of virtual visualisation tools can mislead stakeholders since virtual visualisations show design details that might not be decided yet. The physical mock-ups and virtual visualisation tools have different purposes and complimentary benefits in hospital (re)construction projects. Using the visualisation tools, depending on the to be served purpose, one should gradually show more realistic visualisations. A combination of visualisation tools has the highest impact when in early design phases, coarse physical mock-ups are used, and virtual visualisation tools reveal refinements at a later design phase.","stakeholder involvement; hospitals; visualisation tools; virtual visualisation; physical mock-up; 3D; VR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

We investigate if smoothed aggregation AMG or adaptive smoothing and prolongation based AMG improve upon the classical Ruge-Stüben AMG. It is shown that Ruge-Stüben AMG needs fewer iterations for the test problems. However, smoothed aggregation AMG has a smaller data-size, which is of interest for situations with limited memory or large systems of equations. Moreover, the mechanical problems considered have a coefficient matrix with a block structure, which can be exploited by preconditioners like block Jacobi or the incomplete block Cholesky decomposition; but also the smoothed aggregation AMG can take the block structure into account when creating coarser grids. Further, we examine if the results of the conjugate gradient method can be improved by adding a deflation preconditioner based on the proper orthogonal decomposition or rigid body modes. They are combined with a direct or stationary iterative preconditioner, resulting in two-level preconditioned conjugate gradient methods. The various implementations of such methods are discussed, and the deflation preconditioner is shown to generally reduce the number of iterations compared to the single preconditioner.","Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient; Algebraic Multigrid; Deflation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This function can be easily replaced by a more extensive function. In addition, the application displays user health metrics such as the heart rate, connection state, and it can update the firmware of the implantable medical device.

The motivation for this research is to better understand the turbulent mixing phenomena in the SBL and to be able to represent the mixing more accurate in weather prediction models. In the current models, this mixing is highly uncertain or even missing. It is likely that this mixing is driven by thermal memories that are spatially distributed over the land-surface in the form of surface heterogeneity. These surface heterogeneities (e.g. ditches or roads) effectively store heat during the day and then turn into heat sources, driving turbulent mixing, during the night. A simulation with surface heat sources in an idealized SBL is setup and four case studies are performed. The simulations show that the heat sources clearly influence the mixing in the SBL. A buoyancy plume is formed above a heat source. The plumes of two heat sources are attracted towards each other. At smaller distances the plumes even merge and form a single plume. In the three-dimensional simulations, the distance between the heat sources has an influence on their effect on the SBL. At small distances, the kinetic energy in the system decreases with increasing distances between two heat sources. At larger distances this decrease appears to level off. Apparently, the bending and merging of the plumes allows turbulent length scales to increase, causing the effect of the buoyancy sources to be larger. To verify these simulation results, a field experiment is conducted. An infrared camera pointing at a vertical high-emissivity cloth was able to capture the two-dimensional (vertical and horizontal) air temperature pattern above heat sources. The merging effect between two plumes is also observed in this field experiment. At small distances a single merged heat plume was visible above two heat sources and at larger distances two separated heat plumes are formed.","Land-surface heterogeneity; Stable boundary layer; Turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Calibration of the sensor box was done by collocating it for ∼74 hours with an air quality monitor of the Dutch air quality network in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands. Regulatory air quality data could be obtained at 10 s resolution for CO, NO and NO2. The absence of regulatory O3 measurements results in discarding the corresponding lowcost sensor in further analysis. Next, multivariate linear regression and random forest models were constructed to transform the raw sensor box measurements into meaningful concentrations. The random forest model has a strong tendency to overfit, even though it performs better in absolute numbers. The final calibration models for each species are multivariate linear regression models with an RMSE for CO, NO and NO2 of 118.13 μgm−3, 2.38 μgm−3 and 3.96 μgm−3, respectively. Corresponding correlation coefficients are 0.94, 0.99 and 0.98. Three different types of aircraft activity have been evaluated by deploying the sensor box at Amsterdam Schiphol airport. On 22 January 2021, the air quality impacts from landings on the Polderbaan were investigated by deploying the sensor box ∼200 m from the runway. On both 17 and 19 February 2021, the impact of aircraft departures on the Aalsmeerbaan and Kaagbaan were investigated by measuring ∼300 m from the runway. Finally, on 30 March 2021, air quality impacts from taxiing aircraft were obtained by taking measurements on the airport apron with aircraft coming as close as 43 m to the sensor box. The obtained sensor box measurements represent total air quality concentrations, which contain impacts from multiple sources. Quantifying the proportion of aviationattributable concentrations is achieved via a datadriven approach in which a baseline signal helps to extract the local aviationattributable signal. It was found that this strategy results in local signals that can be linked to activity from aircraft.","air quality; low-cost sensors; aircraft; air quality sensor box; Schiphol Amsterdam Airport; air pollution; alphasense; gas sensing; airport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Cloud movement is the main source of unpredictability within solar forecasting and can be recorded using All-Sky Imagers. Conventional cloud modelling methods using image analysis techniques are unable to extract the spatial configuration and the temporal dynamics of clouds, resulting in poor predictions of the interaction with solar radiation. The goal of this study is to create a deep learning model for short-term irradiance forecasting between 0 and 21 minutes into the future using all sky images combined with auxiliary data. The model performance was assessed by comparing the deep learning model with the persistence model and showed that the deep learning model outperforms the persistence model with 24.8%. A sensitivity analysis to data usage is performed showing that besides using more data, also the variation of using multiple years of data results in better performance. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the model to input variables is assessed, showing that using the clear sky irradiance as input improves model performance with 16% and that meteorological data does not improve performance. Additionally, the model performance was evaluated during different sky conditions showing that the deep learning model outperforms the persistence model for all sky conditions, except overcast conditions. An example of the model behavior is extensively described, showing that the deep learning model tends to predict the trend of the irradiance fluctuations rather than the actual fluctuations. Next to that is in this study shown that the current deep learning model occasional miss important weather events, like obscuration of the Sun, resulting in large irradiance prediction errors. A pathway for future improvements for deep learning models to forecast the short-term irradiance is provided.","Deep Learning; Sky Camera; Irradiance Forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-18","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The aim is to reduce congestion at terminal gates which is caused by a lack of port-hinterland alignment.

This policy is designed for the implementation of a Time Slot Management System (TSMS) and takes the behavioural aspect of Truck Operating Companies (TOC) into account. The time of day preferences of TOC for container pick-ups are inferred from the exchange of information between port and hinterland stakeholders using discrete choice modelling (DCM). These preferences are used to shift truck arrivals and consequently reduce the high waiting time of trucks at terminals gates. To evaluate the effectiveness of the designed TAS policy, we developed a simulation platform that resembles terminal operations using discrete-event simulation (DES). For the allocation of trucks to a certain time period, a choice-based heuristic is designed to approximate the optimum configuration of the TAS policy. The optimum TAS policy design shows that significant gain can be obtained at a low shift rate. Moreover, a measurable amount of waiting time gain can be achieved by the application of the designed TAS policy.","port-hinterland alignment; traffic control strategy; Truck Arrival Shift Policy; Time Slot Management System; Discrete-Event Simulation; Discrete Choice Modeling; allocation heuristic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","ToGRIP",""

Reuse requires much less energy than recycling and therefore has much potential. However, reuse is still rarely put in practice due to the many challenges constructing with reuse involves. One of these challenges is the complex design process. In this research, I have developed a tool able to design with reused elements. Topology optimization is combined with reclaimed elements with the aim to simplify the design process for steel truss structures. The member adding scheme of Linwei He. et al (2019) is used as a basis. Adaptations and additions are made to include geometry information and limited availability of reused elements. In the final tool, capacity utilization of elements is maximized, material volume of the structure minimized and percentage of reused versus new elements maximized. In conclusion, discrete topology optimization proved to be an effective method to simplify the complex design process. The tool can generate multiple different designs for every optimization problem with limited complexity. Volume increase or decrease compared to standard designs depends on availability of elements. In examples in this research volume increase could be limited to 20-30% with limited availability of elements. With large availability, multiple different designs could be obtained with an average unity check close to the maximum unity check. Recommendations are to improve applicability of the tool and to make an estimation of the reduction in carbon emissions and construction costs compared to designs with new elements. These estimations could increase attractiveness of designing with reused elements. Finally, accessibility of designing with reuse should be increased. It should be less difficult to obtain data of existing buildings planned for demolition to experiment with designing with reuse.","Reuse; Topology optimization; Ground structure method; Member adding scheme; Parametric; Design tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) can be a solution for future bridge renovation when only the deck of the bridge needs replacement. In these cases the deck is replaced with an FRP sandwich panel deck. The main advantages are a high strength-to-weight ratio which is beneficial for the ever heavier lorries and the fast installation which prevents hindrance. To connect the FRP deck with the steel superstructure, bolted connectors are used. One of the aspects that needs to be investigated before the bolted connectors can be applied are the relevant loads on the bolted connectors. The focus of this thesis will be to investigate the relevant static and fatigue forces on the connectors. <br/>55 existing girder and arch bridges have been selected from a database of Rijkswaterstaat. For each bridge an appropriate FRP deck has been designed with an analytical method. The bridges are modelled in SOFiSTiK to investigate the shear forces in the connectors. The layout of the bolted connectors is kept constant for all bridges, as well as the transverse stiffness of the connector. The shear forces are calculated with a linear analysis. Before the static and fatigue analyses, first the hybrid interaction of the model is investigated. The hybrid interaction is the amount of horizontal forces transferred between the FRP deck and the steel super-structure. Hybrid interaction is beneficial as it increases the strength of the structure. Two models of a generic bridge have been investigated, the first is the standard model which is supposed to use hybrid interaction. The second model is an adjusted version to create a non-hybrid model. Three parameters are investigated: the deflection, the slip and the longitudinal stress over the height of the beam. The results show that hybrid interaction is created with the bolted connectors in the standard model. <br/>In the static analyses two loads are investigated: traffic loads and temperature loads. The shear forces in the longitudinal direction are investigated as this is the governing direction. Before the loads are applied on the existing bridges, first a generic bridge has been investigated to gain knowledge over three bridge parameters. First the facing laminate of the FRP deck is changed. Second the direction of the webs of the FRP deck, and this also changes the connector layout due to feasibility. Third the expansion coefficient of the resin is changed. For traffic loads mainly the direction of the webs influences the shear forces in the connectors. For temperature loading the shear forces are largely depending on the expansion coefficient of the laminate, the close the expansion coefficient to the expansion coefficient to the steel superstructure, the lower the shear forces. The existing bridges that have been investigated resulted in a large scatter in results. The layout of the superstructure of the bridge influences the facing laminate and the number of connectors, which influences the maximum shear forces in the connectors. For both traffic and temperature loads, the connectors close to the supports experience the highest shear forces.<br/>Besides the static loading, also fatigue is investigated. The shear forces in the connectors are calculated for one bridge, namely the approach bridge Nieuw Vossemeer. This bridge is one of the heaviest loaded bridges in the static analyses and it is according to expect judgement facing deck problems. Two aspects are investigated in the fatigue analysis, first the magnitude and second the type of load cycles. The magnitude is important as this needs to be below the slip resistance of the bolted connectors. The type of load cycles is important as this is related to how damaging the load cycle is. Because there are no S-N curves for bolted connectors between an FRP deck with a steel superstructure, the damage cannot be calculated. The R-ratio is used to investigate the type of load cycles. To calculate the R-ratio of a load cycle, the minimum shear force is divided by the maximum shear force. The resulting number expresses the type of load cycle. For the results, distinction has been made between the connectors close to the supports and connectors in the lengthwise middle of the bridge span. Both the magnitude as the type of loading is different. <br/>Finally, it is concluded that the shear forces in the connectors is one of the aspects to be considered when designing a bridge with hybrid interaction between the FRP deck and steel superstructure. A large scatter of shear forces can be expected, depending on the bridge layout. Incorrect deck design can result in unnecessary high shear forces. The connector layout can be optimised to make the design more cost efficient.<br","FRP; Shear force; Bolted connection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes these methods inappropriate for the highly correlated features derived from STR data for NOC estimation, as these techniques can generate examples with impossible feature value combinations. For this reason, we constructed a new counterfactual method, Realistic Counterfactuals (ReCo), which generates realistic counterfactual explanations for correlated data. We show that ReCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on traditional metrics, as well as on a novel realism score.

This algorithm has specifically been developed for the DEep Spectroscopic HIgh-redshift MApper (DESHIMA) 2.0, a spectrometer that is designed to observe the waveband from 220 GHz to 440 GHz in 347 spectral channels. This octave bandwidth poses a challenge, due to the spectrotemporal changes in the atmosphere column between the instrument and the target source. Removing the time-varying nonlinear interference and distortion caused by the atmosphere is a difficult task, as the atmospheric emission is much stronger than a typical galaxy signal.<br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to develop a method that can estimate both narrow spectral lines and the broad continuum emission with a higher sensitivity than the currently used method of directly subtracting noisy on- and off-source spectra. We develop a logarithmic data model for separating atmospheric noise from the galaxy signal in position switching-observations. Because the atmospheric transmittance appears as a multiplicative term in both the atmospheric interference and the signal modulation, the logarithmic model allows for an additive decomposition of the data. The atmospheric transmittance behaves as a low-rank component in this model. <br/><br/>Using the model, we develop an optimization algorithm (SPLITTER) to perform the separation of the signal and the low-rank atmospheric transmittance. Several implementations are discussed. The final algorithm uses a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to estimate the atmosphere component and the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for estimating the source signal. Instead of subtracting the noisy estimate of the source from the data directly, a denoised model is used in this step, such that we can trade some spectral resolution for a higher sensitivity. <br/>SPLITTER is tested on simulated data using the Time-dependent End-to-end Model for Post-process Optimization of the DESHIMA spectrometer (TiEMPO), a dedicated software package for simulating DESHIMA observations. We show that SPLITTER is able to estimate the spectrum with a higher sensitivity than the conventional method. The improvement factor in our weighted root mean squared error is up to ~1.7 for the full spectrum and up to ~1.3 for the spectral lines only compared to the conventional method. The larger improvement for the full spectrum is achieved by trading spectral resolution for a higher sensitivity in the smooth continuum. With these results, we have an indication that a statistically driven method for DESHIMA observations can provide better estimates than the current method with the same amount of observing time. <br/><br/>More work is needed to create a robust version of the algorithm, because although the sensitivity benefit of SPLITTER is larger in the continuum regions, there are also situations where the continuum is overestimated. The conditions for this to occur are not yet clear. A more robust version could make SPLITTER a reliable new method that can replace current data reduction methods for wideband atmospheric noise removal. In this way, it can be used to make background-limited direct detection spectrometers on both existing and future telescopes observe more efficiently.","DESHIMA; High-redshift galaxies; Spectrometer; Low-rank matrix decomposition; Astronomy; Noise reduction; TLS; Atmosphere foreground; Convex optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

The parameters are computed via maximum likelihood estimation using between 102 and 104 observations of the SIS process on networks ranging in size from 15 to 55 nodes, for both directed Erdős-Rényi and Barabási-Albert graphs. We vary the network size to demonstrate that for a fixed level of accuracy, the number of required observations increases exponentially with the number of nodes for both the whole network and a subset of links and nodes. We further demonstrate that it may require fewer observations to reconstruct certain nodes based on the degree of the node or reconstruct links based on the degree of the node to which the link is incident. Additionally, if we interpret 106 or more observations as the number of required observations where reconstruction becomes infeasible, a network size of 500 would be infeasible for reconstructing the full network and the approximate limit for partial network reconstruction. The Thesis is extended to look at the SI and SIR models, achieving a similar exponential increase in the number of observations required as the network size increases, for a fixed error.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Network Architectures and Services","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Calcium is an important nutrient for both young and elderly people which can, among others, stimulate healthy bone growth and prevent osteoporosis. Therefore, nutrition with sufficient calcium is of great importance. The highest calcium nutrient density for all foods can be found in bovine milk, which contains on average 1.2 g Ca / L. To increase the amount of bioavailable calcium, milk can be fortified by the addition of different calcium salts. In this research the bioavailability and exchangeability of calcium in unfortified and fortified skimmed milk was studied by in vitro methods using equilibrium dialysis and ultracentrifugation to separate different fractions in milk. Radioactive 45Ca was used to follow the exchange behaviour of calcium between the three different fractions in milk: casein micelles, serum proteins, and soluble calcium. For unfortified milk it was found that 34.9 ± 2.2% of the calcium was present in the soluble phase, 9.1 ± 0.6% was bound to serum proteins, and 56 ± 1.6% was present in the casein micelles, which confirmed the results in literature. In addition, with the investigation of the exchange behaviour of 45Ca, it was confirmed that ~40% of calcium in casein micelles is hardly exchanged.To investigate the influence of calcium fortification on the calcium equilibrium in milk, six different calcium salts were selected to be synthesized: calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, calciumgluconate, tri-calcium di-citrate, calcium lactate, and tri-calcium phosphate. Of these, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium gluconate, and tri-calcium di-citrate were successfully synthesized. Further experiments were performed with calcium chloride and calcium carbonate, intrinsically labelled with 45Ca. From fractionation with ultracentrifugation, it was concluded that addition of calcium chloride led to an increase of calcium in the soluble phase, which might indicate an increase in bioavailability. Fortification of milk with 45Ca labelled calciumcarbonate did not lead to an exchange of 45Ca with the calcium present in milk, indicating that calcium carbonate is unlikely to make calcium in milk more bioavailable. In conclusion, a better understanding of the solubility and exchangeability of Ca in milk and the influence of milk fortification with calcium chloride and calcium carbonate is obtained by using 45Ca as a tracer.","calcium; bioavailability; milk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

This is done through the simulation of the yearly operation of the trolleygrids with PV systems integrated at substation level. It is demonstrated that the integration of PV in trolleybus traction grids can vary depending on the characteristics of the grid and the location. In particular, the increase in power demand, in number of sections served, in the traffic conditions and in the radiation and sunshine duration levels induces an improvement in the performance of PV. The average length of the sections supplied and the removal of the HVAC demand on the other hand, are not beneficial to the integration of PV. It is concluded that the potential of integrating PV in the Gdynia trolleygrid is higher than the one in Arnhem.

(mentor); Voorendt, M.Z. (mentor); Maan, D.C. (mentor); Zitman, T.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The tidal channels in the Eastern Scheldt basin, are out of equilibrium due to the reduced tidal prism as a consequence of the construction of the Storm Surge Barrier in 1986. An estimated 500 million cubic meters of sediment is required in order to reduce the cross-sectional areas of the tidal channels such that the system reaches a new equilibrium. This phenomenon is referred to as sediment starvation. The sediment starvation has been causing severe erosion of the intertidal areas which are the only available sources of sediment to feed the tidal channels because the storm surge barrier practically blocks sediment import into the estuary. The intertidal areas form the habitats for the benthic commu- nity, foraging ground for wader birds, and rest area for aquatic animals. In addition to their ecological value, the intertidal areas are valuable wave dampers and therefore important for flood protection of the hinterland. Their erosion thus harms the ecosystems as well as the flood safety of the hinterland. Mitigation measures have been carried out in the form of directly nourishing the intertidal areas (Roggen- plaat, Galgenplaat, and Oesterdam). These nourishments have had detrimental effects on the ecology that remained for a period of 5 years after the implementation. Nourishing the channels, hence reduc- ing the cross-sectional area of the channels, can feed the intertidal areas gradually, thus preserving or increasing the ecological value of the intertidal area. Nourishing the channels can succeed according to the theory on channel-shoal interaction and the experience from the Western Scheldt; however, this has not been studied yet for the Eastern Scheldt. In this study, the effects of a nourishment in a tidal channel have been evaluated for different nourishing methods, volumes and locations in the Eastern Scheldt Estuary. The objective of this research is to answer the following research question: Is a tidal channel nourishment in the Eastern Scheldt a feasible way of supplying the channel’s surrounding intertidal areas? To answer this question, we applied a 2DH numerical model (ScalOost) that runs in the Delft 3D soft- ware. For this research, the forcing consists out of tidal elevations as well as a wind climate. For reasons of simplicity and to limit larger computational time, wind waves are excluded from the model’s forcing. The numerical model is capable of simulating the hydrodynamic effects and the morphody- namic evolution of a tidal channel nourishment. For four channels, the effect of nourishing on the velocity magnitude is studied for different ways of nourishing (elevating or narrowing the channel). The model results show that the considered nourishments cause a local increase of the velocity magnitude and an additional flow on the surrounding intertidal area during flood. According to the analyses of the computed hydrodynamics, the Krabbenkreek and the Brabantsche Vaarwater channels show the most potential considering the velocity magnitude increases and velocity direction changes. There- fore, these two cases were analysed separately in form of two case studies with an in-depth hydro- and morphodynamic analysis for various nourishment designs. For the Krabbenkreek, a nourishment of 2 million cubic meters increases the maximal flow velocities in the order of 0.15 m/s, such that the critical velocity for sand transport (0.45 m/s) was exceeded over a larger part of the channel; to approximately 750 meters further landwards. The period in which the critical velocity is exceeded, increased by 15 to 60 minutes per tidal cycle. The results of the morphodynamic simulations indicate that 2.5% of the initial nourishment erodes over the first year, of which 80% settles above the MLW-line. Bearing in mind the model’s limitations, it is concluded that a tidal channel nourishment in the Krabbenkreek feeds the intertidal area at a slow pace such that the ecology is not adversely affected. The Brabantsche Vaarwater and its two main bends were used to study the effect of secondary flow on sediment transport and eventually on the behavior of a nourishment. Historic data, as well as theoretical analysis, indicate that in both bends, the centrifugal effect is dominant over the Coriolis effect for gen- erating secondary flow. Model results confirmed this observation, yet the dominance of the centrifugal effect is larger in the second bend. As outer bends tend to erode and inner bends to accrete, the outer bends were nourished (750 &amp; 920 ∗ 103 cubic meters) in order to use the secondary flow to transport sediment towards the inner bend and eventually onto the intertidal area. The simulation results show that for both bends, 3% of the initial nourishment erodes after the first year of which 80% accreted on both the inner and outer bend. The morphodynamic simulation results do not confirm the dominance of the centrifugal forces on sediment transport, as larger accretion rates than those simulated on the inner bends were expected. Although the results were not as expected, the nourishments did increase the velocities which increased the suspended sediment concentration in the channel and as simulation results show, sedimentation in sheltered areas. A tidal channel nourishment in the Eastern Scheldt has been proven to be a potentially successful way of indirectly nourishing the channel’s surrounding intertidal areas. However, the accretion rates were predicted in the order of 2% per year, whereas this would be 100% if directly nourished. Furthermore, the impact of a tidal channel nourishment on the sediment starvation in the whole basin is small con- sidering the proposed volumes in this research only represent 0.4% of the actual sediment demand. Nourishing a tidal channel should be considered in view of maintaining ecological values.","Nourishment; Tidal channel; Numerical model; Eastern Scheldt; building with nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fruit frost is the freezing damage to blossoms when in the growing season the night temperature drops below 0±C. This results in damaged or undeveloped fruits, and a yield loss for the fruit farmer. Several techniques against fruit frost have been developed, including sprinkling and wind machines, often in combination with meteorological models, for example, to predict air temperature. However, the contribution of heat exchange with the soil to moderate orchard temperatures is often not included. In this thesis, this heat transfer is investigated, as an increase of heat transfer from the soil to the orchard during the night is a potential remedy against fruit frost. The research is based on measurements for soil temperature, soil heat flux, and soil moisture from two locations (1. Haarweg (Gelderland), The Netherlands 2. Bushland (Texas), The U.S.A.). First, a numerical model is developed to calculate the temperature and soil heat flux profiles for a soil layer. The results are compared to the results of an already developed analytical model. Second, the thermal parameters, that are of influence on the heat transfer, are analyzed by assessing a) their robustness in relation to the model and b) their relation to soil moisture. Because a numerical model is more flexible for shorter periods of data compared to an analytical model (because of underlying assumptions), it can be used to relate the parameters to (daily) varying soil moisture. Third, the numerical model for heat transfer is extended to the vegetation layer, and, again, the results are compared to analytical results. The model is created by assuming homogeneity in both separate layers and by discretizing the governing heat equation over the domain. The results show that the model reproduces temperature and soil heat flux in the soil layer with similar accuracy as the analytical, harmonic model. One thermal parameter, the diffusivity, is robust and does not show a clear dependency on soil moisture. The model is however sensitive to deviations in the other parameter, the heat conductivity. The model shows a clear relation between conductivity and soil moisture, and from this, a site-specific quantitative relation is determined. This relation however is only valid in the investigated region of moisture variation and we recommend future research to cover data in a broader range of soil moisture. Overall, we conclude that the model successfully reproduced the temperature and soil heat flux throughout the full vegetation-soil continuum.","Heat transfer; Vegetation-soil continuum; Fruit frost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Placing wind turbines together is economically advantageous. It helps in decreasing the use of land or sea space, impact on the landscape and the cost of installation and maintenance. However, placing turbines together has a downside: the aerodynamics interaction caused by the wakes can negatively influence the total electrical power production and structural loads of wind turbines in a wind farm. Wind farms currently apply greedy control strategies, i.e. the wind turbine’s power production and loads are optimized individually. This approach turns out to be sub-optimal for the total performance of the wind farm due to the wake interaction with the turbine that is not taken into consideration. From several studies in the literature, it became clear that advanced control solutions can assist in achieving an overall optimal performance of wind farms. Furthermore, it was found that the static axial induction control approach yields a small to non-existing power gain, while the dynamic induction control results in a significant power gain. The dynamic induction control varies the induction factor over time, where as a consequence, a turbulent flow is induced. This results in an enhanced wake recovery. To implement the dynamic control strategy, an internal dynamic low-order model is desired. The objective of this thesis is to obtain a control-oriented low-order dynamic model that takes the interaction of the flow field with the wind turbines in a wind farm into consideration. The aim is to extract these models from data obtained from high-fidelity simulations, e.g. by using the simulator SOWFA. These obtained models should relate the power outputs and the relevant wind characteristics, such as wind speed and direction, to the collective pitch blade of the (upwind) turbines as an input, where this input can vary over time. Moreover, to allow for practical implementation of DIC approach, varying the control input is limited to a sinusoidal. As a consequence, the control parameters are reduced to the frequency of excitation and the amplitude. This frequency is commonly defined in terms of dimensionless Strouhal number. The second objective of this thesis is to find out whether the obtained low-order model can predict the optimal frequency on the collective pitch that results in maximum power production of the total wind farm. The aim is to find the frequency of the optimal control input on the collective pitch that results in total maximum power production of the turbines in a wind farm. An algorithm such as extremum seeking control (ESC) is used to confirm whether the low-order model is actually capable of determining the optimal frequency. It can be concluded that the reduced-order linear DMD model is capable of estimating and forecasting the high-dimensional wake data by using the actual initial value of the flow field. At the same time, there is a mismatch between the power production obtained by the DMD model and SOWFA data. The periodic input on the collective pitch results in a periodic variation in the power output. The maxima and minima of the resulting power output signal are difficult to estimate with the DMD model. For that reason, the DMD model is not suitable for periodic signals that are used on the control input for the DIC approach. The second objective is not achieved for the reason that the DMD model did not succeed in accurately predicting the power production. It is inconclusive whether the DMD model is capable of determining this dominant optimal frequency.","Dynamic mode decomposition; Dynamic induction control; Flow Modelling; Reduced-order model; Collective pitch control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) changes the role of the driver and may cause a lack of social interaction with pedestrians. This study proposes a concept where the AV is manoeuvre-based controlled via eye gaze, and the AV driver’s gaze is visualised for the driver and pedestrians. However, it was unknown if gaze-based AV control is a viable concept and how the AV’s yielding behaviour should depend on the eye driver’s gaze. Method. A two-agent virtual-reality-based experiment was conducted using two Varjo VR2-PRO head-mounted displays (HMDs). Seventeen pairs of participants (a pedestrian and a driver) each interacted in a road crossing scenario. The pedestrians’ task was to hold a button when they felt safe to cross the road, and the drivers’ task was to direct their gaze according to the instructions. Each session consisted of three blocks of 16 trials: the baseline block, in which the AV driver did not communicate with the pedestrian, and two other blocks in which the driver’s gaze was visualised, namely “gaze at the pedestrian to yield” (GTY) and “look away to yield” (LATY). The effectiveness of the interaction was examined using the pedestrians’ button presses. Acceptance and preference were measured using questionnaires. Results. Pedestrians showed the highest crossing performance and acceptance in the GTY mapping, followed by the LATY mapping and the baseline. The eye gaze visualisation caused pedestrians to spend more time looking at the AV; this effect was particularly dominant when the driver looked at the pedestrian. Conclusion. Gaze visualisation in combination with GTY mapping has the potential to be used as a communication tool for AVs at intersections until full automation of driving (SAE level 5) is technically feasible.","intent communication; virtual reality; eye-tracking; AV-pedestrian interaction; multi-agent interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The addition of the second cache tree allows for a more flexible cache size assignment, as either cache blocks of the small or the larger cache tree can be assigned to a specific instruction group. The assignments of the cache blocks can be reconfigured during runtime. The replacement policy is replaced by round robin and (pseudo) LRU, giving the required flexibility, as well as decreasing cache misses, which results in better overall performance for the $ρ$-VEX. Round Robin reduces the runtime when the application heavily uses the caches by 11.7%, but increases the runtime when the application has a low cache utilization.

The investment costs for the implementation of offshore tidal energy are however, still a drawback. A possibility to lower the investment costs for tidal energy is to implement tidal energy extraction into existing coastal infrastructure. An example of this is the current pilot project in the Eastern Scheldt barrier where five Tocardo turbines are attached to the barrier's geometry. The flow passing the turbines in the barrier is contracted by the barrier's geometry and the weir of the foundation of the barrier. Deltares executed an environmental impact assessment for the pilot project with a measurement campaign and a computationally expensive but accurate blade resolved numerical model. In this thesis, a cheaper computational model is added to the these assessment tools. To do so, a turbine parameterization is introduced in the finite element model FinLab. The relatively cheaper computational model should make it possible to execute more extensive sets of simulations of the pilot project in the future. FinLab solves the non-hydrostatic three-dimensional incompressible Navies-Stokes equations in an unstructured mesh with an optional moving free-surface. The used meshes are refined in certain areas of complex flow, such as the turbine parameterization, near the bed, the recirculation zone of the weir and the wake of the turbine. An extra source term is added to the Navier-Stokes equations on a chosen number of turbine integration points, to implement the turbine into the mesh. The placement of these integration points in a two-dimensional mesh is rather simple, the integration points are evenly distributed over the diameter of the turbine. In a three-dimensional mesh, a Fibonacci series is used to implement an actuator disc (AD) into the model domain. A benefit of the Fibonacci circle is that each turbine integration point represents a similar area. The force in the turbine integration points is determined by three methods: an actuator disc with a uniform thrust distribution (uniform AD), a rotational averaged actuator disc blade element momentum method (AD-BEM) and a non-rational averaged actuator line blade element momentum method (AL-BEM). In the uniform AD method, a measured thrust force is divided equally over all turbine integration points. In the BEM methods axial and tangential forces are determined for each turbine integration point based on the local flow speed and experimental lift and drag coefficients. With these methods, it is possible to estimate the generated power and thrust by the turbine. A tip-correction is added to the AD-BEM method to achieve accurate results of the simulations. Furthermore, in both the AD-BEM and AL-BEM methods a small actuator disc is applied in the nacelle region to reproduce the nacelle's blockage of the flow. The uniform AD, AD-BEM and AL-BEM parameterizations are validated with measurement data of flume experiments of a single turbine, flume experiments with different turbine-weir geometries and flume experiments with multiple turbines. The combination of these last two sets of experiments does very well represent the situation in the Eastern Scheldt barrier. As stated above, the AD-BEM and AL-BEM methods are able to estimate the turbine performance. The results of the AD-BEM simulations show a relative error of the turbine's generated power of within 20% in comparison with the flume experiments. The accuracy of the thrust fluctuates more. The AD-BEM method shows to be able to accurately estimate the location of optimum power harvesting in a combined turbine-weir geometry. Both the power and thrust accuracy depend on the mesh resolution and the turbine's rotational speed. Accurate results can be obtained by fine-tuning these settings. The AL-BEM method should be able to produce at least similar similar accuracy to the AD-BEM method when it comes to power and thrust. The AL-BEM method in this thesis is however, not yet able to do so. The results of the simulations with the three methods are also compared with time-averaged velocity measurements of the flume experiments. In the near wake, the uniform AD method does not imply any wake rotation. The rotation of the wake is represented accurately in a time-averaged sense by the AD-BEM method. The AL-BEM method adds transient features such as the downstream trailing tip-vortices to the flow. The velocity shear and turbulent eddies in the near wake as caused by the different methods influence the TKE in the near wake and the recovery of the far wake. The uniform AD under-estimates the wake recovery. The extra velocity shear in the AD-BEM method improves the accuracy but still under-estimates the recovery rate. Resolving the transient features of the near wake in the AL-BEM method further improves the accuracy of the wake recovery. In the simulations with the weir, the geometry seems to be dominant and the wake recovery rate is more accurate than in the simulations without the weir. The AD-BEM method is applied to the Eastern Scheldt field case. Five turbines are introduced in a mesh which represents Roompot 7 to 9 in a simplified manner. Due to the simplification of the mesh, the resistance of the barrier on the flow appeared to be too low. Therefore, the simulations are executed with an upstream discharge boundary. This discharge boundary makes the model less useful to estimate the environmental impact of the turbines in the barrier and at the moment not yet an alternative for the blade resolved model by Deltares when it comes to estimating these effects. With the discharge boundary, the AD-BEM model predicts the average thrust over the five turbines with a relative error of 3% and the average power with a relative error of 12%. This is only slightly less accurate than the results by the blade resolved model by Deltares, while the computational costs of the Eastern Scheldt field case simulations are only a fraction of the earlier executed blade resolved simulations by Deltares.","Tidal energy; FinLab; Numerical modelling; Hydraulic Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Timber high-rise might prove as a suitable solution to both these challenges. However, there is a lack of implementation of timber high-rise. This research argues that a lack of thorough analysis of timber design alternatives in the conceptual design phase results in the exclusion of further evaluation of timber building designs. This research aims to analyze timber building design alternatives more thoroughly by the development of a tool, based on the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) method. In Grasshopper, a parametric model is created with which timber building designs are generated, validated, and optimized. Two main optimization objectives and two constraints are considered in the tool: Firstly, the structural constraint: Each building must be designed according to the constraints as determined in the Eurocode. Secondly, the architectural constraint: Each building must satisfy the architectural design requirements for acoustics, building height, and daylight entrance. Thirdly. the environmental objective: minimize the shadow costs, which are determined according to the MPG methodology. The MPG methodology uses Life Cycle Analysis data to assess the embodied energy impact of structural materials. This embodied energy impact is expressed in shadow costs. Lastly, the economical objective: minimize the construction costs. Based on the mentioned constraints, the tool aims to indicate the design situations in which timber high-rise can be competitive to an assessed concrete design alternative, considering the combination of properties for shadow costs and construction costs. By research and development of the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization tool and analyzing two case studies, a conclusion can be made. Two concrete buildings, which are based on a current Arcadis project, are used as case studies. Both concrete buildings represent a design situation. The main difference between these design situations is the building dimensions. Building A3 represents timber building designs that are created for a design situation with a floor area of 28.8 x 28.8 m and a height of 60 meters. Building B3 represents timber building designs that are created for a design situation with a floor area of 21.6 x 43.2 m and a height of 50 meters. For both case studies, an optimization will obtain timber building designs with an optimal combination of properties for shadow costs and construction costs. This resulted in the following results. For the design situation based on the concrete building ""The Rectangle"", the Pareto optimal timber building designs, referred to as Building B3, were found to be competitive with ""The Rectangle"". For the other analyzed design situation, the Pareto optimal timber building designs referred to as Building A3, were not found to be competitive with the concrete building ""The Square"". Considering the boundary conditions and scope of this research, it can be concluded that a design situation with a rectangular floor plan is favorable over a design situation with a square floor plan and a design situation with a building height of 50 meter is favorable over a design situation with a building height of 60 meter. Also, based on analysis of the case studies the following conclusions were made. Firstly, when the effect of carbon sequestration is excluded in the calculation of shadow costs, the use of timber and concrete in the structural system was found to generate comparable results considering their shadow costs. The inclusion of the effect of carbon sequestration during the lifetime of a timber building results in a reduction of shadow costs of approximately 40% compared to a similar concrete building. Secondly, considering the boundary conditions and scope of this research the ULS is found to be normative for a slenderness up to 2.35. When the slenderness is greater than 2.35, the along-wind acceleration was found to become normative. Next, for all Pareto optimal building designs, the ULS check was found to be normative over the SLS check. Lastly, the mass of the Pareto optimal timber building designs was found to be approximately 8 times smaller than their respective concrete design alternatives, resulting in a foundation with less construction costs and shadow costs.","Timber; timber high-rise; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization; Life Cycle Analysis; Shadowcosts; Environmental impact; Construction costs; Grasshopper; Parametric Design; Optimization; Karamba3D; multi-objective evolutionary algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Although, HALE aircraft enable efficient and environmental-friendly flying, they necessitate a large Aspect-Ratio wing. These slender structures are prone to large, non-linear deformations which further increase the unsteady nature of aerodynamic flow that can detrimentally impact the structure. In the light of this trend towards an efficient aviation industry of tomorrow, Airbus Innovations UK has ventured into the development of a folding wing tip concept whose benefits are two-fold. First, is the ability to increase span during flight, thereby reducing the induced drag. The folding capability also ensures entry gate requirements at airports. Secondly, the folding mechanism presents load alleviation capabilities with appropriate hinge setup. Alleviation of loads on lifting surfaces directly translates to reduction of the Wing Root Bending Moment (WRBM), which means a reduction of weight. Thus, a further improvement in efficiency of flight. In this work, a nonlinear aeroelastic solver is developed. The proposed partitioned framework couples the industry standard commercial software package MSC Nastran, a structural solver to the Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (UVLM), an aerodynamic solver. The UVLM module developed, exhibits both static and dynamic capabilities. Three wake models are incorporated. Horse-shoe wake is employed for static simulations and convective wake procedures are available for transient dynamic simulations. The independent modular solvers are coupled using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) and Nearest Neighbour (NN) approaches. This framework enables the solver to capture the combined effects of structural nonlinearities and unsteady flows. The proposed solver is then verified and validated for two different test cases: NASA CRM Wing and Pazy Wing. Experimental validation is carried out using existing results from related work. The solver is then used to evaluate the “AlbatrossOne”, a hinged wingtips concept by Airbus Innovations UK. Both static and dynamic responses are analysed for load alleviation capabilities.","Nonlinear Aeroelasticity; Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method; Fluid-structure interaction; Radial Basis Function; Hinged Wingtips; Maneuver Load Alleviation.","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.003551, 4.3491032"

Due to the great impact that a flood would have for the Dutch society, The flood safety standards are very strict, which means that the required failure probability of flood defences is very low. To keep the flood risk within acceptable limits of the hinterland, flood embankments are assessed on whether the probability of failure matches the stringent norms using the methods and rules which are stated in the legal assessment instrument (WBI). Within the WBI the probability of failure of the flood embankment equals the sum of the probability of occurrence of individual failure mechanism. This thesis specifically focuses on the failure mechanism: sliding of the landside slope cover due to wave overtopping of clay flood embankments. Due to wave overtopping the relative permeable top layer of the clay embankment becomes saturated. This leads to a shallow subsurface flow parallel to the landside slope cover which is unfavourable for the geotechnical stability of the landside slope cover. The stability assessment of this mechanism is currently assessed with the Edelman &amp; Joustra formula. This formula method is not based on a probabilistic or semi-probabilistic analysis and therefore does not give an failure probability. Instead it uses safety factors. Levee managers therefore believe that the outcome is overly conservative (Waterschappen, et al., 2021). This thesis addresses the question: How can the stability assessment of the Edelman &amp; Joustra formula can be optimized for clay flood embankments in the Netherlands within the legal assessment instrument? To answer this question, new semi-probabilistic safety factors were derived based on a full probabilistic assessment of the Edelman and Joustra formula. The outcomes show that the current approach is not always as conservative as is often assumed. Application of the newly derived safety factor allows levee managers to be more flexible in how to account for the contribution of this failure mechanism to the total levee failure probability. The newly developed method therefore prevents unnecessary rejection and over-dimensioning of flood embankments, so the available resources for flood embankment improvements can be used better.","Flood Risk; Flood embankments; Stability Analysis; Edelman and Joustra; Clay; Probabilisitic Analysis; Sliding of the landside slope cover; WBI; BOI; Rijkswaterstaat; RPS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Implementing such multi-functional adaptation measures touches on the interests of many stakeholders who need to work together to find resilient and suiting solutions in urban climate adaptation. To facilitate this cooperation, Deltares developed the Adaptation Support Tool. The AST defines eight different performance indicators to compare the effectiveness of urban runoff reduction measures, among which the runoff volume reduction factor. This factor is defined as the rate at which a specific adaptation measure increases the return time of the extreme runoff event. This factor is determined by the underlying model of the AST, the Urban Water Balance Model (UWBM).<br/>The UWBM has the benefit of using long times series instead of single precipitation events (design storms) as input to determine the effectiveness of measures; antecedent conditions for every extreme event are therefore known. Currently, the UWBM is only determining the runoff volume reduction factor. At the same time, the literature shows the importance of analysing the effectiveness of measures using both flow peak reduction and storage peak reduction. Exploration of the possibility to implement these two reduction factors into the UWBM forms the challenge of this study. <br/>This research aims to define a flow peak- and storage peak reduction factor based on modelling systems in the UWBM using long time series. Because the model describes these factors over the measure area, the second goal of this study is to investigate the possibility of converting this measure factor to a whole project area factor and combining this factor for a combination of measures. Main conclusions of this research are as follows: A flow peak reduction factor can be empirically determined based on the proposed method in this study. A storage peak reduction factor can not be empirically determined based on the proposed method in this study. It is recommended to do more research into the analysis of the storage peaks using time series, since it can give an extra insight into the effectiveness of measures. Converting the found flow peak reduction factor for the measure area to the project area with multiple interventions is substantiated with a proposed equation. However, it is recommended to do more research into the conversion equation to be used in the Adaptation Support Tool. By determining the flow peak reduction factor together with the runoff volume reduction factor, the effectiveness of urban runoff reduction measures in a project area can be quantified and used to compare alternative solutions for their effectiveness in flood risk reduction. The added flow peak reduction factor gives a more thorough insight into this effectiveness of measures. <br","Urban Runoff Measures; Urban water balance modelling; stormwater management; Adaptation Support Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Resources Engineering","",""

This thesis investigates how pre-trained models can be combined for performance on all their source domains, without access to data. This problem is formulated as a Multiple-Source Domain Adaptation (MSA) problem setting, where models trained on source domains are combined so that the combiner is robust to application on any unknown target domain. This thesis explores the MSA setting and presents a perspective on MSA theory from literature. The issue in the MSA setting is that target models are not robust in general, leading to negative transfer. Firstly, this issue is illustrated by example of the source models and linearly weighted combinations of the source models. Next, existing theory that guarantees the existence of a robust model is investigated. It is argued that a performance bound has the potential to be extended from the perspective of additional knowledge: in addition to the in the MSA setting available source models, some additional knowledge of the source domains might be used by the model. Existing MSA theory’s assumptions are clarified and the theory is split in two. One half is inherent to the MSA setting and guarantees a model with as robustness property the loss on a matching mixture. The other half assumes a combiner that uses additional knowledge of the source domains, for which the robustness is proven satisfactory. Finally, it is investigated what makes additional knowledge in the MSA setting useful. Current literature assumes a specific target model--the distribution-weighted (DW) combiner--that is viewed as using the sources' joint distributions as additional knowledge. It is argued that knowledge of the training process of the source models can also be used as additional knowledge. In conclusion, this thesis discusses how robustness in the MSA setting can be improved from that of the source models by basing the combiner on additional knowledge of the source domains.","Multi-source Domain Adaption; Ensemble Learning; Robustness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By exploiting the intelligence of the swarm, it is possible to create a swarm robotic persistent surveillance method that can deal with unknown dynamic environments without the need for complex computations or excessive storage. Using stigmergy, which is communication via the environment, robots drop pheromones to signal that a specific location is covered. Other robots sense these pheromones and avoid going there. This is, in essence, the inverted stigmergic behaviour of ants. While ants deploy pheromones to attract other ants to that location, our robots repel other robots by deploying pheromones. <br/>This thesis proposes a stigmergic swarm robotic persistent surveillance method that can deal with unknown environments and dynamic obstacles. Stigmergy is used as the sole communication mean. Additionally, an extension is included in the model that renders the model more efficient with respect to the pheromone usage. Subsequently, to demonstrate the potential for real-life application, the model is simulated in Webots, an open-source 3-D Robot simulator.<br/>Concludingly, this thesis demonstrates that stigmergy lends itself perfectly for persistent surveillance. It minimizes the computations and memory storage needed, while ensuring performance. The proposed model outperforms current literature and deploys pheromones more efficient.

One possibility to reach this goal can be achieved by employing processes with non-ideal fluids, such as fluids at supercritical conditions in refrigeration, heat pump cycles and power cycles. <br/>Most of the flows in industry are turbulent and hence the need to study turbulence in non-ideal fluids arose. Turbulence in non-ideal fluids is extremely challenging since there are many complex effects at play. One such effect is caused by variations in properties, which also occurs in compressible flows, flows with high concentration gradients, or flows in heat exchangers.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a review of the existing theory on semi-local scaling for variable property flows with the aim to take it one step further and apply it to turbulent heat flux modeling. Two types of variable property cases are analysed in this thesis; (1) low-Mach number flows with uniform pseudo-heating sources, (2) high-Mach number flows with non-uniform viscous heating. For the former, a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data-base, already available at TU Delft, has been post-processed with the main goal to investigate if the semi-local theory can also be applied to thermal turbulence and its modeling. For the latter, additional DNS simulations of high-Mach number channel flows have been performed to investigate how the viscous heating and its correlations can be accounted for in the semi-local scaling framework.<br/><br/>Using a 2-equation heat flux model, we find that modeling thermal turbulence in semi-local scales considerably improves the results for low-Mach number flows. However, for high-Mach number flows, additional unknown (closure) terms arise due to fluctuations in the viscous heating source. A model for the source term in the enthalpy variance equation is successfully proposed. In addition, the DNS study of two high-Mach number flows with constant semi-local Reynolds number profiles shed light on the importance of a newly defined parameter (modified Eckert number) and also unveils one of the most important conditions in which semi-local theory can be compromised, e.g. extreme density gradients.","Turbulence; Variable Property; Compressible; Low Mach; High Mach; Aerodynamic heating; RANS; DNS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

The first result of this thesis consists of the conceptualization of direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy measures on travel and activity patterns within a theoretical framework, based on travel behavior change theories. Reasoning from this framework it can be concluded that post-COVID-19 three general direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy measures on travel and activity patterns may be expected: (1) a shift from onsite to online work-related activities, (2) the respacing and retiming of work-related travel patterns and (3) a modal shift towards active modes of transport such as walking and cycling. The second result of this thesis are the creation of four exploratory post-COVID-19 travel behavior scenarios, based on participatory intuitive logic scenario planning methodology following an adaptation of the standard approach, including a novel scenario switchboard. The third and final result of this thesis are simulation results which project congestion rates and travel times by car, and the modal split within the city of Amsterdam in the year 2030 using a tour-based travel model. Based on the results as calculated within the travel model of the four post-COVID-19 travel behavior scenarios, it can be concluded that reduced work-related activities and its consequential changes to work-related travel patterns: (1) strongly alleviates congestion rates during the morning and evening rush hours, (2) decreases travel time from the city center of Amsterdam to certain other zones in Amsterdam with 1 to 2 minutes per person per trip, and (3) provides arguments to allocate more public space towards cycling infrastructure, especially within the district of Nieuw West.","travel behavior change; Covid-19; scenario building; urban mobility; travel model; Amsterdam 2030","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Introduction During Bicycle Motocross races (BMX SX), the start has been proven to be crucial for good overall performance [1]. Riders reaching the bottom of the eight meter high starting ramp in front of the pack, have a favorable position to perform the first jump and can pick the most ideal line through the first corner. The chances of getting involved in collisions with other riders are also highly reduced. Since riders start behind a gate, the anticipation and timing with respect to this gate movement are most important [2]. Most scientific research regarding the BMX SX gate start is focused on defining the performance indicators for a fast start [2] [3] [4] or using in-field experiments<br/>to evaluate the effects of minor changes to the bicycle design [5] [6]. However, using the results of these studies to actually improve the start performance would require extensive training using these new conditions. Using predictive simulations, these adaptations can be evaluated without practicing and can thus have a huge contribution to enhancing the gate start technique. However, before these simulation models can have any impact, they must be thoroughly analyzed to prove their validity.<br/>Objective The main goal for this study was to construct a biomechanical model for the BMX SX gate start which could reproduce experimental data. The model must be able to track kinematic data with an accuracy of less than 5% while also match the main kinetic characteristics without tracking those. The kinetic profiles should show the same peak pattern as is commonly seen in cycling and must not differ more than 10% with experimental data. When these goals are reached, this model could serve as a framework for future applications within BMX SX gate start research or other cycling disciplines.<br/>Method A nine degree-of-freedom biomechanical planar model was created within the open-source software package OpenSim [7] [8]. The model consists out of the ground surface, the gate, the BMX SX bicycle, and the rider. The latter two are connected using kinematic constraints on the feet and pedals. The upper body is connected to the frame by a single arm. The model is driven by eight optimal torque actuators located at the hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, and elbow joints. The contact dynamics of the wheels to the ground and the gate are included using the Hunt-Crossley model [9]. Moco [10], a direct collocation package for OpenSim, was used to solve the kinematic tracking optimization problem. The kinematic data was taken from a prior study by Melle van Dilgt [11] who captured three-dimensional kinematics of an elite female BMX SX athlete of the Dutch National team using an Xsens suit (Xsens Technologies, Enschede, The Netherlands). This IMU data was projected on the planar model using OpenSense, a tool within OpenSim that converts experimental IMU data into the model’s generalized coordinates. Simulation outcomes were compared to kinetic data collected by Hylke van Grieken [4], who used a fully instrumented bicycle including special cranks (Axis2D, Swift Performance, Brisbane, Australia) to capture the pedal forces executed during in-field experiments with a sample rate of 100 Hz. These experiments used the same elite participant but were taken on a different day using a different bicycle.<br/>Results The optimized tracking simulation showed close agreement with experimental kinematic data, showing an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.337° or 0.52% for the six leg joints. For the tracking of the crank angle and the horizontal displacement of the bicycle similar results were found (RMSEs of 0.079% and 0.6% respectively). Simulated crank torque peak values were off by 4.4%, 7.7%, and 5.1% for the first, second and third torque peak respectively. Overall the crank torque was reproduced with an RMSE of 18%.<br/>Conclusion This work shows the suitability of the designed model for future applications in predictive simulation of the BMX SX gate start. The model can be used to study a wide range of ""what-if"" scenarios and could lead to the improvement of gate start performance. The way the model is constructed, the main building blocks can be adjusted to more accurate, but also more complex, components if desired.<br","BMX cycling; Data-Tracking; Biomechanical Model; Predictive Model Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-15","","","","","",""

But recently libraries have seemed to fall out of fashion, especially with young adults. Libraries have had a tough time with a streak of budget cuts, whilst adapting to many innovations and changes. This alone may make it hard for a library to keep up, but with a generally older staff and whilst addressing a young and dynamic target group (being young adults, 18-30), this task becomes overwhelming. One thing libraries could rely on in the past is the value of its massive book collection. Although reading is important for young adults, they seem to read less and less. Mostly the concentrated reading of longer pieces of text, referred to as ‘deep reading’ has had a strong decline. However, deep reading is important, as on a personal level deep reading improves critical evaluation, reflection and drawing conclusions on induction and deduction (Onderwijsraad en Raad voor Cultuur, 2019). On a societal level, especially in the current knowledge and information society, reading skills are important in functioning in society. In a society, strong reading skills improve the GNP and strengthens democracy (Onderwijsraad en Raad voor Cultuur, 2019). The goal of this project is to increase the young adult engagement with the library in Bovenkarspel which falls under the foundation Westfriese Libraries. Based on research into the company, the target group (desk research and interviews) and context, a future context was sketched with the ViP approach. Through this process the following design statement was defined: Westfriese Libraries want to support young adults’ self-development by providing them with the space and tools to explore themselves by culture. From this design statement a concept was designed which engages young adults by a treasure trail.

Additionally, due to more awareness about environmental sustainability, there is an urgent need for ""green propellants"" for space applications. The objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop a novel green hybrid hypergolic bi-propellant system with a viscoelastic nature of the fuel. The thesis focussed on determining the formulation of the novel bi-propellant, which was found to be highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer and gelled alcohol in which a catalyst is suspended as fuel. The fuel's viscoelastic nature is achieved by using gelling technology and characterized based on a rheology study. A suitable catalyst is found and the performance of this catalytically induced hypergolic propellant is evaluated by means of a multi-drop test. In the end, promising performance results were obtained with fuel having critical gelling concentration and critical catalysts concentrations well below what is described in the literature.","Propulsion; Green; Hypergolic bipropellant; Hybrid rocket engine; Gelled fuel; Ethanol; Hydrogen peroxide; Catalyst; Ignition Delay Time; Rheology; Gelation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To deal with these critical decisions and avoid treatment errors and costs, physicians show a growing interest in Clinical Decision Support Systems (IDSS). Current CDSSs, however, suffer from limited transparency and flexibility, which gives rise to ethical concerns when applied in healthcare environments. A novel CDSS approach overcomes these limitations: Behavioral Artificial Intelligence (BAIT). However, a BAIT-based CDSS is not yet capable of incorporating new clinical developments to keep its recommendations accurate over time. Because healthcare decision-making is highly dynamic, the static BAIT-based CDSS needs a transformation into a dynamic BAIT-based CDSS that retains its accuracy and, therefore, clinical relevance over time. However, the preferences regarding a dynamic BAIT-based CDSS vary among healthcare decision-making contexts. Therefore, CDSS developers need an architecture that illustrates how to create and customize a dynamic BAIT-based CDSS that matches physicians' preferences in a particular healthcare context. Because designing these architectures is challenging, this research aims to formulate design principles that guide the design of dynamic BAIT-based CDSS architectures. By following the Action Design Research (ADR) framework, this research identified and tested a set of architecture requirements by building an architecture in a situated problem context. The generalization of the requirements that worked in a situated context resulted in ten design principles guiding the design of a dynamic BAIT-based CDSS architecture. The greater part of the design principles is specific to the design of a dynamic BAIT-based CDSS architecture. By providing these novel insights, the design principles contribute to the CDSS architecture design knowledge base. The research also contributes to CDSS architecture design knowledge because it tackles the challenges of designing a dynamic BAIT-based CDSS architecture. By doing so, the research outcomes eliminate the barriers to design such an architecture and lay a foundation to continue the work on transparent and dynamic CDSSs. The findings highlight new design challenges for further research, like designing a dynamic BAIT-based CDSS architecture with the ten design principles in another sector to investigate how to modify the design principles, so the principles are useful outside the healthcare sector.","Clinical Decision Support Systems; Discrete Choice Modeling; System Architecture; Design Science Research; Action Design Research; Healthcare decision-making; Behavioral Artificial Intelligence Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This research dives into the following research question: ‘How can sustainable mobility guide the redevelopment of post-industrial sites towards a sustainable environment’. In the research, the component of sustainable mobility is connected to development and environment. Strategies like TOD and S2N are used to find synergies in research and design.

(mentor); Müller, S. (mentor); van Loosdrecht, Mark C.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The removal of iron from groundwater is essential to avoid aesthetic issues of the produced drinking water and to reduce maintenance cost of the system. The most applied iron removal method of oxidation and filtration produces large volumes of aqueous iron sludge of little value and the method is more likely to fail at high iron concentrations. This research investigates the novel concept of removing iron(II) anaerobically from groundwater by precipitation as vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2 ¢ 8 H2O) by dosing phosphate to the water. Natural groundwater was used to investigate the proposed method. A better understanding of the ironphosphate chemistry was obtained in experiments with a synthetic iron solution. To find a possible alternative to the limited resource phosphate, the possibility of removing iron by forming a compact mineral was also tested by dosing sulphate and carbonate. The chemical equilibriums and carried out experiments were evaluated by a geochemical model and the reaction products were analysed by X-ray diffraction. Up to 93% of iron removal by vivianite precipitation was obtained by dosing phosphate to anaerobic groundwater spiked with 100 mg Fe/L. An additional aeration step increased the efficiency to 99.9%, a higher total removal efficiency compared to the conventional aeration-filtration technique. The geochemical model showed that the anaerobic removal stopped when the saturation index (SI) of vivianite drops below 4, which explains why the last 7% were not removed anaerobically. Increasing the pH increases the SI of vivianite and can enhance further removal. Theoretically iron can be removed by vivianite precipitation starting from a concentration of 1 mg/L at a pH of 8.5. A second order kinetics was found for the removal of iron by vivianite precipitation at pH 7 with a rate constant of 2.27 M/s. The corresponding half life of iron is 4 minutes, while the half life of iron oxidation is 16 minutes at the same pH. Vivianite was the only crystalline end product detected and this decreased the sludge volume by a third compared to the sludge currently produced with oxidation and filtration. The total iron removal by sulphate addition only reached 73%, probably caused by the formation of iron(III)- sulphate complexes, and is therefore not a proper alternative to phosphate. The addition of carbonate reached an anaerobic removal of 59% and was increased to 99.9% by aeration. The formed sludge contained of a mixture of several oxidised compounds and the volume was almost 6 times higher compared to the currently produced aqueous iron sludge, which is why carbonate is not considered as an interesting alternative. The possibility of removing iron(II) anaerobically from groundwater by forming a compact mineral is successfully demonstrated. This method can increase the efficiency of drinking water production: higher throughput rates can be reached and a valuable end product with interesting reuse opportunities is created, provided that the phosphate can effectively be recovered from the water. It can decrease the operational costs of groundwater production substantially. The proposed novel method is a promising alternative to the conventional treatment method of oxidation and filtration, especially at plants where large iron sludge volumes are currently produced caused by elevated iron concentrations.","Groundwater; Anaerobic treatment; Vivianite; Resource recovery; Iron chemistry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","RedOx filter project",""

Due to privacy, the client is referred to as: “the Dutch UMC.” The Dutch UMC wants to become an innovating leader in health care but faces many problems during the act of innovation. Because the organization is struggling to locate, describe and tackle the encountered problems, a research project was set up to provide the organization with new tools to properly organize innovation. Therefore, the research question of this project is defined as: “how can the Dutch UMC realize innovation?”. This research resulted in defining seven problem areas which, each in their own way, have a negative impact on the innovation process. The shared cause for the defined problems is a defect in the current innovation process. Cooper (1993) divides the innovation process into six stages. When comparing these stages to the current process within the Dutch UMC, it becomes visible how the first three stages are neglected or skipped. These early stages of the innovation process are also referred to as the pre-development stages or the fuzzy front end (Hestatt and Verworn, 2004). Apart from sharing this insight with the organization, an innovation framework was created to organize the front end of the innovation process. This framework is based on design thinking, which is proposed as the most suitable method for non-design organizations to structure the front end of innovation. The framework delivers the required input to start the conversation on re-organizing innovation and start a transformation towards fast and engaging health care innovation by design.","Innovation; Organizational design; Health care; Design; Change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, concerns regarding the environmental burden associated with the life cycle stages of the PV systems are increasing with the fast growth of the technology. This study focuses on the environmental impacts associated with the roll-to-roll (R2R) production of the flexible thin-film silicon-based PV technology developed by the Dutch company HyEt Solar. A life cycle assessment analysis (LCA) for the manufacturing of the flexible thin-film solar modules (PowerFoil) at HyEt Solar is carried out using the SimaPro software. This study covers three cases for the 2.1 kWp (PowerFoil) PV system suitable for rooftop installation. The first is the case of single-junction a-Si modules with an efficiency of 7%, the second is the case of tandem-junction (a-Si/nc-Si) modules with an efficiency of 10%, and the final one is the case of tandem-junction (a-Si/nc-Si) with improved efficiency of 12%. The goal is to first assess the environmental impacts for the manufacturing process using the CML-IA baseline method, with a focus on the global warming potential (GWP) impact category, then perform a sensitivity analysis to study the effects of changing specific parameters and assumptions. Additionally, this study uses the Cumulative Energy Demand v1.11 calculation method in SimaPro to quantify the total energy requirement for the manufacturing process of the PV system and based on that, the energy payback time (EPBT) is calculated. This LCA study follows the framework and guidelines provided by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and uses the Ecoinvent 3.5 database for choosing the inventory’s input processes. After taking the utilization losses, the balance of system and energy requirements for higher deposition rate for the bottom cell into account, it was found that the lowest total GWP impact of 1031 kg CO2-eq (20.4 g CO2-eq/kWh) was scored by the tandem-junction system with improved module efficiency (η= 12%). Results also showed that the Heat/Electricity input category was the highest contributor in the total global warming potential and the total primary energy demand for all three cases. Sensitivity analysis results found that the optimal deposition rate for the bottom cell was 2 [nm/s] and that both the GWP impact per unit electricity generated and the EPBT dropped for large-scale utilities, while the increase in irradiation in different locations did not necessarily lead to a decrease in energy payback time. i","Flexible thin-film solar cells; LCA; GWP; CED; EPBT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","FlamingoPV project",""

Active inference is a model-based approach that directs agents to explore uncertain states while adhering to a prior model of their goal behaviour. This paper introduces an active inference agent which minimizes the novel free energy of the expected future. Our model is capable of solving sparse-reward problems with a very high sample efficiency due to its objective function, which encourages directed exploration of uncertain states. Moreover, our model is computationally very light and can operate in a fully online manner while achieving comparable performance to offline RL methods. We showcase the capabilities of our model by solving the mountain car problem, where we demonstrate its superior exploration properties and its robustness to observation noise, which in fact improves performance.

RCF is a known hazard to the safe operation of railways, the cracks can cause transverse rail fracture, which may result in derailment. Contrary to convention, the traffic on this particular railway is bidirectional. In literature, little is known about the effects of bidirectional traffic on the rail material and the formation of RCF defects. In this study, the effects of the bidirectional traffic on the rail material and RCF defects are investigated by performing a metallographic examination of the rail surface and microstructure of rail material specimens taken from the actual track. The metallographic examination is supported by the analysis of the wheel-rail contact, which is simulated with multibody wheel-rail contact simulation software.<br/> <br/>In longitudinal direction, optical microscopy revealed the absence of plastic strain in the surface layer of the rail. This plastic strain, which is the result of tangential surface traction, is always observed on rails subjected to uni-directional traffic and is considered the leading cause of fatigue crack initiation. However, the simulated wheel-rail contact stresses exceed the yield limit, so plastic deformation is expected. It is concluded that the frequent direction reversal of the tangential surface traction causes cyclic plasticity without the accumulation of strain, detectable with optical microscopy. Despite the absence of accumulated plastic strain in longitudinal direction, RCF cracks of varying sizes are observed on the rail surface. Although developed as a result of bidirectional traffic, the observed crack morphology shows similarities to the 'squat' RCF defect.<br/><br/>In this study, new insights are generated by considering the implications of bidirectional traffic and the rolling direction reversal on existing theories about the rail squat formation mechanism.

(mentor); Hoes, O.A.C. (graduation committee); Vossepoel, F.C. (graduation committee); Klein, J.D. (graduation committee); Nederlof, I.A.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Drought and subsidence are two out of several water-related urban climate adaptation challenges many cities in the Netherlands currently face. Drought is expected to increase in frequency and extent due to climate change. Therefore, drought is likely to further pressurize (subsiding) urban areas in the coming decades. Although the impact of drought on soft soils and hence subsidence is described in academic literature, in-practice analyzes are limited. Given the expectation of increased drought impacts, as well as the current urge for new housing developments to combat housing scarcity, this research focuses on in-practice drought impacts on subsidence in two soft-soil urban areas in the Netherlands. This research’s objective is to gain insight into drought-induced subsidence in soft-soil urban areas in the Netherlands, in order to better understand drought impacts on subsidence rates in future housing developments on comparable soils. With a better understanding more appropriate site preparation strategies can be applied. The objective is endeavoured by an in-practice analysis of two study areas: a 90s neighbourhood in Diemen and a recently finished urban area in Kampen. Firstly, variations in relative surface levels, observed by InSAR (2015-2019), are compared for dry and wet periods. Afterwards, this subsidence data is separated based upon local characteristics (soil structure, pavement type, vegetation percentage and vicinity of surface water) to analyze their influence on drought-induced subsidence. Lastly, an expert questionnaire is conducted on suggestions for both mitigation and adaptation strategies. Subsidence is not a linear process in time: surface level movements vary due to the soil’s wetting and drying. The extent of soil compaction in dry periods is found to increase with intenser droughts. The extent of soil swell in wet periods is approximately similar for varying wetness extents. This research found that the severe drought of 2018 thereby caused a soil compaction to such extent it could not be balanced with subsequent winter swell, and hence resulted in approximately 1 to 1.5 millimeter of drought-induced subsidence. Drought-induced subsidence is thus a net result of the (change in) seasonal surface level fluctuation. This net result is assumed to be consequence of extensive groundwater level drops, although the exact share of processes and subsidence mechanisms could not be estimated. Moreover, surface level movements are found to be prone to a lag and difference in duration (hysteresis) in comparison to the start and duration of dry and wet periods. Various local characteristics are found to influence drought-induced subsidence. In general more compressible soils show slightly larger surface level movement between dry and wet periods. The (sand) cover thickness is found to be influential on which subsidence mechanisms are triggered during a drought: a cover thickness resulting in groundwater levels to drop to present clay/ peat layers causes shrinkage and/ or peat oxidation additional to clinch. Unpaved surfaces are found to fluctuate more extensively than paved surfaces, but this does not necessarily result in more irreversible subsidence. Furthermore, abundant vegetation might result in extra irreversible subsidence due to its extensive water usage in dense urban areas. Lastly, in the analyzed soft-soil areas the surface waters seem to influence groundwater levels and hence surface level movements only on short distance. Suggestions on feasible enhancing site preparation strategies are given based upon research results and experts’ opinions. The suggested mitigation strategies consist of two approaches in order to hamper the variations in effective stresses and hence minimize the seasonal surface level fluctuation. The first approach focuses on preventing extensive groundwater level variations: increasing storage and infiltration of water, reversed drainage, building crawl-space free and choosing vegetation types based on their water usage. Additionally, it is suggested to apply a sufficient cover thickness (at raises) if soft soil layers are near the surface. This prevents that future extensive groundwater drops within these layers, and thereby limits (seasonal) shrinkage and/ or peat oxidation. The second approach focuses on reducing the top soil’s weight, via lightweight materials or self-carrying constructions. Adapting to drought-induced subsidence starts with measuring/ monitoring surface level movements in order to analyze spatial and temporal trends. Additionally, drought is to be considered to greater extent in subsidence modelling in order to improve subsidence estimations. This can be done by applying variable or lower groundwater levels in estimations of the (change in) effective stresses, at calculations of consolidation or creep. Lastly, urban utility management should focus on long-term costs via e.g. Life Cycle Analysis, and on overlapping maintenance cycles of surface level raising and e.g. sewer pipe replacements. The most important conclusion derived on urban drought-induced subsidence is that despite individual drought impact on subsidence is limited to 1 to 1.5 millimeters, its seasonal occurrence continuously affects surface levels. Moreover, due to climate change drought is expected to increasingly impact surface levels in Dutch soft-soil urban areas in the coming decades. The suggested strategies mainly hamper variations in soil stresses, via fluctuating groundwater levels, and hence drought impacts on soft soils. These strategies help to limit future soil movements and hence result in more climate adaptable soft-soil urban areas. The focus of this research is on qualitative analyses of in-practice data such that significant processes have been disclosed, rather than statistically verifying the results. Consequently, the research initiates further specific studies on statistical verification of drought-induced subsidence, and moreover topics on its mechanisms; its spatial and temporal variation; its measurement and modelling; the influences of local characteristics hereupon; and the effectiveness of the suggested enhanced site preparation strategies.","drought; subsidence; soil; urban; groundwater; soil moisture; clinch; shrinkage; creep; consolidation; oxidation; swell; compaction; fluctuation; surface level; site preparation; climate adaptation; precipitation; evaporation; transpiration; compressiblity; hysteresis; lag; effective stress; InSAR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-11","","","","","",""

(mentor); Ravenshorst, G.J.P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Damen is designing more and more slender hull forms, which leads to a small dock block contact area, and therefore a high load on the block bed. Dry docking is achieved by using multiple blocks located along the longitudinal length of the ship. Dock blocks are constituted by several layers, normally three or more. The configuration of the block bed (concrete in combination with hard­ and softwood) creates the support of the vessel with non­linear behaviour. This study focuses on a prediction of the blockload in the dry dock, taking into account non­linear material behaviour of the timber layers. Nowadays, the approach to predict the dock block load makes the assumption of linear elastic behaviour of the timber layers. The loads produced can cause a non­linear behaviour of each block, which might lead to an over­stress failure of one or more blocks. The assumption of linear elastic behaviour possibly results in wrong load distributions, which eventually leads to a redistribution of the loads on the other blocks. In turn this can force other block failures and ultimately this produces damages of the hull forms. The consequences of a poor dry docking analysis are potentially catastrophic. A docking failure can lead to extensive ship and dock damage, disruption of docking schedules, and loss of the ship to active duty until repairs can be made. Two set of models are conducted to predict the load on a dock block and evaluate the influence of the non­linear behaviour. The Timoshenko beam theory with multiple springs is used to calculate the load on every single dock block location. The load on every particular location is used in the model for a single dock block formed by elastically connected beams. A double Winkler foundation system represents the interaction of the stacked block layers and dictates the non­linear behaviour. Non­linear material properties are captured by the secant modulus of the top layer. A test campaign pointed out that for each layer of nominal identical specimens a large variability in material properties is noticed. Material properties found in the literature were different from those obtained during experiments. Moisture content has a significant influence on linear and non­linear effect, with the Young’s modulus and yield point being shifted to lower values. The variability in material behaviour and moisture content must be considered when predicting the block load. Moisture content variability lead to changing block bed load distributions. Underestimation of the moisture content can lead to large differences in the single dock block analysis. With the good matching in the validation work, this research confirms the reliability of a double Winkler system to prescribe non­linear material behaviour of a single dock block. Although the analysis of a single dock block matches results obtained from finite element models, further research is still needed. The model of a Timoshenko beam on spring supports gives reasonable results, but underestimates the load in case of local increased stiffness caused by a transverse bulkhead. Optimization on this particular section is needed to get more realistic results.","dock blocks; non-linear material behaviour; Timoshenko beam theory; compression tests; timber loaded perpendicular to the grain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One way of the diagnostic of well-functioning of the automotive radar is by means of calibration in service stations. In contrast to offline calibration in service stations, one another way of testing the automotive radar on well-functioning would be by means of monitoring the state, or with other words the healthiness, of the radar in real-time. One possible solution to monitor the radar state is to use a massive set of calibration targets in road infrastructure and thereby the problem lies in optimally estimating the state based on the RCS information provided by the radar. As a result, in the first part of this thesis, based on the defined target selection criteria, selection of the most appropriate calibration target among possible candidates is discussed. Using massive set of targets is required to overcome the uncertainty in production and installation accuracy in one-target measurements. However, this method brings randomness which is caused by two error sources being the non-ideal shapes of the calibration targets originating from mass production errors and orientation errors either from installation or maintenance errors. Second part of the thesis investigates how this randomness affects the self-diagnostics performance of automotive radar. Thereby, the model of target orientation and RCS loss due to orientation errors, and, the model of target RCS and its RCS loss due to mass production errors are developed. For both error sources, the statistical characteristics of the loss factors are determined by means of corresponding probability distribution functions which are derived analytically. In case of orientation errors, analytical results are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations as well as Kullback-Leibler Divergence. In case of mass production errors, analytical results are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations only. Together with the results obtained in the first part, results of the statistical characteristics of the loss factor due to non-orthogonality help to find a balance between the size, quality and number of targets to be deployed in a certain range in a given road configuration. To finalize the project, the measurement model is determined according to which the approach for self-diagnostics is developed under certain assumptions and considering a set of measurements of the same realization of a single target only. By the developed approaches, the relation of statistical parameters on self-diagnostics performance is determined by means of three different estimation methods and the results are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations.","Automotive radar; Calibration; Self-Diagnostic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Almost 4000 MV piles are used as anchorage of quay walls in the port of Rotterdam. The current design method of MV piles in Dutch practice is a CPT-based method that correlates the cone resistance to the shaft friction by a factor α_t. In the port of Rotterdam, the cone resistance is restricted under the assumption that no shaft resistance higher than 250 kPa is mobilised. Consequently, α_t is used in combination with a limiting value for the cone resistance of 18 MPa. Moreover, the value of α_t that is currently used in the port of Rotterdam (1.4%) is derived after limiting the cone resistance at 18 MPa. Since this design method was developed in the 1980s', many more MV piles were tested in the port of Rotterdam. The maximum test load was generally at least two times the characteristic value of the required anchor force. None of these full-scale tests were loaded up to failure and no significant creep effects were observed. Consequently, the design standard was never updated as ultimate bearing capacity remained undetermined. Recently, the Port of Rotterdam has executed failure load tests in the Maasvlakte area. The tests allowed detailed strain readings along the full length of the test piles and offer the possibility to accurately determine the local mobilisation of shaft friction in addition to the ultimate failure load. Apart from describing the successful instrumentation with BOTDA fiber optical sensors (Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis), this study addresses the assessment of the obtained data in detail. Multiple relations are considered in this thesis. Analysis of CPT's indicates an increase in cone resistance due to pile installation. Investigation of pile driving data shows that installation energy correlates well with the cone resistance. Soil-structure interaction is analysed and a mobilisation curve is composed. This curve illustrates that mobilisation of shaft friction as a function of displacement of MV (tension) piles is similar to the Dutch standard for small and non-displacement compression piles. This thesis presents proof that limiting the cone resistance based on a maximum shaft friction of 250 kPa is not correct. The derivation of α_t without limiting the cone resistance results in a value of 1.2%. Installation energy proves to be a good indicator of the soil conditions. The piles that give good predictions for the bearing capacity with α_t = 1.2% present similar ratio's between the installation energy and the cone resistance. Future research may establish a consistent relation between CPT-based bearing capacity and pile driving energy to reduce uncertainty. This thesis will contribute to an update on the design method for MV-piles in dense sand layers of the Maasvlakte area.","MV pile; Tension pile; Geotechnical; Bearing capacity; Pile load test; Deep sea quay wall; Fiber optic sensors; Port of Rotterdam; Maasvlakte","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

One of the benefits of cycling is improved health due to more physical activity. However, cycling also causes a health burden due to the many cycling accidents in the Netherlands. The share of single bicycle accidents, where no collision with another road user is involved, has increased over the past years. In 2000 only 10% of all bicycle accidents were single bicycle accidents, while in 2018 this increased to 35%. One of the potential causes for single bicycle accidents is narrow bicycle paths. This research focussed on the influence of the bicycle path width of narrow bidirectional bicycle paths on steering behaviour, which can support a discussion on the required minimum width for bicycle paths in the guidelines. A controlled experiment is conducted to collect data of steering behaviour variables on different bicycle path widths while controlling other influencing factors. The results of the experiment show that cyclists cycle significantly closer to the path edge on narrower bicycle paths (55.6 centimeter on a 2-meter wide path and 37 centimeter on a 1-meter wide path), while there are no differences in average steering angle. An oncoming cyclist, which is in the experiment represented by a parked bicycle, forces cyclists to cycle even closer to the path edge, which makes the minimum distance to the path edge smaller. The minimum distance to the path edge becomes 15.1 centimeter on a 1.5-meter wide path. This smaller distance to the path edge increases the risk of riding off the path, which makes the narrower paths less safe. A questionnaire was used to examine the perception of the different path widths. The perceived safety of cyclists decreased on narrower bicycle paths. A 2-meter wide bidirectional bicycle path is considered safe to pass others by all participants, but on a 1.5-meter wide path this is only considered safe by half of the participants. The main research question was “<i>What is the influence of the width of bidirectional bicycle paths on cyclists’ steering behaviour?</i>”. It can be concluded that lateral position is related to the width of bidirectional bicycle paths, while steering angle rotation is not related to the width of bicycle paths. The results of the experiment are transferable to real-life traffic conditions, but do not include the variety in infrastructural conditions, cyclist ages and bicycle types. These varieties in real-life traffic conditions might increase the required bicycle path width.","Cycling safety; Bicycle paths; Path width; Steering behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

In this master thesis, an SCPA is designed in an advanced technology node for wireless signal transmission. Special considerations are taken to explicitly suppress the harmonics of second and third order by manipulating multiple waveforms. A feedback loop is designed in order to facilitate proper suppression in the presence of variations. The issue of power back-off efficiency is addressed through the method of impedance matching utilized. The system operates between the frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 2.5 GHz. For a carrier frequency of 2.4GHz, a peak system efficiency of 42.75% and a -6dB back-off system efficiency of 22.52% are achieved. The system presents high AM curve linearity with an IIP3 of 42.3 dB.

The CE is an economic system that replaces the current take-make-waste linear system and replaces this with the reduction, reuse and recovering of resources. The challenge is to build with limited emissions, depletion and pollution of the living environment. Looking more specifically to a building, the load-bearing structure is responsible for a significant part of the material related environmental impact. In order to reduce the environmental impact of a building, more guidance is needed as the implementation of the CE principles requires a new approach for designing. The principles of the CE are safeguarded in various circular design strategies. Which circular design strategy is most beneficial for the project depends on the requirements and ambition of the project. The resulting difference in environmental impact caused by the design choices should be illustrated. Unfortunately, the current determination methods for the environmental impact do not include the design principles of the circular design strategies. Besides, the environmental impact is assessed at the end of the design process. Once the design is final, adjustment to improve the environmental impact are too difficult or costly. <br/>In this research a design tool is developed that makes the practitioners in the building sector aware of the environmental impact of the design choices. Three circular design strategies are presented in the tool that can be followed to stimulate the development of a circular building project. The design tool can be used in the preliminary design phase to create and explore varying structural design variants in line with the chosen circular design strategy. The structural design variants can be compared on their environmental impact expressed in five indicators: the MPG, the environmental performance value (in Dutch: Milieu Prestatie Gebouwen [MPG]), the produced amount of CO2 emission, material usage, expected service life and building costs. <br/>The research shows that based on literature review, expert judgement and open databases a design tool can be built, which gives insight in the environmental impact and more design parameters to support the implementation of circular solutions in the preliminary design phase. To meet the unique project specifications different solutions are required. Therefore, the design tool supports the design process with a uniform approach. The outcome of this research highlights three main influential aspects for the determination of the environmental impact; (1) the expected lifespan of the design assumed in the calculation method, (2) the quality of the environmental database of materials and (3) the total applied materials in the load-bearing structure. For the practitioners of the design process it is extremely important to be aware of the effect of changing the expected lifespan and thus the determination method for the environmental impact and the quality of the environmental database used.","Circular Design Strategies; Environmental Impact Assessment; Design Tool; Circular Structural Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

We consider the freight transport application of an online grocer. We introduce a Multi-Commodity Minimum Network Flow ILP implementation for MDVSPTW with short computation time. Also, based on the Concurrent Scheduler algorithm for MDVSP from the literature, we introduce the Greedy Scheduler algorithm that is able to find a feasible solution within short computation time for our problem. These two implementations form building blocks for the three main algorithms we introduce, that find good feasible solutions for our problem within 15 minutes: the ILP + Greedy algorithm, the Random Search algorithm and the Random Search and Fix algorithm. We incorporate the driver day duration restriction in the three algorithms by either allowing a driver change, that is two drivers executing one truck day, or not, and compare the results. We show that the ILP + Greedy algorithm performs the best. In the case an algorithm that does not involve an ILP is preferred, e.g., for robustness reasons, the Random Search and Fix algorithm performs better than the Random Search algorithm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In this work, clusterings of the QMG are used to construct an online Bayesian nonparametric alarm system for the prediction of stock market crashes via the so-called ""reinforced urn process"" (RUP). To test the efficacy of this modelling methodology we exploit extreme value theory to systematically define stock market crashes by studying the tail of an appropriately fitted generalized pareto distribution (GPD) for stock market drawdowns. This approach identified 13 extreme drawdowns between 1985-2020, for which the RUP was trained from 1986-2005 to predict the 8 extreme drawdowns from 2005-2020. Of the three correlation metrics used to test this approach, the QLO corresponding to the set of upper Tail-Dependence matrices was shown to outperform the others: Pearson's and the Gini correlation. Tail-Dependence was able to predict all 8 crashes with just 5 false alarms over a 12 month time horizon, all 8 with 7 false alarms over an 8 month time horizon, 7 out of 8 with 9 false alarms over a 4 time horizon, and 7 out of 8 with 17 false alarms over a 2 month time horizon. This approach was then tested against the usage of the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model's confidence indicators with promising results. The quantum Lorenz ordering is meant to rank a set of correlation matrices by the amount of dispersion reflected in their spectra: a true heterogeneity. We consider this dispersion from the standpoint of measurement error as has been in the application of random matrix theory (RMT) to correlation matrices in portfolio risk theory. We provide analytical relations between quantum majorization and random matrix cleaning for a few RMT filtering schemes posing quantum majorization as a desirable condition for RMT filtering. The RUP is tested using these RMT cleaned correlation matrices as well.","Stock Market Crashes; Urns; Quantum Majorization; Extreme Value Theory; Risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

EUROCONTROL delays inbound flights heading towards AAS on departure, due to reasons at or around AAS. There are two main reasons for Airport ATFM delay at AAS, Weather and Aerodrome Capacity. This study aims to find a better understanding of the operational conditions that cause ATFM Aerodrome Capacity delay, such that it can be addressed properly. This is done by applying a Bayesian Network (BN) to AAS data, that includes variables from the operational conditions at AAS. The BN shows the relationship between variables and is based on conditional probabilities, so it can show the stochastic behavior of the airport. A baseline model is created using expert knowledge and through Structure Learning (SL), additional relationships between variables are identified which result in a model that best represents the operational data. The results from the BN show that an increased chance of ATFM Aerodrome Capacity delay most often occurs in the first inbound peak of the day when the cumulative delay is still low. In these conditions, the percentage of capacity used according to the schedules is often between 75% and 100%. However, at the actual time of operation the percentage of capacity used is often above 100%, indicating that the available capacity is exceeded. Interestingly, the conditions that increase the chance of having ATFM Aerodrome Capacity delay do not increase the chance of arriving too late. Having an ATFM Aerodrome Capacity delay of 20 to 30 minutes, showed only a 35% chance of arriving with more than 15 minutes of delay. Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the strategic planning of the landing slots, and the actual arriving traffic. Additionally, airlines apply schedule buffers, that could nullify the ATFM Aerodrome Capacity delay, but are unknown to other operators in the air transportation system. More information should be shared between operators to ensure all interests are met and a safe and efficient operation can be realized.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Offshore contractors use special cable laying vessels (CLV’s) in order to install subsea power cables, which transport offshore generated energy. Workability studies are performed to evaluate whether operations can be performed or not. These workability studies are subsequently a combination between operability assessments (performed in OrcaFlex months prior to operation) and forecasted weather windows. During the operability assessment, eventually limiting sea states are defined which are expressed in significant wave height (Hs), wave peak period (Tp) and incident wave angle relative to the vessel heading (a). If the forecasted weather windows exceed the predefined limiting sea states, operations cannot be executed. These current workability assessments are based on 1D JONSWAP spectra. This thesis contains an exploratory study of implementing a motion-based forecasting (MBF) method into workability studies, based on 2D wave spectra. This is done by focusing on the motions at the chute of the CLV, as this is where the subsea power cable leaves the CLV. Before MBF can be implemented, however, at first a specific limiting motion predictor needs to be identified that covers the cables integrity limits. Furthermore, this limiting motion needs to be quantified as well in order to compare this essentially composed new cable limit with MBF predicted chute motions. Subsequently, all cable integrity criteria need to be converted into this limiting motion to preserve the subsea power cables integrity. For normal cable lay operations, eventually all mechanical properties and cable limits are covered by three main cable integrity criteria. These are minimum bending radius (MBR), minimum bottom tension (BT) and maximum top tension (TT). By means of modelling a lot of various environmental loading conditions, the research described in this thesis shows that the chute z velocity is eventually indicated as a proper limiting motion predictor. Out of all investigated chute motions, chute z velocity (which represents the vertical velocity of the chute) shows the best correlations with the aforementioned cable integrity criteria. To determine workability by implementing motion based forecasting, this limiting chute z velocity needs to be quantified. The chute z velocity needs to account for all three main cable integrity limits, hence these limits are essentially converted into one single chute z velocity limit (which is essentially a new introduced cable limit). To quantify this limiting chute z velocity not the entire relation is of interest, but only the range close to breaching the cable integrity limits. Therefore, a percentile line method is introduced which is constructed on the 90th-percentile values per bin. Based on this research, it was found that binwidths must not exceed values of 0.5m/s to obtain robust results. However, no minimum amount of data points per bin was established as this varied for all assessed subsea power cables. Finally, workability studies of the current 1D JONSWAP (based on a single Hs −Tp sea state) method was compared to a 2D superimposed JONSWAP accounting for both swell and wind wave contributions. This comparison indicates that when determining workability based on more detailed 2D spectra, the workability study provides more smoothed results. This means, the higher chute z velocity peaks from the 1D total sea state are downscaled when simulating a 2D spectrum, whereas the lower chute z velocity peaks from the 1D total sea state are upscaled when implementing a 2D spectrum. The obtained motion-based chute z velocity forecasts indicate that optimization is possible by splitting the total sea states into both swell and sea waves contributions and accounting for wave spreading.","Subsea cables; Subsea cable installation; Normal lay operations; Limiting motions; Motion-based forecasting; Offshore workability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-09","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Peternel, L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To generalize the use of robotics, there are a few hurdles still to take. One of these hurdles is the programming of the robots. Most robots on the market today employ position control, with a set of controller parameters tuned by an expert. This programming is quite expensive, only suited for a single task, in a single configuration, and not interaction safe. This thesis tries to solve these problems, by introducing Position And Stiffness Teaching with Interactive Learning (PASTIL) and History Aware PASTIL (HA-PASTIL), a novel interactive way of learning scalable variable impedance policies. The system is able to learn both positional reference trajectories and stiffness trajectories at the same time. PASTIL and HA-PASTIL learn these policies from positional corrections applied by a human teacher, through physical human robot interaction (pHRI). For the measurement and extraction of these corrections only the proprioception sensors of the robot are used, so no force/torque sensors are required. To learn from these corrections, the intention of the teacher is estimated, by segmenting the correction space in three parts. Each of these three parts correspond to a set of update rules for the policy, that fit the intention of a correction in that segment. In this thesis, the proposed algorithms are validated through a series of experiments with sample tasks, and compared with baseline algorithms. The main conclusions from these tests are that PASTIL and HA-PASTIL, as introduced in this thesis, outperform the baseline algorithms on task performance for all tasks and that the learned stiffness makes a positive contribution to task performance. This means that the algorithms proposed here allow for simple systems, with only proprioception sensors, to be instructed by users, instead of experts. This makes it possible for robotics to be applied at lower cost, with less expertise needed to program and operate. These algorithms, however, still have some aspects that could use further research. The most important example is that they are not yet tested on an actual robot, with physical human robot interaction. There is still quite some work left to do, but the proposed algorithms might pave the way for more, and better, algorithms that aim to learn force control behaviour form only positional corrections.","Robot Control; Interactive Learning; Impedance control; Intention Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The dynamics of the human-water interactions have been studied in the frame of sociohydrology and the central key was to study the impact society had on the hydrological regime of the rivers and the rivers on society, at the basins of Ilissos and Kifissos. Athens is the capital city of Greece, where almost half of the country’s population is located and the most important financial center of the country, where about 70% of country’s financial activity takes place. The time frame of this thesis covers almost the last 200 years, from 1834, when Athens became the capital city of Greece, until 2019 and takes into account the most important political and social events of these years. The human factors used in this research and which have also been used in sociohydrological studies are the community’s sensitivity and memory, along with human parameters like the social and political regime. In this research, the case study research method was selected for exploring in depth the interventions applied at the two rivers and the relations of people with water resources during the study period, by paying attention at details and attempting to correlate conditions and events. In more details, for collecting information about the evolution of social and political regime and the interventions to the rivers, the historical analysis method was used and for exploring the evolution of community’s sensitivity and memory, the method of content analysis at newspaper articles and municipal acts was chosen. The study showed that according to the way the community’s sensitivity evolved, there has been a change at the way people face Ilissos and Kifissos, from economically exploiting the rivers, towards a more environmentally sustainable management attitude. However, throughout city’s political and social history there have been periods, where the prevailing way people faced the two rivers changed drastically due to severe political and social events like wars, change of political regime and severe flood events. Moreover, the memory of the rivers influenced the way people treat the rivers, since it was found that there had been positive and negative memories related to the rivers, concerning their historical value on Athens history, memories related to their good or bad environmental condition and memories related to flood events. Usually, memory mentions were used to criticize the government for the process of projects or were used as motivation for more protection measures.","Ilissos; Kifissos; Athens; Greece; Basin; Urban River; socio-hydrology; sociohydrology; Political events; political regime; Democracy; dictatorship; totalitarian regime; War; society; urban development; community's sensitivity; memory; flood memory; pendulum swing; levee effect; case study; Historical Analysis; Content Analysis; Newspapers; Municipality; municipal acts; floods; Water management; river; human factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The objective of this thesis is to evaluate new evolutionary optimization methods to solve the railway track optimization problem. We use a Python based platform, since this programming language is increasing in popularity and new evolutionary algorithms are being made available there. The purpose of the research is to find out which optimizer and objective function performs best. Before the railway track parameters are optimized, tests are conducted on benchmark problems to become familiar with the evolutionary optimization solutions. In this thesis we use Grey Wolf Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm. Subsequently, the optimizers are applied on a numerical railway track model from [1]. We focus on the optimization of four parameters, stiffness and damping of both railpad and ballast. Objective function one J1 includes the sum of the differences between estimated frequency response function and target frequency response function in the frequency range 0-12500 Hz. Objective functions two includes the sum of the differences between estimated frequency response function and target frequency response function in the frequency range 0-3418 Hz and gives extra weight to those differences in the frequency range of the track resonances. Objective function three J3 includes the sum of differences of the estimated track resonances and the resonances from the target response. We compare the performance of these optimizers and three different objective functions. We show that it is possible to use all three optimizers to estimate the rail track parameters. We yield the best results with an objective function that only takes the frequency range 0-3418 Hz into account and applies a higher weight factor to differences within the frequency ranges of the track resonances. The compared algorithms behave differently for different objective functions. In most of the tested cases, GWO performed the best. The smallest difference between target parameters and optimized parameters were obtained with objective function two J2. Damping of the railpad is the most difficult parameter to estimate. Stiffness of the ballast was estimated with an error of about 3.90%, stiffness of the railpad with 1,06% and damping of ballast with an error of 3.60%. Finally, part of the further research includes the analysis of other evolutionary computation algorithm, optimization of the whole track model, sensitivity of analysis of the optimization parameters, inclusion of real-life measurements and addressing stochasticities in the objective function.","Evolutionary Computation; Railway Engineering; Inverse Modelling","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","During berthing operations vessels use their bow thruster(s) to improve their manoeuvrability, making them less dependent on the assistance of tugboats. The jet from a bow thruster reflects on the quay wall. It is directed towards the bottom where it reflects, causing high flow velocities over the bed. This may scour the nearby bed when it is left unprotected, leading to instability of the quay wall. Over the years, the shipping industry has been developing continuously, characterized primarily by the upscaling in size of inland- and sea-going vessels. As a result, vessels have more power and larger thruster diameters leading to higher hydraulic loads on quay walls and bed protections of berthing facilities. The most common type of bed protection is rip-rap (partially) penetrated with concrete. However, due to the complex flow field of the reflected jet, the decay profile of the near-bed flow velocities is unknown. This results in uncertainties in the design of bed protections and the required width of these protections that must be penetrated with concrete. In this research, the decay of the near-bed flow velocity in perpendicular direction to the quay wall induced by a 4-channel bow thruster is researched. The eventual goal is to provide a better indication to what extent the bed protection must be penetrated with concrete. Field measurements have been conducted in the North Sea Port of Gent with the Somtrans XXV, one of the largest inland vessels in the Netherlands. The flow velocities near the bed, induced by the bow thruster, have been measured with Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADV), Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Ott meters (Ott). The results from the flow velocity measurements have been analysed on three main parameters: influence of the applied bow thruster power, the distance between the measurement instrument frame and the bow thruster and quay wall clearance. The highest flow velocities are measured near the quay wall in the order of 1 m/s reaching up to a maximum of 1.8 m/s. Further away from the quay, the flow rapidly declines towards a more constant level of approximately 0.3-0.4 m/s. To define the maximum load on the bed, the mean flow velocity plus three times the standard deviation is used resulting in a maximum load ranging between 1.6-2.8 times the mean horizontal flow velocity. The Dutch and German guidelines for determining the near-bed flow velocities generally overestimate the measurement results. In addition, the dependency of the Dutch method on the total travelled distance by the jet, based on the sum of the quay wall clearance, the height of the bow thruster above the bed and the distance x from the quay wall, are not reflected in the measurement results. It is recommended that this extensive and unique data set acquired through the field measurements in Gent is further used to analyse the flow field of a reflected jet on a vertical quay wall by validating numerical and scale models. Combining these three different methodologies will contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon with the eventual goal of optimizing the design of bed protections.","Bow Thruster; Quay walls; Turbulence; Field measurement; Propeller jet; Bed protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The production flexibility and scalability of HFSB is investigated by designing and improving the conventional HFSB nozzle generator used by Delft University of Technology. Experiments are performed on various nozzle designs, focusing on the average bubble diameter. Through geometrical scaling and further developments, the bubble diameter is scaled from 0.5 mm, produced by conventional nozzles, to 2.5 mm. The obtained upscale in bubble diameter corresponds to a 3-fold increase along all dimensions compared to the current operational domain for HFSB experiments. Furthermore, a novel physics-based model is proposed relating particle size to the nozzle orifice and flow rates of air and helium and is benchmarked with the acquired experimental data.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The main principle of the application lies in fulfilling the fundamental needs of the patients and its family identified throughout the research. An isolated patient feels detached from his environment and unfamiliar with the new one, which can be defined as a lack of relatedness. Other essential needs are stimulation - to be distracted and security - to be informed. On the other side, the family members want to feel close with their hospitalized loved ones. The identified needs are relatedness, competence - to know patient’s feelings and state of health and foremost to have a purpose defined as a meaningful connection and knowledge on how to help. The goal of the project is to reduce the feeling of isolation to Covid19 patients by creating an unobtrusive connection with their family and a warm home environment. The project intended to be a rapid answer to the current pandemic and resulted in the isolation of vulnerable patients. The process started from the market research phase, where the main categories of projects, concepts, services, and consumer products were evaluated. The outcome showed that the majority of identified solutions that tackle the problem of closeness are mobile applications. The main principles of interaction derived from the market research are: sharing the same activity, sharing an experience, evoke memories, share memories, develop a relationship. The exploration and ideation had been made based on those outcomes resulted in the creation of three concepts: Evoke memories, Ambient participation (share experience), Active participation (share an activity). Concepts were evaluated throughout the interviews. Additionally, participants were asked about the meaning of closeness. After every iteration, the list of requirements had been updated and led to developing two concepts the mobile application -Digital Closeness and the physical concept - Modular Closeness. The decision needed to be made; two concepts were evaluated using the Harris profile method. Results have shown the possible higher improvement of perceived closeness with faster development and implementation process than the other concept. The Close app focuses on the discreet way of sharing memories which are the source of positive emotions and moments to send short updates to the patient, that both can serve as a distraction for the patient. App provides the patient’s family with the purpose by showing them the importance of creating meaningful content. The patient is also able to send short reactions that will give the family information. Additionally, the Close app offers an ambiance connection that is based on the family location. The familiar picture will be displayed on the patient’s TV during his inactivity, representing the location of the patient’s loved one. Firstly, the concept had been evaluated with the AttrakDiff to assess the hedonic and pragmatic qualities and its attractiveness. Secondly, the evaluation was conducted with hospitalized ex- COVID-19 patients, a family member of the hospitalized patient, and the healthcare professional. The concept had been received significantly positively by all of the stakeholders.","Closeness; Feeling of closeness; Mobile application; Close App; COVID-19; Isolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","During the course of this thesis, the design of a knee brace that improves the quality of life for people with arthritis in the knee, is being researched. The knee joint is covered with articular cartilage which protects the bones from being damaged. Arthritis of the knee is a pathology where this cartilage is damaged potentially even to the extent that direct bone-to-bone contact occurs. The most common symptoms for the patient are pain and inflammation, affecting their mobility and quality of life. Firstly, research is conducted on the arthritis knee disorder, the patients and their interests, and the technical aspect of a knee brace in relation with the knee kinematics. The following main insights are revealed by the analyses: -Arthritis in the knee is wear and tear of the articular cartilage caused by loading. This can be the result of extensive sports, overweight, incorrect alignment of the joint or aging. -There are no treatments available that cure the damaged cartilage tissue. It is in the patient’s interest to slow down the deterioration process. When the disorder impacts the quality of life too much, replacement surgery can be opted for. -Replacement surgery is the last resort option due to its invasiveness, possible complications and high rate of dissatisfied patients. It is therefore preferred to delay the need for a surgery if possible. -The deterioration process can be slowed down by exposing the knee joint to less load. Partially unloading the joint can be beneficial during demanding activities or even daily activities, depending on the stage of arthritis. -A customized fit of the knee brace is preferred for increased comfort and effectiveness. Secondly, during the development phase, two main challenges are explored, being the custom fit of the brace and the unloading mechanism. To make a perfectly fitting brace design, many mock-ups are created and evaluated on their comfort and secure fit. The insights are translated into a standard model that can be shaped around the patient’s 3D scan of the leg. This experimental approach is also applied to find an unloading mechanism that can be integrated in the brace. The concepts are tested by attaching them to the brace mock-ups that were created when exploring the perfect fit. Thirdly, a design proposal is created, resulting in the LVATE brace that can be integrated in Orthobroker’s product-service platform. During the patient’s appointment with an orthotist, a 3D scan of the leg is made and uploaded to a digital platform. The platform morphs the LVATE brace around the 3D scan in such a way that it distributes pressure among tolerant zones of the leg. The brace can then be ordered right away. The unloading mechanism is activated by rotating a knob that is positioned on the lateral side of the brace. Finally, the brace is evaluated on its feasibility, desirability and viability. A conclusion is derived from the evaluation feedback and recommendations are prepared for a further development of the design proposal.","3D Printing; Additive Manufacturing; osteoarthritis; Healthcare; orthoses; Orthopaedic; Product Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Distribution of high-quality entanglement over long distances is a key step for the development of a future quantum internet. Exponential photon loss related to distance in optical fibres makes it impractical to connect two nodes directly. Furthermore, the impossibility of copying general quantum states forbids using the same solutions as in classical communication. Quantum repeaters can be used to extend entanglement to longer distances using teleportation; nonetheless, straightforward application still leads to an exponential decrease in the link quality. Entanglement purification probabilistically allow us to obtain few high-quality links from many low-quality ones. Several protocols combining quantum repeaters with purification have been proposed. However, the hardware quality is still lacking. Moreover, it is unclear how an improvement over a certain hardware parameter affects the final link quality or entanglement generation rate. Analytical expressions are hard to find and usually assumptions are needed, limiting their applicability. In this work, a realistic repeater chain is modelled using NetSquid, a discrete-event based quantum network simulator. A genetic algorithm-based optimisation methodology is then applied to determine what entanglement distribution protocol allows for minimal improvement over current hardware, and what these improvements must be in order to achieve a target link quality and distribution rate. In this thesis, we aim to make the path towards scalable quantum repeaters clearer, as well as understand how entanglement purification can enable this goal. We conclude that quantum repeaters are necessary to connect distances larger than 200km. We also find that entanglement purification enables achieving target metrics with lower hardware cost when the internode distance is approximately 100km, where a balance is found between a low rate for longer separations and a too demanding hardware for shorter ones. Finally, we analyse the growth of the hardware cost with the distance showing that, with the best choice of protocols, it scales linearly. We believe that these results constitute a valuable stepping stone towards a blueprint for a pan-European quantum internet.","quantum internet; quantum repeaters; Optimization; Genetic Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

At present most treatments for cancer still give rise to unwanted side-effects. In this thesis, a treatment that combines both chemo- and radiotherapy to reduce the side-effects of chemotherapy is reported. Instead of allowing the drug to spread through the whole body and also targeting fast dividing healthy cells, a chemotherapeutic drug is encapsulated in a polymeric nanocarrier. In addition, the nanocarrier encapsulates another molecule, a photosensitizer. The photosensitizer can be activated by visible light to produce singlet oxygen and in previous experiments was shown to be able to induce release when exposed to ionizing radiation. In a yet unknown process this will act as a switch, leading to the polymeric nanocarrier releasing the chemodrug. This allows inducing a more precise release at the tumor by focusing the radiation locally.

These changes will need to be accompanied by major investments in energy infrastructure, especially considering the goals of climate-neutrality envisioned for 2050. In integrated energy system planning, the system-level interactions between, for example, storage, electricity networks and gas networks are taken into account and considered as a whole. This thesis investigates the potential benefits of integrated energy system planning, focusing on the distribution grid level. The analysis is carried out for a case study in the Sterrenburg region of South Holland. Power-gas integration and the integration of electrical energy storage with batteries are investigated using hourly demand and generation profiles based on 2050 scenarios. An expansion planning model is developed to determine the optimal investments for the 2050 scenarios, starting from the existing network. This mixed-integer linear programming model uses PyPSA, an open-source energy system modelling toolbox. The optimisation objective is a combination of investment and operational costs. The results demonstrate spatial and economic benefits from including electrolysis, and limited effects from electric storage and gas-to-power within the scope of the case. There are many possibilities for broadening and deepening the scope in future works. For example, different combinations of integration such as heat networks and long-term gas storage could be considered together.","Optimisation; Distribution Network; Energy System Integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-01","","","","","",""

Often times it is challenging to build mathematical models to describe the system dynamics due to limited knowledge of the underlying system, complex nonlinearities, or the existence of unknown exogenous phenomena impacting the input/output response. For this reason, it's important to develop methods of System Identification to learn these dynamics using only batches of input/output data, as well as control strategies capable of handling such models. The necessity for flexibility in the model and ability to deal with nonlinear mappings has led to the interest of applying machine learning methods to Identification and control design. This thesis focuses on using Gaussian Processes as a means to learn a model from batch training data and on developing a control strategy capable of handling such a model. The goal is to propose a Data-driven algorithm for closed-loop control and to explore the properties of a Gaussian Process that make it a candidate method for control applications.","Gaussian process; Regression; system identification; Machine Learning; Control; Online","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This means people have to cross knowledge boundaries. Crossing these boundaries can be done with boundary objects that help to transfer knowledge across these boundaries (Carlile, 2002, 2004). Touch can expand the vocabulary that people have at their disposal and therefore contribute to making transferring experiential knowledge and crossing boundaries easier.<br/><br/>To make the research of how touch can be applied to enhance transdisciplinary learning more concrete, a specific context has been chosen, namely the organization ‘Centre of Expertise Societal Innovation’. Within this organization, they want to create learning communities whereby knowledge is shared and preserved between students and others stakeholders in consecutive projects. This has led to the following research questions:<br/><br/>“How to improve the transition between graduation projects within the Urban Innovation program of EMI with a haptic language design to preserve knowledge within the different communities of practice.”<br/><br/>The knowledge that the organization wants to preserve is so-called tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is hard to express in words. Therefore, guidance is needed to help people express their tacit knowledge. From the theory of transdisciplinary learning, it is retrieved that the 7 habits of the mind are important to foster transdisciplinary learning. These habits also include using the senses of the human body. Therefore, it is interesting to combine transdisciplinary learning by expressing tacit knowledge with the senses of the human body. Especially the sense of touch is interesting to use because touch can deepen communication and is one of the most versatile senses. <br/><br/>The literature study in combination with exploratory research on how touch can be used in communication, has resulted in 6 haptic design principles for transdisciplinary learning. These principles can be used by designers that want to create physical haptic designs for transdisciplinary learning. The 6 haptic principles are:<br/><br/>1. Haptic design triggers people to touch it<br/>2. Haptic design makes people conscious of touch<br/>3. Haptic design enables different touch experiences<br/>4. Haptic design translates and adjusts between different disciplines by providing the same meaning for everyone<br/>5. Haptic design evokes interaction between users<br/>6. Haptic design gives people the tools to make their thoughts and ideas tangible<br/><br/>With the principles, a final concept design has been created, called MIMIC. MIMIC is a haptic language design that helps users to express their internal thoughts, ideas, and feelings by providing tools to make these internal thoughts, ideas, and feelings tangible. Translating to external forms will make it easier for others to understand. MIMIC consists out of two sets of cubes, the basic set made of wooden cubes with different weights, and the haptic set of cubes with different materials from 10 categories on each side cubes. Furthermore, a guide, an instruction sheet, and warming-up exercises are created to give guidance to users for sharing relevant knowledge and the use of the haptic language in general. <br","Haptic; Haptic language; Communication; Communication design; Tool; Transdisciplinary collaborations; Transdisciplinary learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

As a result, it is becoming widely deployed in various safety and security-critical applications like autonomous driving, malware detection, fingerprint identification, and financial fraud detection. It was recently shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to multiple attacks and pose a serious security threat for such systems. Such an attack is the backdoor attack. In this attack, the model's training is partially or fully outsourced to a malicious party. The adversary designs a secret property, the trigger, and embeds it into a small fraction of the training data. The trained model associates this property with a specific (chosen by the adversary) target label. The backdoored model behaves well on regular inputs, but a misclassification will occur with a very high probability when the trigger is present. The advent of this attack sparked an arms race in the deep learning community resulting in numerous backdoor attacks and defenses during the last years. In this thesis, we conduct a systematic evaluation that can push our knowledge further, aiming at more effective defenses in the future for various applications like image classification, natural language processing, and sound recognition. We show that the trigger's size is positively correlated to the attack success rate in almost all cases. On the contrary, the trigger's position is not always connected to the attack success rate and depends on the used neural network. Furthermore, we are the first to experiment with inaudible triggers in sound recognition and show that they can be used for stealthy real-world attacks. Moreover, we show that backdoor attacks could be a framework that further pushes our knowledge of how deep neural networks learn.<br/>%Most of these attacks focus on computer vision, and only a few experiment with natural language processing and sound recognition. Additionally, most of the defenses are empirical and can be bypassed by slightly altering the attack scenario. Additionally, we exploited global average pooling's properties aiming at a more effective attack. In particular, we created dynamic backdoors that can be effective even if different trigger positions are used during training and inference without poisoning more data or altering the poisoning procedure. The exploration of this layer also showed that when a model generalizes well on new inputs, it is less probable to be susceptible to backdoor attacks.","Deep Learning; Backdoor Attacks; AI Security; Image Classification; Text Sentiment Analysis; Sound Recognition; Global Average Pooling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the financial crisis, the population grew whereas construction declined. The current shortage of houses is around 330.000 (Obbink, 2020), to counter this issue an estimated 1 million new houses need to be built in the coming 10 years (ABF Research, 2019). This graduation project focuses on an initiative to remedy this crisis: a Community Land Trust (CLT) association in the Bijlmer H-neighbourhood. A CLT association is a community-led not-for-profit organisation that creates and manages affordable housing for people with low or modest incomes and develops neighbourhood facilities that benefit the local community. CLT associations are open member organisations that use an alternative development model which includes the interests of residents and the neighbourhood. The ownership and management of the land, homes, and neighbourhood facilities are anchored in the CLT organisation by taking them in joint ownership, as well as establishing conditions that ensure sustainable and social use. The problem statement this thesis focuses on is: How can the CLT association facilitate successful collaboration within workgroups between its members and external experts? The corresponding design statement is the following: Design a platform for CLT members that stimulates a desirable way of working, and includes an approach towards making democratic decisions, in order to empower members and create a flourishing community. To realise this design statement a CLT members platform was designed. This platform focuses on being a communication channel for the association. The platform helps to clarify the structure and purpose of the association, and provides tools that support the community throughout their operation. To create a clear storyline of how this platform will be used in the association, a CLT blueprint was created, displayed in the figure on the right. This blueprint shows the journey of a member within the community, starting with the onboarding process, followed by being an active member, and ending with being part of an empowered community. For the three stages, activities that could occur are described by explaining the various entry points, the process, the outcome, and how this outcome might influence other processes happening in the community. Several tools are proposed that are useful during the before mentioned activities.","Community Land Trust; Social innovation; community development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The manufactured design consists of two curved, thin-walled U-beams made of high strength steel. The beams are prestressed in opposite directions to obtain zero torsional stiffness so that rotation of the head is allowed. The presented manufacturing method for the beams consists of three different steps; (1)Production of a straight U-beam using a saw mill, (2)Bending the U-beam with a bending tool based on press die forming, (3)Heat treatment to increase the strength of the profile.<br/>C75 high strength steel is used for the production of the beams. The straight U-beams with a wall thickness of 0.4 mm were produced within an accuracy of 0.03 mm. The formed U-beams in step 2 approximately follow the desired curve with a maximum lateral error of 1mm which is deemed sufficient for this application. Finally, the beams were strengthened using a standard quenching and tempering heat treatment which increased the yield strength with a factor of 4 up to 1650 MPa. A prototype was made which consists of a 3D printed lower and upper base, as well as two prestressed curved U-beams produced with the presented manufacturing method. The performance of the compliant mechanism design with the produced beams is analysed in terms of the moment-angle curve. Prestressing reduced the maximum moment between -60 and 60 degrees with a factor of about 60 to 0.015 Nm.","Compliant mechanism; springback; zero-stiffness; head support; manufacturing method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

However, overpass girders in the main road network of Rijkswaterstaat are never reused for the same function. There are barriers present which hampers the reusing elements in comparison with the traditional way of handling infrastructure projects. Most of the main reasons why girders are never reused in the main road network of Rijkswaterstaat according to the interviewed authorities can be diminished with the designed process model. The process model creates insight in the process and results are gained in the SBIR project. Insight is necessary in the total process, environmental impact, financial impact, supply and demand, and dismantling the structural components. Next to the process steps there are essential boundary conditions for reusing structural components in large scale. External boundary conditions are clear laws &amp; regulations and the improvement of environmental impact both in calculation tools and in environmental gains for tender contracts. The laws and regulations must explicitly state what rules should be followed. Rijkswaterstaat can provide this necessary clarity. Also, the calculation tools must be adjusted so that all reuse advantages and disadvantages are included in the calculation and a fair comparison can be made. The process steps consist of evaluation of the structure, impact calculation and supply &amp; demand. When the process steps are followed the highest potential of reusing elements can be reached. After the process steps are ran through, the knowledge must be shared with all market parties and clients. This will create new insights in the sector which can result in new ambitions and new eco-innovations. With the newly gained insight, the process model of reusing structural components can be followed again to improve the circularity and sustainability of the sector at each new process cycle.","Circularity; Circular Economy; Reuse; Concrete; Case study; Overpass girders","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

An analysis was conducted on the interactions between groundwater drainage and different water infrastructure systems like: the sanitary sewer system, the storm water drainage system, and the drinking water system. Due to the age of these networks, damage caused during natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, the ground movement sensitivity of the region and the existing land subsidence, these networks are in poor shape. To quantify the groundwater drainage component of each system, an existing QGIS wastewater model was used along with different time series, including hourly and daily data for precipitation and sewer station influents, and a storm drainage analysis based on pumping station data. The following notable conclusions per water system were made: 1) 50% of the total water treated in the wastewater treatment plant is groundwater, adding a large amount of unnecessary stress to the treatment process, 2) the storm water drainage system is the largest groundwater drainage component contributing to 58% of the total groundwater drainage and 3) 55% of the produced drinking water is lost during distribution, meaning the drinking water losses are a larger groundwater recharge than the annual precipitation surplus. A large part of this lost drinking water is then drained by the adjacent sewer and storm water drainage pipes.","Groundwater; Drainage; New Orleans","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with concurrent chemotherapy followed by brachytherapy. Many patients experience some degree of treatment-related toxicity, mainly concerning the bowel, urinary tract, or vagina. Another important morbidity is hematologic toxicity (HT) due to bone marrow suppression, which might negatively impact the efficacy of adjuvant therapies. Treatment-related morbidity has a profound impact on patients’ quality of life. Proton therapy allows easier sparing of organs at risk (OARs), which might result in a decrease of treatment-related morbidities. One initiative to reduce treatment morbidities for LACC-patients was proposed in a collaborative project between Erasmus Medical Center (Erasmus MC), Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), and Holland Proton Therapy Center (HollandPTC): the PROTECT-project. A clinical pilot study will be conducted to determine differences in dose to OARs and in morbidity outcomes when comparing state-of-the-art photon therapy with adaptive intensity-modulated proton therapy (aIMPT) for patients with LACC. Additionally, bone marrow sparing capabilities of both delivery techniques will be evaluated. The focus of this thesis is on the clinical implementation of aIMPT to facilitate the pilot-study and consists of three parts. <br/><br/>The thesis started with a systematic review of the literature about the relationship between bone marrow dose and HT in LACC-patients treated with primary chemoradiation. The review has been submitted for publication. There was a scarcity of studies investigating the relationship between bone marrow dose and HT and clinically useful prediction models were not available yet. The majority of the studies defining bone marrow as the whole pelvic bone found a significant association between bone marrow and HT, in contrast to studies evaluating lower density marrow spaces or active bone marrow. Future studies may use whole pelvic bone contouring to develop normal tissue complication probability models.<br/><br/>Secondly, the development and implementation of the treatment planning strategy for LACC-patients in HollandPTC were proposed. Uncertainties arising from proton therapy delivery were identified and strategies to address these uncertainties were determined. The proposed aIMPT-strategy for LACC-treatment consisted of a plan-of-the-day-approach with margins and robust planning. Further work includes establishing the balance between robustness settings and margins and optimizing the clinical implementation of the plan-of-the-day-strategy.<br/><br/>Lastly, the workflow for LACC-patients in Erasmus MC was translated into the HollandPTC environment. Requirements for the new workflow were generated with input from both the investigator and a risk evaluation with the users. A workflow was designed and translated into HollandPTC's situation. Secondly, the implementation of the plan-of-the-day-strategy in the treatment management process of the oncology information system ARIA was investigated. Recommendations were made to finalize and validate the implementation of the workflows. <br/><br/>This thesis provides a base for the clinical implementation of aIMPT for LACC in HollandPTC. The systematic review gives guidance for bone marrow sparing techniques in Erasmus MC and HollandPTC. Additionally, a combination of a plan-of-the-day-approach with margins and robust planning was identified as the most optimal treatment planning strategy. Lastly, an implementation strategy for the clinical workflow and treatment management process in HollandPTC was determined. Further work should focus on finalizing and validating the clinical implementation to facilitate PROTECT's clinical pilot study in HollandPTC.","Proton therapy; Cervical cancer; Implementation; Clinical workflow; Treatment planning strategy; Hematologic toxicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

Therefore, in this thesis, the influence of horizontal wind on satellite aerodynamics in the lower thermosphere is analyzed. The impact of the choice in satellite geometry design and orbital parameters on the satellite's aerodynamics and wind sensitivity is tested. To model satellite aerodynamics in this high-density region, a method of using the Stochastic PArallel Rarefied-gas Time-accurate Analyzer, SPARTA, is proposed. It is proven that the worst-case horizontal wind can have a negligible influence on the satellite’s drag coefficient depending on its attitude and satellite geometry.

Collecting this plastic however begs the question: ‘What to do with this waste after it has left the ocean?’To answer this question, first, it is important to look at the material. In my research, I defined the following tiers of ocean plastic:Tier 1: Mechanically recyclable plastics and recolourableTier 2: Mechanically recyclable plastics, but black and non recolourableTier 3: Non-mechanically recyclable plasticsBased on an analysis The Ocean Cleanup and its context I defined three main goals that it should attempt to achieve with the plastic: Value: To gain as much income as possible from the plastic in order to be less dependent on donations.Awareness: To use the plastics to generate as much awareness as possible for the ocean plastic issue.Volume: To find a purpose for the entire volume of the extracted ocean plastic.No single product made from ocean plastic can satisfy all the goals and tiers at once. By developing a combination of complementary ideas with an underlying strategy, The Ocean Cleanup can maximise the impact on all three goals while ensuring that the different ideas fit with the material tiers.Through a combination of literature research and interviews (both with consumers and experts) I designed and developed the following strategies:1: Limited Ocean Plastic EditionsPartner with specific companies to make limited ocean plastic editions of existing products. This creates a win-win-win situation in which the consumers get a special version of a product, the partner company benefits from the positive brand association and The Ocean Cleanup accomplishes all three goals.2: Interior&amp;Exterior ArchitectureCollaborate with processing companies to create building materials from the ocean plastic. In this context the fact that the material cannot be coloured is of lesser importance and the demand for sustainable materials is high.3: Arts &amp; ExperimentsThis context allows for the extraction of as much value and awareness out of the non-recyclable plastic as possible by using it in for example: art projects and design competitions.These three distinct strategies fit together in an overarching brand concept I call: Ocean Product. This brand establishes a single point of recognition for consumers, while at the same time differentiating The Ocean Cleanup’s plastic from that of competitors.Finally, I integrated all findings into a partnership selection tool, which can help The Ocean Cleanup decide which partnerships are worth pursuing and which are not.I believe that this strategy, with its three tiers and partnership selection tool presents a complete vision of how The Ocean Cleanup can turn 80.000.000 kg of waste into ‘Ocean Product’.","Ocean Plastic; The Ocean Cleanup; Plastic; Valorisation; Strategy; Strategic Design; Recycling; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Very ambitious goals in regards to performance, efficiency and sustainability are being asked of the aviation industry, the kind that warrant a virtual exploration of the edges of the flight envelope. High­ order has come to be regarded as a necessary ingredient to achieve breakthrough advances in this direction. So much so, in fact, that the major aircraft manufac­turers, governmental aerospace research agencies and top universities worldwide have been acting in coordination to increase the technology readiness level of these approaches, for the last ten years. In this work, I study in significant detail the one aspect that makes high-­order methods ideal candi­dates for enabling the use of more advanced turbulence models in industry: the cost­-efficiency of their discretization—they offer minimal amounts of dispersion and dissipation errors, for a given number of degrees of freedom. I consider three research objects: discontinuous Galerkin spectral method (DGSEM), flux reconstruction (FR) and a novel B-­spline-based discontinuous Galerkin formulation stabilized via algebraic flux correc­tion (DGIGA­-AFC), and characterize their order of accuracy, linear and nonlinear stability characteristics, as well as dis­persion and dissipation errors as a function of wavenumber. Afterwards, I experimentally investigate their relative suitability towards scale­-resolving simulation of compressible and turbulent flows, by solv­ing a number of simple test cases of increasing difficulty (linear advection, inviscid Burgers and Euler equations; all in 1D) using a purpose­-made MATLAB implementation. The proposed isogeometric method (DGIGA) has been found to be at least as viable as the other two, a priori, for the resolution of high­-speed turbulent flows. Moreover, I have found that low dispersion and dissipation need not always be associated to high order, but to a high number of degrees of freedom per patch instead; these two coincide in the more conventional schemes, yet not necessarily in DGIGA. As a nonlinear stabilization mechanism, however, the proposed combination of DGIGA with AFC has turned out to be inferior to existing limiters.","high-order FEM; discontinuous Galerkin; flux reconstruction; isogeometric analysis; algebraic flux correction; hyperbolic equations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A detailed evaluation of DRG stimulation-induced effects on postural stability can be obtained by recording center of pressure (CoP) and muscle activity during seated stability tasks, combined with the validated modified Functional Reach Test (mFRT). However, this particular combination of experiments has not yet been used to quantify postural stability in SCI patients or the healthy population. The aim of this study is to investigate postural stability in the healthy population utilizing a novel experimental protocol, involving this combination of experiments, to serve as reference for SCI patients in the upcoming long-term DRG stimulation study. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. CoP sway during upright sitting and multi-directional leaning was determined from force plate recordings. Furthermore, functional arm reach was assessed with the mFRT. Lastly, contribution of hip and trunk muscles was examined by retrieving muscle activation patterns and intermuscular coherence from surface electromyography (EMG) recordings during multi-directional trunk movements. Results: During upright sitting an average root-mean-square CoP displacement of 1 mm, velocity of 4.5 mm/s and acceleration of 175 mm/s/s was found. Maximum CoP displacements during multi-directional leaning were within 10 to 20 cm. Furthermore, the average functional arm reach was 50 cm in the forward direction and 30 cm in the lateral directions. The contribution of hip and trunk muscles to multi-directional trunk movements consisted of antagonist and contralateral muscle activation, accompanied by high intermuscular synchronization between 0-100 Hz for most neighboring muscle pairs. Conclusion: This study provides a detailed examination of postural stability in the healthy population. Some revisions of the experimental protocol must be considered to reduce the amount of cross-registraton in EMG recordings. Nevertheless, the data of this study is well suited to be employed as reference for the potential improvements in postural stability in SCI patients during the upcoming long-term DRG stimulation study.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-20","","","","Technical Medicine | Sensing and Stimulation","",""

Internal radiation therapy with alpha particles is a promising method to battle cancer, but it is currently limited to easily accessible tumors. A more advanced and selective method for alpha radiation therapy that will have better outcomes, fewer side effects, and higher efficacy is needed. A promising alternative is a two-step approach in which super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION’s) are first delivered to the cancer cells and then receive the radiotherapeutics in a targeted manner. One of the most important conditions for this strategy is retention of SPIONs at the cell membranes in order to ensure in vivo click-reaction between the azide-functionalized nanoparticles and cyclooctyne-conjugated radiotracer. The goal of this study is to observe the behavior of two types of SPION’s on the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer cell line U87 and to verify whether the nanoparticles are internalized by the cancer cells or stay on the outside of the membrane. This has been done by growing U87 spheroids, incubating them with the nanoparticles, performing a cryosection on these spheroids, photographing the slices of the cryosection with a fluorescence microscope and analyzing the iron-content of the slices with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The second part of the study concerns the preliminary in vitro click-reaction of the nanoparticles by adding beta emitter 177Lu coupled to DOTA-cyclooctyne complex to spheroids that were incubated with the nanoparticles. The fluorescence microscope analysis concludes that the nanoparticles functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) penetrate the U87 spheroids less than the nanoparticles without PEG. The azide click reaction between the nanoparticles and 177Lu-DOTA-cyclooctyne complex was observed and showed more cell damage to the spheroid incubated with nanoparticles then the spheroids that were only treated with 177LuDOTA-cyclooctyne.","In vitro; azide-functionalized; spheroid","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Science and Technology","",""

The free variables can be used in any constraint, and can be used to connect clusters. The solver uses this structure to speed up the computations in two ways. First, the low rank structure is used to reduce matrix products to products of the form uT M v, where M is a matrix and u and v are vectors, as already suggested by Löfberg and Parrilo in [43rd IEEE CDC (2004)]. Second, an additional block-diagonal structure is introduced due to the clusters. This gives the possibility to do operations such as the Cholesky decomposition block-wise.   We apply this to sphere packing and spherical cap packing. For sphere packing, the speed of the solver is compared to the often used arbitrary precision solver SDPA-GMP, showing the theoretical speedup in time complexity.

The idea that electrokinetic transport control is a possibility originates from research that found that charge inversion is reduced when monovalent ions are added to a multivalent solution. Consequently, flow reversal suppression is expected. Many mechanisms are known to contribute to charge inversion and ion competition, but it is unclear how they exactly relate to charge inversion reduction and flow reversal suppression. This work aims to replicate charge inversion reduction and flow reversal suppression in a system with an amorphous silica interface for mixed electrolytes with calcium, sodium and chloride. To allow insight into the structural behaviour of the electrical double layer and the electrokinetic properties for varying concentrations, molecular dynamics simula- tions are used. No variation in charge inversion and flow reversal reduction was found for the simulated concentrations. However, the adsorption behaviour of ions in the electrical double layer changed due to ion competition between sodium and calcium, where sodium outcompetes calcium for inner sphere surface complex adsorption. This work also shows that the electroosmotic flow behaviour for mixtures is sensitive to the dynamic adsorption behaviour of ions, emphasizing the importance of correctly tuned force field parameters between surface and ions.","electrical double layer; electrolyte mixtures; electroosmotic flow; electrokinetics; nanofluidics; molecular dynamics; solid-liquid interfaces; amorphous silica; adsorption; ion competition; charge inversion; flow reversal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

(mentor); Carroll, E.C.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death in today's world. Radiation is a widely used in the treatment of cancer. One of the relatively newer methods is proton therapy, which can spare healthy tissues better than traditional photon treatments due to the unique Bragg peak of protons. A promising improvement is FLASH proton therapy, which utilises ultra-high dose rates (40-100x higher than conventionally used). However, a lot is still unknown about this method. This research took first steps towards experimentally investigating FLASH proton radiation in living tissues. To achieve this, three types of experiments were performed. The first consisted of simulation with proton radiation, the second used proton to irradiation zebrafish, and the last experiment irradiated zebrafish with a gamma source. First, a virtual model of the irradiation conditions was built with TopasMC, using an 140 MeV proton beam propagating in a water tank containing model cells. The flux and number of protons were tallied at various positions. A new beam was created for each positing using the tallied data resembling the original beam. The new beam was used for small scale irradiation of a model cell. The damage was assessed by calculating DNA strand breaks. <br/>The simulation showed a Bragg peak for dose measurements, in accordance with literature. The damages to DNA significantly increased as the LET increased, as expected. This forms a basis for future simulation into FLASH. Next an experimental setup was realised and a first experiment was preformed. The setup showed a field homogeneity with a maximum difference of 3\%, as well as a maximum dose difference of 2\% in the region of interest. This provided a solid foundation for accurate measurements of the experiment with living samples. Subsequently, zebrafish embryos were irradiated with protons with either 5 Gy or 20 Gy and a dose rate of approximately 1 Gy/min. A different batch of zebrafish embryos received gamma radiation with a dose rate of around 10 Gy/min, also to 5 Gy and 20 Gy dosages. The damage to the embryos was estimated via the detection of heart beats, and their length, directly after receiving radiation and after a day of growth. The results of the proton irradiation of the embryos showed no significant differences between the separate groups. For the gamma irradiation also no significant difference were found, either for the 0-day measurements. After a day of growth, a tangible difference was found, but this was with a control group that was not transported. Therefore, no direct link could be made to radiation as a sole source of the influence. Additionally, temperature had a large effect on the development of the embryos. The simulations showed the difference in biological effect of different LET coefficients of protons. The practical irradiation's do appear to reveal some discrepancy between the different samples, but the samples sizes are too small to draw definitive conclusions from, especially went comparing the results after a day of growth. Nevertheless, a solid base has has been build for future research into FLASH. A simulation capable of doing physical and biological measurement was constructed. Also, an accurate physical setup for proton irradiation was made. In addition, a design for the containment of the zebrafish during transport, irradiation, and processing was devised. Lastly, protocols for the transportation, handling, processing, and analysis of the samples were created.","Zebrafish; Proton therapy; FLASH; high dose rates; Radiation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2031-04-01","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Ke, L. (graduation committee); Turteltaub, S.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A common choice for multiscale modeling of the mechanical response of composites is to use periodic boundary conditions (BCs) on square representative volume elements (RVEs). However, these periodic BCs over-constrain the response when strain localization takes place in bands that are not compatible with the imposed periodic constraints. Previously developed improvements are based on aligning the periodic BCs with an evolving localization band. This is either done by applying a rotation to the periodicity frame or by imposing the periodic BCs in a weak sense and then applying a shift to the function that couples points. However, with matrix-inclusion RVEs, this change of the periodicity frame may cause a mis-alignment of inclusions that cross opposing edges, resulting in an artificial reinforcement along the RVE edge, which limits the number of supported localization angles and fails to provide a transversely isotropic response. It is the objective of this thesis to develop a micromodel with transversely isotropic response for strain localization problems. It is shown that circular RVEs with straightforward application of periodic BCs provide a response which is independent of the load orientation but fail to predict full softening behavior. This is due to over-constraining when cracks reach the boundary. Therefore, a modification to the periodic BCs on a circular RVE is proposed, which allows for cracks to cross the edges. This is achieved by adding an unknown jump to the periodic constraint equations, which does not affect the response before localization. Moreover, a parameter that depends on the RVE size is used to make sure that the kinematics are consistent between scales in an average sense. The performance of the formulation is tested with a series of simulations where macroscopic strain rates are imposed under varying angles. Additionally, a circular heterogeneous RVE with periodic material is presented where inclusions are allowed to cross the edge. It is demonstrated that the circular RVE with the modified periodic BCs successfully predicts an isotropic response with full softening. In the simulations that were performed, a priori knowledge of the localization angle was used. However, the framework can be extended such that the BCs adapt to support an orientation of a localization band that is detected during the simulations.","multiscale; strain localization; representative volume element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In serious forms of crime, like drug crime or human trafficking, enormous amounts of money are made. For criminals, this money is not directly usable. Spending it right away in the economy would be too obvious and attract attention from the authorities. Therefore, the dirty money gained by these criminal activities should be laundered first. The true origin of the money is disguised, and a legal source is linked to it. After money laundering the dirty money, the money appears clean and can be spent in the economy. Money laundering is not only a crime in itself but also a secondary offence. It can be seen as a symptom of other criminal activities because the need for laundering money is always a result of criminal activities where much money is made. For this reason, it is crucial to tackle it. The fight against money laundering is essential to fight all other kinds of serious crime effectively. The Public Prosecution Service plays a vital role in tackling money laundering. They are responsible for detecting criminal offences and prosecuting criminals. In this project, the initial goal was to: Map the current money laundering system in the region of Limburg and identify opportunities that support the Public Prosecution Service in the fight against money laundering in the current system. Money laundering is a complex problem. It involves many stakeholders and it is dynamic. In this project, the systematic design approach is used to tackle this complex problem situation. In the systemic design approach, the design thinking and system thinking methods are combined. The project can be separated into two parts. The first part is about researching and identifying the money laundering system. The second part is about developing interventions that fit in this system. To move from insights to interventions, an experiment with different methods is carried out. These methods were: GIGA-mapping, the VIP method, system mapping by using a causal loop diagram, and the reframing method. By reflecting on these methods and developed personal design criteria, an intervention framework was developed. This framework helped develop three new sub design goals, focused on providing understanding, guidance and inspiration for the Public Prosecution Service. These three goals resulted in three systemic interventions. The first intervention is the causal loop diagram, focused on understanding the money laundering system. Second, the action blueprint, consisting of six principles that guide the Public Prosecution Service in taking urgent action. And third, the tangible solution overview shows examples of how the six principles can be developed into tangible ideas. The interventions collaboratively help to increase the sense of urgency regarding money laundering among th Public Prosecution Service. Together they form the Money Laundering Design Manifesto.","systemic design; design manifesto; money laundering; Openbaar Ministerie; systemic design lab; system mapping; systemic interventions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Previous research has shown automated robotic mechanism design to be both deceptive (prone to local minima) and rife with linkage problems (having highly interdependent parameters). This results in a barrier to optimization that is unable to be breached by simply applying more iterations and computational power. The research also indicates that a graph structure model of the robot in combination with an evolutionary algorithm yields useful robotic mechanisms for a limited set of simple problems. This thesis expands on this pre-existing representation by introducing an indirect model that can be used to include both controllers, motors and other new elements in the representation. Besides this extension of the mechanism model, a framework for the automated design optimization task itself is introduced. This thesis shows an equivalence between an operator based representation of the mechanisms and the graph based representation. These operators represent modifications on the mechanism structure and/or parameters. By recognizing the operators as paths in this model a graph of the search space itself can be constructed. In this graph the vertices are mechanisms and the edges are operators. Using the the operator-mechanism equivalence it is shown that designing an optimization algorithm is equivalent to (1) choosing how vertices in the space are grouped together. (2) choosing how the vertices of this search space are connected beforehand by either implicitly or explicitly picking operators and projecting onto their corresponding domain. (3) picking which of the connected paths to traverse based on accumulated information at runtime. This represents a framework that allows the accumulation of knowledge about optimization algorithms acting within it by defining a set of meta-heuristics. With these it is possible to make informed choices to build better optimization algorithms. To show the effectiveness of the framework a novel quality diversity algorithm is developed, Reduced Operator-Space Evolution (ROSE), which uses the insights mentioned above to generate a large diversity of well performing mechanisms simultaneously on a representative pick-and-place task. This confirms the theoretical results about the effect of the operator-mechanism equivalence and locality properties. A new step forward to breaching the barrier to optimization. Alongside this thesis a performant simulation and analysis Python library for mechanisms was developed called PyMechs. The library visualizes the framework and handles mechanism simulation and evaluation, as well as implements ROSE.

However, so far, none of the individual algorithms perform at a level that qualifies for clinical use. In this study, we investigated whether combining several existing AD prediction algorithms improves performance and generalisability.<br/>State-of-the-art AD progression prediction algorithms were collected from the TADPOLE-SHARE project. Algorithms were trained on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and made forecasts of the clinical diagnosis (CN, MCI, or AD). These algorithms were combined using i) simple, unlearned fuser methods and ii) learned fuser methods. In total, seven experiments were conducted, exploring different combination strategies with increasing complexity of fusers. Finally, we implemented and added our own individual algorithm, a residual neural network (ResNet). All individual algorithms and ensembles were evaluated with the multiclass area under the curve (mAUC) and the balanced classification accuracy (BCA) performance metrics. Statistical significance was evaluated with the McNemar test.<br/>Results. TADPOLE-SHARE resulted in the collection of eight algorithms, from which five were reused for combination. Overall, combining algorithms slightly improves performance (i.e. increased BCA and mAUC), although improvements were not statistically significant (McNemar test). Both BCA and mAUC showed a trend of improved performance with increasing fuser complexity i.e. data learned fusers and re-entering original data features. DoubleResNet was the best performing ensemble (BCA = 0.809 [±0.026], mAUC = 0.902 [±0.020]) and performed slightly better than the best scoring fused algorithm EMCEB (BCA = 0.761 [±0.029]; mAUC = 0.866 [±0.020]).<br/>These preliminary results suggest that combining pre-existing AD progression prediction algorithms might provide the increase in performance and generalisability needed to enable clinical translation.

As these dunes function as primary flood defences, intensive research has been conducted into dune erosion in recent years. This research mainly took place in laboratories, because all boundary conditions could be controlled and measurements could take place very accurately. However, it remains difficult to simulate a natural wave climate in a flume. In addition, there is also the risk of forgetting certain (as yet unknown) natural processes. Partly because of this, the demand for accurate field data and field measurement techniques has increased over the years. This thesis proposes a new experimental method to investigate dune erosion in the field, in which a 40 feet open-top shipping container is used as an in-field wave flume. Two containers are placed in between the low- and high waterline of the Sand Engine, near Kijkduin. The experimental method is validated by looking at the hydrodynamics within the container and by comparing dune erosion within this container with dune erosion from existing field and laboratory studies. This validation consists of four experiments in which several research hypotheses are tested to see if the wave propagation and erosion processes inside the containers work as expected. In general, it can be concluded that the experiments carried out inside the containers were in good agreement with the tested theories. These theories included that: the avalanching process is present, higher dunes have a bigger eroded volume, the dune toe follows the rising water level and the slope of the foredune remains similar during the erosion process. As this was the first time this method has been used, some recommendations are made. One of those findings is that the use of the measurement systems should be the same in both containers. A good reason to use this contained erosion method again is for the investigation of the grain size influence in erosion processes.","containers; Fieldwork; Coastal Engineering; Flume experiments; Sand Motor","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/education/student-stories/building-sandcastles-for-your-graduation Student stories","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

A Circular Economy (CE), “restorative by nature” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013, p. 14), could mitigate this crisis; however, implementing circularity principles into the lifecycle is not straightforward for many products, including composites. A snowboard is a typical sports composite; since this sector is severely dependent on the state of the environment, the intention to become more sustainable is increasingly expressed in this industry. However, environmental impact information of possible circularity interventions is lacking; the goal of this research is to bridge this research gap for this and related industries. This is done by identifying circular lifecycle scenarios for 2025 and evaluating these with prospective LCA to answer the following research question: “In what ways could the principles of the circular economy be incorporated into the snowboard lifecycle by design year 2025, and how would this affect the environmental impact?”. This question was answered by conducting a mixed methods review involving statistical analysis, literature review, and expert consultation, followed by a prospective LCA-study. Three plausible circular scenarios were identified: secondhand use, a focus on biobased materials, and a focus on recycling and recyclability. Of these alternatives, the secondhand alternative performed best; the other alternatives performed better in certain impact categories and worse in others. Main contributors to the snowboard environmental impact were materials and production, specifically production electricity; the impact of the use- and distribution phase were limited. However, the research was subject to large uncertainties and data challenges. In conclusion, the holy grail for composite circularity has not been found yet; future research should focus on finding lower impact solutions to ensure effective implementation of the circular economy in this growing industry.","LCA; Ex-Ante; Composite; Snowboard; Sanwich Composite; Winter Sport; Fiber Reinforcement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

One of such datasets is Cobra-Groeninzicht's database of all trees in the Netherlands. In the gaming industry, a new technique is being used to generate tree models: the L-system. An L-system stores a string representation of the structural model of a tree, with the added possibility for recursive modelling using growing rules. This format proves a promising alternative to more traditional methods of storing complex geometries. However, it remains unclear whether it can be an accurate enough representation for modelling and analysing real-life trees.<br/><br/>In this research project, the AdTree algorithm is used to reconstruct a skeleton from a point cloud of a single tree. This skeleton is then transformed to an L-System string format, as well as a CityJSON format (both in JSON structure). The L-system format comes with the advantage that it allows for several methods of increasing its compactness further (growing, generalisation). The overall size of these files also indicates fewer storage space is needed to store the tree geometry. The quality of the L-System skeleton is nearly equal to the input, the skeleton generated by. Assuming it can be read and drawn using a Turtle program, the L-system thus allows for storing the same geometric information more compactly than traditional storage formats, with sufficient accuracy, and the added possibilities of growing or generalising the model.","L-system; Tree; Structural model; Reconstruction; Tree models; LiDAR Points","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","Synthesis Project 2021",""
