An overview of the field, however, has not yet been composed. This makes it difficult for practitioners to identify what is relevant for them, and for researchers to determine interesting angles to explore. To this end we present a literature survey on the field of log analysis. In this survey we outline the different techniques and practices introduced by research in the field. We find that the results of the various works do not lend themselves well to comparison, and suggest future steps of research to overcome this lack of clarity.

(mentor); Schoenmaker, R. (mentor)","2016","Additional thesis - This thesis looks into the use of the Reliability Centred Maintenance in practice, by applying the methodology in a real life case, analysing the maintenance department of the organisation Hidrovía S.A.. Nowadays Hidrovía S.A. is maintaining the aid to navigation of the main river in Argentina, a concession given by the national government of maintaining and dredging more than 1500 km of waterway. The aid to navigation can be divided in roughly three types: buoy, beacon and spar, which they mainly hold up by using corrective maintenance. This could positively be changed by adapting some maintenance strategies. Using a Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Mode Effect Analysis during the RCM process, a few things were noticed; the three types of Aid to Navigation (AtoN) have a lot different sub components in common, the buoy has the highest failure rate and within the buoy there are six critical sub components: the top mark, lantern, battery (case), solar panel, floating system and chain. These six critical sub components could gain more reliability by adapting the maintenance policy: scheduled maintenance of the lantern, battery case and solar panel, redesign of the floating system and a combined strategy (preventive and scheduled maintenance) for the chain. In order to give a real maintenance policy adaptation, unfortunately more information is needed. More research should be done in the possibility of combining the scheduled replacement with the preventive maintenance and the redesigned buoys replacement. Also, the feasibility of the redesignitself should be looked into.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Valstar, E.R. (mentor)","2016","Background: Aseptic loosening [AL] of cementless implants is causing approximately 60% of total knee and total hip arthroplasty revisions. AL is caused among other factors by micromotion. The result is that the bone around the prosthesis is replaced by a fibrous membrane. This fibrous membrane allows for more micromotion and we thus enter a vicious circle of loosening. In-vivo research for treatments of AL and research into preventing AL is rare. When in vivo research is conducted, this is commonly done in large animals such as sheep and dogs. To bring down costs and increase reproducibility it is desired to recreate the fibrous membrane in a smaller animal. Therefore, an unstable knee hemiprosthesis was designed for the femur of the Wistar rat. Methods: First a test was conducted on cadaverous adult male Wistar rat femurs to assess whether it was easier to access the medullary canal of the femur from the hip or the knee side. Then, a second test was conducted on cadaverous rat femurs (n=8) to assess the depth and width to which we could implant a cylindrical prosthesis. The third set of tests was to see if the conceptual unstable prosthesis allowed micromotion of 200 μm. Miniature silicone rubber and polyurethane resin [PUR(r)] springs were tested and a mock implantation in bone surrogate was conducted. Results: The results obtained from the first test show that it is easier to access the medullary canal of the femur from the knee side. The straight canal of the distal femur was also found to be more suitable to allow for micromotion than the curved canal of the proximal femur. The second test showed that we could implant a cylinder with a diameter of 2.3 mm and a length of 2.3 cm in the femoral canal. The third test showed that the conceptual prosthesis allowed for micromotion, but the spring’s material needs to be optimized. PUR(r)’s creep and compression set were too high. Silicone showed the most potential, because of its low compression set (permanent compressive deformation). However, the stiffness of the silicone needs to be increased and it showed high wear during fatigue testing with respect to the PUR(r). Conclusion: The conceptual prosthesis showed promise, but improvements on the spring material are necessary. The silicone can be made stiffer and altering the design can also increase the stiffness of the prosthesis. A flaw in the conceptual design is that micromotion is restricted in vivo, because the femoral prosthesis is abutted by the distal cortical bone. A change in the design of the prosthesis can remedy this problem. Another remaining challenge is to design a prosthesis which allows for localized application of wear debris particles and treatment solutions in the peri-prosthetic tissue, fully simulating the circumstances that occur during AL.","Rat; femur; implant; prosthesis; hemiprosthesis; knee hemiarthroplasty; micromotion; aseptic loosening; osteolysis; in vivo model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

The iron triangle, though not without criticism, is the traditional performance measure of projects and consist of time, cost and quality. Despite well documented reasons in literature why projects fail – and the existence of established project management handbooks – cost and time overruns are not uncommon. The nature of projects is changing: projects are becoming increasingly complex and this increasing complexity is another potential reason for failure of projects. Planning is one of the most important aspects of project management and it considers not only time, but also cost, quality, health, safety, design. Despite the importance of the planning process, the use of sophisticated scheduling software and the increasing interest in project management implementation, projects fail at a substantial rate in planning accuracy and adequate control of planning. The problem is that despite literature mentioning that project complexity influences the planning process and contributes to project failure, there is a lack of research what the influence of project complexity – inclusive of the softer aspects of complexity accepted in more recent publication – is on the planning process of infrastructure projects. Present literature that examines the influence of project complexity on the planning process focus on the quantitate aspects: the numeric optimization of scheduled activity duration. It is analogous to scheduling project buffers as a result of project complexity. This research is initiated on the belief that in order to adapt planning efforts to project complexity, it must be first understood what the effect of project complexity is on the planning process. The objective of this research is identify what the influence of project complexity is on the planning process of infrastructure projects by answering the main research question: “What is the influence of project complexity on the planning process of infrastructure construction projects?”","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Schorsch, J.F. (mentor)","2016","Wearable robotic lifting aids compensate a proportion of the gravity during heavy lifting and can thereby reduce the burden on the operator’s musculoskeletal system. This study investigates the effect of errors in the compensation force of an inaccurate load compensation system on fast reaching movements of an operator. In an experimental study, subjects (n=18) held a 2.7 [kg] object while connected to a haptic manipulator that largely compensated the load by a constant force of 23 [N]. Subjects were are asked to perform elbow-flexion movements against gravity towards a target, either 30 or 50° away in a Fitts’ like task. The experiment consisted of two parts: In Part A the independent measure was a noise over the compensation force (a filtered Gaussian white noise with variances of either 1 or 1.5 [N], over a set of trials). In Part B an estimation error was added as a second independent measure (a sudden overestimate or underestimate of the compensation force of 5 [N] added as a step in the middle of catch trials). Dependent metrics used are the rise time, settling time, first peak error and the agonist-antagonist muscle co-activation. It was hypothesized that subjects would show increased settling times for both error types. In Part A it was further hypothesized that subjects would react to the noise by intentionally moving slower (increased rise time) and by stiffening their limb (increased agonist-antagonist muscle co-activation). As hypothesized, the results showed that the settling time significantly increased for both the added noise and the sudden estimation error. Interestingly, contrary to what was hypothesized, the results of Part A generally did not show an increase in rise time and overall a lower muscle activity with noise of both muscles of the agonist-antagonist pair. From these results, it can be concluded that noise and estimation errors lead to longer movement times during fast goal-directed elbow flexion. Contrary to what current literature suggests, a reasonable amount of noise over the compensation force even seemed to cause subjects reducing the amount of co-activation. Apparently unpredictabilities like noise not always cause an increase of co-activation, and it can be concluded that more research is needed on what exactly makes humans choose their limb-impedance strategy in practical situations.","Load compensation; human movement control; force noise; estimation error","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Design","","","",""

Two methods have been identified to improve the disturbance rejection performance of the MAV: incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion and phase-advanced pitch probes. Incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion uses the angular acceleration measurements to counteract disturbances. Multihole pressure probes measure the incoming flow angle and velocity ahead of the wing in order to react to gusts before an inertial response has occurred. The performance of incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion is compared to a traditional proportional integral derivative controller with and without the multihole pressure probes. The attitude controllers are tested by performing autonomous wind tunnel flights and stability augmented outdoor flights.

(mentor); HosseinNia, H. (mentor)","2016","Driven by the rise of market demand and development of technology, high-precision motion systems must meet the increasing accuracy requirement. Currently, High-precision positioning stage is widely used in many different application areas, such as hard disk drives, wafer steppers and electron and atomic force microscopes for nano-scale imaging. Classical PID control which occupied 95% of precision mechanical industry is no longer sufficient to satisfy the future demand for higher accuracy and performance. Therefore, the application of advanced control method on positioning stage to improve the system performance and tracking accuracy is of great importance for both academia and industry. The challenge for the control of positioning stage lies in the strong nonlinearity such as friction or hysteresis and difficulty in modeling and identification. A novel model-free control method which has strong ability in handling nonlinearities is applied to the nano-positioning stage. This method has relatively low computational load and does not need a model. The experimental validation shows the average tracking error of model-free control reduces by 83.5% as compared with PID for the ramp tracking with maximum 50nm/s. Both the numerical simulation and experiment results show its superiority in coping with nonlinearities and disturbance rejection. For the sake of comparison, another control method called active disturbance rejection control which has a similar structure as model-free control is also developed and applied to the positioning stage. In terms of the drawbacks of the current model-free control method, some modifications, such as the higher order derivative estimator, the new model estimation method and nonlinear tracking differentiator, are successively applied to model-free control method to improve the tracking performance. Besides, as positioning stage often executes repetitive tasks, iterative learning control is added to compensate for repetitive error and disturbances. Moreover, a feedforward model which can predict the required force for pre-sliding motion is added to cancel the nonlinear pre-sliding friction and reduce the control effort. The numerical simulation and experiment validations illustrate, with this simple control structure, the excellent tracking accuracy and insensitivity to disturbance are ensured.","tracking accuracy; Positioning stage; Motion control; Model-free control; nonlinear control; Iterative learning control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The environmental pollution and depleting fossil fuels have been considered as a critical issue all over the world. Many efforts have been devoted to investigating alternative fuels to tackle these problems. Alcohol fuels are potential candidates to alternative energy as it can mitigate pollutant emission. In addition, alcohol fuels can be applied to current diesel engines with technical modifications. This thesis mainly focuses on the effects of methanol fuel on in-cylinder process in premixed dual fuel engine. Different fuel ratios were tested to investigate the effects of methanol fuel. Existing diesel engine models, which have been developed by TU delft, were used to conduct computer simulations. To describe dual fuel combustion, separated vibe functions were adopted in the existing models. The simulation results indicated that the cooling effect caused by high heat of evaporation of methanol affected in-cylinder processes. With increase of methanol injection, start of ignition delayed due to the cooling effect. The longer ignition delay improved premixing of pilot fuel and it led to higher heat release rates. In case of maximum temperature, it was affected by both the cooling effects and diesel injection timing. With advanced diesel injection timing (-5.5 TDC), maximum temperature of dual fuel mode was higher than only diesel mode due to strong premixed combustion. Due to the lower LHV of methanol fuel, brake specific fuel consumption became higher with increase of methanol injection. Brake thermal efficiency decreased with increase of methanol injection due to lower combustion efficiency. The current models are not able to differentiate different combustion durations for diesel and methanol fuels. Further developments of the models are recommended to increase simulation accuracy. Furthermore, simulation on different diesel injection timing is recommended to better understand methanol combustion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Mechanical engineering / Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","",""

Assessing the performance of a building heating system with energy analysis has limitations regarding the implementation of sustainable heat, because energy analysis only takes into account the quantity of energy. Exergy analysis allows a better evaluation of a system’s performance as it also takes into account the quality of an amount of energy. A dynamic model of the heating system of Louis DavidsCarré (LDC2) has been developed and calibrated in the new simulation software: ‘CHESS’. The model is controlled by the smart thermal energy control ‘HeatMatcher’. The model is well able to capture the dynamic behavior of the complex heating system. The time scales of the dynamics as well as the temperatures and mass flows in the system resemble those of a realistic building heating system and show good comparison with the measurements from LDC2. A week in winter, spring and summer have been simulated. The results of the simulations are used for (dynamic) exergy analysis. The exergetic performance of the heating system with HeatMatcher control has been assessed. The results substantiate the importance of exergy analysis in analyzing the performance of heating systems, as energy efficiencies are between 89% and 95%, whereas exergy efficiencies are between 19% and 29%. Furthermore, opportunities for the optimization of the exergetic performance of the system, as well as for the further development of the simulation software CHESS, were identified.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Zwaag, S. (mentor)","2016","Aluminium AA2024-T3 is a high strength aluminiumalloy widely used in aerospace. The strengthening copper-rich intermetallic phases, however, make the material very susceptible to aqueous corrosion and severe pitting. To protect the metal, coatings loaded with corrosion inhibitors are typically used. Traditionally, highly efficient CrVI-based inhibitors have been used but these are soon to be banned due to their high genotoxicity. The use of alternative environmentally friendly inhibitors is commonly bound to the problem of incompatibility with the organic coating matrix. As a solution to reduce unwanted inhibitor-matrix reactions and to control the inhibitor release extensive research has been devoted to the development of responsive inhibitor nanocarriers. These carriers are, however, limited in the amount of inhibitor they can store thereby having a narrowpotential for long-term protection at damage sites such as scratches or cracks. Alternative concepts are therefore needed. This work explores for the first time the use of responsive electrospun polymeric nanofibers loaded with corrosion inhibitors as an efficient carrier system for long termprotection of relatively big damages in coated AA2024 structures. For the proof of concept explored in this work, water soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) fibres loaded with up to 10 wt% CeCl3 were successfully electrospun. To control the inhibitor release the PVA fibres were crosslinked at different degrees by glutaraldehyde. The influence of fibre chemistry and inhibitor loading on the release kinetics of the loaded fibre mats was investigated via in-situ UV/VIS spectroscopy. Loaded fibremats were successfully incorporated in a protective epoxy/amine coating system varying the position of the inhibiting mat within the coating with respect to the substrate. Insitu opto-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the long-term, protective, self-healing behaviour of the prepared coating systems after damage. Protection up to 4 weeks was achieved for several coating compositions with different fibre chemistries and corrosion inhibitors. This research opens the path for the development of sophisticated, tailored and highly efficient inhibitor delivery systems for the protection of metal structures at large damages for long immersion times.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-22","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Novel Aerospace Materials","",""

Material from the same drillcores has been analyzed geochemically by Barrick. The results of the geochemical analysis provide information which include the gold grade, gold recovery and arsenic content. This information is taken at approximately the same depths as the image samples are retrieved from, creating 628 geochemical measurement locations. The research focuses on comparing the image data and the corresponding geochemical data. In order to understand the geological history of the deposit, literature was used to describe and assess the deposit. The deposit at Cortez is a Carlin-Type deposit. Carlin-Type deposits are characterized by extremely fine-grained disseminated gold hosted primarily by arsenian pyrite. Carlin type deposits are dated as Eocene age, more specifically, the mineralization at Cortez is dated at 34 Ma. The Cortez Hills deposit consists of disseminated gold particles in highly altered calcareous host rocks. Because of the the complexity of its geological history, the appearance of the samples varies and this variation is possibly linked with the gold mineralization.The geochemical data is used to replicate the classification of ore types known at Cortez: Refractory ore (Autoclave ore & Roaster ore), Oxide ore (Mill Oxide ore & Leach Oxide ore) and Waste. The Refractory ore is defined as material with a gold grade higher than 4.69 ppm and a gold recovery lower than 0.7. Autoclave ore has an arsenic content of more than 1200 ppm, and below that value the refractory ore is called Roaster ore. Oxide ore is defined as material with a gold grade higher than 0.125 ppm and a gold recovery higher than 0.7. Mill oxide ore is high grade ore (>4.69 ppm Au) and Leach oxide ore is medium grade ore (<4.69 ppm Au). The other material is called waste. This research aims to distinguish these 5 ore types (Autoclave, Roaster, Mill, Leach and Waste) by the image data. The image data was analyzed and compared to these ore types using color based parameters and textural parameters both defined in Matlab. 19 Color based parameters were created based on RGB and HSV values. 28 Textural parameters are obtained using functions from the image Processing Toolbox of Matlab. All parameters are compared with the different ore types. Of all color based and textural parameters, the average blue intensity parameter is the best for separating ore and waste: Half of the samples below a blue intensity of 0.3 are classified as ore, and above this threshold 89.7% was classified as waste. Another parameter was defined as the percentage of pixels with a red intensity 0.05 higher than both the green and blue intensity. This parameter distinguishes the oxide ore samples, since they have a higher percentage for the parameter than the refractory ore samples. 7 Color based parameters were used to create a classification tree model. This model classifies the samples into 8 different visual appearances: Black, Dark, Dark&White, White, Red, Dark&Red, Pink and Grey. These classes are compared to the different ore types, in order to investigate the relations between the appearance classes and the ore types. The results of this model indicate that the classes have relations with the ore types: 63%of the classes Red and Dark&Red are oxide ore samples (Leach and Mill), 82% of the samples with a Black class are Refractory ore samples (Autoclave and Roaster) and the classes Dark&White, Pink, Grey and White comprise 54% of the data set and consist for 86.7% out of Waste.The color based parameters and textural parameters are also put in one matrix making a data matrix used for PCA and PLS-DA models. The scores and responses of these models are again compared to the 5 ore types. PLS-DA proved to be the best method in separating oxide ore, refractory ore and waste based on a set of 47 image data variables. By combining multiple PLS-DA models, 87.2% of the data set is classified in three groups, Refractory, Oxide and Waste, with an accuracy of 75.8%. The research showed relations between RGB image data and both gold presence and gold recovery and therefore as well between RGB image data and the types refractory, oxide and waste. In ore sorting applications, this could not only mean a significant decrease in the volume of the feed, but also a valuable addition to blending purposes. Because of the relations found between image data and gold content, the Cortez Hills underground mine and other Carlin-type mines in the area may show potential for implementation of sensor based sorting in the processing operation at the mine.","Sensor Based Sorting; Image Analysis; Carlin-Type Gold Deposits; Cortez Mine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Low loading of diesel generators is considered to be a major problem for all-electric offshore vessels performing DP-operations. Low loading, often caused by system dimensioning for peak conditions and high redundancy requirements, leads to increased engine wear, fuel consumption and emissions. In this research, a Royal IHC designed DP2 class flexlay vessel for which low load problems have been experienced, is considered. The research objective is to develop a system that allows optimal use of diesel generators with respect to engine wear, fuel consumption and emissions, while guaranteeing system safety. A full year wind speed time distribution of North sea measurements is used to define the environmental conditions. Thruster load is calculated from the environmental conditions, after which 440 V load and missions load are added to acquire the total load. Five concept system configurations, which are variations on the benchmark configuration, are proposed. The applied variations include differently sized diesel generators to increase utilization flexibility, and introducing batteries in the system as spinning reserve and to stabilize load on the diesel generators. Based on static performance analysis, for which a simplified version of the load profile is used, two concepts with the most potential for performance improvement are chosen. The performance of these concepts is further examined by simulating pipelay operations in the time domain. Simulations are performed with a Simulink model, of which two versions are composed. With the model containing the highest degree of complexity, the comprehensive model, system safety related parameters voltage drop and frequency drop can be assessed. Additionally, a simplified version of the power system model, capable of doing fast simulations, is constructed for examining system performance with respect to engine wear, fuel consumption and emissions. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that with a power configuration containing differently sized diesel generators and batteries, a significant performance enhancement can be achieved. Compared to the benchmark configuration, fuel consumption and emissions can be considerably reduced. Also, a reduction in engine wear is predicted due to higher engine ratings in combination with lower load variations and engine hours. The payback period of the additional investment made for integrating batteries is 12.4 months. For all configurations, simulated voltage drop and frequency drop are within defined class limits.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Mechanical engineering, track: Transport engineering, specialisation: Mechanical systems and Integration","SDPO.16.034.m",""

The analysis is, therefore commonly performed in the time domain, resulting in a time consuming and computationally demanding optimization process. In order to reduce the computational cost, an optimization approach using the principle of decomposition can be utilized. Here, it is assumed that when changing dimensions of a structural members, sectional response forces and moments remain constant. This assumption is made for both the actual changed member and for all other members of the structure. Additionally, this is assumed to be valid for a simultaneous change of all members all over the structure. It is the so-called local optimization approach and allows for an individual (local) optimization of each member of the structure. The objective of this thesis is the development of a gradient based optimization framework for the local optimization of structural members of an offshore wind turbine with jacket support structure and the implementation of an algorithm using the principle of decomposition. The development of the gradient based method for the local optimization necessitate the study of changes in global performance when modifying structural members locally and a method to receive these sensitivities in structural performance elementwise. Thereafter, the algorithms were used with the local optimization approach. The implementation was carried out using customized Matlab scripts for the automated load analysis with the finite element solver Fedem WindPower. The UpWind reference jacket used within the OC4-project and the generic NREL 5MW turbine atop were used as the case study for this work. In addition, as the objective function for the optimization process, a cost model that considers both manufacturing and material costs was developed. Finally the evaluation of the speed and the accuracy of the methods proposed is presented and the efficiency of the method is proved.","structural optimization; sensitivity analysis; jacket support structure; local approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jellema, A.H. (mentor)","2016","Over the last ten years, various products have been introduced with which consumers can analyze or even modify the activity of their brains. When it comes to the design of these neurotechnological headgears, there are contradictory requirements between the functionality, fit and experience. As a result, current devices are generally either oversimplified in their capabilities, or limited in their comfort, accuracy or quality of the interaction. This report describes the development of a novel headgear design that addresses this compromise and aims to offer a better balance between these three properties through the introduction of modularity. At first a better understanding of the technological possibilities is created through literature research. Three technologies are selected for implementation in the headgear: EEG, fNIRS and tES. Relevant anthropometric data are thereafter collected and requirements are formulated regarding ea. the target range of head shapes and the accuracy (‘technical fit’) of the product placement. Key application scenarios are then selected for which the modular product cab be most valuable. These scenarios are used to formulate requirements from different users and contexts. The selection focusses on the at home neurorehabilitation after brain trauma, on ‘neurofeedback’ training and on general cognitive enhancements. This preparatory phase sets the stage for an iterative creative process in which the main contradictions in the assignment are tackled. The final design comes about in a three-step manner. First there is a focus on the basic modular structuring of the components. Next the concept is further elaborated upon in terms of form and interaction, and later in detailed solutions, materials and production. The result of this project is a design that goes by the name Nerva headgear. It is an adaptable frame that can be used to place the various technical tools on the different target locations on the scalp. The frame is built up of elements that can be re-configured. The necessary electronics can be connected to the structure. In this way the product can be adapted for different applications, users and usage contexts. It can be set up to target only the areas of interest and using only necessary technological tools on the scalp. By extending or rotating some of the key components of the headgear, the product can be adapted for users with different head shapes and sizes. Furthermore, it is possible to regulate the pressure that is exerted on the scalp. This allows to optimize the comfort and the signal stability during use. A prototype is developed and put to test to assess the performance of the design on the aspects functionality, fit and experience. The evaluation shows many points for further improvement, but the concept remains intact. The important features of the product have proven to be feasible and the practical potential is affirmed. The adaptability for different head shapes was found successful (though various adjustments are suggested) and it is believed that the design can potentially outperform alternatives in its technical fit. The overall user experience has remained generally positive, especially on its hedonic qualities. A study with a more representative user group should be performed in the future to assess the true pragmatic qualities of the design.","Neurotechnology; headgear; modularity; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

These oscillations show the rotating behaviour of Envisat, and can be translated to its rotational state by re-producing this signal using a corresponding attitudemodel and the offset between the reflector and the center-of-mass.

(mentor)","2016","• In the planning of new wells, typically the same trajectory is used for conventional wells and wells with smart completions. This study demonstrates that the economically optimized trajectory for smart and conventional wells can be very different. Two new well trajectory optimization algorithms were developed using Stochastic Pattern Search (SPS) principles. In both algorithms random perturbations are made starting from an initial well trajectory, which are sent to a reservoir simulator whereafter the perturbation with the highest Net Present Value (NPV) is selected. New perturbations of the selected well trajectory are made and simulated to, again, select the highest NPV. This process is repeated until a certain stopping criteria is met. The two methods differ in the selection of the perturbations used to initiate the new iteration. In the SPS1 method every subsequent iteration starts from the perturbation with the highest NPV which may be the starting well from the previous iteration. In the SPS2 method the starting well from the previous iteration is excluded. This does not allow the SPS2 method to converge, but it avoids one of the main risks of the SPS1 method, i.e. that the optimization remains stuck in a local optimum. To demonstrate the difference between the optimal well trajectory of well with a conventional and smart completion, both the SPS1 and SPS2 method were evaluated using a realistic, but slightly simplified reservoir model. Both methods were able to optimize the trajectory for both conventional and smart completions. The SPS1 method quickly converged to a local optimum, whilst the SPS2 method was able to determine a trajectory with a significantly higher NPV for both the conventional and smart wells. Moreover, the optimal well trajectory with the smart completion, as found by the SPS2 algorithm, had a NPV that was 40% higher than the optimal trajectory for the conventional completion. It can therefore be concluded that when smart completions are assessed, well trajectory optimization can have very significant value impact and may be crucial in evaluating the full potential of the completion. Furthermore it was shown that, for the example considered, the SPS2 procedure is a good method for well trajectory optimization in a three-dimensional reservoir and although more testing is needed it is believed that is has potential to work with any type of completion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis is part of the research on the thermodynamic properties of thorium salt and aims to provide a C++11 code to simulate fuel salt flow at various temperatures around a settling sphere and inside a container. This thesis should form the basis of a C++11 implementation on fuel salt flow in the Molten Salt Fast Reactor using the Lattice Boltzmann Method. The research into the thermodynamic properties of the thorium fuel salt is necessary in the research and development of new Generation IV Molten Salt Fast Reactors. The simulation uses the Lattice Boltzmann Method in the C++11 code language and the Palabos open-source library which are introduced in chapter 1. The governing equations in this simulation are the dynamics of the sphere, the Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) and the boundary method equations as presented in chapter 2. The boundary condition chosen for this thesis is the Guo extrapolation method with the Inamuro iteration to determine the fluid force and torque on the sphere. These models were chosen since they existed in the Palabos library and were used in 3D moving wall examples. Since there was no documentation available from Palabos on the off-lattice 3D methods, building the model proved to be time consuming and was a trial and error process. The resulting code as shown by chapter 3 is still a work in progress. The challenge was to combine both a settling sphere or in other words a moving wall with fluid wall interactions, in 3D and inside an enclosed container (hence no infinite flow in any direction and a second boundary). Due to the complex nature of the problem and the lack of documentation, time ran out before results could be obtained. If the model would have generated results these would have needed to be verified and validated as presented by chapter 4. The intended simulation presented in chapter 5 was a settling sphere inside a cylindrical container with simulations for varying temperatures and Reynolds numbers. As stated earlier the model did not obtain results but the project did as stated in chapter 6, namely a good understanding of modelling fuels salts with C++ and the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) Palabos library is obtained. Therefore in chapter 7 it is recommended: to either update the palabos library and expand the documentation, resulting in a library owned and maintained by Delft University of Technology for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) in C++, or choose a different library entirely. Any such library should make the most of the advantage that the LBM has, namely that it is a very parallel method. Proper documentation and coding standards should be implemented keeping the library readable and understandable. Hence the conclusion in chapter 8 is that the Palabos library might prove a good solution in the future if modified and documented. More research on different boundary conditions and their performance is required. More research is also required on the performance of the Palabos library compared to other libraries. Finally a performance analysis for hardware and parallelisation methods would be required to make a decision on improvements in that department.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-21","Applied Sciences","RST/Radiation, Science and Technology","","Physics of Nuclear Reactors","",""

Regarding previous Apache flight controller designs with limited control authorities, oscillations were severe due to the effect of a high bandwidth nonlinear flight controller on the main rotor dynamics. A significant improvement is found by implementing an inner control loop which regulates the disk flapping angles of the main rotor. A translational rate and attitude command controllers are provided through a system of cascaded outer-loops. A position hold and sideslip controllers are implemented as well to complement this nonlinear closed-loop system. Offline simulations are performed in Simulink to validate the capabilities of this control system. An initial piloted experiment is performed with a professional Apache test pilot to assess the handling quality levels on the SIMONA Research Simulator.

(mentor)","2016","The use of detailed numerical simulations for practical applications or in the study of complex flow phenomenon is limited by the computational cost. Over the last two decades, reduced order models (ROMs) have become a viable alternative on account of their low computational cost. ROMs capture only the essential dynamics of interest rather than resolving all the quantities in the flow. Several techniques have been proposed recently to construct ROMs based on the Galerkin projection. However, these techniques are limited in their ability to model the flow as they can only represent specific quantities of interest. In the recent past, a goal-oriented reduced order model (GOROM) has been proposed. The GOROM provides the user the ability to define the optimality constraint to model the flow phenomenon of interest. The GOROM is constructed by solving a goal-oriented optimization problem. The GOROM models the flow phenomenon of interest by projecting the governing equations onto a subspace spanned by a set of optimal basis functions. These optimal basis functions are constructed from a secondary set of basis functions by solving the optimization problem. In the previous work, the goal-oriented optimization problem was defined by developing the semi-continuous formulation (SCF). In this work, the SCF is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The GOROM is constructed by solving the optimization problem using the inexact-Newton trust-region algorithm. This is first demonstrated by constructing the GOROM for the Burgers equation. This is followed by the construction of the GOROM for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The application of the GOROM is demonstrated by modeling the flow for a set of 1D problems. Additionally, the scaling of the computational cost of the construction and application of the GOROM has been investigated.","goal-oriented; variational multi-scale; reduced-order model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

Comprehensive training programs are required to prepare (novice) pilots for this last phase of flight, and facilitate the development of robust manual flying skills. Various non-aviation studies have shown that using augmented reality in training environments to provide additional insight in the training of specific events or maneuvers, can lead to increased performance during training. However, relatively little is known regarding the effects of visually augmented reality to enhance (novice) pilot training. A quasi-transfer-of-training experiment with 24 novice participants was conducted in the SIMONA Research Simulator to investigate the effect of two augmented reality flare displays on the performance of the manual landing flare. Three groups, of 8 participants each, were asked to perform a final approach and flare maneuver in a Cessna Citation I model. Group 1 trained without visually augmented cues, group 2 trained using an augmented reality display emphasizing naturally present visual cues used throughout the flare maneuver, while group 3 was trained using an augmented reality display providing visual situational-guidance augmentation for the flare maneuver. Training was followed by a two-step evaluation phase where all groups used the non-augmented display. Results of the experiment show that situational-guidance augmentation presented in the context of the landing flare can be beneficial to train novice participants towards a specific standard framework, achieving slightly better performance during approach, on touchdown location, as well as consistency in the throttle closing altitude. No augmentation dependency was found during the two-step evaluation phase for either of the augmented groups, indicating generalizability of the trained skills.","augmented reality; pilot training; transfer-of-training; flare; display design; SIMONA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Control and Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2016","Micro turbines are miniaturised gas turbines and have the potential to be effectively used in combined heat and power (CHP) applications due to their advantages over reciprocating engines. Micro Turbine Technology B.V. is developing a 3kW recuperated micro turbine for a micro-CHP application and is currently looking for ways to improve the efficiency of the system. At present, off-the-shelf turbocharger components are used to reduce costs and there is a scope for improvement by shifting to a bespoke design. With the reduction in the size of the turbine, the volume-to-surface ratio decreases and hence the heat transfer effects become important. The decrease in performance due to thermal losses needs to be evaluated in order to make an accurate prediction of the efficiency of the turbine. In this thesis, a numerical model is developed for estimating the heat lost to the environment and to the bearing housing using a lumped analysis method. This is coupled to a CFD simulation of the volute and the rotor to provide a diabatic boundary condition for the solver. The results from the thermal loss model are compared with existing data from MTT and it was found that the model can predict the thermal losses with good accuracy. To improve the efficiency of the rotor, a 3-D shape optimisation is performed using the tools in ANSYS suite. To ensure that the new design can be directly used in the system, system-level parameters like shaft speed and mass flow rate are constrained. The important geometric parameters are parametrised and a response surface optimisation is set-up. A lower-order model of the design space is built and due to the large number of input parameters, a significant number of refinement points are added to ensure good accuracy of the response surface. In the next stage, a two-step optimisation is executed. Gradient based optimisers are computationally less expensive, but are prone to converging at local optimum values. This drawback can be overcome using evolutionary algorithms, but they require more computational time to converge. Therefore, an evolutionary algorithm with a relatively relaxed constraint is used to identify the location of the global optimum and a gradient-based search is performed in this confined design space to accurately identify the optimum design point. The influence of thermal losses in determining the optimised design is also evaluated. From the results, it was seen that the optimum point does not change significantly when the thermal losses are included and hence it can be inferred that the thermal loss evaluation can be decoupled from the optimisation process. An improvement of 2.17 percentage points in efficiency is achieved through the optimisation while respecting the mass flow rate constraint and also imposing a limit on the leading edge hub radius to ensure the stresses do not exceed permissible levels. However, when the limit on the leading edge radius is removed, the efficiency increased by 5.36 percentage points. Based on a detailed study of the optimised geometries, it was seen that the blade angle distribution and the leading edge hub radius are the most important parameters influencing the efficiency of the rotor. The blade widths at the inlet and exit can be used to control the mass flow rate in the system and compensate for any change in mass flow rate that is caused due to the variation of the other parameters. The influence of the trailing edge sweep on the efficiency is also studied and it was seen that effect of the sweep angle is strongly influenced by the shroud blade angle distribution. The future work based on this thesis can be directed towards including a structural solver inside the optimisation loop to ensure that the optimiser also consider the stress constraints that need to be satisfied for a feasible design. Also, it was clear that the inflow angles are not at the optimum value and hence a re-design of the volute is suggested to reduce the incidence losses.","CFD; micro turbine; thermal losses; optimisation; lumped analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Pipelines with multiphase flow of gas, oil, and water are commonly used in the oil and gas industry. In the presence of offshore platforms or vessels, the pipeline ends with a vertical riser. A possible new concept is to use a single large diameter pipeline along the sea floor that ends into multiple smaller diameter risers. This concept might be of interest for future Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) vessels. This report focusses on detailed numerical simulations for a small scale representation of this industrial flow splitting configuration: a two-phase flow of air and water though a 0.5 [m] long, 0.05 [m] diameter, horizontal pipe with a T-junction to a dual 2.5 [m] high, 0.05 [m] diameter riser system. A comparison has been made between two multiphase flow solvers available in the well-known open-source code OpenFOAM. The interFoam solver utilises a mixture model formulation, while the multiphase- EulerFoam solver uses an Euler-Euler (two continua) formulation for both fluids. Both solvers use Volume of Fluid as interface sharpening method to solve the equations for incompressible flow. Air and water are flowing into the domain with a total volumetric flow rate of 64.2 [m^3/h]. The volumetric flow rate of water in the simulations is taken as 1, 2 and 3 [m^3/h]. Furthermore, a pressure difference between the outlets of the dual risers is applied. This is meant to analyse the difference between solutions of both solvers with respect to maldistribution between the two risers, pressure loss and liquid hold-up. The Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operator (PISO) algorithm with two corrector loops is used combined with a low Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition of 0.25 to obtain sufficient numerical stability. Second order discretisation schemes in space and a first order scheme in time are used. In order to speed up the calculations Geometric Algebraic Multigrid is used to solve the pressure field. Meshing of the domains is done with snappyHexMesh. Three T-junction meshes are generated with increasing fineness of 23042, 47544 and 95292 cells. Two riser meshes are made with 67720 and 276784 cells. The Large Eddy Simulation turbulence model is used with the Smagorinksy Sub-Grid Scale model. The fixed flow rates at the inlet are coupled with a variable pressure. At the outlets the outflow velocity is variable with a fixed pressure. The turbulent viscosity at the wall is governed by wall functions. The calculations are done on the hpc12 cluster at Delft University of Technology. The calculation times are in the order of one to three weeks for a typical simulation. Overall, differences between the production at the outlets of interFoam and multiphaseEulerFoam are small. Solutions from both solvers indicate that the influence of a pressure difference over the outlets has more influence on the non-symmetric production of air than of water. The results from multiphaseEulerFoam look promising and due to its Euler-Euler momentum description it shows realistic flow behaviour in the junction. Improvements in simulating the system can be made by progressing the simulations longer in time, by increasing the entrance length of the horizontal pipe towards the junction and by choosing another Sub-Grid Scale model.","CFD; pipe flow; multiphase flow; LES; OpenFOAM; interFoam; multiphaseEulerFoam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Aerodynamics","",""

It is based upon three main pillars: an observational study, a stress study and a future vision. During the observations, the boarding speed was reduced by passengers blocking the seat row or the aisle. Solutions could be found in three different directions: adaping the interior, the logistics, and/or influencing the psychological aspect off te boarding process. The stress study showed that there are fluctuations in the stress level during the travel process from home to destination. In the boarding and pre-boarding moments high stress levels could be found. With the Vision in Product Design (VIP) method a future context was shaped, a mission for the new design was designed and after that the desired interaction was created in order to come to a new concept. This formed the framework for design directions. Sub concepts were chosen and developed into a design concept; a boarding system where the passenger connects with the airport and seat wich contains a personal storage area. Checkpoints reassure the passenger with the final checkpoint being the seat. When the passenger gets close to the seat, a spot light above the seat starts to shine on the seat. On top of that the seat has a personal luggage spot underneath the seat pan for small luggage.

Current research, though, is still mainly focused on the printing of structural components. In the future there will be a need for smart materials to come to fully integrated components. These smart materials include sensor materials, actuators and othermultifunctional materials. In this thesis a fully dense, biphasic, lead-free piezoelectric composite sensor of randomly oriented and low volume fraction filler was 3D printed in a reproducible manner. The influence of both nozzle size and temperature settings on producing a fully dense disk sample has been investigated by microstructural analysis on the cross sections of randomly oriented printed piezoelectric composites of multiple compositions. In addition there is a clear link between the printing settings of layer height and the infill density with the dielectric constant of the printed sample disk. Moreover, a proportional relationship between piezoelectric charge constant and poling temperatures was indicated. For the in-situ fabrication of structured piezoelectric composites of 1-3 connectivity, a concept design was proposed and developed. Through both an experimental and theoretical approach, a parametric analysis of all the major settings that influence performance of the in-situ concept design, was conducted. The analysis indicated that the parameters of printing speed, length between the two electrodes and temperature, influence both the exposure time and the viscosity of the composite filament inside the setup and, thus, affecting the degree of particle chain alignment. Based on this analysis, recommendations on the settings variation, as well as, a possible alterations of the setup’s configuration were proposed.","piezoelectric composite sensor; additive manufacturing; fused deposition modeling; FDM; DEP; structured piezoelectric composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-20","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

(mentor); Antonakas, P. (mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor)","2016","The Smit sawing wire system was used in the salvage operation of the Baltic Ace. The sawing wire was drilled underneath the wreck and connected to two barges on opposite sides. Winches were placed on the barges to make a controlled cut through the wreck by pulling the sawing wire back and forth. The cut was made in an upward direction. While the sawing wire was pulled in by one winch, the winch on the other side kept a holding tension on the sawing wire to create a normal force in the wreck. This normal force was necessary to make the cut through abrasive wear. To get a better insight into the forces experienced in the sawing wire system, measurements were conducted during the cutting operations. The objective of this research project is to contribute to the assessment of the sawing wire system, by providing a simulation model based on theory and compare this with measurements of the salvage operation of the Baltic Ace. The measurements show a peak tension at the beginning of the sawing cycle that was not expected in calculations made prior to the operation. In friction theory, this is called the breakaway force that is needed to get the sawing wire moving. The breakaway force is caused by the difference in static and kinetic friction coefﬁcients between the sawing wire and the wreck. The simulation model is made in Orcaﬂex and includes the friction at the contact points, barge movement, and the heave compensators. The friction is included by a Coulomb friction model for the kinetic friction, a tension for the breakaway force and a stick-slip damper for the intermittent motion of the wire. The heave compensator stroke is controlled by a code in python that measures the sawing wire angle and the heave motion of the barges at the fairlead position. The barge motions were included by force-RAO’s, calculated in AQWA. The wave environmental forces are simulated using a JONSWAP spectrum with the wave height and period similar to those during the sawing operation. After completion of the model, the results were compared with the measurements. The tension graph of the model has similar peak forces at the beginning of the cycle (ﬁrst 10s.) and similar lower force ﬂuctuations in the constant part (10-50 s.).

(mentor)","2016","The future depletion of conventional fossil fuel reserves, the ever increasing need for energy self – reliance and the global concern around environmental change caused by their use, have made heat and power generation from alternative and sustainable sources a primary research focus worldwide. Biomass is such a source, constituting a clean and renewable fuel, while being the third fuel resource in the world after coal and oil in terms of abundance. Through thermochemical processes biomass can be employed for energy, chemicals and transport fuel production. Pyrolysis is the thermochemical process of biomass decomposition into various useful products in the absence of an oxidation medium. Torrefaction is a mild pyrolysis process, typically carried out in a temperature range between 230oC and 300oC. This pretreatment process offers benefits with respect to biomasses energy density, while reducing the oxygen and hydrogen to carbon ratios and its hygroscopic nature. In this work untreated and torrefied biomass species were pyrolysed under different final temperatures in a Pyroprobe 5200 reactor. In particular, raw and torrefied (at 250oC and 265oC) wood ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and raw and torrefied (at 300oC) Torrcoal, which consists of mixed wood residues, were investigated. The feed was reduced to a particle size less than 75 μm and the experiments were performed with a sample size of 30 mg in the temperature range of 600oC to 1000oC at a heating rate of 600oC/s, in order to achieve fast pyrolysis conditions. The main purpose of these experiments was to determine the effect of final pyrolysis temperature and torrefaction to the yield and nature of pyrolysis final products. In terms of individual gases, CO, CO2, CH4 and H2 were identified using a micro GC. Tar compounds (phenol and PAHs) were identified and quantified using a HPLC system. The aforementioned experiments produced mass closure values between 65% and 84%, which can be considered as satisfactory due to the difficulties in measuring gravimetrically pyrolytic water, higher hydrocarbon gases and light tar compounds. Increasing pyrolysis temperatures had a negative effect on char yield, however above 800oC it appeared to stabilize. Maximum values of the liquid yield were obtained at 600oC and 700oC before attaining a decreasing trend for the ash materials and stabilizing for Torrcoal materials at 900oC. Gas yields increased until 900oC for Torrcoal species and ash torrefied at 265, but for the rest species the increase continued until 1000oC. CO was the major gas produced above 800oC overtaking CO2 at that temperature, while CH4 and H2 yields became significant above 700oC and 800oC respectively. Torrefaction and increased torrefaction severity led to an increase of the char yield of the pyrolysis process. Their effect on the liquid yield was the opposite. In terms of total gases production the differences were minimal and only noticeable above 800oC. However, the quality of the pyrolysis gas was higher for the torrefied species. Regarding the tar compounds analysis, phenol yield decreased until 800oC before reaching a plateau thereafter. PAH species yield increased steeply between 800oC and 900oC. Their production still increased above that temperature but at a slower rate. Naphthalene was the major PAH produced. Torrefaction seemed to favour phenol production while its effect on PAHs was not significant. Between the two biomass species studied, the higher phenol yield of Torrcoal pyrolysis along with its higher char and lower liquid yield are indicative of higher lignin content for this biomass.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The Hightech Groundfridge project was initiated with the goal to research the functioning of the Groundfridge as produced by Weltevree and design a new version with climate control that is in line with the product identity of the current Groundfridge. The need for climate control has been envisioned by Weltevree as a means to give users more control over the storage climate and improve the storage conditions. Research determined that the temperature within the Groundfridge was suitable for storage of various goods but much less constant than expected, with yearly fluctuations in temperature which makes constant storage challenging and the suitability for certain goods less predictable. It also turned out that the temperature of the surrounding ground has a vast influence on the inside temperature, making climate control harder and especially difficult when electricity has to be produced off-grid. From the research into various climate control technologies and techniques, the vision emerged that not active climate control but more stability of the Groundfridge climate would have the highest benefit for users. Well-timed ventilation and monitoring of the Groundfridge was chosen to elaborate upon. The final design is an intelligent ventilation product installed in the Groundfridge door that could also be used in other applications. It works autonomously and independent from the electricity grid, and communicates with the user through a smartphone app. Through the use of sensors and user indicated types of stored products, the user gains more control in the storage conditions of their goods for a relatively low increase in Groundfridge price.","Smart ventilation; food storage; root cellar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Flipsen, S.F.J. (mentor)","2016","Currently location trackers for valuables have a short battery life, demanding an intensive battery maintenance experience of the user. Discharged batteries mean a malfunctioning product, resulting in a false sense of security by the user. The incentive of this thesis is to explore the opportunities in energy harvesting technologies, low power electronics and the tracker market, and to consolidate these into a valuable design for a new tracker. With the usage patterns of different valuables as a basis, the power consumption and yield of different applications and configurations are calculated, creating an overview of the feasibility of application fields for trackers. The suitability for low intensity location sharing, the availability of light and moving parts, the high theft rates and the possibility for off-grid storage make bicycles suitable for trackers powered by energy harvested from the environment. Around 400.000 bicycles are stolen in the Netherlands annually, resulting in an acceptance of the inconvenience that disempowers the victims in the event of a theft. Victims show a clear need for acting on theft by consulting their social network. Victims have lost their faith in the solving capability of the police, hence victims without a bicycle insurance plan tend not to register their bicycle as stolen. For the police department, registering stolen bicycles serves as the driving force for acting on bicycle theft. The police has a clear need for more (accurate) data on bicycle theft. The interview with the police underlines the necessity of the police for a legal retrieving procedure. With the outcomes of desk research, interviews, experiments, field tests, and context mapping session throughout the analysis phase, the following assignment is formulated: ∙∙ To design a compatible and affordable bicycle tracker, which is independent from a finite power source and helps, empowers and guides victims to legally track and retrieve their stolen their stolen bicycles, resulting in a reduction of theft rates. The iterative design approach in the synthesis phase revealed the most appropriate implementation of the tracker. Limiting the update moments to just before and after a ride, and using power down states interrupted by a mechanical tilt switch showed huge power reductions, revealing the opportunity of a solely battery powered tracker with a battery life of more than 10 years. With this finding the usage of energy harvesters becomes unnecessary. The dependency of energy harvesters on the energy from the environment makes them rather unreliable, incompatible with different bicycles and vulnerable for tampering. For the purpose of a bicycle tracker that acts on theft, a batterypowered product is a better solution. The battery-powered product is integrated into the seat post tube of the bicycle; this position is the most favourable considering the performance of the data communication, the compatibility and the tamper resistance. Tests with the LoRa network show reliable results of the KPN network for implementing it in a tracker. This low power, low costs communication network supports location tracking starting from the beginning of 2017. The final result is a maintenance free, affordable and hardly distinguishable tracker that is compatible with most bicycles. During the activation of the product the user constructs a ‘bicycle passport’, capturing the identity. In the event of a theft, the location is updated and can be shared with the police and social media, enabling a more efficient retrieving procedure.","trackers; location; bicycles; self sustaining; power consumption; bicycle theft; iterative; energy harvesters; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Modeling pile driving is a complex process, including vibrations generated from the driving hammer, propagating further through the pile and transferred to the surroundings at the pile-soil interface. The vibrations propagating through the ground interact with structures, potentially causing damage to both underground and structures at surface level or potentially disturbing their inhabitants. Prediction models of ground vibrations focus on estimating the vibrations at ground surface level. The prediction of vibration amplitude at different depths can be more useful at sites with sensitive ground conditions. A model predicting these subsurface vibrations, easily applicable in engineering practice is currently not available or not validated. One of the impediments in developing a model for predicting ground vibrations at different depths is the lack of field data for validation. The purpose of this thesis is to find a prediction model for ground vibrations at different depths below the surface level. The study is focused on vibrations induced by impact driving of open ended steel tubular piles. A literature study was conducted to gain theoretical knowledge on pile driving and ground vibrations. The model developed by Massarsch and Fellenius [15] was found in the literature and although it predicts ground vibrations at surface level, the adaptation of the model for predicting vibrations at different depths was studied. Vibration measurements from the field test performed in the Caland Canal have been analyzed. The soil profile at the site consists of sandy clay and clay layers overlying a dense sand layer. First, large diameter dolphin piles were driven by a vibratory hammer. When the pile toe reached the dense sand layer, the driving process was changed to impact hammering in order to change the characteristics of the vibrations transmitted through the soil. The pile driving was extensively monitored and particle velocities were recorded by 3D geophones placed up to depths of NAP -22m (9.50m embedment depth). The prediction model of Massarsch and Fellenius [15] makes a distinction between the velocities of different wave types emitted from piles during impact driving. These waves are the shear waves propagating with a cylindrical wave front along the pile shaft and compression waves emitted at the pile toe, propagating with a spherical wave front. Surface waves resulting from wave reflection at ground surface are not considered in this thesis, as this research focuses on vibrations at different depths. Wave velocities are calculated from the hammer input energy, taking into account ground conditions and considering the vibration transmission efficacy which defines the amount of energy transmitted at the pile-soil interface. The model is adapted for open ended tubular piles. Due to the large diameter of the dolphin piles and the present soil conditions, the soil plugging effect and its contribution to dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe are ignored. Dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe is considered the source of spherical waves, while the soil resistance along the pile shaft is the source of cylindrical waves. The ratio between the pile cross section and the total area delimited by the external diameter is taken into account when calculating the dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe, resulting particle velocities of spherical waves smaller than unity. Therefore the cylindrical waves propagating from the pile shaft are considered the main source of ground vibrations. The results of the prediction model have been compared to vibration values measured in the field test. The predicted vibration amplitudes are a good approximation of the vibration levels measured in the sandy clay and clay layers. The predicted vibrations are of higher magnitude compared to the amplitude of vibrations recorded by the sensors placed in the dense sand layer.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","The Pioneering Spirit is the world’s largest construction vessel. The twin-hulled vessel is 382 m long and 124 m wide. At the bow is a slot, 122 m long and 59 m wide, that enables the Pioneering Spirit to straddle a platform and remove or install entire topsides up to 48,000 t in a single lift using eight sets of horizontal lifting beams. Until now little is known about the vessels behaviour during platform transport at forward speed, which is part of the removal/installation operation. Vessel motions and internal loads are key elements in determining how much a platform must be reinforced during transport. The goal of this thesis therefore was to analyse those elements at forward speed in waves. For this thesis a time domain Rankine panel method (WASIM), has been chosen as the theoretical method to predict the vessel behaviour with forward speed. This method has been compared to an alternative, a greens function method (AQWA) that Allseas uses at the moment. The largest difference between the two boundary element methods is the different approach of the free-surface boundary condition. The Rankine panel method models the free surface and the body with singularities allowing forward speed terms to be included in the free surface boundary condition. The green functions method only models the body with singularities, and uses a conventional zero speed greens function by neglecting the forward speed terms in the free surface boundary condition. To validate the results of the two hydrodynamic solvers, motions from forward speed model tests have been used. Additionally to explain the vessel behaviour the added mass, damping and exciting forces have been analysed. Furthermore the internal loads have been investigated by calculating section loads. Those have subsequently been used in a beam model to estimate bow deformations. Due to forward speed, the Pioneering Spirit starts oscillating at a higher (encounter) frequency than the incoming wave frequency. This effect causes a large drop in added mass and damping of the vessel at certain frequencies. The wavelength with respect to the vessel dominating the excitation force however is unaffected by forward speed. This thesis shows that the change of balance in the equation of motion causes a significant change in vessel motions. The most significant is an increase in heave and pitch motions in bow wave directions at low frequencies. Peak heave and pitch accelerations are more than doubled in these situations, subsequently causing significant increases in bow deformations. Due to the unconventional shape of the Pioneering Spirit resonating wave modes are present in-between the bows at zero speed. This study shows that these resonating wave modes are translated away from the vessel with forward speed allowing no resonance to be build up. From this study it can also be confirmed that the greens function method (AQWA) does not correctly model the translation of waves in the free surface, causing wave resonance effects to be amplified instead of translating away. It can be concluded that the green functions method is an inaccurate solver for the Pioneering Spirit and ships with likewise geometry, regarding forward speed in waves. The time-domain Rankine panel method (WASIM) does a much better job, showing a good correlation with model test results in beam to bow wave directions. It may be concluded that a proper forward speed solver is highly recommended for the beam to bow wave situations that have been investigated in this thesis. A next step would be to investigate the effects stern incoming waves and different transport conditions.","Forward speed; Rankine panel; Non-conventional ship; greens function; wave resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

Prior to space flight, ground tests are performed to determinewhether a spacecraft, or a specific part thereof, can withstand the acoustic load. These tests take place in a reverberation chamber. An acoustic feedback control algorithm shapes the sound field to specified third octave band levels which, are characteristic to individual launch vehicles. When applying feedback control, one faces two challenges. For one, the reverberant room introduces a large time constant resulting in slow transient behaviour, i.e. slow test start-ups. Furthermore amplitude fluctuations are introduced when analysing white noise with third octave band analysis due to its stochastic nature. This causes a lack of precision in steady state operation. This thesis studies acoustic phenomena taking place in a reverberation chamber. These include non linear sound propagation. The presence and significance of this non linearity will be evaluated. Subsequently, it is aimed to derive an input-output relation, describing the acoustic room response. To extend this relation, the third octave bandpass filters will be studied. After a physical model is formulated, different feedforward control algorithms are studied to improve both the build-up time of the sound field and the accuracy of the sound field after the steady state is reached. These will first be applied to a single third octave. Thereafter the control system will be extended to multiple third octave bands.","acoustic testing; reverberation chamber; acoustic test control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","","",""

The question that is central in this research is: What is the added value of a real option tool for decision-making in road widening projects? The requirements of a real option tool were researched and a tool was designed. After that, the tool was tested and potential users and experts were asked on their opinion on the added value of this real option tool. All respondents state that the tool has added value for decision-making in road widening projects. In further research, it is recommended to improve the tool, e.g. by researching key indicators on the effects of flexibility. A more thorough analysis of the added value of this tool in pilots is recommended.","Real option analysis; Road widening projects; Decision support systems; Decision-making process; Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","","",""

(mentor); De Schutter, B. (mentor)","2016","In the last decades there has been a significant increase of traffic demand in urban areas due to the development of the economy and the increase of population. The increase in traffic demand leads to a more congested road network. Congestion causes unwanted delays, resulting in higher travel costs, noise, and pollution. Popular methods to resolve the problem of congestion are, for instance, to improve the use of the existing infrastructure or to extend the current infrastructure. Most of the time the latter is not possible, because there is no space for extension of road network. To improve the use of the existing infrastructure, the available capacity should be utilized as efficiently as possible. In an urban road network traffic travels from intersection to intersection. Hence, the intersections are influenced by each other with some time delay, and therefore it would be useful to predict the evolution of the traffic demands. For this reason an Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy will be suitable for controlling traffic. However, this is to realize in practice due to the long computation time and the presence of uncertainty in traffic. The goal of this thesis is to develop a predictive model-based urban traffic controller that accounts for uncertainty while not losing performance in every traffic regime and while remaining real-time feasible. The aim of the controller is to improve the throughput of an urban traffic network by aggregating the traffic dynamics to (several) tens of seconds, and this is evaluated by means of simulation.","LTM; urban traffic network; linear model predictive control; robust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Mugge, W. (mentor)","2016","The structural response of active skeletal muscle is derived from a combination of sarcomere contraction properties, collagen fibres in the connective tissue, and incompressibility. The role of collagen tissues could be substantial but is still not completely understood. Only few studies have looked into the functionality of collagen reorientation within connective tissues during contraction. The objective of this paper is to propose a discrete static micro-mechanical model to study the sensitivity of kinematic properties of skeletal muscle depending on initial braiding angle of the endomysium lattice and the stiffness of collagen fibers. Two models are developed, first a hexagonally shaped single muscle fibre surrounded by connective tissue, and second, a fascicle model encompassing a single fiber surrounded by neighbouring fibres on all sides with their portion of connective tissue. Connective tissue is modelled in a crossed-helical setup of tension-only elements. Contraction is simulated by pretensioned 'sarcomere' spring elements that follow the muscle force-length relationship. the model calculates displacements, forces, pressures and work developed as a result of contraction.The most important conclusion of the model is that the contribution of braiding angle and collagen stiffness can be considered very important. For a sufficiently small angle, the observed model behaviour can solely be attributed to sarcomere properties. When the orientation angle is increased, the passive properties of the myofascia start playing a larger role. The model response then becomes very much influenced by a pressure term that is induced by stretch in the collagen acting on the incompressible muscle. Although validation methods are limited, the model results are promising and further research is encouraged.","Muscle fiber; Muscle modelling; Static Model; Collagen braiding angle; Myofascia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor); Jumelet, D. (mentor)","2016","Momentarily the determination of the static stability of rock on mild slopes can be split in roughly two paths, the empirical and the physical approach. However, both the approaches have their limitations from which one could conclude that neither approach is currently an accurate description of the stability of rock on mild slopes under wave attack. The empirical approach by van der Meer [1988] has to be extrapolated outside its validity region and is deemed to be too conservative by Schiereck and Fontijn [1996]. The physical approaches on which the software XBeach-G[1], runs are capable of globally determining dynamic profile response reasonably well however they cannot accurately determine static stability. From this lack of an accurate approach to determine the stability of rock on mild slopes under wave attack, follows the research question of this thesis: “How should the stability or rock on mild slopes be described?” To determine how to describe the stability of rock on mild slope under wave attack, a test plan was set up. The test plan was split into two parts, firstly the empirical approach and secondly the physical approach. The empirical approach is based around the formula of Van der Meer [1988] for plunging waves. Whereas the physical approach follows the methodology of Xbeach-G. For which the input parameters have been derived by the means of a combination Bubble Image Velocimetry (BIV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Concluding on the test results, the empirical Van der Meer [1988] gives good results for slopes up to 1:10. For slopes milder than 1:10, the damage should no longer be described by the damage level ‘S’. A good alternative seems to be the damage depth ‘E3’. The fact that ‘S’ no longer is a proper way to determine the damage, suggests that the Van der Meer [1988] formula should not be used for mild slopes any more. However, for all cases the extrapolation of Van der Meer [1988] results in (very) conservative approach and can therefore still be used in this form, but should serve as a first indication. The Van Rijn [2007] approach seems to be preferable over the Nielsen [2006] approach, because the Van Rijn [2007] approach aligns with the visual observations and profile change measurements. Apart from better results, the Van Rijn [2007] is more pragmatic than the Nielsen [2006] approach. This is because the parameters used in Van Rijn [2007] can easily be determined with basic details of the slope, whereas the Nielsen [2006] approach significantly depends on the accuaracy of the parameters (phase lag angle and the sediment friction coefficient), which both have been proven hard to determine.","Rock protection; Mild slopes; BIV; PIV; 3D profile scan; Van der Meer [1988]; Van Rijn [2007]","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In that light, research into bio-based jet fuels (biojet fuel) and bio-based chemicals has been accelerating in recent years. Yet, commercialization of their production is rather difficult. Despite substantial research in production technologies for biojet fuel and biosuccinic acid, commercial production of these products is still very minimal. Therefore, a research was executed with the objective to analyze how government policies affect commercialization of biojet fuel and biosuccinic acid, within the context of sugarcane competition and international trade and to explore alternative policies. This research was operationalized in the following research question: “What set of policies can be recommended to increase the production of biojet fuel and biosuccinic acid, within the context of national and international competitition between the road transport and sugar market? The methodology used to answer the main research question is a blend of institutional analysis and agent-based modelling and simulation and was used to gain better understanding of how actors’ behaviors and interactions give rise to the emerging key variables of interest that can be observed at the macro systems level. The agent-based model that was developed was used for policy exploration in which policies were explored that might be able to increase the production of biojet fuel and biosuccinic acid in the period of 2015 until 2030. From this analysis, multiple conclusions were drawn: (1) actors’ behaviors and interactions give rise to a dynamic sugarcane market; (2) sugarcane pricing and allocation are key factors in the emergence of biojet fuel and biosuccinic acid production; (3) strong national and international competition with the sugar and ethanol market is likely to be an unstable context for biojet fuel or biosuccinic acid to be commercialized; (4) current government ethanol-support policies hinder commercialization and (5) 2G bagasse-to-biojet technology showed positive results for biojet fuel demand satisfaction.","Sustainability; agent-based modelling; complex adaptive systems; bioethanol; biojet fuel; succinic acid; aviation; petrochemical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","","",""

(mentor); Guatame-Garcia, L.A. (mentor)","2016","The St. Austell area (SW England) is known for its high quality and world-class size kaolin deposits and has a long history of kaolin mining. Mining started in the high grade zones. However, in recent years, mining is moving closer to lower grade zones and sees an increase in iron-impurities within the ore. The kaolin mineral assemblage consists of kaolinite and minor quantities of muscovite, quartz and feldspar. The quality of kaolinite can be described by the structural order in the crystal lattice (crystallinity) and the amount of iron-impurities present. A deeper insight in the distribution of high crystalline kaolinite, iron-impurities and associated minerals, as well as their transitions in the deposit, is required to optimize the kaolin extraction. These processes can be described by Visible Near-Infrared (VNIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, this Master Thesis investigated how hyperspectral imaging can contribute to the understanding of the alteration processes in the St Austell area. Hyperspectral data was used to describe the transition from slightly altered granite to highly kaolinitized areas, by mapping the distribution of rock-forming and alteration minerals. For this study, 11 drill core boxes (consisting of two 1.5 m intervals) were provided and 29 hand specimen samples were acquired from the St. Austell mining area. Kaolinite is an alteration mineral derived from rock-forming minerals present in granite. The geology of St. Austell kaolin deposits is complex and debate still exists on the exact deposit formation and kaolinitization process that formed the world-class deposits. The paragenetic alteration model obtained from literature consists of four phases and describes the complete alteration from fresh granite to fully kaolinitized material. The alteration phases could be distinguished and described based on the mineral content, chemical composition and mineral distribution. Also, mineral structures (e.g. veins and pseudomorphism) and textures (e.g. coarse-grained and porphyritic textures) were of major importance. A hyperspectral data decision tree classification program was developed to map minerals related to the alteration process. Alteration minerals, such as kaolinite, have characteristic absorption features in the VNIR and SWIR, which could be used to identify and distinguish minerals. The spectrum at each pixel was compared and classified according to the presence of characteristic absorptions. Such absorptions were derived from spectral analysis and spectral library reference spectra. The hyperspectral data classification resulted in mineral maps (false-color images) that displayed the spatial distribution of minerals in a sample. Also, hyperspectral data was used to map spectral parameters, such as the kaolinite crystallinity (KX), illite crystallinity (IC), deepest absorption wavelength location and absorption feature asymmetry. These spectral parameters provided more information about the mineral distribution and chemical composition. The hyperspectral data analysis and classification resulted in the identification of the following key minerals: kaolinite, halloysite, montmorillonite, illite, muscovite, tourmaline, biotite and topaz. The spatial relation of these minerals provided information about the state of alteration, alteration direction and intensity. The interpretation of the mineral maps proved that the four distinct alteration phases could be distinguished by hyperspectral imaging. The first alteration phase was identified by the presence of tourmaline in either vein-like structures or as small crystals. Additional minerals of the first alteration phase were Al-rich muscovite and topaz. Phase two was recognized by fine-grained Al-poor muscovite from the rhyolite dykes. Phase three was observed as long stretched iron-rich veins, which consisted of either kaolin, montmorillonite or illite in combination with iron-bearing minerals. The final alteration phase was responsible for extensive kaolinitization and was characterized as a two-step alteration process. In this process, K-feldspar altered to montmorillonite and some kaolinite. When all K-feldspar material was dissolved, the formed montmorillonite was altered to kaolinite. The two-step alteration process was very well observed in both KX and IC maps. The crystallinity maps showed low KX and IC in the transition zones where both kaolinite and montmorillonite with low crystallinity were present. High IC values were observed in the less altered regions, while high KX values were observed in the completely kaolinitized areas. The distribution of high-crystallinity kaolinite was mainly related to the presence of fluid pathways and the absence of iron-bearing minerals, other than tourmaline. The results of this research showed that hyperspectral imaging is a good technique to map the alteration process of the St. Austell granite. The mineralogical distribution, crystallinity, and influence of iron-impurities could all be visualized in false-color images, which allowed for easy interpretation. Hyperspectral imaging provides exploration geologists with quick, qualitative and objective information. The information derived from mineral maps could be used to develop more detailed alteration models, which could optimize extraction and beneficiation processes. The distribution of high quality kaolin is more accurately known at a particular location and at a certain moment in time. Based on this information, more specific mining, stockpiling, blending and mineral processing decisions could be made. Eventually, this will result in less deviations from quality targets and a reduction in mining and processing costs.

One of the large challenges in CFD, is advection. Advection dominated flows are governed by hyperbolic equations, which pose severe stability issues. Stabilized methods usually add significant numerical diffusion, which alters the solution. Another issue are discontinuities in solutions, such as found in shock waves and acoustics. Besides solving these issues, conservative properties have to be satisfied at all costs. In order to further improve results, new methods are still developed today. The mathematical tools to do such developments are also further expanded. For instance, in the last decades the branch of differential geometry has steadily grown. This branch of mathematics can be extremely useful, since a clear distinction is made between geometric depend and geometric independent operators. These operators become more in use for numerical methods. Of all the available operators, the Lie derivative is important for advection. In junction with newly developed edge polynomials, a scheme for advection is created. The new edge polynomials are special, as these partly scale with a variable integrated over the cell and partly scale with the values on the cell boundaries. In order to do this, one polynomials integrates to 1 over the cell, while the other polynomials do not contribute, hence integrate to 0 over a cell. This gives several benefits. Conservation is clearly defined in the cells and not in points, hence conservation is locally defined. Also an extinction is made between conservative values and fluxes. One can also use the property of not contributing to conservation by correcting point values for stabilization or improvement of the solution. These polynomials are used within a Galerkin Finite Elements (FE) framework. Besides correction methods, upwind methods can be used as well. The approach is tested on several equation sets. On a simple linear advection problem, excellent results are found. Four test cases are tried, from a sine wave, two discontinuous functions and a hat function. With the proposed polynomials, the shapes are conserved extremely well, also in comparison to widely used schemes. On the inviscid Burgers’ equations, the stabilization methods become of importance. In the inviscid Burgers’ equation, initially smooth problems can become discontinuous. When a discontinuity forms, several issues can occur. For one, spurious oscillations can become apparent, or the velocity of the discontinuity can have errors. With several approaches, competitive results can be obtained. The discontinuity velocity is computed well, but spurious oscillation usually do occur. With several methods, the oscillations are suppressed. Not all approaches succeed in doing so. The third and final equation set to be tested, are the Euler equations. Although solutions can be found, all solutions contain errors. Several error sources are indicated, which should be addressed in further research. In comparison to a Monotonic Upstream-Centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) scheme, results need to be further improved to be on par. In conclusion, the suggested polynomials show potential. Several methods to improve solutions showed their usefulness. In linear advection, the new polynomials performed better compared to existing widely used methods. In non-linear advection, the results are on par with reference methods. For the Euler equations, further improvements are necessary.

(mentor); Verwer, S.E. (mentor)","2016","Many engineering problems require some objective to be optimized subject to certain constraints. For linear and convex optimization problems, techniques exist that can find the global minimum. For problems that have local minima or complex constraints, finding the global minimum is more difficult. An example of such a problem can be found in Lansingerland, where heat needs to be supplied by greenhouses. In this work a heat generation problem that has a local objective but complex constraints is solved using simulated annealing. The problem has the form of a demand supply problem and is applied in the context of generating heat for greenhouses in the region of Lansingerland. The objective is the costs that we want to keep as low as possible. The constraints arise from the network used to transport the heat, because the pressure in the pipes and valves of this network needs to be kept under control. Prior to coming up with a solution, the patterns of the heat demand are studied to decide what conditions the solutions should take into account. It was found that days follow a similar pattern and that the demand is higher in winter than in summer months. Furthermore the distribution of the heat demand over the different greenhouses is roughly equal for each day. Then, a look is taken at how a heat control can be solved using a stochastic optimization technique without considering variations during the day. Instead the problem is solved as if the heat demand for a single day is constant. We improve on canonical simulated annealing by making our mutations more intelligent than random. Two better approaches are shown to accomplish this. One starts by an analysis of trying different solutions to see what works best under what circumstances. This will be referred to as a smart mutation. The other approach varies the type of mutation based on earlier iterations. This will be referred to as an adaptive mutation. Both approaches show similar results, but since the adaptive mutation doesn't require much domain knowledge, this one is easier to apply to other problems. The influence of the starting point is also explored. In our setup it mattered a lot whether the initial point was already located in the feasible domain or not, for how quickly a solution can be found. We found that a good initial scenario should be one that already starts in the feasible domain. The best result was obtained by creating an initial scenario that for each greenhouse randomly decides to use the CHP or the RoCa. The mutation that gave best results in our case was the adaptive mutation, but it is expected that if more domain knowledge is added the smart mutation would be the best one. Finally, we will demonstrate how a heat control problem can be solved if the heat demand varies over time. In order to do so, a new way is introduced to segment time-series. This segmentation will be used to cluster the heat demand for a single day and to solve the problem for each segment individually. This improves the solution considerably, because it enables us to generate more heat at cold moments of the day like midnight, but to save on costs during the hot parts of the day.","stochastic optimization; simulated annealing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Science","",""

In contrast to traditional forms of contracting, contractors become often also responsible for an operational period. The obligation to ensure availability and reliability of infrastructural assets to the client demands Dutch contractors to create smart and innovative solutions for Asset Management (AM). Meanwhile, recent developments such as Smart Cities and Internet of Things (IoT) result in an increase in the application of sensor devices from 16 billion in 2014 to 40.9 billion forecasted in 2020. The use of smart sensor technology to detect and predict asset performance during the maintenance phase of road infrastructure projects is still in its development phase. The application of sensors to establish an asset network offers a great potential to the construction sector. This Double Degree graduation work is a combination of two master studies from the Technical University of Delft: Construction Management and Engineering (CME) and Geomatics for the Built Environment. Although the entire research consists of two separate theses, each thesis includes an integrated approach from both studies. The partition of the research in two theses allows a holistic research into the potential of sensor technology for the construction sector and an in-depth analysis of the application of sensors. This holistic research answers the following research question: How can the construction sector incorporate sensor technology during the maintenance phase of road infrastructure projects to optimise Asset Management? The developed theoretical framework presents three subjects: the individual asset, the asset network and AM. The research explains the potential of sensor technology by elaborating on the overlap between these three subjects. This resulted in the author’s definition of Smart Asset Management (SAM). SAM is the collection, analysis, sharing and exploitation of sensor data to balance performance, costs and risks by performing the right maintenance at the right time and at the right location. SAM is a combination of an individual Smart Asset (SA) and a collection of SA in a Smart Asset Network (SAN). An individual SA allows to collect and analyse data of attached sensors. A SAN shares and exploits relevant sensor data between assets mutually. This network allows indicating the performance of each asset, regardless of the number of attached sensors. The analysis of the current situation indicates the connection between Smart Cities and sensors through performance, information and data requirements. In addition, three case studies have been analyzed: (1) Project structures and embankments monitoring Haarlem, (2) Project real-time railway monitoring Zeeland, and (3) Project van Brienenoord-bridge Rotterdam. The multiple case study analysis reveals that the content of the set requirements influences the applied management style for AM, which in turn determines the incorporation of sensor technology. The research at hand therefore distinguishes 15 requirements for realising SAM, of which providing insight into the aspects availability and reliability of assets are the most important. The requirements contribute to four set objectives: 1) to store and retrieve performance data in order to improve insight in the actual and real-time condition of assets, 2) to predict future conditions and service levels, 3) to support efficient planning of maintenance activities, and 4) to integrate new technologies and to innovate. The developed theoretical implementation describes how the SA and SAN contribute to the scenario of ‘Asset Manager of the future’. The theory of SAM has been tested in the research of Braaksma (2016). The results of the testing were evaluated and 12 out of 15 requirements were satisfied. The combination of SA and SAN seems to be a suitable combination for realising a SAM application in the construction sector. It allows sharing sensor data when needed, and thereby utilizing the data for multiple applications. However, three requirements were not fully satisfied due to limitations in and their relevance for this test set-up: (1) defining the exact performance pattern, (2) providing the reliability factors of detected performances, and (3) data security and privacy. The requirements remain important in realising SAM, though were not of crucial importance in this research. The extension of the test set-up in a prototype is likely to resolve these requirements. In conclusion, implementing the ‘Asset Manager of the future’ scenario answers the research question by posing SAM as a way to optimise AM: it improves insight into asset performance and supports improved decision-making by Asset Managers. It aims to support the construction sector in the obtained responsibility to ensure availability and reliability of assets. This research attempted to show the theoretical potential of sensor technology in the maintenance phase and evaluated requirements for implementing SAM theoretically. To create a completely automated process for collecting, analysing, sharing and exploitation of sensor data in the construction sector, it is recommended to translate this theoretical implementation into an operational practice. Explicitly focusing on innovation, acknowledging the importance of users in the process and realising a pilot project are focal points for research in the near future. This research shows that SAM provides the construction sector with a smart and innovative solution for AM, utilizing the potential of sensor technology to perform the right maintenance at the right time and at the right location.","Asset Management; sensor technology; linked data; Smart Asset Management; Smart Asset; Smart Asset Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

(mentor)","2016","Double Degree Program - Recent developments, such as Smart Cities and Internet of Things (IoT), result in an increase in the application of sensor devices from 16 billion in 2014 to 40.9 billion forecasted in 2020. The role of sensor technology is increasing in importance due to the decreasing costs of acquiring sensors and due to more practical implementations that are available on the market. In the meantime, the introduction of integrated contracts demands Dutch contractors to ensure availability and reliability of infrastructural assets to the client. Dutch contractors face the need to realize smart and innovative solutions for Asset Management (AM). The use of smart sensor technology to detect and predict asset performances during the maintenance phase of road infrastructure projects is still in its development phase. Meanwhile, the application of sensors to establish an asset network offers a great potential to the construction sector. This Double Degree graduation work is a combination of two master studies from the Technical University of Delft: Construction Management and Engineering (CME) and Geomatics for the Built Environment. The purpose of this study is to conduct an in-depth analysis that specifically focuses on expansion joints to test the proposed theory and to evaluate the set requirements for Smart Asset Management (SAM) of Braaksma (2016). SAM is defined as the collection, analysis, sharing, and exploitation of sensor data to balance performance, costs, and risks in managing assets in order to perform maintenance at the right moment and the right location. This research answers the following research question: How can sensor technology be used in the construction sector to facilitate Smart Asset Management during the maintenance phase of road infrastructure projects? SAM is a combination of an individual Smart Asset (SA) and a collection of assets in a Smart Asset Network (SAN). An individual SA allows to collect and analyse data from attached sensors. A SAN shares and exploits relevant sensor data between assets mutually. This network allows indicating the performance of each asset, regardless of the number of attached sensors. A theoretical implementation of an SA, by means of a proof-of-concept, builds on the current methods of asset monitoring in the construction sector and on a developed monitoring system. The proof-of-concept is able to collect and analyse sensor data by executing multiple runs on simplified representations of expansion joints. The use of intra-correlation, which is the correlation between sensors and asset, supports to indicate the degradation of the expansion joint, despite addressed limitations of the test set-up. The research indicates four influential aspects to be considered when realising an operational use of the SA. These aspects are (1) to manage expectations of Asset Managers, (2) to collect relevant sensor data, (3) to define proper ways to handle data transfer, and (4) to adapt current SAM systems. A use case for the expansion joint in an SAN builds on the current situation of adopting asset networks and on the analysed alignment of standards in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and sensors. The use case defines the components that are taken into account when the user requests information from the SAM system. The use case introduces inter-correlation, which is used to determine the extrapolation of sensor data from one asset to the other. In addition, a developed class diagram describes the SAN data model and its relation to the SensorThings API model, a recently released sensor standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The class diagram defines the link between BIM and sensor models. The use case continues on the class diagram and describes how SAN allows measuring the performance of each asset. The research indicates four influential aspects to be considered when realising an operational use of the SAN. These aspects are (1) to manage the willingness of Asset Managers to work and rely on a SAN, (2) to integrate and interpret sensor and BIM data sources, (3) to detect inter-correlation and needed calculation techniques, and (4) to determine the representativeness of sensor data. In addition, the requirements set for SAM have been evaluated by elaborating on the findings of the research into SA and SAN. The results serve as input for the research of Braaksma (2016). In conclusion, implementing the SAM scenario answers the research question by identifying SA and SAN as a way to incorporate sensor technology: it is able to measure asset performances and supports the realisation of SAM decision-making. This research investigates the added value of attaching sensors to expansion joints and provides a total of eight influential aspects to be considered when realising a SA and SAN for expansion joints. Also, this research includes a view on the extent to which components of BIM relate to sensor technology. The combination of using intra-correlation, inter-correlation and extrapolation is utilised in the developed use case. These results support the construction sector in the obtained responsibility to ensure availability and reliability of assets. Properly addressing the identified aspects of influence, acknowledging the importance of users in the process and investigating how to apply intra-correlation, inter-correlation and extrapolation in a pilot project are focal points for research in the near future. This research provides an insight in maintaining assets – expansion joints in specific – in such a way that individual asset performances can be detected and predicted, utilising the potential of sensor technology in assets networks.","Asset Management; sensor technology; expansion joint; Smart Asset Management; Smart Asset; Smart Asset Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Schilperoort, B. (mentor)","2016","Within hydrology evaporation is one of the most important terms in the water- and land surface energy balance. However evaporation is difficult to estimate accurately. Conventional techniques to measure actual evaporation have their drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that multiple sensors need to be used, with all their own bias. One of these techniques, the Eddy Covariance (EC) system has the drawback that it is dependent on weather conditions and is known for its problems with closure of the energy balance (Foken, 2008). A new method called the Bowen Ratio- Distributed Temperature Sensing (BR-DTS) method is introduced by Euser et al. (2014). This method determines the Bowen ratio which is the ratio between the sensible heat flux and the latent heat flux. The BR-DTS method measures temperature using a fiber optic cable. This cable is placed vertically along a tower, the cable going up is dry and the cable going down is wrapped in cotton and kept wet. With the dry and wet temperature of the DTS-cable the air temperature and vapour pressure can be determined. By having a large amount of measurements over the height and measuring it with a single sensor the BR-DTS method does not have the problem of varying biases of sensors (Euser et al. 2014). The aim of this study is at first to verify if the temperature data of the dry and wet cable are correct and second to compare the outcome with the EC data. The temperature of the dry and wet cable measured with the BR-DTS method are really close to the temperatures measured with the relative humidity sensors with a maximum R2 of 0.998 at 4 and 16 meter height for the dry cable and a maximum R2 of 0.988 at 16 meter height for the wet cable. The energy gap found is relatively small, see figure 11, and the latent heat flux measured with the BR-DTS setup is just as in the results from B. Schilperoort (2015) greater than the latent heat flux measured with the EC setup. On the other hand the sensible heat flux measured with the BR-DTS setup is smaller than the sensible heat flux measured with the EC setup which is in contradiction with the results from B. Schilperoort (2015).","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The use of quantum computer can dramatically increase the computation power when compared with a classical computer. This is achieved by the manipulation of qubits. Qubits are the basic unit of quantum computation, and assumes a superposition of the two classical states ’0’ and ’1’. Qubits can be realized in many ways, namely; Ion traps, Nitrogen vacancies in diamond, Transmons or Quantum dots. The implementation of confined single electron’s spin state in a quantum dot to encode quantum information, provides advantages of scalability and integration with current semiconductor process technology. These qubits are susceptible to en- vironmental influences, therefore to reduce it ( or to enhance the decoherence time), the system is kept at 20 mK. To maintain electron confinement in a quantum dot, the quantum dot is applied with specific voltages with stringent resolution conditions. (-2V to 2V with ± 5 µV resolution). Currently, this condition is met by using chemical batteries, which being large in size, affect the scalability of the system. To that end, use of analog and digital circuits to supply the confinement voltage and to address the qubit system can improve the scalability. Circuits which can be monolithically integrated with the qubit would reduce fabrication complexity and provide higher operation speed as well. Thereby, this thesis studies whether MOSFETs can be formed using the same wafer substrate of quantum dots. In this thesis, the research of a fabrication recipe for MOSFETs based on strained Si in SiGe-Si-SiGe heterostructure is presented. To maintain the strain in Si, the process temperature should not exceed 700 ◦ C. This is confirmed with Raman spectroscopy experiments. Then the MOSFETs are fabricated and characterized in room and cyro-temperatures (4K). The SiGe transistor has following parameters at 4K : mobility, µ ( 1980 cm 2 / Vs), transconductance (30.7 µS), I on (2*10 −5 A), I off (2*10 −12 A) and sub-threshold slope (80 mV/dec). Using it, a rudimentary SPICE model of the SiGe MOSFETs are derived and then the addressing of qubit system using Demux architectures of Static CMOS, Pass Transistor, Transmission and Binary Tree are studied. From the timing and power analysis, Binary Tree architecture was found to be best choice as it provides the lowest static power consumption of 66.5 nW for 1 to 1024 Demux. To improve the device characteristics, high k dielectric materials were studied. To study the feasibility of high k dielectrics, MOS capacitors were fabricated using ALD deposition for Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and HfO 2 . The defect densities were obtained by comparing the theoretical and experimental high frequency voltage and capacitance curves. From the current voltage curves, the breakdown field strength and resistivity is extracted. ALD Alumina of 7nm stacked on top of Silicon dioxide of 3nm has the least influence from charge defect with Fixed Oxide charges of 1.2*10 12 eV −1 cm −2 and Interface charges of 9.1*10 11 eV −1 cm −2 . Also, this stacked oxide provides a gate resistance of 111 GΩ, thereby making it the best candidate for gate dielectric.","Cyro temperature; SiGe heterostructure; Raman Spectroscopy Oxide Reliability; MOSFETs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-16","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering","","","",""

Solving this 'overproduction' problem requires a good understanding of the nature of a reactive program, as well as the various behaviors it can have. Several solutions have been proposed and implemented, though they turn out to not work under all circumstances. We classify these solutions based on the type of reactive programs they can be applied to. We further develop a new solution for the case in which the producer can actually be controlled. Our solution involves the notion of feedback control, which is a technique that is not well-known in computer science. For this technique to be applied, we develop an API to compose and execute feedback systems in production level systems. Based on this API we develop our solution to the overproduction problem.","feedback control systems; feedback control; feedback system; reactive programming; reactive extensions; RxJava; RxScala; Rx; overproduction; overproduction problem; backpressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering Research Group","",""

(mentor)","2016","The offshore industry and especially the oil and gas production, has faced a remarkable growth in the last decades, causing an increase in the population of offshore structures. The overwhelming majority of these structures are bottom founded and mostly made out of steel. Over these decades much experience has been gained with the design and construction of these steel offshore structures. A number of structural regulations such as the ISO 19902 have been developed based on the industry best practice and are currently used worldwide. The design routine is based on the conventional Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) method where the design is guided by the use of partial factors for the load and resistance. These factors were derived based on calibration work and on older regulations trying to achieve the same inherent level of safety. This caused the picture about the intended design target reliability level of the ISO standard to be a little vague and as a result the required level of safety is not explicitly defined. The goal of this MSc study is to investigate the intended target reliability when designing bottom founded offshore steel support structure with the ISO 19902 and specifically to research about how the reliability analysis procedure can be engaged during the design phase of offshore steel structures. To this end, the principles of nonlinear pushover analysis, system based and reliability based design are investigated and discussed. A code has been developed that allows interaction with Matlab and the nonlinear analysis program USFOS. A jacket structure has been designed and optimized based on the ISO 19902 and the achieved reliability level has been estimated. Further, a reliability analysis has been performed more explicitly through Monte Carlo simulations accounting for a number of stochastic variables such as the yield stress, the marine growth and the hydrodynamic coefficients. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to determine which are the parameters of influence to the reliability level. Finally, a method of designing with the focus on the desired reliability level is proposed and demonstrated in the examined jacket. The application of the reliability based design method offers the potential benefit of reducing the structural steel and ensuring that the required reliability level is achieved.","Offshore jacket; Structural reliability; Pushover analysis; Monte Carlo simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This research provides a framework for urban public transport operators to use in the management of disruptions, with a main focus on the passenger perspective of the management of disruptions, but also considering the operational effects of implemented measures. This framework is then applied to several hypothetic cases within the network of the urban public transport operator in The Hague, HTM, as well as one disruption which actually occurred. Two measures have been considered in the management of disruptions, which are detouring vehicles and short-turning of vehicles, effectively cutting the line in two. The framework consists of two models, namely an alternative generation model, and an alternative assessment model. Alternatives are assessed from the passenger perspective by the total generalized passenger travel time (TGTT) incurred by that alternative. The resource perspective of the different alternatives has been assessed by the delay vehicles incur upon arrival at the destination terminal due to the alternative. Applying the framework to four hypothetical disruptions in the network of HTM showed 7 to 9 alternatives were generated for each of the locations. Two different passenger demand levels (morning-peak and rest-of-day) have been considered to see the effect of different passenger demand levels on the assessment of the alternatives. The results showed that in 2 of the 8 cases (4 locations, 2 passenger demand levels) short-turning yields the lowest TGTT on the disrupted line. Comparing the results to the currently applied disruption management protocols, showed that only in 1 of 8 cases the protocol actually yields the lowest TGTT for passengers on the disrupted line. It was found current protocols are mainly driven from a resource perspective. The difference between the alternative having the lowest TGTT and the disruption management protocol was up to 85%. Three variables have been found of main importance when considering either detouring or short-turning as a measure. These are the ratio of passengers favoured by detouring versus passengers favoured by short-turning, the detour time and the short-turning distance (distance between the two short-turning stops). This framework is perceived to be mainly of use for urban public transport operators in the process of managing the current operations. It can serve as input for traffic controllers, either in the construction of disruption management protocols (offline) or incorporated in a decision support system (real-time). The main recommendation for further extension is the incorporation of a passenger route choice model, in order to make it applicable for more disruption locations and disruption durations.","disruption management; rail-bound urban public transport; passenger perspective; discrete event-based simulation; SIMIO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","TIL","",""

It remains uncertain whether these responses are evoked through equivalent integration processes, because our perception of head position is not always aligned with postural responses evoked by vestibular perturbations, where postural responses are expected to align with head orientation. In this study, we examine if the contributions from bilateral vestibular organs are equal in postural responses and the perceptions of motion that are evoked during an artificial vestibular disturbance. This study also examines whether there is a linear integration of vestibular signals in the postural responses and perceived motion generated by the vestibular disturbance. Electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) was used to evoke whole-body and compensatory ankle-muscle responses during a standing balance task or the sensation of angular velocity about a roll axis during a perceived motion task. Stimulation on one side (monaural) was used to demonstrate if individual leg muscles receive equal inputs from both labyrinths, and if the motion perceived by activity of each labyrinth is equivalent. Principles of left-right integration were evaluated by comparing the sum of monaural responses with stimulation on both sides (binaural).","vestibular disturbance; electrical stimulation; human standing balance; motion perception; bilaterality; integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","BMA0332",""

The number of e-bikes used instead of normal bike is growing vastly. These e-bikes have to be charged. With todayâ€™s chargers the energy comes from the AC utility grid and the main source of this energy is generated by fossil fuels. This thesis describes the redesign of an existing bike shed to charge e-bikes in a sustainable and grid independent way. Firstly the amount of daily energy needed is calculated so the amount of solar panels can be determined. The solar energy generated in winter is low so storage is included to make the bike shed autonomous. The required area of solar panels and corresponding amount of energy storage for this daily load, cannot be implemented on the existing bike shed. A new, modular, shed is designed with a grid connection. This system consists of eight high-efficient solar panels connected via a maximum power point tracker to a 48 V DC-bus. An inverter is used to connect the DC-bus to the AC- grid. The designed chargers are connected to the 48 V bus. The main problem of this design are the different connectors to connect these chargers to the charging station. Also, the user has to bring along the charging cables. To make the system more user friendly a contactless charging system is designed. This charger is based on a combination of standards which exist nowadays because none of them are directly suitable. The kickstand is used for the energy transfer because the bike does not have to altered and no different systems for different frame types have to be designed. The power transfer of the system works as designed, although the lack of standardization in connectors and ways of charging. This way of charging is a very promising technique and future cooperation with e-bike manufacturers or the EnergyBus group for standardization will be the finishing touch.","solar; e-bike; charging; contactless charging; wireless power transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-16","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Using historical data from FMS and ADS-B, fuel-optimal CDAs are simulated using the total-energy model from BADA. By comparing the fuel consumption between the historical flight and the simulated CDA flight, fuel benefits are found. CO2 emissions are then calculated linearly from the fuel benefits. The results show average savings of 92 kg up to 500 kg of fuel per flight.

One of the biggest problems in distributed systems is that they only function well if everyone contributes some resources. If agents do not participate, or try to pretend they participate, but in fact are slacking off, then the system might not achieve its desired purpose. This work presents two methods to estimate how well agents contribute to the network, while preventing cheating. Firstly, the NetFlow algorithm, which uses max-flow computations to bound the profit of cheating by Sybil attacks. Secondly, the Temporal PageRank algorithm, which uses information about the ordering of the interactions to provide a robust mechanism to determine reputation. Theoretical guarantees about several aspects of these algorithms are provided. Furthermore, these mechanisms are tested on data from a real-world distributed system: Tribler, an anonymous peer-to-peer downloading system. Finally, taking both the theoretical and practical results, the broader implications of these mechanisms and future possibilities are explored.","Sybil attack; distributed systems; trust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Small flying robots can perform landing maneuvers using bio-inspired optical flow by maintaining a constant divergence. However, optical flow is typically estimated from frame sequences recorded by standard miniature cameras. This requires processing full images on-board, limiting the update rate of divergence measurements, thus the speed of the control loop and the robot. Event-based cameras overcome these limitations by only measuring pixel-level brightness changes at microsecond temporal accuracy, hence providing an efficient mechanism for optical flow estimation. This thesis presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first research integrating event-based optical flow estimation into the control loop of a flying robot. We extend an existing 'local plane fitting' algorithm to obtain an improved and more computationally efficient optical flow estimation method, valid for a wide range of optical flow velocities. This method is validated for real event sequences. In addition, a method for estimating the divergence from event-based optical flow is introduced, which accounts for the aperture problem. The developed algorithms are implemented in a constant divergence landing controller on-board of a quadrotor. Flight tests demonstrate that, using event-based optical flow, accurate divergence estimates can be obtained over a wide range of speeds. This enables the quadrotor to perform very fast landing maneuvers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-16","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

Therefore, the research methodology itself is the topic of interest and Delfi-n3Xt is used as a case-study. Due to the lack of facts, a combination of a forensic approach and a more general empirical approach is used. In this thesis, the satellite operations are reviewed extensively by inspection of orbital elements, by an extensive telemetry analysis, by a reconstruction of the mission and by a detailed analysis of the last moments of contact. Beyond the operations, the design of the ISIS Transceiver (ITRX), including the Linear Transponder (LT), is reviewed to identify hypotheses. During this thesis over 30 hypotheses were identified. Some hypotheses are directly related to the loss of contact and some are not. Since many hypotheses were identified, a selection was made for verification. This selection procedure was based on a methodology similar to a risk assessment, where the hypotheses with highest risk are selected. Eventually five verification campaigns were performed. One campaign was based on analysis and the other four were based on tests using spare hardware. Unfortunately, no root cause was found during this thesis, but two hypotheses were rejected, one hypothesis was verified, and one hypothesis was considered plausible and highly likely. Based on the achieved results it is concluded that the used methodology is effective for cases like Delfi-n3Xt, were evidence is lacking. It is acknowledged however, that full confirmation of the root cause of failure can’t, and will never be achieved, because the only way to determine the root cause is by inspection of the satellite itself. Many lessons were learned however, regarding forensics, regarding Delfi-n3Xt and regarding CubeSat projects in general.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Mooij, S.C. (mentor); Budding, I. (mentor)","2016","Assignment - This report describes the design of solutions that enable KLM Cargo to add more value for its employees and customers using data generated by new technological opportunities. The scope for this report is on pharmaceutical shipments passing through KLM Cargo’s Schiphol hub, from acceptance to delivery, and focuses on addressing the needs of warehouse employees, customer service agents, and pharmaceutical customers. Problem - KLM Cargo’s current cargo handling process is a manual, labour-intensive process suffering from problems for warehouse and customer service employees in terms of efficiency, workload, and quality, caused by missing and inaccurate data. It is therefore necessary to improve the amount, accuracy, and availability of condition, location, timing, and activity data, because these data categories have the biggest impact on KLM Cargo’s service delivery. Interviews show that pharmaceutical customers want to feel safe that KLM Cargo will deliver pharmaceutical shipments on time, in good order, and according to regulations, most importantly by controlling the temperature throughout the transport. Customers also want to be kept informed in real-time about their shipment’s status, temperature, location, and activities, and expect KLM Cargo intervene and communicate in case problems occur. Market trends will require and enable technological, digital, and data-driven innovations for the airline industry at an accelerating speed. Rapid technological progress drives the cost of computations, data collection and storage down, and enables a low-cost, low-power data collection infrastructure, combined with effective storage and analytics methods. To keep up with these developments KLM Cargo should develop technological, innovative solutions that are able to deal with a continuous, high volume, high velocity data flow and can transform data into actionable insights. Results - These insights can be combined in a design scenario for 2030, in which KLM Cargo operates in a competitive air cargo market that pushes airlines to compete on digital initiatives that use intelligent, connected cargo assets that generate and use a real time flow of data in order to enable an intelligent, efficient, reliable, and transparent logistical process for the transport of high-impact, high-value goods. In this future, KLM Cargo should aim to improve the quality of its pharmaceutical solutions through data-driven solutions. These solutions should help warehouse employees to work more efficiently, improve transparency for customers, and improve communication by customer service agents. The data framework presented in this report provides KLM Cargo with a common language and structure, while five data enablers outline the foundation for its actual data use. First, smart, sensor-equipped cargo assets and other systems connected to a common data sharing platform allow KLM to collect large flows of real-time data about its cargo process. Next, this data should be transformed into insights and actions through descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, one of which is defined as the ability to automatically prescribe required actions. Finally, data and insights are delivered to stakeholders via the digital tools presented in this report, that allow KLM Cargo to achieve quality improvements. Warehouse employees are provided with tablets, mobile apps, and large screens that enable them to work more efficiently, through automatic incident monitoring, data collection, and notifications. Transparency towards customers is increased, through online access to real-time shipment condition, location, and activity information. Finally, customer service agents get a tool that gives them access to the same accurate, real-time shipment data, so customers and customer service agents will benefit from improved, proactive communication.","KLM; cargo; data; pharmaceuticals; sensors; airfreight; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management (PIM)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Quantum computing holds the promise to solve problems that are currently intractable by classical computing platforms. Such computing framework relies on the properties of quantum bits (qubits) that operates at cryogenic temperatures well below 1K. Besides a quantum processor, an operational quantum computer needs a classical electronic controller reading out the electrical signals generated by the qubits and the providing electrical control to perform the required operations on the qubits. Since today’s quantum processors comprise a low number of qubits (<10), most controlling electronics can operate at room temperature and be connected by bulky interconnects to the cryogenic qubit chamber. However, when scaling up to the thousands of qubits required in a practical quantum algorithm, the classical electronics must be placed at cryogenic temperature to simplify the interconnects and allow a compact, reliable and scalable system. In this work, we propose the fully-integrated implementation in standard CMOS technology of the electronic read-out for spin qubits. Simulations show that the proposed current read-out circuit can achieve a 10MHz bandwidth that is 10X wider than current state-of-the-art read-outs while keeping comparable noise performance and operating at 4.2K. Such results are a promising indication that cryogenic CMOS circuits can provide the building blocks for the integration of the classical electronic controller for future scalable quantum computers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is constantly finding new ways to improve simulation results. One of the large challenges in CFD, is advection. Advection dominated flows are governed by hyperbolic equations, which pose severe stability issues. Stabilized methods usually add significant numerical diffusion, which alters the solution. Another issue are discontinuities in solutions, such as found in shock waves and acoustics. Besides solving these issues, conservative properties have to be satisfied at all costs. In order to further improve results, new methods are still developed today. The mathematical tools to do such developments are also further expanded. For instance, in the last decades the branch of differential geometry has steadily grown. This branch of mathematics can be extremely useful, since a clear distinction is made between geometric depend and geometric independent operators. These operators become more in use for numerical methods. Of all the available operators, the Lie derivative is important for advection. In junction with newly developed edge polynomials, a scheme for advection is created. The new edge polynomials are special, as these partly scale with a variable integrated over the cell and partly scale with the values on the cell boundaries. In order to do this, one polynomials integrates to 1 over the cell, while the other polynomials do not contribute, hence integrate to 0 over a cell. This gives several benefits. Conservation is clearly defined in the cells and not in points, hence conservation is locally defined. Also an extinction is made between conservative values and fluxes. One can also use the property of not contributing to conservation by correcting point values for stabilization or improvement of the solution. These polynomials are used within a Galerkin Finite Elements (FE) framework. Besides correction methods, upwind methods can be used as well. The approach is tested on several equation sets. On a simple linear advection problem, excellent results are found. Four test cases are tried, from a sine wave, two discontinuous functions and a hat function. With the proposed polynomials, the shapes are conserved extremely well, also in comparison to widely used schemes. On the inviscid Burgers’ equations, the stabilization methods become of importance. In the inviscid Burgers’ equation, initially smooth problems can become discontinuous. When a discontinuity forms, several issues can occur. For one, spurious oscillations can become apparent, or the velocity of the discontinuity can have errors. With several approaches, competitive results can be obtained. The discontinuity velocity is computed well, but spurious oscillation usually do occur. With several methods, the oscillations are suppressed. Not all approaches succeed in doing so. The third and final equation set to be tested, are the Euler equations. Although solutions can be found, all solutions contain errors. Several error sources are indicated, which should be addressed in further research. In comparison to a Monotonic Upstream-Centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) scheme, results need to be further improved to be on par. In conclusion, the suggested polynomials show potential. Several methods to improve solutions showed their usefulness. In linear advection, the new polynomials performed better compared to existing widely used methods. In non-linear advection, the results are on par with reference methods. For the Euler equations, further improvements are necessary. With further research, the benefits of such polynomials for numerical methods would become even more clear.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The JUICE spacecraft is an ESA mission to the Jovian system that will be launched in 2022. It will collect scientific data about Jupiter and its Galilean moons thanks to a flyby tour of Europa, Ganymede, Callisto and a final Ganymede orbiting phase. A high number of flybys will be performed with minimumaltitudes of 200 km. The tracking of the spacecraft during the flybys allows the estimation of the position of the spacecraft and the moons; in particular the knowledge of the moons positions can improve noticeably. However, due to the uncertainties in the positions of the moons and the spacecraft itself, a robust trajectory control is required for precise flyby targeting, to ensure that the nominal mission plan is achieved with the required margins. A preliminary navigation analysis for the mission JUICE has been developed, with the objective of the studying the influence of the spacecraft and moons positions uncertainties on the trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs). The navigation analysis is composed of an orbit determination covariance analysis and a guidance simulator. The covariance analysis determines the standard deviations of the parameters of interest, (spacecraft and moons initial states) from the observations computed along the trajectory of the spacecraft. Different parameters can be chosen for the covariance analysis in order to represent different mission conditions and tracking data performances. The guidance has the purpose of computing the necessary actions to bring back the spacecraft to the desired path after the nominal one has been perturbed with the spacecraft and moons positions uncertainties; these action are the TCMs, which are represented by a ¢V due to the high thrust engine of JUICE. Three different targeting algorithms have been implemented for the guidance, with different characteristics of accuracy and speed. Two statistical maneuvers per flybys have been implemented, the pre-flyby (targeting) maneuver and the post-flyby (cleanup) maneuver. The navigation analysis is performed using a Monte Carlo method, sampling with a normal distribution the results of the covariance analysis to obtain perturbed trajectories; statistical results are then computed. This is necessary because the results of the OD are to be interpreted in a statistical way; the real perturbed trajectory is always affected by an uncertainty. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the tracking data types has been performed for the covariance analysis. The results show that for JUICE an uncertainty of the level of a few hundred meters can be reached, if range and VLBI data are used. However these results are just indicative since Doppler data have not been included in the simulations. The uncertainty in the positions of the Galilean moons obtained thanks to the flybys depends highly from the tracking strategy used and the data types. With themost realistic configuration (tracking interrupted before the flyby and inclusion of all the past data), the level of uncertainty can arrive to a few tens of meters, with data accuracies of 0.2 m for the range and 0.1 nrad for the VLBI. These results are for the formal errors and it is known that they are usually overly optimistic; the true error will be higher. Moreover, the importance of optical data for a further uncertainty reduction has been proven. The improvement of the Galilean moons uncertainties along the Tour as data are continuously added is also observed. Sensitivity analysis with respect to the maneuver time and the maneuver execution errors have been performed for the Monte Carlo navigation analysis. The maneuver time has the highest influence on the size of a maneuver; each flyby presents a time for which the ¢V required to correct the trajectory is minimum. Very often this time is of 3 days before the flyby (for the targeting maneuver), as found often in literature; however many flybys have this minimum around 2 days before the flyby. The maneuver execution error has a limited impact on the total mission ¢V , but it can decrease the accuracy of the targeting, causing an higher miss distance at flyby. The total ¢V required to performthe flyby Tour varies considerably upon the different parameters chosen; using current level accuracies (1mfor the range and 1 nrad for VLBI) and a maneuver time of 3 days before (and after) the flyby, the result is ¢V Æ 13.5 m/s (around 0.67 m/s per flyby). This value includes the targeting and cleanup maneuvers; it is easily obtainable by the propulsion system of JUICE, concluding that it is possible to correct the trajectory for the uncertainties of JUICE and the moons with a small effort.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

(mentor); Jarquin Laguna, A. (mentor); Leontaris, G. (mentor); Hoogendoorn, C.F.D. (mentor)","2016","The increasing demand for electricity offers many opportunities for renewable energy production, of which one alternative is tidal stream energy. Several feasibility studies have shown that the global tidal stream energy potential can contribute significantly to producing renewable energy. This tidal energy can mostly be produced at the 'tidal hotspots', where the kinetic energy density is very high due to fast flowing tidal currents. However, the tidal technology is not yet cost competitive in comparison with other renewables, such as photovoltaic and wind energy, which is why further cost reductions and efficiency improvements are to be achieved. Interviews with existing tidal system developers provided insight in the cost breakdown and showed that maintenance accounts for a significant share of the total project costs. This is due to the harsh environmental conditions that impose a large uncertainty, which increase the complexity of selecting an optimal maintenance policy. Damen Shipyards has shown interest in entering the tidal industry and is exploring the cost reduction possibilities by developing their own tidal system. This thesis contributes to Damen Shipyards' research by performing a time series analysis of a tidal hotspot to identify and model the multivariate dependence of the governing environmental phenomena. A probabilistic decision support tool is developed for selecting the optimal maintenance policy. The decision support tool primarily determines when and to what extent corrective maintenance should be performed. The corresponding overall maintenance costs are also calculated and secondary information regarding the activity duration is given. By means of the probabilistic approach, which captures the weather window uncertainty due to the environmental randomness, the results can be interpreted by the user based on the desired confidence level. In this research the weather window uncertainty is implemented by simulating a large number of random, but statistically identical environmental time series, which are based on available measurement data of the tidal field at EMEC, located at the Orkney Islands in the United Kingdom. The multivariate dependence between the significant wave height, wave peak period, wind velocity and current velocity is identified in the measurement set and fully represented in the generated time series by means of a pair-copula construction simulation. The necessity for having time independence cannot be met in the original dataset, which is why a new simulation approach is developed. This method consists of a sequential simulation of pair-copula constructions to include both the time dependence and multivariate dependence in the synthetic time series. Simulation of the set of synthetic time series showed to be more effective for describing uncertainty with respect to exclusively using the original dataset, due to the possibility of including more environmental realizations. The tidal array is represented as a semi-Markov decision process, which captures all costs and transition processes related to the deterioration and maintenance decisions. A policy optimization algorithm can then be used to find the optimal set of decisions and the corresponding maintenance cost rate which includes both the direct and indirect maintenance costs. The novel tidal system design of Damen Shipyards is then plugged into the decision support tool to determine the optimal maintenance policy and maintenance costs. The effect of different levels of detail for representing the tidal system have been compared and the benefits in terms of cost reductions of using this decision support tool with respect to less advanced approaches have been highlighted. Furthermore, multiple scenarios have been elaborated to identify the sensitivities in the cases of accounting for unreliability in the failure rates, varying the number of platforms in the array and including the economic fluctuations of the maintenance vessel day rates.","probabilistic; tidal energy; maintenance policy; optimization; semi-Markov decision process; copula, multivariate dependence; decision support tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

A rising water demand in the Kathmandu Valley is initiated by urbanisation with a rate of 4.7 % per year and amplified by a growing trend of per capita water consumption. At the same time, water availability seems to deteriorate. However, the severity of the problem is hardly known due to immense data gaps. This research aims to (1) estimate the urban water demand from literature research, (2) collect new field data about spring and stream flow, water quality, and ecological stream health, and (3) analyse remotely sensed data in order to characterise the linkages and inter-dependencies between land use, hydrology, and water quality in the Kathmandu Valley. The field data were collected in August and September 2016 and helped to get a decent picture of the water situation. The landuse classification performed using Landsat 8 images had an accuracy of 88 % and proved to be a meaningful source of data to link to the other research topics. Automated SEBAL was attempted to be used for computing evapotranspiration estimates but cannot successfully be used in mountainous areas yet. Penman-Monteith equation was used as alternative. A simplified water balance was performed for the months of August and September 2015. The outcome showed estimates to be 2, 2 x 106 m3/d for ET, 5.6 x 106 m3/d for precipitation, 2.0 x 106 m3/d for the Bagmati outflow and 1.4 x 106 m3/d for groundwater infiltration. To be able to comment on long term groundwater depletion, an annual water budget needs to be performed. The clearest influence on water quality parameters (pH, DO, EC and Rapid Stream Assessment class) was found to be the presence of developed area. With more than 20 % developed area within the considered sub-watershed, the water becomes of such poor quality that it cannot be used for any purpose without extensive treatment. In the headwater areas of the Valley, a significant amount of water with a higher quality (i.e. drinking water) is found in the streams. In September 2016 the total inflow of drinkable water to the Valley floor was estimated to be at least 1.0 x 106 m3/d. This value cannot be considered as fully available for anthropogenic purposes, as water needs to remain in the streams in order to not jeopardise ecosystem services and other functions.","Multidisciplinary Project; Water Budget; Remote Sensing; Monsoon; Hydrology; Ecological Streamhealth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","","27.700769, 85.300140"

(mentor); Looye, G. (mentor)","2016","In the context of fault-tolerant flight control (FTFC), various types of incremental nonlinear control methods have been previously proposed that should overcome important challenges that are imposed by the use of nonlinear, model-based flight control systems. This work presents an analysis, design and implementation of promising incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) and incremental backstepping (IBS) control laws for a fixed-wing aircraft. Flight tests on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) validate the control design and confirm many of the advantages of these methods. A summary of the contribution is split up into three parts. First, an analysis is done on the performance of incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion for angular rate control. Incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion is shown to see great similarities with ordinary PI(D) control. When not including the actuators of the system, the gains of an incremental PI controller can be derived from the INDI control law, yielding an equivalent control law. In a similar manner, similarities can be derived between INDI and a non-incremental PI control law that does not need a feedback of the state derivative. Simulations on a model of the fixed-wing UAV support the findings. Besides a comparison with PI control, the validity of the assumptions of incremental methods are assessed for the case of angular rate control for fixed-wing aircraft. Steady state tracking errors in the inner control loop are caused by the assumption that the control-independent part of the acceleration does not change significantly. The steady state errors are directly related to the so-called increment delay, the effective time over which an incremental control action is given. Hence, the negative effect of neglecting the system dynamics increments can be mitigated by using faster actuators or by decreasing the acceleration measurement delay. Secondly, integrated controller designs are presented for the attitude control of the aircraft. Control laws are designed for both the Euler attitude angles, as well as for the aerodynamic attitude. This is done using multi-loop nonlinear dynamic inversion and the Lyapunov-based backstepping procedure, yielding a multi-loop INDI and an IBS controller. Supported with model validation using flight data from open-loop experiments, the robustness of the controllers is demonstrated. Furthermore, the IBS aerodynamic attitude controller has been extended with an extra incremental backstepping loop to control the flight path angle and the airspeed. Finally, flight tests are performed that validate the controller designs. Mainly qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the flight results. The INDI controller that controls the Euler attitude angles has been successfully tested in nominal flight. Simulated controller responses match closely with flight measurements. Also, a manually controlled flight with this INDI control law as augmented control has been performed. In the longest experiment, lasting 241 seconds, the longitudinal and lateral mode were excited with pitch angles of ±22 deg and roll angles of ±50 deg. The IBS controller that controls the aerodynamic attitude was tested in both longitudinal and lateral mode, during separate maneuvers. Although results show a stable response to angle of attack commands, the lack of a good estimate of the angle of attack limits the applicability. The lateral mode of the aircraft was only tested with conservative, non-nominal gains. The results correspond to the expected response, but subsequent tests must be performed for a full validation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-15","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor); Langeveld, J.G. (mentor); Duinmeijer, S.P.A. (mentor); Luxemburg, W.M.J. (mentor)","2016","Fat, oil and grease (FOG) deposits are one of the leading causes of sewer system blockages, thereby increasing the risks of undesired and polluting flooding and sewer overflows. FOG accumulates throughout the entire sewer network; e.g., in public sewer pipes and lateral house connections it reduces the available discharge capacity, and in pump sumps it increases the risk of pump failures. Previous studies primarily focused on FOG deposits occurring in parts of sewer systems downstream of Food Service Establishments (FSE). It is thought, however, that domestic FOG disposal is also an important contributor to FOG deposits, and therefore warrants further investigation. Consequently, the objective of this research was to investigate the relationship between domestic FOG disposal patterns and the occurrence of FOG deposits in sewer systems. By considering both the household scale and the scale of catchments, it was possible to study the influence of individual and population disposal patterns. The first part of this study focused on the influence of individual disposal patterns; samples of FOG deposits were collected from clogged building drainage systems and questionnaires were conducted to reveal information about the household’s cooking and disposal habits. Only three out of the eleven households showed a link between the cooking fats and oils used and the FOG deposits collected, as their fatty acid profiles displayed similarities. The second part of this study focused on the influence of population disposal patterns on the occurrence of FOG deposits, by studying the severe accumulation of FOG at pumping stations in relation to catchment demographics and sewer system characteristics. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) procedures were used to model the probability of the presence or absence of FOG in pump sumps. The model revealed that severe accumulation of FOG in pump sumps was negatively correlated to the average income of inhabitants attached to the catchment, suggesting that individuals within an income-group shared FOG disposal patterns. Furthermore, FSE density and kinetic energy of wastewater per unit of volume per day were found to be important factors correlated with the occurrence of FOG deposits.

(mentor); Hendriks, B. (mentor)","2016","The transition from open surgery to laparoscopic procedures, which is motivated by the improved surgical outcomes and lower overall costs, limits however the amount of information the surgeon can have access to during surgery. To compensate for the lack of visual feedback and palpitation, which are not possible using only the laparoscope camera, research is working to generate additional intra-operative navigational aids to support the surgeon throughout complex procedures. The work presented in this thesis project wants to generate an image guided surgical system by making use of image registration between the 3D patient volumes, such as a CT scan, and the perspective of a laparoscope camera. To generate this Laparoscopic augmented reality, three main steps were implemented and tested: calibration for the camera, instrument tracking for the laparoscope camera and the registration of the 3D CT volume to the 2D pose of the camera image. The implementation for camera calibration followed Zhengyou Zhang's mathematical calibration model, adapted to an ellipsoidal calibration plate. The optical tracking for the laparoscope camera made use Philips's L2C optical tracking system, which is composed of a set of 4 cameras attached to the detector head of a C-arm Allura Clarity system, which was used to generate an intra-operative CT scan of the volume. The registration made use instead of pose estimation to combine the 3D positions of a set of optical markers placed on the skin of the patient to the 2D positions of the same markers from the camera's perspective.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A series of core-flood tests were performed to evaluate the EOR potential of some immiscible N2 injection schemes. Injections were conducted either in a (1) continuous mode or (2) water-alternating-gas (WAG) mode into Bentheimer sandstone cores previously saturated with model synthetic oil. Furthermore, CT imaging has been utilized in some tests to visualize the flow and to obtain the saturation profile. The CT-obtained saturation profile was consistent with the volumetric measurements. Injection strategies resulted in considerable oil recovery factors relative to oil initially in place (OIIP), but the values were different in each scheme. Three of the continuous N2 injections in a secondary mode, starting after the primary drainage stage, led to the recoveries of 48.7 %, 49.6 % and 50.8 % for 16.5 injected PV. The aforementioned tests differed in back pressures with higher back pressures resulting in higher recoveries. Test 4, water flooding followed by N2 flooding resulted in an ultimate recovery of 52.6 %, 17.1 % of which was due to gas injection. Test 5, N2 WAG with a WAG ratio of nearly 1:6 yielded the highest recovery among all concluding with an ultimate recovery of 59.0 %. Mechanism for to oil recovery by gas injection is elaborated in view of the obtained experimental results and based on the concepts of two- and three-phase flow. Implications of the different injection schemes are discussed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","C24B79",""

(mentor)","2016","Machine learning approaches are increasingly successful in medical image analysis. Still, learning from MR images poses some serious challenges. Scanner-dependent characteristics effect feature representations directly and hamper the clinical implementation of otherwise successful supervised-learning techniques. To compensate for variations in scanner output, transfer learning approaches have recently been proposed in MR image segmentation. Although some improvements have been reported, these methods require multiple labeled sources from different scanners. We propose a transfer learning method that requires a single labeled source. The method aims to align source and target sample distributions in feature space by matching medians of class-intensities between the target image and the source. Subsequently, labels are transferred from the source samples to the target image, followed by fuzzy clustering and class-intensity estimation. Using these estimations, two different intensity-matching approaches are evaluated. Experiments on voxel wise MRI brain-tissue segmentation showed the potential of the method compared to standard intensity normalization. However, the number of classes for initialization proved to be critical to estimate reliable class-intensities. Initialization for an incorrect number of classes produced suboptimal solutions, causing classification performance to deteriorate. Establishing the correct number of classes therefore remains crucial to attain satisfactory results.","magnetic resonance; transfer learning; nearest neighbor; image segmentation; protocols","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Pattern Recognition Laboratory","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); van der Veen, C. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor)","2016","A high number of concrete bridges that were built in the Netherlands around half a century ago and which had a transversely prestressed thin deck, nowadays raise a series of questions regarding their structural integrity. This is because their service life has been affected over time by a substantial rise in the number of vehicles that transit them and the considerable increase in the loads applied by these vehicles upon the structure. The concern amplifies when it is highlighted that these structures were designed according to old codes that were valid during that period, codes that have been substantially modified in the course of time. Having all this that needs to be taken into account, it is of high interest to determine how safe these structures are today. One phenomenon that in time would have left its mark on the structural integrity of these bridges is fatigue. This can be defined as the deterioration in time due to a repetitive loading. A large array of studies were dedicated to the topic of fatigue of concrete, aiming at a better understanding of its behaviour, impact and consequences upon a structure. However, throughout this extensive research that also analysed failed structures, fatigue was never found to be the primary mechanism that led to failure, but its contribution was acknowledged and, as a consequence, investigations on this topic are still of current interest. Of great importance is also the phenomenon of compressive membrane action (CMA) that is characteristic to concrete slabs and has a beneficial influence on the structure, leading to an increase in the capacity, being highly influenced by the degree of restraint At Delft University of Technology, a couple of research programs that were performed recently tried to shed some light on both of the previously described topics. The study done on fatigue gave promising results, with its outcome being found to fit together with other researches performed worldwide. A follow-up study based solely on fatigue will start in the near future, this having as objective the impact of the loading sequence. In anticipation of this new study, in order to see to what extent the previous results can be replicated numerically and future ones forecasted, a FEA model for fatigue assessment and prediction was created and its accuracy was evaluated, this being the scope of the Master’s Thesis. For the development of the finite element model, departure points had to be set for each main phase. For the construction and calibration phase, the point of departure meant the use of a two-dimensional model for describing the behaviour of the real life structure, namely the evolution of stresses, deterioration and failure mode. For the second phase, the one related to replicating and assessing the fatigue damage, the departure point meant assuming a uniform alteration in the material properties due to the cyclic loading, modification considered at a structural level.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

There was no method available for the quantification of the material behavior in with this failure mechanism. Therefor the goal of this research was to develop a mechanical test method for quantification of fatigue fracture behavior of a material when a crack is present. One way of improving the lifetime of a shoe is with the use of self-healing material. Therefore a preliminary test has been done with a self-healing material. A new developed fracture fatigue test is designed with the help of a fracture mechanical J-integral test and an unconventional method for finding the point of crack initiation. Instead of using CTOD for finding crack initiation a new proposed r-squared-method is used. The results from the single fracture tests are used as inputs for the fatigue test. From the J-integral test the r-squared-method is validated with a CTOD analysis. Visual comparison fracture surfaces showed that the fatigue test gives a similar failure mechanism as found in the shoes. The test not only showed to represent the failure mechanism but also resulted in quantifiable results. It was possible to make lifetime predictions of the materials and the first preliminary test on a self-healing material showed promising results for future research.","sports engineering; j-test; fracture mechanics; fatigue; outsole; self-healing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor)","2016",": The Air-Wake produced by a ship superstructure is a complex, highly turbulent and unsteady three-dimensional flow, which contains large flow features that interact with the helicopter rotor during critical take-off and landing procedures. An international research effort (TTCP, AER-TP2) which involves experimental and numerical studies on simplified frigate shapes SFS has been conducted with the aim of understanding and simulating the ship air-wake. An unexpected asymmetry of the time-averaged air-wake flow has been noted when the model is oriented parallel to the free-stream direction. In this condition, it has been suggested that the flow features a bi-stable behavior which requires further investigation. During this research project the air-wake flow dynamics on the landing deck of a simplified frigate shape (SFSN) modified by the Netherlands Aerospace Laboratory has been studied using time-resolved large-scale Tomographic Particle Tracking Velocimetry with helium filled soap bubbles. The results show that the time-average flow-field at head-wind condition (ß=0º) on the SFSN present a slight asymmetrical stream-wise velocity distribution, where higher velocity deficits are located on the starboard-side of the model. The time-averaged air-wake structure suggests that the horse-shoe vortex structure from the funnel super-structure convects downstream and interacts with the flow-field on the landing deck. Moreover, the analysis revealed that, as expected, an arch vortex is present in the proximity of the step wall. A low order reconstruction led to an unambiguous identification of the recirculation region on the instantaneous measurements, where the velocity difference between both sides of the deck is calculated. Based on this difference, three flow-states (PS port-side, SB Starboard side and SY symmetric) have been identified. An alternation factor was calculated to determine the number of occurrences of each flow state and the consecutive time that the flow remained on a specific state. This result suggests that at head-wind condition the flow is stable for either (PS, SB) and unstable for (SY) which is considered to be a transitional state. This shows that the air-wake flow of the SFSN at headwind condition is bi-stable and that the bi-stability is restricted to the range ß=+/- 1º degree of yaw. The results from the probability based on the number of occurrence of each flow state show that at head-wind condition the flow state SB presents a higher probability than the flow state PS, which explains the slight asymmetry observed on the stream-wise time-averaged velocity distribution. Finally, the experimental results obtained during this research project contribute to the area of knowledge by characterizing, in spatial and time domains, this complicated bi-stable flow using a three-dimensional flow measurement technique. Moreover, the experimental campaign performed at the Low Speed Wind Tunnel of the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels show that it is possible to perform large-scale flow measurements using time-resolved Tomographic Particle Tracking Velocimetry with HFSB in an industrial wind tunnel facility. This opens new possibilities to the study of aerodynamic industrial applications and more specifically three-dimensional bi-stable bluff-body air-wakes.","Wind Tunnel Testing; Tomographic PTV; Bluff-body; Bi-stability; Simplified Frigate Shapes; Ship Air-Wakes; Aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Department of Aerodynamics","","","",""

We believe that this issue is caused by the many man hours needed to create and place these ornaments. To tackle this issue we propose The Blueprint Approach. Inspired by the architect's blueprint our approach allows the user to define the procedures for placement of ornaments. Given an input facade, the approach calculates the underlying blueprint. Afterwards, the user can use operations to define the procedures for placement of ornaments. As a result the approach outputs a facade with the placed ornaments on it. Next to that, the created pipelines can be reused on other input facades and thus reducing the man hours needed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Comp Graphics & Visualisation","",""

Located several kilometres offshore, the transmission cable resistance becomes substantial. To limit the losses, the voltage in the cables is increased in a substation.

Topside structures for the oil \& gas industry generally require to be ventilated in order to prevent gas stacking. The equipment in the substation module, however, is vulnerable for the corrosive sea environment. Therefore, the structure needs to be sheltered. Hereby, the question rises if a weight reduction can be obtained by incorporating the shelter in the structural design.

Then a frame form the simplified model is chosen as a basis for the comparison. For a single governing load combination, two designs are constructed: a beam-column design complying to the conventional oil \& gas design practice and a stressed skin design that incorporates the sheltering wall as a structural element. Both of the designs are then compared on steel mass and weld labour. The stressed skin design is found to be considerably lighter than the beam-column design. However, in terms of welds, the stressed skin design consists of a higher weld volume and a higher weld pass length. These aspects contribute to the total manufacturing costs of the design. Concluding, both of the designs have their advantages and disadvantages. It is made clear that applying the dividing wall as a structural element in the format of a stressed skin design provides a competitive design in terms of structural mass and weld labour.

(mentor)","2016","Small rockets have the potential to play an important role in the changes that are now occurring in the spaceflight domain. Currently, satellite miniaturization is opening up new possibilities to form constellations capable of full-time global coverage for internet service, real-time earth observation applications, and disaster monitoring. Such programs involving small satellites require low-cost and frequent access to orbit. A new class of launch vehicles is uniquely positioned to offer these small satellites dedicated access to space, with no restrictions on target orbit height or inclination traditionally associated with current rideshare arrangements. A number of new launch service providers has stepped up to this challenge, developing systems with decreased size and payload capability in a commercial way. Their offerings are priced lower than costs traditionally associated with a rocket launch. However, most of these firms do not have hardware in production yet, so the question arises whether or not these early price quotes are realistic with respect to the actual costs incurred. This research has made a first step towards answering this question, by developing a way to estimate costs for such systems in partnership with the European Space Agency’s Cost Engineering Section. All aspects of the estimating process were addressed, from gathering and selecting data, to building Cost Estimating Relationships, detailing cost-risks, and employing existing - and developing new - parametric relationships, whilst exploring their applicability to systems that have a lower payload capacity and gross lift-off weight than traditionally larger rockets. An early phase parametric cost estimate was synthesized with which it is now possible to approximate for commercial liquid and solid propellant rockets in the 100-700 kg payload range the development, production and operating costs, and their cost-based price per flight to within 20% of reported costs. By doing so at an equipment-level depth, novel contributions to theory could be made by adapting the Theoretical First Unit T1method of estimating,mirroring the reductions in cost achieved by commercial launch operators through profit retention and reduced subcontractor management effort. Whilst exploring these new launch vehicles’ costs, it was also discovered that small rockets in particular require a launch rate of over 4 per year to keep program commercialization expenses fromcausing up to a threefold increase in launch prices. An ESA liquid methane vehicle concept was central to the estimate; it was however concluded that this rocket ineffectively addresses the LEO market at a price point that is too high to gainmarket share. Nonetheless, other future proposals for small launch systems can now be evaluated for their cost feasibility, either by potential investors or agencies seeking shared technology development with commercial partners.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-31","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hicks, M.A. (mentor); Pisanò, F. (mentor); Verichev, S. (mentor); Yenigul, B. (mentor)","2016","A landfall operation is conducted whenever a pipeline reaches the shore, during this operation the pipeline is pulled onto shore with the help of a steel wire rope. Allseas engineering has experienced several cases of landfalls during which the friction forces along the steel wire rope rose to excessively high levels. These cases occurred at locations where dense fine sands were situated. Two questions are important with respect to this event, namely how these excessively high forces can be prevented and where these excessively high force originate from. During this research, the effect of transverse vibrations on the pull-out resistance of a steel wire rope buried in a sand body, is investigated. This is done by studying the dynamic behaviour of a steel wire rope as well as the dynamic behaviour of the sand body, in an experimental set-up. Different tests have been carried out, with different frequencies (46 Hz - 134 Hz), different amplitudes (0.3 mm - 3 mm) and two different diameter steel wire ropes (6 mm and 12 mm). During these tests the tension in the steel wire rope has been measured by means of a load cell, other than that pore pressures and accelerations in x-, y-, and z- directions along the steel wire rope have been measured, the longitudinal displacement of the wire has been registered by a load cell. The set-up consists out of a container with a soil compartment in which a dense (80%) sand sample has been prepared for each different test, a winch that delivers the pulling motion and a tension structure that provides tension in the steel wire rope. A pneumatic linear piston vibration actuator is connected to the steel wire rope. Before the test set-up has been designed, an outline of the theoretical framework has been presented. The relevant theory has been explained after which it has been used to design the set-up. The results show a clear reduction in pull-out force of the steel wire rope when subject to vibrations, for all different frequencies and amplitudes. The greatest reduction in pull-out force is obtained for a frequency of 76 Hz, the reduction in pull-out force is 53% for the steel wire rope of 6 mm diameter. The relative reductions in pull-out force for the 12 mm steel wire rope are comparable with those obtained for the 6 mm one. When the relative reduction in pull-out force is divided by the power demand of the used vibration, the most efficient frequency can be obtained. By doing so the most efficient tested frequency was found at 46 Hz. However, if the scope is extended to the range in which no tests were done, the frequency range between 1 Hz and 46 Hz tends to be most efficient, this is not confirmed in this research. It is confirmed that dilation plays an important role in the pull-out process of a steel wire rope. The dilation is accompanied by a temporary negative excess pore pressure during an instant of undrained conditions, this negative excess pore pressure counteracts the dilation that would occur. When the water has had enough time to flow inside the pores of the sheared sand volume, dilation occurs and the process continues in a drained manner. It is assumed that this behaviour causes the excessively high pull-out forces experienced during landfall operations. The reasoning behind the reduction in pull-out force due to vibrations can be found in a reduction of the angle of external friction of the sand-steel wire rope interface. No positive excess pore pressures are measured during the experiments, the effective stress in the sand body is unaffected by the vibrations. Also, the negative excess pore pressure that develops during regular pull-out, is measured during tests where vibrations are applied. The attenuation of the vibration is measured during another set of tests, it has been proven that the vibrations are damped to a very small magnitude once they enter the soil body. However, these small magnitude vibrations maintain over longer distances and are not attenuated a lot. These small vibrations also have enough effect to cause a reduction in pull-out force. The motion of the steel wire rope in the sand body, subject to vibrations is simulated using an analytical model. It has been shown that the analytical model holds for the system, but can't deal with small displacements that occur in the sand body. A second analytical model is presented in which a certain amplitude at the sand boundary has been assumed. This model is capable of dealing with the small displacements, however a numerical model would be more accurate and convenient. Consequently, a method has been proposed to build a numerical model for the problem.","sand; soil mechanics; vibrations; transverse; experimental work; cyclic loading; pull-out resistance; steel wire rope; pore pressures; friction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Alijani, F. (mentor); Herder, J.L. (mentor)","2016","In the past decades research on Active Vibration Control (AVC) has found increasing interest in control of flexible thin-walled structures, mainly made of new advanced materials such as composite carbon fibre. These types of composite structures combine high stiffness with good flexibility in achieving complex shapes, and are mostly used in automotive and aerospace applications where they are often subjected to undesirable vibrations. In the field of AVC, a new type of sensor and actuator have become popular by using so-called smart materials, such as piezoelectric materials. Given their distributed nature, they can be easily mounted on different types of structures, thus making them smart structures. State-of-the-art controllers, such as Positive Position Feedback (PPF), are very sensitive to spillover effect due to uncontrolled vibration modes, and therefore they are found to be difficult to tune in the case of multi-mode control. Another important aspect regarding the controller is that, apart from being able to reduce structural vibrations, it should ensure robustness and closed-loop stability for the controlled system. In this sense, careful positioning of sensors and actuators can have a great influence. With the motivation of improving on the limitations of state-of-the-art controllers, in this thesis a novel AVC strategy based on fractional-order calculus is proposed, developed, and successfully applied in practice. First, a fractional-order Positive Position Feedback (PPF) compensator is proposed to overcome the limitations of the commonly used integer-order PPF such as: frequency spillover, amplitude amplification in quasi-static region of the closed-loop response, and difficult tuning in multi-mode control. Tuning parameters of the controller are obtained by optimizing both magnitude and phase response of the controlled plant. Results are shown by comparing performances of the standard integer-order PPF and the optimized fractional-order PPF, both on a simple 1-DOF plant and on measured frequency response data from a rectangular carbon fibre/epoxy composite plate with free edges. Secondly, a second version of the fractional-order PPF is proposed, and compared to the other controllers for the AVC of a rectangular carbon fibre/epoxy composite plate with free edges. The plate is excited orthogonally by a modal vibration exciter and controlled by Macro Fibre Composite (MFC) transducers. Vibration measurements are taken with a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) system. MFC actuator and sensor are positioned on the plate based on maximal modal strain criterion, in order to control the second natural mode of the plate. Both integer and fractional-order PPFs allow for the second mode to be effectively controlled, although the newly proposed fractional-order controllers are found to be more efficient in achieving the same performance with less actuation voltage, and more promising in reducing the spillover effect due to uncontrolled modes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","","",""

(mentor); Kolahdouz Esfahani, Z. (mentor)","2016",": Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have made remarkable progress since their invention and today they can be found in a wide range of applications such as TV remotes, automotive headlamps, general lighting, traffic signals, camera flashes, display and screens. LEDs that emit light in the ultraviolet-C (UV-C) range are used in applications such as air/water purification and sterilization. Cost per chip of these LEDs is relatively higher than the blue LEDs due to the expensive manufacturing process and low demand. But, the market for these LEDs in applications such as water purification is expected to grow in the coming years into a multimillion dollar market resulting in high volume manufacturing and low cost of chips. Consequently there will be a need for high volume and cost effective packaging solution with excellent thermal and optical performance. Existing packaging technologies like ceramic and lead frame packaging are expensive, less productive, and offer limited processing options. Meanwhile, wafer level packaging is a highly productive and cost-effective solution. Today, Silicon is the most common substrate of the integrated circuits. Moreover, its close coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) with the LED base materials such as GaN and AlGaN, and the high thermal conductivity make it a good choice as a substrate of UV-C wafer level package. In this study we developed a silicon wafer level packaging approach combining advanced processes such as through silicon via (TSV) technology and chip to wafer (C2W) bonding for flip chip UV-C LEDs. We have integrated Si reflector cups for redirecting light from the sidewalls of UV-C LEDs using suitable material such as Aluminum. Complexities of a monolithic flow and the advantages of a dual wafer flow will be discussed. A new method to establish the interconnection in TSVs with metal nano pastes (MNPs) is introduced. The current vs voltage characteristics, optical performances, merits of reflectors, and improvements in spectral distributions of each package are measured and characterized. Different ways of bonding the chips to the submount and the thermal resistances of each package are studied. In conclusion we demonstrate the fabrication of a wafer level package for UV-C LEDs with a new cost effective TSV interconnection method using MNPs. We also show that sidewall emission of the LEDs is redirected with almost no loss in light which will be suitable for applications like water purification and protein analysis where the target doesn’t encapsulate the LED.","wafer level packaging; UV-C light; LED; Nano metal paste; Through silicon vias; 3D wafer lithography; 3D wafer processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Components, Technology and Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The reduction of waste materials is an important step towards a more circular economy. Within the mattress industry, the focus on sustainability and recycling has increased substantially over the last few years. In the Netherlands and a few other European countries the recycling of mattresses is strongly encouraged or made mandatory by local and national government. Matras Recycling Europe B.V. (MRE) is a Dutch company that specialises in the collection and disassembly of used mattresses. In order for this business to be viable and to increase the circularity of the entire mattress industry, it is important to find a suitable application for each of the materials of a used mattress. This thesis focusses on researching the potential of the outer layer of the mattress: mattress ticking. The main research question in this thesis is: How can recycled ticking materials be used to design and create value? The Material Driven Design method (Karana et al., 2015) is applied as a framework to structure the design process, combined with tools and methodology centred around the sustainable business model archetype ‘Create value from ‘waste’’ (Bocken et al., 2014). The context and company are analysed to provide a starting point for the material exploration. The potential of the mattress ticking is explored by tinkering with various ways of manipulating the material, based on a range of variables. The resulting material samples are discussed with a focus group, which led to insights on the perception and experiential value of the materials. A benchmark study compared the mattress material to other recycled textile materials, composite materials and established materials. A questionnaire was used to gain further insights in perception of these materials. The benchmark also discusses a set of inspiring projects and their business models. The characterisation of the material qualities and the benchmark led to the following Material Experience Vision: Creating a unique product with recycled mattress ticking that shows the material’s origin by resembling nighttime and uses the contrasting properties of the material to provide comfort and inspire users to rethink the value of waste. This vision aims to combine the main perspectives of this thesis: company driven, sustainability driven and a material driven perspective. The previous phases are used as input of ideation and concept development. Five ideas are chosen to further explore: Slippers, pet products, nightstand, acoustic panels and the pack pillow. After further development, the concepts are compared based on a set of criteria. The nightstand product is chosen to further develop, mostly because of the way it fits into the mattress industry and how it promotes circularity. The nightstand is further developed to increase functionality and add value. The final product consists of three elements, which can be assemble in different set-ups to adjust the height and appearance. The base and middle elements provide storage, while the top element can also be used as a tray. This product is evaluated with a 1:1 prototype in a qualitative user study. In the final design phase, the value for each of the involved stakeholders is analysed and a set of scenarios for future development are proposed. The thesis is concluded with further recommendations about the development of the material and the product design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Peatlands in the Netherlands suffer from continued surface subsidence and accumulation of suspended sediments which leads to poor water quality. Excess suspended sediments are currently being deposited in depots on peatlands as a sustainable method for reusing sediment and to compensate for surface subsidence. The general consensus of researchers is to credit the majority of surface subsidence of peatlands to oxidation of organic matter. To assess this, the effect of organic matter and initial water content on the shrinkage and water retention behaviour was studied. Additionally, the effect of organic matter on gas formation was researched, along with the main mechanism for such an occurrence. From the peatland Wormer & Jisperveld, dredged sediments were collected from a depot and core samples were also taken over the course of three years. Soil characterisation tests were carried out and a novel approach of combining the extended evaporation method with computed tomography was used. Experiments were varied by differing the organic and initial water contents, through chemical removal (H2O2) of organic matter and fan drying, respectively. Results show that decreasing the organic content reduced liquid limit of the sediment. The effect of organic matter on the shrinkage characteristics is not significant for the range of water contents relevant during the desiccation process observed in the field. Only normal shrinkage was observed at near saturated conditions, where the loss of water volume is equal to the loss of bulk soil volume. Additionally, the effect of organic mat- ter on the water retention characteristic greatly reduces the water content at a given suction level. Varying the initial water content changes the onset of the water retention characteristic, while the curve’s shape was barely influenced. Slight variation of retention behaviour likely due to natural oxidation of organic matter. For the shrinkage characteristic only the onset was influenced. Computed tomography illustrated that the effect of organic matter stimulates gas formation within the sediment. Gradual movement of the gas, aggregation, bubble growth and ebullition events were also observed. The main mechanism of gas formation could not be determined with the applied test methods. However, it is considered to have been caused by either exsolution of dissolved methane, oxidation of organic matter or a combination of both. Further research would be needed for verification.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Level 1 main assembly, including the product portfolio configuration and main assembly activities such as; the production of standard sections on stock. Level 2 sub-assembly, which includes shifting outfitting activities from being performed on board to the workshop where standard and modular outfitting units are produced which fit different systems and components and are interchangeable between different ship types. Level 3 components, standardising within and between ship types to achieve a purchase advantage, increase in-house knowledge and improve service and quality. The effect of changing the production strategy to assemble-to-order instead of make-to-stock has also been investigated.

This causes rapid growth of offshore wind turbine foundations (monopiles). Currently, monopiles are installed using jack-up vessels like Aeolus. However operations will be limited by crane capacity and its cost-effectiveness is subject to discussion. Therefore floating vessels are preferred for future monopile installation; although little is known about the interaction between ship and monopile during the pile driving process. This research focusses on the multi-body behaviour of a floating structure connected to a monopile which is partly penetrated in the seabed. Frequency domain calculations are performed in combination with spectral analyses to investigate floating monopile installation with HLV Svanen and a monohull concept. It is shown that the natural period of the multi-body system shifts towards the working conditions (wave period) of HLV Svanen. Therefore pile release is advised to avoid resonance during monopile installation. It is concluded that increasing scale of monopiles hardly affects the performance of HLV Svanen, while a monohull concept does not significantly improve the performance of floating monopile installation. However a new gripper design should be introduced to ensure structural integrity of the upscaling monopiles.","Monopile installation; Ship motions; Multi-body dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics","",""

They are expected to be a significant part of the total iron loss. The reader is introduced to currently known methods to study high-frequency iron loss estimation and end-effects in laminated media. No suitable method is found. Therefore, an experimental approach is presented. A short-axial laminated stator core is exposed to high-frequency excitation fields generated by coils with normal and extended end-winding heights. The proposed experimental method is verified numerically with a simplified brute-force 3D finite element model. Significant less losses are measured and calculated for the extended end-winding case. The results show that most of the high-frequency losses are induced in the stator end laminations near the end-winding. In addition, it is found that the traditional eddy-current model underestimates the modelled results significantly if a wrong peak magnetic flux density is used. With both the experimental and numerical approach, it is shown that the impact of high-frequency end-winding induced iron losses on the total core loss cannot be neglected in iron loss estimation methods for short axial high-speed electrical machines with concentrated windings.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","",""

(mentor); Dwight, R.P. (mentor); Timmer, W.A. (mentor)","2016","Bobsleighing is one of the fastest winter sports and races are decided within seconds over total times up to four minutes. Therefore marginal gains in performance of the bobsleigh and its crew can determine the race outcome. In order to improve the performance of a bobsleigh the aerodynamic drag can be investigated. A bobsleigh consists of two parts which are connected pivotally: the nose and the rear part of the sleigh. In a track curve the bobsleigh nose will be misaligned with the rear cowling. This phenomena is believed to influence the aerodynamic drag of a bobsleigh. Therefore the objective of this research is to investigate the effect of cowling misalignment between front and rear cowling on the aerodynamic drag of a two-man bobsleigh. To analyse this effect on the aerodynamic drag two types of drag measuring campaigns are performed: wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations. Flowvisualisation (bothwoollen tuft measurements and particle image velocimetry) is performed and force measurements are executed on a simplified bobsleigh model in the wind tunnel. As bobsleigh features such as bumpers, skies and frame are influencing the flow behaviour these are not integrated in the model such that the measurements solely focus on the effect of nose rotation. Next to these wind tunnel measurements numerical simulations are performed on the samemodel to predict and visualise the internal and external bobsleigh flow behaviour. A bobsleigh is a bluff body which means that the drag is mostly influenced by the geometry and flow separation causing a pressure difference between the flow in front of and the flow trailing the body. This pressure difference causes a suction force on the bobsleigh which accounts for the major drag component. As the air flows over the bobsleigh it separates behind the head of the pilot and at the cowling edges. A low pressure region is therefore seen behind the pilot and brakeman which causes the the external streamlines to be sucked into the cavity. This causes a low pressure wake with rotational flows. It is shown that the aerodynamic drag increases with nose rotation. This increase is partly due to the fact that the frontal area increases with nose rotation. The flow stagnates on one side of the body whereas an overlap is found on the opposite site of the bobsleigh. Behind this overlap a separated region develops where air enters the nose due to backflow in the separation bubble behind the nose on the rear body. This separated flow reattaches to the rear body such that an effective frontal area increase increases the aerodynamic drag. However, it is found that this effective frontal area increase is not the only contributor to the total drag. The air entering the nose influences the internal flow behaviour causing a loss inmomentumdue to the internal blockage imposed by both the crew and the equipment. As the distance between the nose and rear cowling increases the aerodynamic drag increases as well. In order to minimise the influence of nose rotation on the aerodynamic drag a shape optimisation of the nose is recommended. This can lead to better aerodynamic performance of the bobsleigh both on a straight track segment as in a curve.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

There are three main arguments for removing the military ordnance: environmental protection, human safety and project related. Current study will focus on the project related removal of munition, specifically for offshore wind cable installation projects. Recovery of UXO is often preferred over redirection of the cable route due to cost savings. Current state of the art methods use dedicated clearance ROV's and divers to remove the munition ordnance. However, these methods prove to be dangerous, inefficient or even impossible to use in shallow water areas (0-10 m) with strong tidal currents. The objective of current study is to develop a remotely-operated munitions detection and removal concept for use in coastal water areas and assess its feasibility. First, a programme of requirements for the novel concept is obtained. During a systematic ideation process, fifteen different conceptual ideas are conceived and compared in a multi-criteria analysis from which the most promising concept is chosen: an excavator carrying a munitions toolskid on a moored pontoon. The second part of the study focuses on assessing the feasibility of the proposed concept for two project sites. Specifically for this study, the workability in waves is assessed. Limiting criteria are defined for two critical components on the munitions toolskid to ensure a safe operation; the motion amplitude of the detection coils, limited to X cm vertical motion and the motion amplitude of the manipulators, limited to X cm absolute motion. The latter limit is based on user experience of existing ROV operations and is thus subject to interpretation. The motion amplitude of manipulator and detection coils is modelled by combining three sources of motion; backlash mobilization in the excavator, bending deflection of the excavator arm and wave induced pontoon motions. Three different types of mooring are modelled; gravity spuds, backhoe-type spuds (i.e. preloaded spuds) and a jack-up system. Results of the workability assessment for two case studies show that the gravity spuds pontoon is not a feasible solution, mainly due to the freedom of heaving and pitching. Both defined motion limits are exceeded by more than X m. When using backhoe spuds or jack-up system, the criterion for the scanning coils is satisfied. The criterion for the manipulators is slightly exceeded by respectively X cm and X cm absolute motion for the backhoe and jack-up system. It can be concluded that none of the assessed solutions is workable if an exceedance of the motion limit for the manipulator is strictly prohibited. However, considering the exceedance of the limit is slight and the motion limit of the manipulator should be interpreted as an indication, the backhoe and jack-up system may prove to be workable solutions. Reassessment of the limiting criterion for the manipulator is required to give insight if a slight exceedance of the limit is allowable.","munitions removal; UXO; concept design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kim, B. (mentor)","2016","Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) processed steel is a promising candidate for the third-generation advanced high strengths steel(AHSS), where considerable amount of carbon-enriched austenite can be obtained in the steel microstructure. The Q&P process starts with full or partial austenisation of the steel, followed by a quench to form a desired amount of martensite and an isothermal holding (the partitioning step) for carbon to partition from martensite into austenite. The end point of the carbon partitioning is predicted by a model referred to as Constrained Carbon Equilibrium (CCE), which assumes a stationary martensite/austenite interface during the partitioning step and precludes any competing reaction, e.g. bainite formation and carbide precipitation. However, it remains controversial whether martensite/austenite interface remains stationary during partitioning and competing reactions have been reported to occur, which can influence the final steel microstructure. This thesis therefore aims to study the phase transformations accompanying carbon partitioning during the Q&P process. A steel was heat treated by the Q&P process to investigate the evolution of phase fractions during/approaching the stabilisation of carbon content using dilatometry and Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD). The steel is a model alloy of composition Fe–0.2C–3Mn–2Si (wt.%). From a set of preliminary heat treatments using dilatometry, 400°C was chosen as the optimal partitioning temperature for a secondary dilatometry tests and the in-situ SXRD. Results show that as the initial quenching stops, the austenite continues to transform during the short holding and reheating, which might be associated with the formation of martensite and then bainite. The bainitic transformation continues to the end of partitioning step. The consumption of austenite is also accompanied by the increased carbon level of austenite. Therefore, the carbon enrichment in austenite is achieved by the coupling of carbon partitioning from martensite and bainitic transformation. From the end of initial quenching to the end of partitioning step, 40%-50% of previously retained austenite was consumed. The rate of transformation is highest at the beginning of reheating. Microstructure consisting of tempered martensite with carbides, bainite and retained austenite is obtained through the Q&P process, with tempered martensite mainly as the BCC phase. The RA fraction can be adjusted from 6.9vol.% to 14.3vol.% with little or no formation of fresh martensite. The time required to acquire the multi-phase microstructure can be greatly reduced compared to austempering.","quenching and partitioning; synchrotron XRD; carbon enrichment; retained austenite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The trend of increasing performance by parallelism is followed by the adoption of heterogeneous systems. In order to allow more fine-tuned balancing between used thread- and instruction level parallelism, the heterogeneous ρ-VEX platform was developed. Pipelining has been a part of microprocessor development for decades to increase throughput of a data-path, where a task is split in stages which are distributed over several functional units who work in parallel. In software the concept of pipelines does exist, but mostly speaks about data-flows as here stages do not operate in parallel. This thesis proposes a step towards making this a possibility by mapping software pipelining on heterogeneous multi-core systems. This work documents the design, implementation and verification of a hybrid write-back and streaming cache scheme that aims to cut down overhead of inter-context and inter-core data communication, with the idea of allowing software pipelines to map stages over cores in the same microprocessor with different functional units, in order to fine-tune this mapping. A prototype design is first implemented in a high level behavioral simulator, after which it is implemented in VHDL, tested functionally to conform to a test-suite and a set of testing pipelines developed for this project separately. The VHDL design is implemented on the ML605 Virtex-6 platform, and in its current state conforms to all test-cases but not yet the pipelines, and a slight slow-down is measured in practice. Even though the prototype currently increased the run-time of a customly developed benchmarking pipeline from 3.3928 * 10^-4 seconds to 3.7858 * 10^-4 seconds, there is room for improvement and it enables more research in a new direction of transparently core-to-stage mapped software pipelines, which we define as horizontal software-pipelining, as opposed to traditional software pipelines who still execute code sequentially, hence vertically.","ρ-VEX; FPGA; Streaming; Processor; Cache; Pipeline; VLIW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

Some of these are truck waiting times, long throughput times and 1st line warehouse efficiency. One of the logistical concepts aimed at solving these is a Fast Track (FT), based on the transshipment purpose of a cross-dock. The focus of this research is thus to answer: ""How can the input and output distribution processes of a Fast Track (FT) at AAS facilitate a seamless flow in the context of a multi-actor environment?"" Having conducted a thorough process analysis and literature review, different designs are proposed based on the airside distribution, the existence of FT storage and the push/pull nature of the system. A simulation study is conducted in Simio with the goal of understanding if the designs have an effect on the KPIs and if these are relevant. When contrasted to the single handler distribution, the multiple handlers one proved to positively impact lead time (LT), reducing it from 2.3 to 1.6 hours and decreasing variability by 50%. The remaining designs are tested on this configuration and based on it, a design with storage and a push nature selected. The existence of storage affected LT whereas the Push designs positively impacted the landside KPIs. As a conclusion, the decision-making power needs to rest in the FT operator so that the dynamism of the push/pull logic can be sustained and as a consequence, stream and efficient operations ensured.","air cargo; cargo handler; cargo; airport; Schiphol; transshipment; transhipment; cross-dock; cross dock; airside; distribution; push; pull; landside; Simio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","52.31050, 4.76830"

This MSc research evaluates the case of the COBRAcable, an interconnector between Denmark and the Netherlands. The COBRAcable presents an interesting and unique case as it the first of its kind and likely involves the expansion of the interconnector in Germany territory. Large uncertainties are present due to different national regulatory regimes, diverse groups of stakeholders with different interests, and stochastic uncertainties due to the variability of renewable energy sources. A socio-economic framework has been designed to address the interdisciplinary nature of the problem of multi-terminal expansions. Scenarios of alternate futures are developed, and Monte Carlo analysis is performed to address the future energy characteristics and stochastic uncertainties respectively. It consists of a linear optimal power flow model where a simplified grid is being tested under multiple expansions that are selected in an expansion portfolio. The results will be quantitative costs and benefits of expansions as compared to a base case. Complementary, a qualitative stakeholder analysis is carried out to address the regulatory uncertainties that are not accounted for by the model.","COBRAcable; cost benefit analysis; interconnector; long-term transmission expansion planning; Monte Carlo; multi-terminal expansion; North Sea grid; offshore HVDC; stakeholder analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

(mentor)","2016","The handling qualities of an aircraft have always been a crucial field of study, being chiefly concerned with the safety and comfort of flight. Historically, the design-by-discipline approach has been used, thus relegating stability and control considerations to later stages of the design process. In recent years a new view emerged, which advocates the benefits of including handling qualities at earlier stages, such as conceptual and preliminary. The objective of the research is to develop a handling qualities optimization module to be fitted in the Initiator, a conceptual design tool developed at TU Delft. The module shall handle both unaugmented designs (bare airframe), as well as augmented design, in which a suitable stability augmentation system (SAS) is included. To this end, a common stability paradigm, based on a modified Routh-Hurwitz criterion, has been implemented as a set of nonlinear constraints on the design space. In essence, the criterion has been transformed from a test to a design procedure, taking the form of a general polynomial-based regional pole placement method. The methodology is concerned with conventional aircraft configurations, specifically by sizing the horizontal tailplane and positioning of the wing. Themodule is focused on designs that possess optimal short period damping ratio and Control Anticipation Parameter (CAP), while the objective functions to be minimized are tailplane induced drag, zero-lift drag, and weight. Static stability and controllability are ensured in the relevant flight regimes using Torenbeek’s X-plots, implemented in the form of additional constraints on the design space. Lastly, the stability augmentation system consists of a pitch damper and an angle of attack feedback. Two different methods have been investigated for the computation of the feedback gains: the first one entails the inclusion of such gains in the design vector. The second one makes use of an optimal control technique: the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), augmenting the design vector with three required weighting factors. Hence, the module accepts three user inputs which specify the methodology: unaugmented design, augmented with method 1 (gains in the design vector) and augmented with method 2 (LQR). The optimization has been run for the three different user-specified methods on an Airbus A320-200. The results show that the procedure is successful, increasing the CAP by 100% for the unaugmented and augmented (method 1) designs. By using the LQR, the CAP showed an increase in 150 %. Moreover the unaugmented design achieved the required short period damping of 0.55, or a 34% increase with respect to the baseline value, while the augmented designs were capable of achieving a damping ratio of 0.76, which corresponds to an increase of 85 %. A convergence study has been done within the Initiator, to assess the performance of the optimized configurations concerning aerodynamic efficiency (L/Dmax) and maximum takeoff mass (MTOM). The investigation led to the definition of breakeven points, which are used to indicate the values of short period damping ratio for which, at a given CAP, the optimized designs have the same performance as the baseline aircraft. Two general design guidelines have been extrapolated: for unaugmented designs, the breakeven points move closer to the baseline values as the CAP increases. Furthermore, at the baseline short period damping ratio and CAP, the optimized configuration is more efficient. For augmented designs, it was revealed that the performance benefits achievable are substantially higher and independent of the required handling qualities. Hence, no breakeven points can be defined. Optimal values of L/Dmax andMTOMare achieved right from the baseline values of damping and CAP, while the gains are progressively increased to cope with the handling qualities demands. Due to the qualitative nature of these conclusions, it is deemed possible to extend them to other conventional configurations, thus providing general design guidelines.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2016","Gravity currents are common around the world, consider for instance avalanches and pyroclastic flows. The kind of gravity currents that this research focuses on occur below the water surface. During dredging operations soil is cut and transported, during many of these processes sediment is introduced into the environment. Consider for instance over-flow losses or the offloading of a dredging vessel through its bottom doors. The introduction of the sediment of greater density into the ambient water creates a gravity current. The small fractions of these gravity currents can travel a great distance and can cover parts of the seabed burying sea-life and damaging the environment. Furthermore dredging companies want to deposit the sand there where it is needed. The objective is to increase the knowledge of the behaviour of these currents and to obtain valuable experimental results that can be used for model validation. In this report the influence of initial concentration on the run-out length and current velocity is investigated and the behaviour of particles of different size with varying concentration has been mapped. Experiments involving a full-depth lock release of a fixed volume suspension of sand particles into a homogeneous fluid of lesser density are carried out over a range of initial concentration. The behaviour is modelled using the two-layer shallow water equations with manning friction and a particle conservation equation containing the settling velocity of the particles. The resulting gravity current passes through four phases as observed in the experiments and in previous work. There is first a slumping phase, during which the suspension collapses and the current is accelerated. This may be followed by a purely inertial phase, where the buoyancy force is balanced by the inertial force. This phase displays almost constant velocity and increases in length with increasing concentration. Then there follows a similarity phases that is initiated when the bore that is formed during slumping overtakes the front of the current. This phase shows a steep decrease in velocity and at the end, the viscous phase sets in when the velocity is sufficiently low that viscous forces start to dominate the flow. The numerical model displays all phases except the last viscous phase since viscous forces are neglected within the model. The experiments showed a maximum velocity during the inertial phase independent of concentration that is not captured by the model, with increasing concentration the model predicts increasing velocity due to increased potential energy. At low concentration the experiments showed that particles segregate over the run-out length of the current. Smaller particles travelled a greater distance than the bigger particles with a higher settling velocity. At high concentration the particle segregation does not occur and the PSD at the start of the run-out length of the current is also found at the end. The multiple fractions model with hindered settling effect shows the same trend of particle segregation reducing with increasing concentration, but was not able to match the PSD of the experiment at high concentration. The model predicts particle 2 segregation as the experiment showed none. Beyond a critical point of initial concentration of particles, the resulting dense current came to an abrupt halt at some point faster than currents with a lower initial concentration. This is a behaviour that is not captured by the model and needs more research.","shallow water equations; dredging; gravity; current, turbidity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime & Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Animal studies are commonly used to test the feasibility and effectiveness of promising novel neu- roscience research ideas. One such new technique is optogenetic stimulation, a state-of-the-art brain stimulation technique. In optogenetics, genetic techniques are used to create light-sensitive proteins within the neuron membrane, thus allowing the affected region to become sensitive to light stimulation, for example through an inserted LED. Current optogenetic stimulation methods use tethered setups and, typically, the animal-under-study is put into a fixed position. This introduces stress, which, besides an obvious reduction in animal welfare, may also influence the experimental results. Hence, an untethered setup is highly desirable. Therefore, in this study, we propose a wireless optogenetic stimulation setup, which allows for full freedom of movement of multiple rodents-under-study in a 40 cm x 40 x cm x 20 cm environment. We investigate a variety of wireless power transfer methods, which results in the choice for wireless power transfer through inductive coupling, as this allows for efficient power transfer over short range and has the least side-effects, making it the most suitable approach for this particular environment. The efficiency of inductive coupling is highly susceptible to vertical, lateral and angular misalignment of the coils. The wireless link is, therefore, designed to maximize the link efficiency and minimize the misalignments between the coils. In order to maximize the inductive power transfer link, we look into all the aspects that have an influence on the link efficiency, including coil shape and coil material. The implementation of the wireless optogenetics setup is divided into three parts: Transmitter Coil: The design of a transmitter coil capable of providing sufficient link efficiency through- out the entire 40 cm x 40 cm x 20 cm region of interest, in order to be able to power the optogenetic stimulation receiver, regardless of lateral and vertical misalignments. Receiver Module: The design of a receiver module that resides on the animal and, as such, is severely restricted in both size and weight. The complete module with receiver coil, rectifying and regulating electronics and microcontroller can occupy at most 1 cm x 1 cm x_ 1 cm and weights below 1 g. Moreover, half of allowable volume of the receiver module is kept unused for the future assembly including the wireless ECoG recording electronics. Optogenetics Optrodes: The creation of optogenetics optrodes using a novel µLED mounting tech- nique, which allows for the µLED array with multiple LEDs to be directly inserted into the brain. The use of a µLED array greatly improves the power efficiency, as the traditional LED-to-optical- fiber coupling is accompanied by large losses in light-intensity. Moreover, a single optrode is able to replace a number of optical fibers, resulting in a less-invasive procedure if multiple stimulation sites are required. For an input current of 0.5 A into the primary coil, an average inductive link efficiency of 0.28 %, and an angular misalignment of 45 degrees, the _nal setup is capable of delivering at least 8.5 mW of light power into the brain.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Biomedical Electronics","",""

(mentor)","2016","In external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer, prostate motion and, more generally, intra-fractional anatomical changes in the pelvic region can lead to significant plan efficacy degradation, possibly underdosing the target and overdosing the organs at risk (OARs). Since through image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) it is possible to monitor real-time the anatomy configuration, one should be able to adapt the plan to the current configuration. A novel realtime adaptive strategy to correct for possible misdosage due to prostate intra-fraction motion is implemented. Since during a treatment fraction the prostate may move up to more than 1 cm from the initial centre of mass (CM) position, a number of plans optimized for possible prostate positions during a treatment fraction are created prior to the treatment delivery. The prostate position are checked at the end of each beam delivery through the image-guidance system. If a prostate shift is detected, the beam of the plan optimized for the prostate position closest to the actual one is delivered. The validation of this adaptive strategy is based on the simulation of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery for different possible prostate displacements during single treatment fractions. The adaptive strategy and the standard treatment delivery are evaluated and compared in terms of target coverage and dose absorption, considering both single and combined treatment fractions. Furthermore, the current EBRT trends are to reduce the number of fractions, referred to as hypofractionation. Since hypofractionation involves fewer treatment fractions in which a larger dose per fraction is delivered the relevance of intra-fractional changes on treatment quality is higher than for a standard fractionated treatment. The adaptive strategy has been applied and evaluated also for the latter case. The results obtained show that through the adaptive strategy the dose degradation is always corrected for the target and only few small dosimetric errors are generated for the OARs, in single treatment fraction. As a few treatment fractions are combined, the misdosage (whenever was present) is totally corrected. Compared to the standard approach, the adaptive approach improves plan quality, ensuring the correct dose delivery to the target and reducing at the same time the dose absorbed on the OARs. The strategy has potential applications in both standard fractionation treatments and hypofractionated treatments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering Design","","","",""

These could reduce the load in these dikes, which could lead to less or no dike strengthening. The dikes is assessed in the last official assessment round with a probabilistic program Hydra-NL. In this program the safety of a dike can determined on the basis of a dike profile and Hydraulic Boundary Conditions. The derivation of these conditions is done with the wave model SWAN. For the derivation of the hydraulic conditions a bottom profile is needed, in which the shallow foreshore are already included to some extent. Typically, the foreshores have already been included until 50-100m in front of the dike toe. Here the hydraulic conditions have been given in a so called output point. In the program Hydra-NL a foreshore module is present. With this module the final stretch of foreshore can be taken into account. With this module the design conditions in the output point are taken and transformed to the location of the dike toe. This transformation leads to lower wave heights, which leads to lower loads on the dike. The calculation method used in the foreshore module of Hydra-NL is the ENDEC method. This module is first compared on theoretical basis to other available transformation methods as SWAN and DaF. This are all modules used in other official calculation tools. Outcome of the comparison was that the ENDEC module can, in some situations, give a significant deviation from the other modules. To determine the extent to which the effect of the foreshores have been included in the official safety assessment a different database of hydraulic conditions has been derived. Instead of near the dike, these conditions are defined at locations in front of the foreshore. These can therefore be seen as the deep water conditions. The effects of the foreshore are assessed on to failure mechanisms. A height assessment, using the maximum overtopping as criteria and a cover stability assessment, for which the wave height notably plays a big role. For the height assessment it was found that including the final foreshore stretch does not lead to a significant increase of the minimum required crest height. The assessment on the dike cover however shows that including the last part of the foreshore could lead to a substantial reduction of wave load. Particularly the lower dike parts experience lower wave loading. As most of the dike stretches in the Wadden Sea have failed on the cover slope of the outer dike, including the foreshore in this manner could lead to a reduction of failure probability.","Foreshores; Wadden Sea; Flood Risk; Hydra-NL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","53.43994, 6.59125"

(mentor)","2016","There has been a lot of research done into traffic on roads and multiple traffic models have been set up for this type of traffic. A subject that has been largely neglected is the traffic on fairways. The research goal set for my graduation project is to define a model that can simulate the traffic on fairways and use this model to optimize the allocation of this traffic. To achieve this the existing traffic models have been investigated. This way a model was found that could be extended to fairway traffic, the mesoscopic model. Within the mesoscopic model there is a possibility to incorporate a more detailed microscopic model for the objects (locks and bridges). Several microscopic models were defined for the locks and bridges. Optimization models were set up based on previous work done into lock modeling. However, optimization models cannot include all rules used in reality; this makes heuristic models more efficient. For bridges the optimization model can be defined starting from the lock optimization. This optimization model can determine what the best time to open a bridge is. In the case of bridges the situation decides which model is best to use. When no information is available, the best result comes from an optimization model. Some bridges have fixed opening times; simply using this schedule gives the same result in less time. The mesoscopic model was implemented on a practical case in Zeeland. Using this model it is possible to gain insight into several elements: - Give a value to the efficient use of objects when traffic is spread over the day and night equally. - Effect of different situations that can occur when maintenance reduces the capacity of the network. - Effect of stimulating skippers to travel at a time when there is less traffic, optimizing the allocation of traffic.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM)","","Mathematical physics","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Terwel, K.C. (mentor)","2016","The possibility of multi-hazards, the occurrence of two or more (natural) hazards at once or shortly after another in the same location, can lead to an increased risk of structural damage and life loss. In the Netherlands, seismically-unprepared houses are especially vulnerable to newly expected earthquakes in the region of Groningen. These seismic events have the potential to compromise levees in the area, in a way that can lead to flooding. The flood, in combination with its triggering earthquake, are the multihazard that is closely studied in this report; damage is assessed to typical unreinforced masonry houses standing close to the aforementioned levees in the Groningen area. In the study, a framework is introduced to analyse damage and its probability for a study case, which consists of a house with longitudinally-oriented precast hollow concrete slabs resting on 100mm-thick calcium-silicate load-bearing masonry walls, and longitudinal in-filled masonry walls. This house is located behind a levee, for which the failure probability due to earthquakes has been characterised by the study of Zuada (2014). First, earthquake damage is assessed by obtaining the lateral displacement of the house in response to the earthquake’s peak ground acceleration via a finite element model and a non-linear time history analysis. And, relating the computed displacement to the amount of cracking and cracked walls as observed from a generated pushover curve that depicts loss of lateral resistance against lateral displacement. For each possible damage state of the house, a set of parameters that describe its weakening is defined. Then, the impact of various flood actions are analysed on the potentially weakened structural cases. Firstly, the flood resulting from a levee breach is studied with a FEM hydraulic model in order to obtain the probable flood depth and flow velocity, related to initial probabilistic parameters for the water level and the characteristics of the breach. Secondly, the interaction of debris (such as trees and vehicles) with the flood and the structure is studied. Then, the loads generated by the flood and the potential impact of debris are evaluated on a non-linear FEM of a wall of the house for an appraisal of damage. Finally, the probability for the house to be in a particular damage state as a result of the earthquake is computed and joined to the probability of the flood further damaging the house and the failure probability of the levee. From this, fragility curves are elaborated detailing the probability of damage as a function of earthquake ground acceleration. For a period of fifty years, the risk of structural collapse for the case study house was computed at 1/25. The impact of debris was observed to a be an often overlooked flood action with a paramount influence on structural damage. For the medially intense flood due to a levee breach with a water level difference of around two meters, all collapse cases due to flood actions were due to debris impact. Severe earthquake damage was observed to be a result of the infilled walls that contribute little to the structural resistance of the house, as well as the lack of redundancy and ductility of the structure. The influence of the multi-hazard on the risk of individual loss of life was also investigated and seen to increase from 4.2·10-4 for earthquake-only analyses to 9.1·10-4 per year for an earthquake-flood multihazard. Clearly, multi-hazards are both structurally damaging and dangerously threatening to human life.","earthquake; flood, masonry; framework; probability; damage; fragility; FEM; Maple; multi-hazard","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","","53.228592, 6.619579"

(mentor)","2016","With the advent of smart thermostats like Toon®, detailed information about operation and usage of central heating boilers has become easily available. However, this information is not used in a systematic way by most companies including Eneco, and the wealth of information within is not available to the users. This has a few drawbacks. For instance, when a mechanic is sent to repair a broken boiler, the mechanic has to rely on the data provided by the callcenter receiving the call from the customer. This data is often missing, incomplete or incorrect. This means that no reliable information about which parts to bring and how long the repair will take is available a priori. Secondly, some malfunctions could have been easily resolved by the end-user, for instance by refilling the system with water. This research aims to provide a starting point in a systematic and automated approach in analysing the behaviour of the boiler by detecting malfunctions as they occur. To do so, a mathematical model of a house is designed. On this model an Extended Kalman Filter is built which monitors important parameters of the system in real-time. The estimated parameters can in future research be used as features in a more complete fault detection and identification scheme. The filter has successfully been tested against simulated faults, and shows promising results when applied to real data.","Smart thermostat; Toon; Eneco; predictive maintenance; central heating systems; extended kalman filter; parameter estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor); Spronck, J.W. (mentor)","2016","White light reflectance spectroscopy is used to determine the reflective properties of human tissue. It is believed that the reflectance of the human tissue is dependent on the pressure applied to the tissue. The reflectance of the human tissue might be an indication if the tissue is diseased. Spectroscopy and a pressure measurement have to be performed simultaneously to determine this relation. Two possibilities are researched to determine the pressure. The first method is to apply a pressure to the tissue and measuring this using a sensor. The second method is to apply a known pressure to the tissue, which makes the measurement obsolete. The pressure measurement or application can be done directly at the tissue or farther away fromthe tissue. When the pressure ismeasured away fromthe tissue a force transfer mechanism is needed to transfer the force outside of the body. Determining the pressure outside of the body brings a lot of advantages. The only parts entering the body will be the optical fiber used for the spectroscopy and the guide to transfer the force outside the body. The research goal then becomes: Design of a linear guide to transfer a force through an optical fiber for pressure sensitive white light reflectance spectroscopy. For the guide was chosen to use a compliant rolling mechanism. This mechanism consists of rolled-up flat strips connected to the optical fiber that can roll along the inner wall of the guide. During the rollingmotion energy is conserved and no forces are added to the measurement. Two models are made to determine the support force which prevents the optical fiber from slipping along the wall. First an analytical model was made and secondly, a finite element analysis is done to validate the analytical model. To determine if the compliant rolling mechanism behaves as described in the model two measurements are done. The first measurement was done to determine if the model to calculate the preload force was correct. The second measurement was done to determine if axial forces are present in the measurement. These measurements showed that the predicted preload forces were correct, but the axial forces were not the same, a stiffness and hysteresis were measured. The measured stiffness can be compensated for, but the hysteresis will give an error to the measurement. To be able to use the compliant rolling mechanism a design is made where the hysteresis does not influence the measurement outside the boundaries of what is tolerable. From the information gathered from the measurements a design for the linear guide could be made. A size minimization was performed to make the total width of the linear guid as small as possible. This resulted in a linear guide of 20mmwide when the tested materials are used. By using thinner materials the design can be made even smaller, which makes it more suitable for usage in minimally invasive surgery. An assembly method by where the compliant rolling mechanism is slid place is described. In conclusion, by taking the hysteresis forces in account a linear guide is designed which transfers a force through an optical fiber from the tissue to the outside of the body. This is achieved by using a compliant rolling mechanismwhich can be slid in place for assembly. i","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","","",""

(mentor); Katsman, C.A. (mentor); van der Horst, A.Q.C. (mentor); Reinders, K.J. (mentor)","2016","The Tha Chin River is a river in central Thailand, which starts in Chainat province as a branch of the Chao Phraya River and flows into the Gulf of Thailand at about 35 km southwest of Bangkok. The Tha Chin is one of Thailand’s most important rivers and it plays a vital role for the lives of over two million people living in this basin. Near the river mouth, it serves as a traffic route for about 4000 ships, mostly used for fishing, located in the area. More upstream, the river is used for both shrimp farms and fisheries, as well as fruit and flower farming and paddy fields. Al these fields are irrigated using a vast and complex network of increasingly smaller irrigation channels, controlled by water gates. The use of river water is however not limited to irrigation only. Besides the agricultural users, the industrial and domestic users are two other major consumers of water from the Tha Chin. Currently the river basin is experiencing serious problems regarding water quality. One of these problems is the high amount of pollution in the river. Multiple factors (e.g. waste water dump from several sources, oil spillage and water hyacinths) contribute to lower dissolved oxygen levels, higher levels of chemicals and algae blooms. Resulting in considerable damage to the ecosystem in the last decades. Another major water problem is salt intrusion. The tide in the Gulf of Thailand brings saline water into the river. Currently this water is pushed back by increasing the river discharge, which is controlled by the Pho Praya water gate in the Suphanburi Province. However, during the dry season the river discharge is often too low to effectively push back salt water and therefore salinity in the Tha Chin becomes too high. The salt water threatens the agricultural production, it decreases the amount of yearly grown crops or even destroys them complete, causing major economic damage. Additionally, it decreases the river capacity with respect to its function to provide fresh water. One of the major institutions involved in managing and controlling the Tha Chin River is the Royal Irrigation Department (RID). This is a department of the Thai Ministry of Natural Resources \& Environment. The RID is responsible for the development and maintenance of the main irrigation systems. As such, it controls the irrigation network in the Tha Chin Basin. Part of their mission is developing water resources and in their search for solving the salt intrusion problem in the Tha Chin, they asked the TU Delft project team to find with a solution. Two solutions are proposed. The first solution is building a barrier in the river at 12 km upstream from the river mouth. This solution is the only one that can solve the salt intrusions problem, however due to negative experiences in other rivers this solution is likely to encounter much opposition. The second solution is the construction of Balance Islands in front of the river mouth. The principal of this solution is to alter the tidal flow such that saline water flows less into the river while the river discharge is not obstructed. In order to implement this solution further research is needed. Also this solution is not able to solve the salt intrusion problem entirely, but will make the problem less severe.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering / Structural Engineering","","","Multidisciplinary Project CIE4061-09","13.528314, 100.264711"

(mentor); Lendering, K.T. (mentor); Van Mechelen, J. (mentor); Van den Eijnden, A.P. (mentor)","2016","A large part of the Netherlands consists of polder area. Therefore the inhabitants have to rely on the Dutch flood defence system to protect them against floods. A vast network of drainage canals ensures that the seepage water and the precipitation water is transported from the polders toward the outside water. There are several mechanisms which can cause failure of the embankments; one of the mechanisms is macro instability of the inner slope. The stability is mainly determined by the pore pressures inside the dike. They cause a reduction in effective stress which is necessary to stabilize the dike. Precipitation acts as a recharge of the groundwater and causes the pore pressures to rise; the exact influence of precipitation on the pore pressures is however not described in literature. The objective of the study was: to compose a method to assess the probability distribution of the phreatic surface that includes the effect of precipitation. With a probabilistic computation it is possible to assess how safe the region behind the dike is instead of only knowing if the area is safe enough. The method that is developed is based on finite element computations of multiple precipitation events for dikes consisting of different hydraulic soil characteristics. In the study the probability density function of the phreatic surface is related to statistical information of precipitation events in the Netherlands. The result from the study is the probability density function of the rise of the phreatic surface in 11 combinations of soil type and permeability. They show that precipitation can have a significant influence on the pore pressures. Each probability density function contains information on the rise of the phreatic surface with a probability of exceedance between 0,5 and 0,001. The rise of the phreatic surface ranges between several centimetres in a dike consisting of permeable sand, to full saturation in a dike consisting of medium permeable clay or peat. The most important finding with respect to the current assessment method (Technisch rapport waterspanningen bij dijken) is that precipitation causes non-hydrostatic pore pressures. The current guidelines prescribe hydrostatic pressures, that results in an overestimation of the pore pressures. This means the probability of failure will be lower than expected regarding to governing schematization method. The most important finding respective to the probabilistic method in ‘flood risk of regional flood defences’ is regarding the probability mass of the phreatic surface. In this thesis report is concluded that the failure due to a high or a low phreatic surface must be regarded separately. The probability mass of the spectrum of high phreatic surfaces is proposed to be 100% instead of 10% as is assumed in ‘flood risk of regional flood defences’. This means the computed failure probability will be larger.","phreatic surface; regional; flood defence; precipitation; probalistic; assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The use of advancements in computing technology has enabled designers to perform more thorough and more detailed design studies. Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) architectures provide users with guidelines on how to structure their MDO problem, including the linking of disciplines and how to perform the optimization. However, complex MDO problems can consist of tens of disciplines and hundreds of design variables. Thus, the set-up of these problems can be complex and time consuming. In an attempt to reduce the time required and complexity of this set up, the main goal in this thesis is: ""To develop and demonstrate a methodology for automatic workflow (re)generation to support MDO"". The method to fulfill these requirements consists of three main steps. The first is the automatic generation of microworkflows, workflows representing the different disciplines of the problem. The user will need to specify the inputs, outputs and operations, after which the workflows are automatically generated. The second step involves the automatic storage of workflows. Workflows are stored in a graph database, allowing the addition of semantics to the data. Adding semantics allows a reasoner to understand what the data means, enabling the inferring of data not explicitly defined. OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies are used to supply structure to the workflow data and add semantics. In addition, materialization scripts are present to regenerate stored workflows. The final step of the implementation involves the automatic generation of simulation workflows according to different MDO architectures. This generation involves the materialization and adjustment of microworkflows and the creation of a ‘higher level’ workflow that links the disciplines and performs the optimization. The implementation of the automatic architecture generation has been validated using three case studies of varying complexity, amount of disciplines and discipline couplings. These case studies have shown a reduction of 93 to 98 % of time spent on the generation of simulation workflows representing the problem using an MDO architecture. In addition, the approach reduces the required user expertise and minimizes the amount of information the user needs to provide.","automation; MDO; MDO architectures; simulation workflows; optimization; PIDO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

It was seen that the current OMCT has a set of input signals which may be representative for heave motion, but might not be representative for pitch and surge motion characteristics. Therefore it was investigated whether a potentially superior OMCT, better representing helicopter motion, can be defined. An OMCT was tailored to longitudinal helicopter motion. Notable differences in pitch and surge motion characteristics were found. However, for pilot-in-the-loop training, the aircraft motion does not only depend on the dynamics of the aircraft model, but also on pilot input. Therefore, using pilot-in-the-loop simulation data, the effect of manual pilot control behaviour on the proposed methodology was studied. It was seen that, although differences were identified, the main trend of the frequency response functions was determined by the dynamics of the helicopter model, not the pilot input. Further research is recommended to evaluate the current set of input signals of the OMCT for a variety of models, also incorporating lateral motion, and tasks using a similar method presented in this thesis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-08","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2016","The current e-bike market is characterized by bike designs with conventional tubular frames, to which external components that allow electric cycling are attached. This often leads to a forced integration of the battery, motor and other components. Amsterdam based e-bike brand QWIC wanted to tackle this integration issue in a different manner, by developing a new type of e-bike frame which is developed during this graduation project. The preliminary concept for this new frame was created by external designer Robert Bronwasser, in which he proposes to embrace a more voluminous frame. This would allow a better integration of components and at the same time open up possibilities for a comfort-oriented e-bike. Furthermore, a more moped-like frame should help creating a perceptual change towards e-cycling, by moving towards a new mobility category and moving away from the dull and dusty ‘cycling-with-aid’ feeling. During the development process, the initial side view sketches and three-dimensional shape explorations have been developed into a feasible product in terms of (1) a general product build-up and component compatibility, [2] a producible frame construction with a promising structural integrity and [3] a valuable interaction. One of the main challenges within the project, was the creation of a new frame construction that was stiff enough to ensure a pleasant and safe cycling experience. Through a literature review, a framework was set-up for the structural requirements and stiffness testing of the new frame design. The final design was created after an iterative process in which the frame was tested digitally using FEM simulations and on a physical stiffness test bench, compared to an existing bike from QWIC’s portfolio, and improved based on the results. A second challenge, and a wish that was expressed by the company, was the simplification of QWIC’s current portfolio and supply chain. The final design will be the leading model in the feature ‘comfort’ portfolio range, serving as a main model in a modular system to which several accessories (such as front and rear carriers) can be attached. To minimize the amount of different frames, the frame design is unisex and only has two frame sizes. Except for 5 unique parts, all other parts are interchangeable between these two sizes, allowing for less needed stock parts. After designing the interaction and product-build-up, the report concludes on the production and cost-price of the frame. Most parts of which the frame consists can be made using QWIC’s current manufacturing processes. For the motorblock, however, which is the most important part in terms of structural integrity of the frame, the investment casting process is suggested. This process allows a low batch size, a complex shape with undercuts and can provide a proper surface quality. A final recommended retail price is calculated at €3,599 for a more affordable ‘CITY’ version with a chaindrive, and at €4,199 for the high end ‘SPEED’ version with a beltdrive and a pedalling support up to 45 km/h.","e-bike; design; e-cycling; electric mobility; urban mobility; frame stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-12-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Vermaas, D.A. (mentor); Vlugt, T.J.H. (mentor)","2016","The combination of desalination technology (Electrodialysis) and power generation from salinity gradients (Reverse Electrodialysis) is a novel electrical energy storage system. The main challenge in the development of this novel energy storage system is to improve the system performance. The performance of the battery is determined by the efficiency, power density and energy density. A strategy to increase the performance of the battery is to increase the temperature of the feed solutions. The main goal of this thesis is to quantify the influence of temperature on the power density [W/m2], energy density [Wh/L] and thermodynamic efficiency [%] of a salinity gradient based energy storage system, charged using electrodialysis and discharged using reverse electrodialysis. In chapter 2 a theoretical framework is developed in order to build an understanding of the fundamental theories that help explain the system characteristics. This is done by studying the literature. Next, chapter 3 deals with the methodology that will be used in order to obtain the experimental data that is needed in order to answer the main research question. After this, the results of the experiments are discussed in chapter 4. In chapter 5 the most important conclusions are summarized and in chapter 6 there is room for a discussion and recommendations. Experimental data showed that: • The total electrical resistance decreases if the temperature increases; • Osmosis and diffusion increases if the temperature increases. • Energy density increases if the operating temperature increases. • Power density increases if the operating temperature increases. • In case of charging the increase of operating temperature increases the systems thermodynamic efficiency. • In case of discharging the increase of operating temperature increases the systems thermodynamic efficiency. In order for the salinity gradient energy storage to be cost competitive the levelized costs should be at most 0.20 euro/kWh. Pumped hydro storage is the cheapest competitor available on the energy storage market today with a levelized cost of about 0.10 euro/kWh . Ways to achieve this competitive price is to decrease the price of the membranes, or increase the performance of the membranes because the membranes are the most expensive component of the system. Another approach is to focus on groups of applications requiring a large capacity to power ratio. The costs of storage capacity of this system are extremely low making it very suitable for the aforementioned group of applications. Irreversible water transport of the system has a large impact on the system performance. Therefore future research should be done in order to decrease this phenomenon. This means that strategies need to be devised in order to reduce the osmotic pressure difference between the concentrate and diluate chambers. Furthermore the internal resistance is an important factor to consider for the overall performance of the system. Currently research is already being done in order to reduce the internal resistance. Increasing the conductivity of the diluate chamber is an important strategy. Lastly the self-discharge of the system is also a parameter to consider and research is also already being done to develop membranes that have high permselectivity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","","","","P&E-2743",""

(mentor)","2016","The maximum wave run-up on a beach is an important factor in the design of coastal protection measures. Therefore, it is desired to predict this run-up based on numerical models. In this thesis, this is done with the use of the model XBeach. Wave run-up consists of multiple components: a swash height, S, and a wave set-up, <η>. The swash height can be divided in a high frequency (incident) and low frequency (infragravity) part. Which of these two frequencies prevail depends on multiple factors such as offshore wave energy and local bathymetry. In general, it is expected that on low sloping beaches or dissipative coasts, low frequency swash is dominant. Steep beaches or reflective coasts experience a dominance of high frequency swash motions. Intermediate beaches experience both high and low frequency motions, and thus lie somewhere between these two extremes. This report uses a case study, which is such an intermediate beach, with an alongshore varying bathymetry and topography: Anmok beach in South-Korea. This report also shows that the prevailing frequency band determines what type of (simplified) model can be used. This is done with the use of both 1D and 2DH models. As no data are available, all conclusions are made based on the model results only. The main part of this thesis consists of 1D results, as this required less computational time. Therefore, many synthetic storms could be analysed. Their analysis showed that low frequency motions prevail in the wave run-up and that the use of a simplified model is allowed. Even though a 1D model requires less computational demand, the question can arise whether it is valid to use it, since the case study showed a strongly alongshore varying coast. To research this, a 2DH model of the case study site has been analysed as well. The analysis is limited to one storm condition, which was also used in the 1D model, due to time constraints. The results showed differences between the 1D and 2DH model in the generation of low frequency motions, which lead to differences in the maximum wave run-up as well. The low frequency motions do not prevail as was seen in the 1D model. Contrary to the 1D model, very low frequency motions could also be found in the wave run-up of the 2DH model. As the 2DH model results are assumed to be closest to reality, the results suggest that a more simplified approach in the determination of wave run-up is not allowed for this particular case study. However, since the results are based on a single stormcondition, further research is necessary to provide more insight and better conclusions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic engineering","","Coastal Engineering","","37.773144, 128.947183"

(mentor)","2016","In the past few decades telescopes have given us insight into the structures of the observable universe. Current and future astronomical research investigate problems that concern how these structures have been formed and at which rates cosmic structures grow. The redshift of galaxies plays a fundamental role in this research directions, since these redshifts are used as a measure of distance in astronomy. To obtain a good understanding of the uncertainties in the redshift estimates, astronomers are currently estimating the probability density function (PDF) of each galaxy redshift. Seeing the enormous number of observed galaxies (in the order of billions of galaxies in current and future sky surveys), storing each galaxy redshift PDF has become a major storage problem. In this thesis we are therefore investigating a method that aims to find accurate sparse representations of the redshift PDFs. This boils down to storing each PDF with a small number of basis functions without losing the shape of the PDF. An additional problem that arises from the large number of observed galaxies is the computation time per PDF during the sparse representation process. To address both the sparse representation problem and the problem concerning the computation time per PDF, we investigate a dictionary learning method in this thesis. In dictionary learning, a set of basis functions learn the complex structures of the redshift PDFs directly from the data in a statistical learning fashion. This brings a level of flexibility such that the necessary structures can be captured in a small set of learned basis functions, which favors the computation time problem. The learned basis functions are stored in a dictionary and in this thesis we use the K-SVD algorithm to learn the dictionary. We show that K-SVD yields very accurate sparse representations which are similar to the results of a successful method proposed in the literature. An interesting result is that the learned dictionary only needs 0.03\% of the time needed in the alternative method to sparsely represent a redshift PDF. A reference method with the same computation time per PDF will be examined to put the K-SVD results into perspective. Wavelet basis functions are used to this end and we show that the sparse representations obtained with K-SVD result in higher accuracies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Caeli is the CESARWater Vapour, Aerosol and Cloud Lidar and is a multiwavelength, high-performance Raman lidar which is stationed at the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) in the Netherlands. The instrument was developed as a key instrument for CESAR to strengthen the sites capabilities as a vertical profiling station. It was designed to withstand operations running 24=7. It is highly equipped with different sensors and monitoring units to keep a check on the health and status of the lidar instrument. Since its deployment at the CESAR, the instrument has been run by an operator, which is very time consuming. The operator has to follow a certain start-up sequence to to initialize the instrument, and then has to wait for atleast 2–3 hrs to perform the measurements. Also, despite having such a unique hardware setup, there is no medium to keep an eye on the system’s health. Manual operation limits the usage of the instrument; currently the measurements are performed mostly twice a week, that too depending on the weather conditions. Now, to reduce the dependence of operation of Caeli on an operator, and to improve the effciency and the smartness of the instrument to predict and analyze different situations, it needs to be fully automated. This thesis provides an integrated solution so as to automate the Raman lidar in such a way that it can be operated from a remote location through a secured link. All the sub-systems have been linked to a single user interface giving an easier access to the user to run the instrument even while sitting home. Programming techniques like producer/consumer, client server architecture, object-oriented programming have been used to develop the interface for the instrument. Different algorithms have been designed to build an interactive application for the user to operate the instrument. Constant notifications and updates keep the user informed about the health and status of the instrument. It also talks about the open points that needs needs to be worked on, and gives a brief discussion on how the instrument can reach upto a full automation stage.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The aim of this work is to study the performance of the selected wake oscillator model in predicting the vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) response of a free-hanging vertical riser subjected to certain imposed harmonic oscillations at the top. This model is a simplification of the situations commonly found in offshore industries when a marine riser, subjected to current flows, is connected to a floating structure at the top which oscillates in any direction. The performance is assessed by comparing the results with recent measurements done in MARIN. The wake oscillator model implementing the principle of van der Pol equation is coupled to the equation of motions of the structure using the acceleration coupling. A total of 40 cases with various combinations of flow velocity, pretension, frequency of imposed motions, as well as the amplitude of the imposed motions are applied to the structure. The combinations of frequency and amplitude applied represent some typical conditions, including the typical range of frequencies and amplitudes in vortex induced motions and in the range close to the Strouhal frequency and/or one of the natural frequencies. Comparison with the measurements shows that, in the case with sway imposed motions, more similar results relative to the model tests are observed when the Strouhal frequency is close to one of the natural frequencies, either when the frequency of imposed motions is close to or totally off from the Strouhal frequency. Despite the fact that some frequency components at the higher frequencies are not captured by the numerical model, the numerical model is, in general, able to predict the dominant frequency components in such cases. On the other hand, less agreement is observed when the Strouhal frequency is not close to any of the natural frequencies of the structure and in the case with surge imposed motions. In these cases, the numerical model does not predict the same dominant frequency component(s) in the cross-flow direction. In terms of the bending moment envelopes, the numerical model, in most cases, underestimates the in-line bending moments. More varied results relative to the model test are observed in the crossflow bending moment envelopes. The implementation of time-varying hydrodynamic drag coefficient is also done and it is shown that, in most cases, more similar results compared to the model test are obtained in the in-line direction after this implementation.","vortex-induced vibrations; wake oscillator; imposed motions; marine riser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Additional thesis - In the Netherlands the total area protected by dikes is enormous. An ideal dike is strong and waterproof: sand in combination with a clay core provide such properties. However, most of the dikes in the Netherlands are constructed long ago with local materials which are less suitable. Especially ancient dikes containing heterogeneous material like peat are prone to stability problems. Dikes play a vital role in the Netherlands and therefore their safety must be guaranteed in the future. Research is continuously performed to gain knowledge on different processes affecting the performance of ancient and modern dikes. One of the processes affecting the stability of dikes and the material properties is the changing water level in the dike. The location of the phreatic level in the dike is changing continuously due to time dependent external conditions. For example, rainfall, transpiration, evaporation, water extraction by vegetation, the river level and the pore water pressure in the Pleistocene sand all affect the amount of water in the dike. Besides external conditions the soil type is also very important for the pore water pressure in the dike. Heterogeneity causes big differences in permeability and therefore also in hydraulic head. During dry periods microscopic cracks can develop due to shrinkage of clayey materials. In such a case the permeability of the system becomes a combination of matrix and preferential flow (Jommi, et al., 2016). The amount of suction in the unsaturated zone of the dike is described by soil water characteristic curve, which is not available for all soil types. Information on the varying groundwater table and amount of water in the unsaturated zone of the dike is interesting because of several reasons. Material degradation of organic soils due to wetting and drying cycles might affect the stability and the permeability properties of the soil on the long term (Kazemian, et al., 2011). On the other hand some materials tend to gain strength by the process called ripening (Pons, 1965). Besides that, the current limit equilibrium slope stability calculations do not consider the additional strength which is available in the unsaturated zone due to suction. The amount of hidden strength might be interesting for the determination of the factor of safety. Varying external conditions and heterogeneous, and anisotropic soil properties indicate the potential complexity of dike structures. A good understanding of different processes related to the piezometric head in dikes can contribute to dike assessments in the future. This research is a reanalysis of pore water pressure variations in an ancient clay dike caused by changing atmospheric conditions.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Results show that when operators demonstrate their control strategies, machine learning techniques can identify these strategies and use them to learn similar control strategies. Apart from mimicking control strategies in identical traffic scenarios is it possible to use machine learning to solve similar, yet different conflicts by applying similar control strategies, without the need of human demonstrations for that particular conflict scenario.

To assure this maintenance is performed, and therefore spare parts are required. An important activity is to have spare parts available when they are demanded for conducting maintenance. However, the stock levels and operational costs should be minimized at the same time. This is difficult to achieve due to unpredictability of demand for spare parts, differentiated decisions about inventory and unpredictability of supply. In existing literature little attention is given to an integrated perspective and high practical applicability, which is required for companies to achieve overall effective spare parts management. In this article the following question is central: How can an integrated approach be designed that can be used to achieve a more desirable balance between spare parts availability, operational costs and working capital (stock levels) in service logistics companies with high value capital assets? Findings in a literature review and during field research at a rail transport operator are combined to design the integrated approach. It focuses on demand forecasting, inventory control and supply management and it is differentiated along the dimensions ‘price’, ‘consumption rate’ and ‘supply risk’. This way a combination is made between an inventory classification and a supplier segmentation. The differentiation assists companies managing groups of spare parts with a suitable level of attention and with a suggested focus with respect to performance improvement. Based on the field research, also differentiated focus areas for organisational and process improvements are indicated. Finally, to make the approach simple and targeted in its use, the main activities are assigned to the three main departments that are concerned with spare parts management: maintenance, purchasing and logistics. The results show that the approach could help companies move forward, though the study can be extended in a number of directions. Hence, suggestions for future research are presented in this article.","supplier segmentation; Spare parts management; demand forecasting; inventory control; supply management; inventory classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport & Logistics (TLO)","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","SPM5910",""

(mentor); Ferranti, L. (mentor)","2016","Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control technique that offers an elegant framework to solve a wide range of control problems (regulation, tracking, supervision, etc) and handle constraints on the plant. The control objectives and constraints are usually formulated as an optimization problem that the MPC controller has to solve (either offline or online) to return the control command for the plant. This master thesis proposes a novel primal-dual interior-point (PDIP) method for solving quadratic programming problems with linear inequality constraints that typically arise from MPC applications. Convergence of PDIP is studied both in primal and dual framework. We show that the solver converges quadratically to a suboptimal solution of the MPC problem. PDIP solvers rely on two phases: the damped and the pure Newton phases. Compared to state-of-the-art PDIP method, this new solver replaces the initial (linearly convergent) damped Newton phase (usually used to compute a medium-accuracy solution) with a dual solver based on Nesterov's fast gradient scheme (DFG) that converges super-linearly to a medium-accuracy solution. The switching strategy to the pure Newton phase, compared to the state of the art, is computed in the dual space to exploit the dual information provided by the DFG in the first phase. Removing the damped Newton phase has the additional advantage that this solver saves the computational effort required by backtracking line search. The effectiveness of the proposed solver is demonstrated by simulating it on a 2-dimensional discrete-time unstable system.","optimization; predictive control; model-based control; suboptimal control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

From here the clean water surplus is infiltrated in the first aquifer. When water demand increases, in summer for example, this water can be pumped up and used for irrigation or cooling. I specifically looked into location-specific factors and local stakeholders and users. This resulted in a final design that is flexible and scalable to both the water assignment and the location.","water buffer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-12-02","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this work a fast and efficient implementation of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based, fixed hardware, streaming multiprocessor architecture for low latency medical image processing is introduced. The design of this computation fabric is based on the ρ-VEX Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) softcore processor and is in influenced by architectures of modern Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) implementations. The computation fabric is capable of exploiting several types of parallelism, including pipelining, Instruction-level Parallelism (ILP) and Data-level parallelism (DLP). The multiprocessor in the fabric is implemented by a chain of ρ-VEX processors that function as a processor pipeline. A memory architecture to support the high throughput of this processor pipeline has been created, making the computation fabric capable of stream processing. The basic building blocks of this memory architecture are single cycle accessible, dual port scratchpad memories. A total of 16 instances of the computation fabric are implemented on a Virtex-7 FPGA, creating an array of multiprocessors that is capable of processing 43.52 images per second when running a typical medical image processing algorithm workload on an operating frequency of 193 MHz. This makes the implementation suitable for real-time medical image processing. The processor pipeline depth of the computation fabric is generic, and can be changed according to the requirements posed by the algorithm workload. This makes the architecture flexible and general enough to handle changes and updates to the algorithm workload.","FPGA; r-VEX; Streaming; Processor; Medical image processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","CE-MS-2016-15",""

(mentor); Nijsse, R. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Lankhof, A. (mentor)","2016","Many vacant buildings that are reused are constructed in concrete. With concrete, one thought to have found a solution for the fire resistance of buildings. Today it appears that the fire resistance of concrete is not always a matter of course. Therefore, it is important to properly asses the fire resistance of existing concrete buildings. With the intention to help the structural engineers in the future and to smoothen the process of the fire resistance assessment, this thesis summarizes and discusses the main points of attention concerning the determination of the fire resistance of existing concrete buildings. This is done by means of relevant literature, interviews, and a case study. The results of this research show that a structural engineer encounters several difficulties while assessing the fire resistance, beginning with the fire resistance requirements. Although the fire resistance requirements are slightly adapted and supplemented over the years, these requirements are still unclear and the backgrounds of these performance requirements are not explained in the Building Decree. In combination with the limited knowledge of the municipalities and the fire brigade, this could lead to unmotivated high demands and a difficult use of the principle of equivalence. Besides the knowledge of the municipalities and the fire brigade, the knowledge of the structural engineer himself is also limited. Although there are many temperature effects known, it appears to be difficult to get an idea of the fire resistance of the concrete material, as well as the structural behaviour under fire conditions. For these reasons, it will take some time before the calculation methods in the Eurocode could be supplemented with more detailed methods. Even though the current Eurocode recommends to assess the structure as a whole and notes that the imposed deformations should be taken into account, the Eurocode mainly gives simple calculation methods concerning individual elements or small parts of the structure. However, despite all these difficulties, this study also makes clear that it is still possible to deal with a fire resistance assessment of an existing concrete building in a more efficient way, partly due to the fact that the consequences of thermal expansions do not always have to be disadvantageous. Based on all the collected information, this thesis is concluded with a recommended approach for the structural engineer to assess the fire resistance of an existing concrete building.","fire resistance; concrete buildings; historic concrete; Building Decree; temperature effects; spalling; imposed thermal deformations; Eurocode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor)","2016","Additional Thesis - This thesis is part of a project by Deltares developing a strategy for resilient water management in Xochimilco and fulfillment of the Master degree Civil Engineering at the Technical University of Delft. Xochimilco is protected on a global level by UNESCO and deemed a World Cultural and Environmental Heritage Site, on a national level the site is a protected natural area. Xochimilco is situated in the south of the Federal District of Mexico City (UNESCO, 2006). The area is one of the most important environmental, historical and cultural symbols of Mexico City. Land subsidence is a big issue in this area, which is caused by groundwater exploitation in combination with highly compressible soils. This research developed a methodology for risk assessment that can be applied in other areas that suffer from land subsidence. The methodology was applied in Xochimilco and quantitatively and spatially assessed the risk of land subsidence caused by groundwater over-exploitation. For the development of the methodology a literature review about land subsidence in Mexico City was conducted. It is concluded that land subsidence has many associated consequences, damage to infrastructure, damage to buildings and permanent flooding were taken into account in the risk assessment. Furthermore, a literature review of current research in the field of land subsidence risk assessment was conducted. In most studies risk is regarded as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure, this definition was also used in this research. At the moment the risk assessment research focusses on vulnerability parameters such as GDP and population density. However, such parameters do not focus on the damage that can occur due to land subsidence. Therefore, an analogy with the methodology for flood risk assessment was used in this study, making use of vulnerability curves. Furthermore, the developed methodology makes the distinction between damages caused by absolute and differential land subsidence. The application of the methodology resulted in a risk map of Xochimilco. This risk map reveals a large risk of damage due to land subsidence in the transition area between clayey soil and volcanic deposits. Furthermore, the map shows that a part of cultural heritage site is under threat of permanent flooding and this might even expand into urban area in the upcoming 10 years. It is recommended to prioritise mitigating measures in these areas. Further research could be conducted in assessing the accuracy of the vulnerability curves that were applied, improving the resolution of the hazard maps and applying the methodology in different areas of Mexico City, or even different cities. In the end the methodology provides an approach towards risk assessment focusing on the direct damages involved. The resulting risk map can be used in order to determine the most important areas for preventive and mitigating measures. This study reveals and interesting perspective towards land subsidence. Instead of focusing on the the exact prediction of subsidence, the spotlight is put on the consequences. An important side, easily lost sight of because land subsidence is such a slow onset hazard.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor); Rezaei, J. (mentor); Van de Kaa, G. (mentor)","2016","The road transportation has been overly used in freight transportation for decades, and it has undesirable effects on the environment. Nowadays, with the ever-increasing awareness of environmental issues which is mainly caused by road freight transportation, intermodal transport is thus promoted in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But, even though many policies promoting the use of intermodal transport have been proposed, they have less impact to trigger shippers to shift mode from road transport to intermodal transport. The main reason might be that the real requirements of shippers towards transport mode are not well understood, hence this research is to investigate freight transport mode choice from their perspectives. The requirements for transport modes are abstracted into a set of factors, and knowing the perceived importance assigned to each factor is helpful to understand what should be improved in intermodal transport. In this research, the literature review regarding freight transportation mode is done aiming to generate an exhaustive list of decisive factors, and these factors are transport cost, door-to-door travel time, on-time reliability, flexibility, frequency, and reduction of CO2-emission. However, apart from these six factors, characteristics of the freight itself do play a role as a premise in freight transport mode choice, and factors are possibly perceived differently regarding different types of freights, therefore, four type of freights are chosen, which are freights from manufacturing industry, agriculture industry, perishable food industry, and chemical industry. Best-Worst method which is a Multiple Criteria Decision Making method is chosen to conduct data analysis, and online questionnaires are sent to the respondents which are divided into three groups: practitioners, industry experts, and professors. And, since this research mainly focus on two regions: Europe and the United States, all respondents are chosen from these two regions. The results of data analysis indicate an overall ranking of all factors, where transport cost is viewed as the most important, closely followed by on-time reliability, and reduction of CO2- emission is viewed as the least important. Moreover, through the comparison of the general perception of factors regarding four types of freights, it can be seen that one or more factors are perceived differently based on four types of freights. Besides, different groups of respondents do perceive specific factor differently, and perceptions of practitioners and professors differ a lot. Since these two types of comparison analysis have not been done in the previous literature, so this research is the first study to provide a perspective for understanding factors from the perceptions of different types of respondents and in terms of different types of freights. Besides, by including reduction of CO2-emission, this research provides an overview of this ever-increasing important factor.","Freight transport mode choice; CO2-emission; intermodal transport; best worst method (BWM); multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM); comparison analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-17","Technology, Policy and Management","","","Master Technology, Policy and Management","",""

(mentor)","2016","Land reclamations in deltaric areas provide space to meet the demand for a safe place to live and work. Sand, a traditional filling material in some locations is becoming scarcer. An alternative filling material is mud. Mud consists of clay, silt, sand, organic material, water and gas. Therefore, it is a versatile material and difficult to predict its consolidation behaviour. This research will contribute to better predicting the consolidation of soft cohesive sediment. The objective of this research is to determine if the consolidation behaviour is a function of the initial conditions. To assess the effect of the initial concentration of mud on consolidation behaviour, settling column experiments and Seepage Induced Consolidation (SIC) tests were performed. These experimental methods determine two sets of material parameters for consolidated beds with varying initial concentration. The first method is used to determine material parameters for a low initial concentration suspension, the second method for a high initial concentration mud mixture, when particles are no longer in suspension. The most important parameters in consolidation are permeability and effective stress. The consolidation behaviour is simulated with a 1-DV model that solves the Gibson consolidation equation. To simulate the consolidation behaviour of a high concentration a swelling coefficient is added. The density profile of a consolidated bed is simulated with material parameters from both experimental methods. Material parameters obtained from these methods differ by an order of magnitude. The simulated density profile with material parameters obtained from a SIC test compare better to the measured density profile from a physical model. When the density profile of a column is simulated with varying material parameters from SIC tests, there is an effect of material parameters on the simulated density profile. The simulated density profiles compared to measured density profiles show that the swelling is only present in high concentration mud. Therefore, the consolidation behaviour is dependent on the initial concentration. The material parameters obtained for low and high initial concentration mud are different. Thus, the initial concentration has an effect on the material parameters. There are differences observed between density profile simulations with varying material parameters. Therefore, the material parameters have effect on the final conditions. However, the significance of this effect is unknown. This research contributes to a better understanding of how to predict consolidation behaviour of mud or soft cohesive sediment.","consolidation; cohesive; sediment; settling; gelling; concentration; permeability; effective stress; Markermeer; Marker wadden; mud; land reclamation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","","52.60000, 5.40000"

(mentor); Sodja, J. (mentor)","2016","The general trend in the aerospace industry is to optimise lightweight and highly flexible wing structures made of composite materials. This flexibility gives rise to static and dynamic aeroelastic instability problems. Research by Kim and Lee, Murua et al., and Drazumeric et al. have proven that chord-wise flexibility has a significant effect on the aeroelastic characteristics of an airfoil [1–3]; including the aeroelastic instability boundaries. Drazumeric et al. have numerically and experimentally shown that by adding chord-wise flexibility the stability boundaries could be increased up to 79.2% in the region of bimodal flutter behaviour, meaning that conventional section flutter and plate flutter occur simultaneously. It has been identified that the two-dimensional aeroelastic characteristics of flexible airfoil has been studied for constant stiffness flexible airfoils only. The present project will take the next step by assuming a piecewise constant thickness distributed flexible trailing edge. An elastically supported rigid airfoil shaped leading edge with attached a flexible composite plate was considered. The piecewise constant thickness distribution of the flexible plate was optimized for increasing the critical flow velocity at which the aeroelastic instabilities occur. An aeroelastic model has been developed to determine the aeroelastic characteristics of an elastically supported airfoil with attached a flexible piecewise constant thickness distributed trailing edge. The thin airfoil is assumed to harmonically oscillate with small amplitudes. The aerodynamic forces and moments are calculated by adopting the Küssner and Schwarz model which relates the pressure distribution over the airfoil to the downwash [4]. The transverse motion of the plate is modelled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam under the assumption that no span-wise deformations in the flexible trailing edge occur. The aeroelastic stability boundary is obtained by solving a complex eigenvalue problem in matrix form. The solutions to the system of equations are obtained as couples of the reduced frequency with the corresponding critical flow speed. The aeroelastic model is used to tailor the thickness distribution of the flexible trailing edge to optimise for the critical flow speed. Optimisations are executed for airfoil sections with conventional sectional parameters and with unconventional sectional parameters. In all cases it can be seen that a convergence in critical flow velocities was obtained for a trailing edge divided in two sections with a constant thickness. Depending on the length of the flexible trailing edge an increase up to 76% was achieved for airfoils with unconventional parameters, while for airfoils with conventional parameters a limited increase up to 4.1% was achieved.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

Although entanglement is essential for practical implementations in those fields, it is hard to create and transmit entanglement reliably. External factors introduce noise which may destroy or weaken the entanglement. Consequently, there is a need for methods to improve entanglement. Entanglement distillation attempts to solve this problem. Entanglement distillation is a process where probabilistically from a fixed number of copies of noisy entangled states, a smaller number of more strongly entangled states is created. This is done using only local operations and classical communication. Various protocols are known to perform distillation. However, for many it is unknown whether better results are possible. The goal of this thesis is to show whether known protocols are optimal. The greatest amount of entanglement achievable by entanglement distillation can be expressed as a non-convex optimization problem over separable quantum states. This problem is further relaxed to a semide finite program which will yield upper bounds on performance of the distillation for specific input states. The program is applied to various states that occur in experimental setups. Two known protocols are shown to perform on the upper bound, thus, being optimal. Using a heuristic algorithm, we look for new protocols. Here the optimization is done iteratively over one quantum state at a time. However, this method did not result in any useful protocols.","quantum entanglement distillation; Quantum information; semidefinite programming; quantum entanglement","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Facylty Applied Sciences","","","",""
