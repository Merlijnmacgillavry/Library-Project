(mentor); Dijkstra, J. (mentor); Van Hoven, A. (mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor); Voorendt, M.Z. (mentor)","2013","Hardly any flood defence system is a continuous dike system, since it is often interrupted by non-water retaining structures, as for example stairs, buildings, roads, fences and trees. Also larger hydraulic structures as floodgates and sluices are sometimes situated in the dike alignment. The transition between these different objects and the dikes with grass covers is still an area that receives limited attention in current methods for design and safety assessment in the Netherlands and other countries. The problem at hand is that during flood disasters in New Orleans, Thailand and France, these transitions appeared to be vulnerable spots in the flood defence system. The erosion process of the grass cover developed fast around objects or structures which were placed on the inner slope and suffered from wave overtopping. The objective of this thesis is to gain insight into the vulnerability of transitions between dikes with grass covers and (non-)water retaining objects during overtopping of flood defences. This is achieved by testing the applicability of current erosion models for the structural transition zone. The defined erosion models are separated in a load and strength side, which are expanded with a load and strength parameter to define the influence of an object on the inner dike slope. For the impact zone of the wave is chosen for two models that use the pressure load of the wave as input, because the velocity is (nearly) zero at this point. In the zone next to the object or structure is chosen for a flow erosion model, because the velocity is assumed to be an important mechanism to initiate erosion. Numerical analyses are performed on the load side of the erosion process by the program ComFLOW. This model should determine the pressures and velocities that occur around an object. This is validated with a field experiment that used a similar set-up. It appears the model calculates the velocities on the slope accurately, but due to the lack of friction in the model this velocity accelerates too much on the transition between the slope and the horizontal part. However, it does show that the velocity next to the object has no peak acceleration, like was expected. Therefore the assumption that a velocity difference influences the load on the grass cover next to an object seems not plausible. For the field experiment with the overtopping simulator, two pressure gauges were installed in the impact zone in front of the object and on the slope. These showed with respect to measurements on the slope, besides a difference in the hydrostatic pressures, a large difference in the dynamic pressures. Conclusions with respect to the actual erosion around the object could not be drawn, because due to gaps in the soil in front of the object; this area was filled with concrete. The numerical modelling and field experiments led to erosion models for zone A and B, including the load and strength parameters for the influence of a structure. As a first validation of these models, the field experiment at the Vechtdijk is used. This experiment consisted of a slope with a tree close to the toe. For the erosion in the wave impact zone, it appeared the model predicted the time needed to reach the different erosion states quite well. However, the grass quality was assumed as average, which was not investigated during the experiment.","Grass erosion; Wave overtopping; Structural transition; Flood defence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Compared to the Netherlands, the traffic in Suriname is approximately five times less safe. Some figures of traffic safety in Suriname show that the situation is concerning. In 2010 the total amount of people demanding emergency help at the AZP due to traffic accidents was 5016. Compared with statistics from 2008, this number has increased with 35%, as in 2008 the quantity was 3697 people. Looking at the number of fatalities in 2003, the number was 62 and in 2010 it was 87, showing an increase of over 40% in eight years. This means an average increase of the number of deaths by about 5% per year in that period. When only the statistics of fatalities are taken into account, it is clear that the number of fatalities in 2003 (62 deaths) compared to 2007 (90 deaths) shows an increasing trend. In 2009 there was a peak of 112 fatalities, followed by a decrease to 87 deaths in 2010. Until 2012 it remained steady with 86 deaths in 2011 and 83 in 2012. From these figures, an upward trend can be observed for the number of road accidents and fatalities in Suriname. Road accidents are tragic events that often cause untold human suffering. In addition, every death is one too many. Traffic and road safety are important for the Surinamese and in particular road safety remains a ""hot issue"" in Suriname. Research scope This research focuses on the urban agglomeration Greater Paramaribo, which is assumed the districts of Paramaribo and the adjacent Wanica. Due to the realization of the bridge across the Suriname river, the urban area within the range of Paramaribo is enlarged to the western part of the district of Commewijne. Due to the low number of deaths (5 in 2010) in Commewijne that part is not included in the geographical demarcation of this research. Chapter 3 of this study emphasizes further on the geographical demarcation. Regarding traffic types, this research focuses on the road traffic of Greater Paramaribo. Road traffic is divided into two types: motorized traffic (cars, motorcycles, mopeds) and non-motorized traffic (pedestrians and cyclists). Given the scope of this study, the design measures are primarily focused on infrastructural aspects. Besides this, guidelines for possible generic measures are presented, such as in the area of enforcement and education. The degree of traffic safety can be expressed in many different ways. Direct variables that can be used to measure traffic accidents are the number of accidents or divided in terms of the number of fatalities or the number of victims with varying degrees of severity. In this study, the severity of the accident in terms of the number of fatalities is chosen as an indicator for traffic safety. In Greater Paramaribo, only the number of fatalities is registered and published by the authorities. Problem Definition The following problem definition has been formulated in this study: In the current situation many traffic accidents occurs in Greater Paramaribo. The traffic safety on the road network in Greater Paramaribo is insufficient. This research project has the following objective: Analyzing the traffic safety situation and providing recommendations for improving the current and future traffic safety situation in Greater Paramaribo. The main research question: What steps can be taken to improve traffic safety in Greater Paramaribo? To answer the research question, several sub-questions are derived. The answers to these sub questions should lead to the answer of the main research question. Each sub question is linked with a phase (Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation) of the chosen basic design methodology for this research. Used methods and techniques To answer the mentioned sub-questions, different methods and techniques are used: Literature study: A literature review is conducted to create theoretical basis of this research. The main advantage of this method is that much information can be gathered fast, which can be used to analyze the traffic safety situation in Greater Paramaribo. Document review: This research technique is used for the literature review, by consulting existing sources (secondary research). The sources consist of databases, archives and libraries. For example, data from a previous study is used to compare own collected data on traffic accident locations in Greater Paramaribo. Case Study: This method is used to identify and study the underlying causes of traffic accidents. Two techniques are used: the research paper (secondary research) and observations. By performing detailed observations on different locations, insight is gathered in the way certain situations occurred in practice due to infrastructural factors. Observations: This technique of data generation is used to investigate traffic conditions, road users and infrastructural concerns on site (called black spot roads). Therefore a list of infrastructural issues related to traffic safety is used as an observation schedule, road and intersection data is gathered and traffic situation sketches are made. Interviews: This technique is especially used to analyze the current policy on traffic safety. The number of people that is interviewed for this research is limited to the main actors that are involved in the traffic safety policy of Greater Paramaribo. Analysis: In this study, the black spot approach is used. The important steps in this approach are: 1. Analysis of accident statistics and identification of unsafe traffic locations (area where many accidents occur). 2. Analysis for searching patterns and commonalities of accidents at the sites identified, with the aim of determining 'why' the accident occurred. 3. The determination of measures (often infrastructural improvements) on basis of the analysis step. In this ""reactive"" approach, the unsafety at the dangerous locations with the most accidents is tackled. Conclusions The answers to the sub-questions are presented below, as a result of various research methods and techniques that have been applied. A1: What are the main factors that affect traffic safety and how can they be improved? In general there are three group of factors which affect traffic safety. These factors are related to human, vehicle and physical environment. These factors can be improved by: reducing the risk of exposure, by reducing the risk accident rate and by reducing the accident severity. The basic philosophy in improving road safety is by working simultaneously on different areas on the improvement of road safety. These areas are traditionally called the three E's (Education, Engineering, Enforcement), and should strengthen each other in order to provide good results. A systematic approach is needed there fore. A2: What is the current traffic safety situation in Greater Paramaribo? The analysis of accident statistics shows that there are more male (80%) than female (20%) fatalities in Greater Paramaribo. It can be assumed that men have a higher risk of being involved in traffic accidents and a higher chance to get killed due to these accidents. In the age group 21-40 years, most traffic victims occur, which is a fact for both male and female victims. This means that in Greater Paramaribo young people have a higher risk of dying due to a road accident. When looking at the type of victim, it can be noticed that the largest group of victims in Greater Paramaribo are mopeds (40%), followed by pedestrians (25%) and car drivers (20%). The increasing popularity of this vehicle (mopeds) in Greater Paramaribo, especially among young people, is problematic. Accidents by these road users are mostly caused by fast driving and other road users often not providing enough priority to the mopeds. The percentage of victims of cyclists is 9.70% and that of higher category cars (busses and trucks) is 3.73%. The road users in Greater Paramaribo which have the most risk of getting involved in traffic accidents are the so called slow traffic users (mopeds, cyclists and pedestrians). This group has a higher risk to die due to a traffic accident. If we look at the type of collision that mainly occurs in Greater Paramaribo, it can be noticed that the majority (35%) of collisions occur between cars (motorists) and mopeds. Secondly these collisions occur between pedestrians and cars (20%) and thirdly (18%) are single-vehicle accidents (mopeds excluded). The percentage of accidents between cyclist and cars is 8.96%, moped- moped accidents is 5.22%, car-car accidents is 7.46% and the last type is between pedestrians and mopeds with a percentage of 4,48%. The fact that there are a limited number of unilateral moped accidents (moped-moped) with fatalities may suggest that these road users exceed the allowed maximum speed, or die due to collusion with obstacles on and around the roads. In accidents involving several road users, mostly car drivers are the counterparty. If the counterparties of these car drivers are being grouped; it shows that 70% are car drivers. This indicates that between slow and fast traffic users, main problems causing traffic collisions exist implicating that measures must be related to infrastructural factors. As most fatalities in Greater Paramaribo take place between these groups, the focus in preventing accidents lies on the group moped riders, cyclists and pedestrians. Environmental factors that may affect traffic accidents based on analysis of statistics: For each weather season, the occurred type of collusions is analyzed in order to identify possible causes for traffic accidents influenced by environmental factors. The aim was to investigate whether environmental factors such as moisture or water on the road surface causes traffic accidents. Analysis shows that most of the moped-car accidents occur in the rainy season, which is also applicable to the pedestrian and cyclist accidents. Causes of traffic accidents due to environmental factors:  Poor or absent drainage facilities on the road, leading rainwater to remain longer on the road.  Bad visibility for vulnerable users through the raindrops.  Remaining rainwater on the road causing users to avoid this and using the space (pavement) of the faster road users like cars.  Poor road conditions (potholes), which are filled with water and form a risk for two wheelers when riding into them, resulting to lose control of their vehicle.  Sidewalks for pedestrians often get flooded, which can cause them to fall down or to use the road instead These conditions create a traffic hazard situation which can result to an accident involving vulnerable road users. A3: Which actors are involved within the scope of this research and what are their interests? The main stakeholders are the Ministry of Public Works (OW) in terms of infrastructure related issues and the Traffic Police (VP) regarding enforcement related issues. OW and VP are the actors which can influence the traffic safety policy of Greater Paramaribo. All the other involved actors have the same interest, which is to improve the current traffic safety situation of Greater Paramaribo. A4: What criteria can be used for the implementation of measures? The analysis shows that the main criteria that have to be taken into account for implementing measures are costs and road traffic safety. A5: Which roads and intersections within the traffic network of Greater Paramaribo are unsafe? It can be concluded that in general all types of roads (category 1: arterial, category 2: collectors and category 3: local roads) are unsafe in Greater Paramaribo. This is based on the analysis in this research indicating that there are no major differences in percentage of fatalities per road type (38% in category 1, 34% in category 2 and 28% in category 3 roads). A6: What are the characteristics (infrastructure-related factors) of these roads and intersections that make them unsafe? After selecting a number of black spots for further research, it can be concluded that different risk factors related to the infrastructure influence road traffic accidents. If these factors are classified, the following areas are distinguished: Design, Construction, Road Marking & Signaling and Maintenance. The black spot list generated from dataset 1 is validated and reliable, since these roads are also known as black spot roads based on analysis of dataset 2. S1: What measures will improve the safety on the roads and intersections of Greater Paramaribo? Infrastructure measures related to the following five risk areas: Design, Construction, Road Marking & Signaling and Maintenance: Design  Avoid conflicts of crossing traffic as much as possible  Physical separation of vehicle types when there are large differences of speed  Reducing speed at conflict points (such as intersections)  Ensure recognizable road categories Construction, Signaling & Marking  Better and more road marking and signaling  Speed reducing measures  Construction of sidewalks and better pavement and more visible crosswalks  Refer mopeds to the bicycle and moped lanes on the category 1 roads, leading to a smaller degree of mixed traffic between vehicles with large speed differences.  Construct broader cycle lanes  Road markings by constructing more lines and crosswalks Maintenance  Creating optimal conditions for good visibility.  More, safe and clean sidewalks for pedestrians  Uniform and cleaning sidewalks  Maintaining drainage services of road and sidewalk regularly  Paving of unpaved sidewalks, leading to good infrastructure facilities for pedestrians  Maintaining pedestrian crossings regularly, making them optimally visible for road users S2: What measures are applicable for Greater Paramaribo? Besides the infrastructural measures (from S1) also generic measures must be taken. These generic measures can be aimed on the vehicle, the drivers and the assistance. Besides these orientations of generic measures, combinations with group age categories can be made. Examples of generic measures for mopeds:  Information / Education aimed at younger drivers  Helmet duty in combination with helmet requirements  Counteracting engine volume increase of the vehicle (moped)  Introducing moped license and setting of a minimum age for driving a moped  Requirements on training and examination Higher enforcement regarding speed, helmets and vehicle engine volume increase E1: What are expected effects of these measures? In particular, the infrastructure-related measures have been successfully implemented in many countries leading road safety to score high and benefits greater than the costs. In general, the expected effects when these measures are implemented in Greater Paramaribo will be also positive. E2: What advice can be given to the authorities of Greater Paramaribo concerning traffic safety improvement? The advice to the authorities on the shorter term is to define traffic policy which is based on a reactive approach and for the longer term a pro active approuch in order to improve traffic safety. Infrastructure measures to be implemented on the short term can be in the field of signaling & marking and maintenance. On existing roads and intersections where there is enough space available, applying traffic facilities (pedestrian crossings, bus bays, clean roadsides etc.) for vulnerable road users can be started with. For the longer term, measures have to be implemented in the field of design and construction. The preparation of design standards and guidelines is an action which can be started on the short term. Once these are established for Greater Paramaribo, new infrastructure can be designed based on these standards. Audits can be performed to assure that new infrastructure is designed and constructed in accordance with the directives and standards. When generic measures are taken into consideration for being implemented, it is necessary to investigate for which type of road users it is meant. By taking this into account generic measures can perform better, because they are more effective and reflected better on the practice, compared to a general situation. For the situation in Greater Paramaribo the focus must be on the vulnerable road users like the mopeds, pedestrians and cyclists. Generic measures such as campaigns and education programs must be implemented on short term. Recommendations  Elaborate further on specific measures in the category generic- and infrastructural measures for each target group is recommended. Further elaboration will create a more accurate picture of associated costs and return (benefits) in terms of road safety. Further research into the preparation and development of design guidelines and standards to be established for new roads and intersections is also recommended  Categorize the road network of Great Paramaribo to an official functional hierarchy of roads.  Register traffic accidents in a systematic way. Further research is recommended on this area, since it has proved during this research how limited and laborious it is to consult data sources. For effective road safety policy and research recording accident data is essential, because it gives insight in characteristics of these accidents. It is desirable that software used in registration procedures is user-friendly, so that the competent authorities do not have to experience difficulties. In this way, exchange of data between main data collectors (ABS, AZP and VP) can be very beneficial in sense of using it as input for effective road safety policy.  With the existence of the SOV an important step towards the development of road safety policy has been made in Greater Paramaribo. However, it is recommended to use this graduation project as a turn of input for the establishment of a road safety plan. The black spots investigated in this study can be elaborated further into specific measures that can be implemented to improve traffic safety on these locations.","verkeersveiligheid","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Since it is usually difficult to use classical mathematic models to understand these systems, scientists and engineers have to resort to simulations. Currently programming languages like CUDA C and OpenCL are available to run large scale simulations on a GPU architecture. Alternatively simulations can be executed on agent-based simulators such as NetLogo. The former enables the writing of highly performant programs whereas the latter offers a simple language and execution model which is accessible to people with little programming experience. The purpose of this thesis is to devise a proof-of-concept simulator called CudaSimulator which attempts to create a middleground between NetLogo and CUDA, which on the one hand retains the simplicity of NetLogo and on the other hand executes simulations on a GPU architecture. Apart from the general context this thesis is motivated by a specific demand. The Snowdrop project at the Embedded Software Group, TU Delft, aims to find algorithms that are written in the NetLogo programming language and exhibit certain emergent behavior. In order to find such algorithms Genetic Programming is used. Since a Genetic Programming framework has to simulate and evaluate a lot of algorithms and this process is usually lengthy, it could be accelerated on a GPU architecture. The CudaSimulator is therefore developed in such a way that it could serve as a backend to the Genetic Programming framework. The thesis includes an evaluation of the simulator which shows the situations in which the CudaSimulator is more feasible than alternative solutions.","MANET; distributed; simulation; CUDA; GPGPU; NetLogo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

The procedure is performed with a transvaginal ultrasound probe and an intrauterine foam, ExEm©-Foam. The foam distends the walls of the fallopian tubes and has echogenic properties. The ultrasound waves excite the air bubbles inside the foam, which in turn reflect and emit harmonic vibrations. The pulse inversion mode on the ultrasound instrument processes the returned vibrations into high contrast and sharp images. The graduation project describes the exploration of disposable mixers for the creation of ExEm©-Foam. Several foaming principles are evaluated on suitability, efficiency and feasibility. The concepts are divided in continuous and batch process categories. IQ Medical Ventures, the manufacturer of the ExEm©-Foam kit, was interested in a continuous solution, but the study shows that batch processes are more efficient, feasible and attractive. The final design is an optimization of the existing ExEm©-Foam kit. The new foam kit exists of two 10 ml Farco-Pharma syringes, one filled with 5 ml of ExEm©-Gel and the other with 5 ml of purified water. The syringes are attached to a custom connector, the LinQ. This allows the transfer of the fluids from one syringe to the other. The Venturi effect occurs due to the narrow nozzles of the syringes and causes cavitational forces to split the air bubble inside the syringe. The foam is prepared after ten repetitions of fluid transfer from one syringe to the other. The LinQ is an addition to the foam kit and is an inexpensive, disposable connector for the two syringes. The mixing setup has been redesigned to prevent disconnection problems, which caused entire ExEm©-Foam kits to be spilled. The LinQ simplifies and strengthens the fixation of the syringes, stabilizes the mixing setup, optimizes mixing efficiency and gives the foam kit a mature appearance. The LinQ is made of ABS with injection moulding and reduces the production costs of the ExEm©-Foam kit.","foam; medisign; gynaecology; ultrasound; hyfosy; contrast; bubbles; iq; medical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","Medisign","",""

This thesis presents a theoretical analysis of traction power generation by a tethered wing. The objective is to establish the fundamental relationships between system and operational parameters on the one hand, and the achievable mechanical power output on the other hand. It is assumed that the instantaneous flight state of the wing can be approximated by the steady equilibrium of aerodynamic and tether forces. The analysis covers the general case of controlled flight along an arbitrary, predefined trajectory with varying tether length. The analysis is compared with several special cases that are available in literature. In a second step, the effect of weight and centrifugal acceleration of the wing is included in the analysis, as well as the effect of weight and aerodynamic drag of the tether. To estimate the potential traction power generation the analysis is applied to the specific trajectory of a pumping cycle, which is characterized a traction phase, in which the kite performs figure-eight maneuvers, a retraction phase and a transition phase.","power; airborne; wind; energy; kite; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Birglen, L. (mentor)","2013","Underactuated graspers are known for their self-adaptability. The final configuration of the grasper in which it obtains a stable grasp relies on the static equilibrium of the grasper and object. Any external or inertial force that acts on the object disturbs this static equilibrium and causes a change in the configuration of the grasper. The self-adaptability therefore reduces the robustness against external perturbations. This thesis introduces the concept design of an underactuated grasper with the ability to adjust its level of self-adaptability by changing the rotational stiffness of an internal differential mechanism. By implementing a bi-stable mechanism the grasper is able to transfer from a compliant state to a stiff state once the actuator force overcomes a threshold value. Experimental validation of the concept design shows that the lateral compliance of the grasper in the stiff state is reduced by a factor of 7 compared to the compliant state. The lateral pull-out force of the grasper in the stiff state is increased by a factor of 1.9 compared to the compliant state. As a result a grasper was designed which uses the benefits of self-adaptability to grasp an object and increases its robustness once a stable grasp is obtained without the need of an additional actuator.","underactuated grasping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The use of media among young children is growing and a growing amount of media content is aimed directly at this target group. It is foundation Cinekid’s aim to contribute to the improvement of children’s position towards media and to improve image culture for children. Due to the dynamics of the current media climate Cinekid sees the need to rethink their positioning: A future vision and suiting product service design provides opportunity for this. This report describes the process of the graduation project ‘Reframing Cinekid: a new frame of reference for foundation Cinekid’. The topic of this report is foundation Cinekid, based in the Netherlands. Foundation Cinekid organizes the largest media festival for children worldwide, covering cinema, television and new media. Due to several changes in their working field, Cinekid sees the need to rethink their positioning. For this graduation project the Vision In Product method is applied as used within the company of KVD Reframing. KVD Reframing has further developed the ViP method into the Reframing method. This report describes the results of the application of this method. In accordance with Cinekid the research domain was established as ‘Media for children in 2020’. Extensive context research was done on a broad range of factors that influence Cinekid company as a whole. In order to structure the information found, the factors where grouped into clusters. These clusters served as the input for the formation of a framework. This framework represents the future context, based on the found factors in the research domain. The framework describes the future media use of children in general. In accordance with Cinekid, a vision statement was developed that describes the position Cinekid will take in response to the future context. To give more depth to the vision statement, suiting interaction qualities and product qualities were developed. An internal analysis of Cinekid was executed to gain insights on how the vision statement can find the best strategical fit within Cinekid. This altogether provided a list of requirements, and in combination with the vision statement served as the basis for product development. Several concepts were developed, one was chosen and further elaborated. Research was done on the way children make distinctions between media and how they search for media. The final design is an online media portal for children, designed to fit to children’s way of searching for media. The core idea behind the website is to stimulate children to take control of their own media consumption, by allowing them to search for and select media of their interest. An interactive prototype was made and tested in Science Centre Nemo. The report concludes with the results of this research and a reflection on the final design.","vision in product; media; website; Cinekid; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-05-30","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Rezaei, J. (mentor); Seck, M.D. (mentor); Radstaak, B. (mentor); Audenaerdt, R.J.M. (mentor)","2013","Transport collaboration has been applied in many different industries both on vertical and horizontal level; to improve transport performance and reduce transport costs. In the air cargo industry currently limited transport collaboration exists both on horizontal and vertical level for inner airport transport of freight forwarding companies. High growth rates and healthy operating margins had limited the need for extensive collaboration in the past. However due to changing dynamics of air cargo transport use and type of shipments that are transported at major established airport in Western Europe, like Schiphol airport, there is an increased focus on cost reductions and improved transport performance. Therefore horizontal transport collaboration could be applied to improve the transport performance and costs for air cargo freight forwarders active at major airports. This research has tried to reveal the potential and main challenges of applying horizontal transport collaboration at Schiphol airport for air cargo shipments. This research has combined both qualitative and qualitative methods to support the potential of horizontal transport collaboration within a large air cargo system, by combining analyses on different major cargo airports with both a case study simulation model and system analysis on specific shipment collaboration at Schiphol as a whole. The results of this study indicate that for many freight forwarding companies, supporting horizontal transport collaboration could significantly improve transport costs and performance. However in order realize the potential benefits of horizontal transport collaboration; companies will have to transport shipments on regular basis that are suitable for transport collaboration. Also forwarding companies will have to be much more flexible and adaptive, regarding the use of different types of transport and the way shipments are collected/delivered, in order to make horizontal transport successful based on costs and performance. With the expected lower growth rates of air cargo and more dynamic transport of air cargo shipments with lower operating margins at major established airports in Western Europe, horizontal transport collaboration is also expected to be effective approach for coming decades. Given the existing overcapacity at most air cargo handlers at different airports and the reluctance of air cargo handlers to invest in more automated systems, due to uncertainty about air cargo growth. Besides this supporting horizontal transport collaboration can also improve the relationships with air cargo handlers, forwarders and transport companies, which can make part of the air cargo transport more stable and effective. It can give the air cargo handler and forwarder the ability to offer different transport concepts to their customers. However to truly realize the full potential of horizontal transport collaboration, the use of horizontal transport has to be frequently assessed and improved, due to changing shipment dynamics of the involved companies. Next to this the remaining single company transport use should also be adapted as well on regular basis, in order to improve the transport costs and performance of the complete transport system. Not all forwarding companies active at a major airport, will be willing or able to support either horizontal or vertical transport collaboration, therefore it is advised to assess the possibility for all air cargo handlers individually, at major airports, to apply segmentation on transport collaboration. This segmentation should be assessed regarding potential and the ability of companies to collaborate within a specific transport flow, between the warehouses of two or more companies. This means that both forwarders and air cargo handlers should support vertical and horizontal transport collaboration when it results in; higher benefits for their own organization, for the other involved stakeholders and all companies are able to effectively support the intended collaboration.","horizontal collaboration; airport logistics; Schiphol; forwarder; air cargo; air cargo handling; transport preformance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-30","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport & Logistics","","System Engineering Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2013","This report documents the design and development of an affordable, appealing and well-performing solar handheld-device charger (the Solution), which fits the needs of the targeted users, who live in developing countries, have no or only limited access to electricity, but can afford to, and have the aspiration to own a mobile phone. The assignment was provided by Lemnis Solar, a start-up company that develops and sells high quality solar products focused on emerging markets, especially in Southern Africa, where having no access to electricity is still part of people’s daily life. Many people worldwide still have no safe and reliable access to the electrical grid. Africa has one of the biggest non-electrified populations, which is expected to grow even bigger in the coming years. Moreover, the off-grid population is not the only market for alternative power sources; households with unreliable grid connections are in need of additional solutions as well. Lack of access or limited access to electricity is a general problem in many African countries. Mobile phones can improve people’s lives in developing countries significantly, and are becoming increasingly common among the poor in Africa because of their affordability. However, due to the continent’s low electrification, millions of mobile phone users are in need for alternative phone charging solutions, and their number is predicted to grow in the future because the pace of electrification of the continent cannot keep up with the growing population and the growing number of mobile phone owners. Solar technology is a promising solution for mobile phone charging, which is already becoming increasingly popular in Africa. To simplify the process of defining the user needs, South Africa was selected as the focus of this project, where the major relevant problems are existent as well. It was found that the most popular phones are cheap and basic, or slightly more advanced, but still low cost models. The variety of phones is diverse; and a solar charger will need to be compatible with all of them. Several solutions are used by those who have no access to electricity to charge their phones. However, the majority of them are unaffordable, inconvenient and unsafe. Personas were created; and based on their needs, the design direction for developing a suitable solar charger was defined. The direction, a portable versatile solution is a smaller scale product that can be used in various conditions and locations. It focuses on mobile-device charging, and is powerful enough to be a satisfactory phone charging solution on its own. Its portability and versatility makes it a suitable product in a variety of scenarios. This solution is needed by those who have no access to convenient and cheap methods to charge their phones and by those who need a reliable and flexible back-up solution. There is a big variety of solar chargers on the market. However, the majority does not fit the needs of the target group. Their main problems are that they do not have the right performance, which was specified based on the analysis of solar, and battery technologies, and price, which was found to be too high for the target group. The functions of the Solutions were defined: harvesting energy by converting solar radiation into electricity (charging), storing the harvested electricity and releasing the harvested electricity and charging electronic devices with it (discharging). Moreover the main criteria that it has to meet in order to satisfy the needs of the target group were specified: affordability, portability versatility, durability, clarity, good performance, safety and attractive appearance. Based on these design guidelines, concepts were formulated. The best two concepts were prototyped, and tested as part of a field research, which was conducted in Zimbabwe, to gain knowledge about how the concepts could be improved, and which one should be chosen to be the basis of the final design of the Solution. The research consisted of product testing, observations and interviews. The results of the field research were used to create the final design proposal. The result of the project, the Solution is a portable, versatile and affordable solar handheld-device charger, which provides a safe, reliable and convenient charging solution. It charges all mobile phones and a wide variety of battery powered devices. It is equipped with an internal battery, which stores enough energy to charge a basic mobile phone completely. The internal battery can be charged by solar power in only one sunny day, and it can also be charged from the AC power grid. It is simple and easy to use, and can be operated with only one button. It is equipped with a LED indicator to show how much power is left in its battery. The Solution comes in an aesthetic protective case, which can be used as a stand to ensure that its solar panel is in the right position in any circumstances.","design; solar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-05-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Wiggenraad, P. (mentor); Baggen, J. (mentor)","2013","While the fourth railway package is under way at the European Commission in Brussels, French railways are at a crossroad. Despite being one of the first to restructure its organization and separate infrastructure management and train operations in 1997, and opening freight to competition n 2006, since then the industry can appear as though nothing had changed. There is marginal train competition introduced by the Italian railways between Paris and Milan, the new freight operators have managed to capture a quarter of traffic, but the main segment, national and local passenger trains, is still to be opened. Resistances are multiple and varied. Some based on economic rationale – opening TGV traffic brutally would disorganize production and not benefit anyone – others lie more with French corporatism and reluctance to change. With 150,000 employees under the highly protected railway worker statute, and millions of French workers at threat of not being to be able to go to work when a strike occurs, it takes very strong political will to push for opening of the lager share of railway operations, however shy that opening could be. Under the government of Nicolas Sarkozy and with the strong impulsion of Nathalie Kosciusco-Morizet, minister for Ecology and Transports until May 2012, the idea was promoted to open competition progressively for national transport, beginning by one or two Intercity lines. This strong stance and the interest of third-party operators triggered the present study with a central question: What are the requirements for a new TOC to operate a French Intercity line if it were to be tendered to competition in 2014? How would this apply to the specific case of Quimper-Nantes-Bordeaux-Toulouse? To answer the main question, the research approach begins with a system analysis of French railways and their environment. This first section begins broadly by considering the organisation of railways throughout Europe. This continental outlook first underlines that there is no single but several approaches or models to opening passenger train operations to competition. In any case, whether the national operator is kept as a whole (in Germany or in Sweden) or cut in smaller chunks (in the United Kingdom), competition has brought in strong productivity gains and increased the quality of service to the customers. But to meet these results, prerequisites are negotiations with the actors and specifically the employees, and strong regulation to guarantee fair and efficient competition, backed by strong political will. Then the analysis focuses then on the French organisation and on how competition could be introduced. Because of the multiplicity and complexity of the actors involved, the system is first considered in its environment, with an analysis on the political decision centres that actually fund public transports. The focus then turns on the railway industry itself, considering the current rift between the two key actors, SNCF on the one side (transport operator) and RFF on the other (network management), with the myriad of smaller actors revolving around them. SNCF has the weight of the years and a very rigid and vertical organization, making it practically an administration in itself, if not a branch of the Transport Ministry. RFF is a younger organization (born in 1997) that gained its limited powers by fighting every inch against SNCF. Originally an artificial accounting trick to get the debt of railways out of the State accounts and allow for entry in the Euro, RFF has managed to develop its credibility and have a voice that counts in the industry. The process antagonized both companies, SNCF generally considering RFF useless if not illegitimate, and RFF feeling threatened by SNCF. The absurdity of the situation is even pushed further with RFF actually not being able to maintain the tracks itself but having to use SNCF workers for that. This results in SNCF paying tolls to RFF who then pays SNCF to fulfil railway works. It is estimated that as many as 45,000 SNCF workers are actually working directly for RFF. These imbrications and the complex relationship between SNCF and RFF accounts for very high transaction costs, deepening the debt of the industry. Beyond the issue of how the relationship between RFF and SNCF should be improved, the question is how best to introduce competition. Competition in the market and competition for the market are introduced and discussed, the latter being preferred due to the natural monopoly quality of railways and French social preferences. Given resistance to change mentioned above, the introduction of competition is likely to be very progressive, starting probably with experimentation. And since the Intercity lines are most likely to be opened first, they are considered in depth and analyzed, and it is shown there are opportunities for development there. All along this first chapter on system analysis, requirements are gathered. These are external requirements that have to be making the railway market interesting for a new operator to enter it. They are assembled and grouped along the lines of external political factors, stakeholders’ involvement strategy and choice of the most suitable line. To analyze a line and elaborate a service design, a methodology is developed and described, kept in general terms, and applied to the case study of Nantes-Bordeaux, firstly for Institutions analysis and then for technical analysis. These lead to criteria that will be used in for the evaluation. Because of the key role of political figures in funding and deciding over transport infrastructures and operations, the first part of the analysis focuses on a systematic analysis of local politicians and their networks of influence. Key figures are identified, that could push the project forward and perhaps even attract funding. Then the environment of the line is considered, with specific attention to the users demands, formulated in line committees and via the users’ associations. The technical analysis of the line describes the state of the infrastructure, with the challenge of a line that is only partially electrified and is aging rapidly, with speed limitations as low as 40 km/h on certain segments, the current rolling stock is introduced, that is also characterized by great age and subsequent low reliability. Then, so as to get an idea of possible demand potential and development possibilities, the competition is systematically analyzed for air, car and coaches, with all lines and routes described and analyzed, in terms of travel time and price. Nantes-Bordeaux suffers from strong car competition, with travel time by car quite similar and very little toll costs. Nantes-Toulouse faces strong direct competition from airlines, with very regular flights operated by Air France but also by Easy Jet, thus at prices often below that of the train, for a much reduced travel time. These different lines of analysis lead to criteria that will eventually be used to evaluate proposed scenarios. Following the analysis, scenarios are drawn, on the institutional side and on the technical side. With the criteria elaborated in the analysis, these scenarios are then evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. For the institutions, it has thus been accepted by all actors that the dual situation between SNCF and RFF must be put to an end. Two scenarios are considered, one seeing RFF getting full infrastructure management and overseeing all employees linked to the network, while SNCF would retain train operations only. The second scenario sees SNCF building itself in a holding overseeing both network management and train operations, copied on the German railway industry. Both scenarios are discussed and evaluated. The full separation scenario leads to more fair competition, but the holding scenario is more acceptable for the workers and for the government. On the technical side, three service scenarios are built, according to the systematic approach elaborated. The key differentiation point is whether to consider the line as a whole and spread services over its full length (Scenarios T1 and T1bis) or to strive to provide services where they are most needed, i.e. on the central segment between Nantes and Bordeaux (Scenario T2). Both possibilities are assessed with the criteria and it appears that if focusing on the central trunk makes more sense from a user and operator point of view, allowing for more trains to service the most useful part, spreading services over the full length also secures support of many more political figures that can prove key in funding the project. Finally an outlook into future prospects considers the influence possible improvement works would have on running time, with a likely time gain of 90 minutes on the whole, and a much better service to the customers as a consequence. To further improve service, hourly services are drawn and evaluated. Overall, it appears that there is room for a new approach on French railways that would discard past “historical” timetables and strive to build new ones based on users’ demands rather than on politician games. This new approach, although unsatisfying for historical user groups, can unleash untapped growth potential and develop ridership on train services. Once and if the experimentation of competition on Nantes Bordeaux is achieved and successful, the next step could be a relatively independent group of lines with a much larger volumes, typically Paris to Clermont-Ferrand. More generally, now that questions arise about the pertinence of TGV as an absolute ideal for all territories, there is room for a reflection on the key role of Intercities in France, which should not be seen anymore as a leftover between TGV and TER but as a key means of transport and growth factor, which, if it is adapted to the needs of today’s users, can definitely meet success and improve lives of passengers.","France; trains; Intercity; railway competition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","TIL","",""

This tool shows high potentials for coastal modelling due to the flexibility in domain resolution and unstructured grids. This MSc thesis focussed on implementing wave effects in D-Flow FM with satisfying results. In addition, a coupling system is built, enabling a flexible coupling between D-Flow FM and the wave module SWAN, for modelling the wave-current interaction. An innovative program-structure is presented which provides a dynamic coupling tool enabling interactive modelling. This coupled tool shows large opportunities for coastal models where flexible resolution and geometry fitting are desired. Applications like the Sand Engine or the Wadden Sea modelling tidal velocity patterns at offshore regions and meandering gullies and rip channels at nearshore regions, all in one domain. These kinds of models are usually very computationally intensive, especially when morphodynamics are also included. With the introduction of unstructured modelling, coastal applications like the Sand Engine or the Wadden Sea, are modelled more efficiently. The wave formulations implemented in D-Flow FM are state-of-the-art and correspond to the implementation as in Delft3D, which have been tested and validated with success. In the validation of wave modelling by D-Flow FM, four different test cases are considered. First, a simplified open channel flow is analysed, where the general performance of D-Flow FM is verified to the analytical solution. Second, an M2-tide for an alongshore uniform beach is modelled. Next, oblique incident waves are modelled on a planar beach. And finally, a non-uniform barred beach is modelled (Egmond case) with rip channels induced by waves. By means of these test cases the wave formulations in D-Flow FM are validated. From the test cases, it is concluded that modelling waves in D-Flow FM generally gives good agreement with validated Delft3D models. The velocity patterns, both in magnitude and direction, show a good match, as confirmed by the Egmond case. The water levels modelled by the planar beach case match the Delft3D simulation as well. However, despite a good performance inside the surf zone, small model deviations are found outside the surf zone, at intermediate water depths. These model deviations should be reduced by correcting the bed shear stress for Stokes drift. Past studies have proven the benefits of unstructured modelling over structured techniques, which shows high potential for D-Flow FM. With the inclusion of wave effects in D-Flow FM, improvement to nearshore modelling is made, but an extensive validation needs to be done. The dynamic software coupler provides an interactive modelling experience, and serves as a comprehensive tool for general model understanding. These developments have contributed significantly to improve nearshore modelling by D-Flow FM.","Delft3D; D-Flow FM; SWAN; unstructured grid; flexible mesh; numerical wave modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Caarls, W. (mentor)","2013","In this thesis one of the negative effects of learning from scratch on the durability of LEO is analysed. LEO is one of the bipedal walking robots of the TU Delft Robotics Institute. It uses Reinforcement learning to learn a stable and energy efficient walking gait. LEO’s learning algorithm causes its gears to fail faster during the initial learning phase than during the optimisation phase. One of the reasons for the low mean time between failure (MTBF) is the learning algorithm itself. The learning algorithm initially causes random motions which in turn cause high stresses in the gears and mechanical failure. The MTBF due to these motions can be predicted. This MTBF can be increased by adapting the learning algorithm in various ways. We investigated 5 algorithms that increase the MTBF and compared them to SARSA(?) learning. In general, increasing the MTBF decreases the learning performance. Three of the investigated algorithms are unable to increase the MTBF while keeping their learning performance approximately equal to SARSA(?). Two algorithms are able to do this: the PADA algorithm and the low-pass filter algorithm. In case of LEO, the MTBF can be increased by a factor of 108 compared to SARSA(?) learning. This indicates that in some cases, failures due to random motions can be prevented without decreasing the learning performance.","reinforcement learning; mechanical failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biorobotics","",""

(mentor)","2013","Designing and modelling foundation structures crosses two engineering disciplines. The structural engineer who designs the structure and the geotechnical engineer who determines the bearing capacity of the soil. When modelling large shallow foundations, it is not always clear how to determine the stiffness of the soil and how it should be used in structural software programs. In general, the stiffness is determined by the geotechnical engineer and the determined value is used by the structural engineer. To determine the stiffness, it is important to know the intended use. For the use of the stiffness, it is also necessary to know what restrictions/assumptions are applicable. Besides uncertainties when determining the soil stiffness, other methods to model the interaction between structure and soil are also not straightforward. The goal of this thesis is to develop a consistent way of modelling large concrete slab foundations and optimize the interaction between structural and geotechnical engineers. The model should take into account the interaction between structure and soil and should be able to yield correct, fast (computational and modelling time) and useable results for the designer. The conclusions of this thesis can be split up into three parts. The first is related to the analytical analyses of different foundation models that were investigated, the second is related to the computational analyses and the third is related to the communication between structural and geotechnical engineer. Three simple foundation models with constant parameters have been analysed: A Winkler foundation, a Pasternak foundation and a Gradient foundation. The models were analysed analytically. In this study it is found that the results of Pasternak foundation model represents reality more consistently. This model only needs three input parameters and takes the spreading of the loads in the soil into account. This is done through the shear modulus of the shear layer (Gp value), which is difficult to determine. What can be concluded from the computational study is that, if the displacement is important, the Secant Method (SM) will calculate/provide values which are significantly smaller, compared to the Terzaghi and PLAXIS results, and another method must be used to verify the displacement. If the moment is important, the SM values can be used. The interaction between the structural and geotechnical engineer can be guided by a checklist. This list summarises the important aspects which need to be discussed to come to a quick and an appropriate model for a final design. This is an initial step towards improving and optimizing the work approach. What both engineers should keep in mind is that a Winkler model with non- uniform coefficients appears most suitable for most slab foundations.","modelling; shallow foundation; Winkler; Pasternak; SCIA; SOILin; PLAXIS; spring model; secant Method; Terzaghi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Wolvekamp, T. (mentor)","2013","The research showed that there is only a poor relation between second order bending moment magnification via Euler buckling and the actual geometrically nonlinear behaviour of arches. The better approach for the second order effect is to think of additional bending moments caused by imperfections and by the imaginary second order loading. The additional bending moments due to the second order effect are determined by the deformations and the horizontal thrust. The amplitude of the geometrical imperfection in the analyses is applied conform eurocode 2. Analysis showed the high sensitivity of arches to imperfections. The amplitude of the imperfection is a fictitious value to use in structural analysis. It incorporates deviations due to execution tolerances and material non-homogeneity. Due to time constraints, the derivation of the formula could not be investigated. However, it has a large influence on bending moments. Accounting for physical nonlinear behaviour is realistic and beneficial. The stiffness of concrete cross-sections varies depending on the internal forces it is exposed to. Bending moment peaks will lead to cracking. The resulting lower bending stiffness reduces the peak value. In this introducing analysis, the stiffness is applied according to M-N-? theory in which the initial uncracked stiffness and the lowest elastic stiffness (just before yielding is reached). A full physical nonlinear analysis, including the reinforcement and nonlinear stress-strain relations, will provide more detailed results. The three dimensional model, including the physical and geometrical nonlinear behaviour, is the best representation of the point supported structure. It can be optimized by modelling the spreading of the tandem axle load through the foamed concrete more accurately. The most accurate and elaborate model will lead to the most detailed results, when modelled well. However, these models require much time. Computational time increases as equilibrium between loading, deformations and stiffnesses has to be found iteratively for each load combination separately. Furthermore, judging the large amount of output data in an elaborate model is time consuming as well. In practice, modelling all physical mechanisms as detailed as possible is considered with respect to uncertainties like the spread in soil data, accuracy of loads and deviations of material properties. These considerations might lead to the use of far more straightforward models in engineering. Nevertheless, for further research, it is good to know whether the three dimensional, physically and geometrically nonlinear model will lead to lower or higher internal forces compared to the more elementary models.","arches; second order effect; concrete bridge; structural design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Prevel, R.G. (mentor)","2013","For service robots to be employed in normal human environments, autonomous navigation is an important requirement. To enable autonomous navigation, the robot needs to be able to build a map of any unknown environment. The problem of letting a robot build a map and simultaneously localizing itself within the same map is known in robotics as the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. An important problem in SLAM is known as the loop closing problem. This problem occurs when the trajectory of the robot contains a large loop. After traversing this loop, the accumulated pose error causes the algorithm to fail to recognize the robot has returned to its original position. In this thesis a novel algorithm is introduced to improve the loop closing behaviour of a widely used SLAM algorithm, called FastSLAM. FastSLAM uses a particle filter to estimate the pose of the robot. The resampling step in the particle filter algorithm causes particle depletion, which inhibits correct loop closures. The proposed algorithm, called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO-)SLAM, uses ACO to improve the resampling step of the FastSLAM algorithm. ACO-SLAM does this by incorporating a measure of the map consistency and a measure for correct loop closures into the resampling step. Simulations are used to compare the performance of both algorithms with varying noise settings. Robby, the personal robot developed by the Delft Biorobotics lab, is used for experiments to test the performance of the algorithms in a realistic human environment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

However little is known about quantifying and structuring the costs related to MDM. In this thesis the question ”How can the possible reduction of costs for organizations which may result from implementing Master Data Management be modeled?” is investigated. This research presents an extensible meta-model for the costs related to MDM, which provides a method to structure these costs and compare them in different situations (e.g. before and after an MDM project) to calculate the possible cost reduction. In addition to the meta-model, a support tool has been developed, which acts as an operationalization of the meta-model and helps to model, visualize and compare these costs. Together, these provide a powerful set of tools to model the costs related to MDM, visualize the risks of poor MDM and show the importance of proper MDM. The advantage of our research is that the meta-model provides a fixed hierarchy, but gives the user enough modeling freedom to model their specific situations. Furthermore, the support tool provides an easy to use user interface to model and compare the costs and visualize the risks of poor MDM to an organization, which might convince them to start an MDM project to improve their master data quality (MDQ). Additionally, the support tool uses the extensible meta-model and is therefore powerful enough to model processes in detail as well. This means that the tool could not only be used to quickly show the costs and risks of poor MDM, but could also be used to thoroughly analyze the MDM situation within an organization.","mdm; master data; master data management; cost model; support tool; data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Information Architecture","",""

Realizing the fact that data collection scheme from in-situ test beds for large number of vehicles is always expensive and time consuming, before being employed in large scale, such safety critical system should be tested narrowing down the gap between real circumstances and analytical models in a simulation platform. It is evident that underlying radio wave propagation models can comprise the validity of large scale vehicular network simulation results. Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) channels have higher dynamics due to rapidly varying topologies and environments which have significant impact on performance study of upper layer protocols and applications. In spite of the fact that few measurement based empirical channel models are present in the literature, they are not tested for large scale vehicular networks.

During this MSc thesis, required amendment to the TNO’s in-house OPNET based 802.11p node model was made to meet the IEEE standard. To the best of author’s knowledge large scale simulation study of 802.11p nodes with realistic channel model is not present in the literature. Three different vehicular scenarios (i.e. suburban, highway, rural) were simulated with hundreds of IEEE 802.11p nodes in OPNET. For bringing down gap between real life behaviors of wireless channels in V2V communication a realistic Nakagami-m fading channel was developed to replace the standard OPNET propagation model. For the sake of implementing varying speed and separation distance, power spectrum and fading parameter-m were defined as function of velocity and separation distance respectively. Statistics were collected for large scale vehicular scenarios to evaluate performance of physical and higher layers. Retrieved scenario based results were compared with empirical channel models which showed fine resemblance between the mentioned models. Primarily, it was found that all the vehicles within the standard requirement for DSRC range of 1 kilometer may not receive packets. Finally, three different scenarios were collated which deduced that the multipath fading is more deciding factor for communication quality in contrast to the Doppler effect.","ITS; VANET; IEEE802.11p; channel models; modeling and simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Telecommunications","","Wireless and Mobile Communications","",""

Heinz is a multinational food company with many number one brands in their portfolio and always looking for opportunities to grow and improve. Heinz has a strong and wide portfolio for both products. Heinz offers the consumer choice in taste, health, convenience and process. These are also the four food quality attributes on which the food product selection model is based. The model shows how consumers search for product attributes that can indicate anything related to the four quality aspects and the costs to base a selection upon. Heinz Beanz and Pasta are in the high price range in both categories. Their main competition comes from private labels that offer the same products at much lower prices, sometimes at half the price of Heinz. The benefits Heinz has over private label and other brands are: a strong brand and a product choice. Heinz also makes use of health related product claims on the package, such as 1 of your 5 a day. Even though competitors have almost the same ingredients and nutritional values, they make less or no use of health claims. This provides Heinz a benefit over competitors, but there is a threat that competitors may also start using health claims. A more immediate challenge Heinz is facing is the stagnated growth in year on year sales for baked beans and processed pasta. Although they are the leading brand in both categories in value and volume, it is becoming difficult to increase profits. The challenge is thus not only holding a stronger position against competitors, but more importantly, drawing new sales to the category. Heinz needs to attract new consumer segments or find new occasions to use the product. One way to do this is via Goodness. Because baked beans and processed pasta have been a staple good for so long in the UK, consumers have specific associations with the products and how they are to be eaten. The products are seen as the healthy part of unhealthy and simplistic meals. This product image is standing in the way of growing in Goodness. Heinz needs to attract sales from consumers that are less frequent users of Beanz and Pasta. By looking at the current consumer segments, it can be determined which consumer is most interesting to focus on. Health Seekers are the most interesting consumer segment for this project, especially since they are the most triggered by Goodness. Health Seekers look for ways to lead healthy and balanced lifestyles. They form around 30% of the baked beans and processed pasta market, but are currently not the core focus segment for Heinz Beans and Pasta. As stated before, the focus on this project is to increase the Goodness awareness for Beans and Pasta by improving the product usage. This can be further specified: fitting better in a healthy lifestyle and being less perceived as unnatural. The benefit area for Pasta is a healthy alternative to other (children) snacks. The benefit area for Beanz is to become a part of healthy and inspiring dinner time meals. For Beans and Pasta a roadmap of concepts has been developed. Each roadmap has a marketing stage before launching new products, to prepare the market for the new product meaning the concepts embrace. In the Pasta roadmap, each concept unlocks new occasions to use Pasta as a healthy snack. In the Beanz roadmap each concept further unlocks healthy meals and introduces more variety to the diet via different kinds of beans and sauces.","Heinz; baked beans; Beanz; pasta; food","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-05-22","Industrial Design Engineering","SPD","","","",""

Small errors in parameters such as mass and length may result in a non-balanced mechanism producing shaking forces. Normally a mechanism would be balanced using a trial and error method, which repeats the use of trial weights and measurements until the mechanism is balanced, however this method is time consuming and therefore costly. This report presents a method that detects, locates and quantifies the error(s) in a force balanced mechanism, after just one test run. An adjustable 1-DoF rotating mechanism is developed and a sensitivity analysis is performed to obtain the shaking force response of each parameter error. Comparing the shaking force response with the theoretical values shows the effectiveness of the adjustable 1-DoF rotating mechanism. Then the inversed relations of these shaking force responses are plotted in a design chart which can trace back the parameters that need adjusting. The method demonstrates that a 1-DoF mechanism can be balanced after just one test run.","force balance; tuning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Visch, V.T. (mentor)","2013","This master thesis proposes a vehicle design based on insights of transportation needs of young adults, gained through research. Interest is directed towards young adults aged 20-30 living in European cities, who show active and mobile lifestyles, but whom interest for the car is fading. To understand how these people will construct their lives and how vehicular mobility can play in a meaningful role herein, a future vision is defined. The methodology used to create the vision is called Vision in Product. It asks the designer to collect factors, based on literature research, of whom he thinks will shape a preferable future. The research led to the selection of a mindset, describing how young adults will manifest themselves, traveling in the urban environment. The Renault brand identity aspect, joie de vivre, was taken into account to decide on the mindset. The mindset involves travel for recreative purposes, including exploration and enjoyment, as well as a need for social support, driven by the future outlook of cities. The urban environment is intensifying. The future context is finalized with a mission statement: I and Renault want people to explore and enjoy everyday life by spontaneously choosing together from all they encounter in the city. The vehicle design is the means to accomplish the mission. The vehicle is designed on three levels: usage possibilities, technology and aesthetics. The highlight of the vehicle is equality of user experience, embodied by a vis-à-vis seating lay-out and a central control display. The user experience is facilitated by means of a self-driving architecture and expressed through the leitmotiv: a symmetric greenhouse. Vehicles operate within a service system, this provides opportunistic use and connection to events and peers.","design; vehicle; young adults; urban mobility; future vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Flying has become a commodity but the same kind of base products is still used, and innovation mainly occurs in technical fields such as lightweight materials and cost-effective production methods. As this technical product-mindset still defines the world of aerospace engineering today, there are opportunities in a more user-centered approach left untapped. Till now, services and user experience have been left to the airlines to decide, but for truly innovative product-service system development, there is a need for a new way of stakeholder conversation. Zodiac Aerospace with its vast global network is in an ideal position to take the lead in such conversations, when an internal paradigm-shift can be achieved towards Product-Service System thinking. Assignment formulation by Driessen (Zodiac CE): ""We meet the demands of our focal points within Airlines but in OEM program’s (Original Equipment Manufacturers like Airbus, Boeing,..) we cannot only rely on years of experience and must become pro-active otherwise we lose control over our own developments. It is the task of the Development Department to become pro-active to foresee and prepare ourselves towards these demands. Knowledge management, Lean developments, recruiting communicative developers and Open Innovation are ingredients to become more open and pro-active. Driessen is a product company with a long customer-centric development and manufacturing tradition, enabling airlines to service their passengers. Yet, the border towards developing product-service combinations has never really been crossed. As such, the main challenge is to shift the paradigm from developing products to enabling services. Therefore a Crew Experience Lab is needed where more can be learned about the enabled services, and to optimize user/product-interaction. In such a lab, the products become “objects of conversation”, which is a key learning tool for Research and Development. The scope of this graduation project is to design a Crew Experience Lab, and develop a stakeholder workshop methodology to be able to translate stakeholder sessions into insights for R&D.""","aviation; knowledge management; product-service systems; user-centred design; context research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-05-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Social and technological developments, stemming mainly from (i) the increasing world-wide concern about the sustainability of resources, water scarcity and the effects of climate change, (ii) concepts related to integrated urban water management with a target towards sewage load reduction and rain water retention, and (iii) innovation in housing appliances and waste-water treatment technology, suggest that the current regime of drinking water demand of retail customers could change. A decrease of water demand concerns the water utility, that is operating a system in under-capacity and is currently working on a Long-Term Vision for their water supply system. The future seems highly uncertain and it is essential to understand (i) how and by whom water saving could be induced in an area of abundant water resources like the Metropolitan Area of Amsterdam and (ii) what kind of effects a further decrease of water demand could bring about. Standard Policy Analysis techniques are applied to address this issue and the approach is largely qualitative. Desk study and interviews are conducted to collect information and data that are systemized and further processed through uncertainty and systems analysis to supply an answer to the above. The anticipated changes that could lead to water saving –drivers of water saving– are clustered in categories for supplying clarity and are, then, classified according to their potential effect and uncertainty. Stakeholders and their actions that could induce water saving are also identified. The system is decomposed into embedded subsystems in order to identify potential effects on each one, and mitigating alternatives are discussed after examining the available practices for maintaining a high performing water supply system. The analysis supplies insights on the type of information that Waternet needs to seek in order to perform educated explorations about the future, as well as on how this could be achieved. The outcome of the research can be utilized towards this end and towards developing further the Long-Term Vision of the water supply system. However, further research is necessary in order to make elaborate quantitative estimations in this direction.","uncertainty; water supply; water demand forecasting; policy analysis; sustainability; system decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Engineering and Policy Analysis/Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Beella, S.K. (mentor)","2013","MyWheels, a Dutch non-profit organization, provides a hybrid of traditional business-to-consumer (B2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) car sharing. In the P2P model, private car owners can share their cars with other drivers in the neighbourhood, it has been part of MyWheels service since late 2011. The focus of this project is to contribute to the interaction design of the P2P model, which has to lead to an implementation into the current online platform of MyWheels. The overall aim is to simplify the usability and improve the user experience. The project consists of a discovery phase, followed by redefining the design goal and consequently a development phase in which three iterations have been made to deliver a working online prototype. Several steps were taken in the discovery phase to ensure the relevance of the design. An initial understanding of the sharing economy, of which P2P car sharing forms a part, highlights principles for successful businesses. Building a community and building trust are the most influential principles for this project. A comparison between P2P and B2C car sharing found that the main difference is the introduction of a third party, the private car owner. As a result car sharing has become more social, but also less convenient because private cars are not build for sharing and more communication between users is required. A review of MyWheels current implementation of the service platform shows that it has not made a complete transition to offer convenient P2P car sharing. Similar services from around the world provide examples of improvements. Final insights were found during interviews with pairs of Mywheels drivers and owners that confirm the need of the previous findings and emphasized the high level of personal interaction users have together. The results are mapped on a customer journey map which identifies the weakest links in the car sharing process of MyWheels. The improvement offered in this project aims at increasing MyWheels involvement to let users trust and get to know each other earlier in the process. Also a vision is created for the interaction that is inspired by traditional borrowing: car sharing should become more about sharing experiences and awarding appreciation. The first step of development was setting three goals: Give users an online personality, facilitate online communication between users, and finally capture and communicate experiences. The development has gone through the phases of foundation, form and functionality. In the foundation all features, flow and interaction were designed, in the next phase wireframe sketches were made and tested with the user group and in the final phase actual functionality is created in the backend and frontend of the website. In a final user test most functionality was working in a test environment. The end result is evaluated with a high usability that helps people to get to know and trust each other by the introduction of a rating and review system and motivates people to keep participating actively in the service by the introduction of a gratitude system.","car sharing; service design; online prototype","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-05-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Communication & Conceptualization","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

In the current gener- ation of nano satellites an Attitude Determination and Control Subsytem (ADCS) plays an important roll and sometimes even critical roll. An ADCS is necessary in order to achieve certain mission objectives and to prevent the satellite from tumbling to fast. A failure of this subsystem can have serious consequences and can even lead to a failing mission. Because of the importance, this subsystem must be reliable and robust in order to reduce the risk of a failing system. To achieve reliability and robustness, a software framework must be designed and implemented that minimizes the risk of software failures. Apart from software failures the risk of hardware failures should also be reduced as much as possible. Therefore all hardware should be thoroughly tested, before it can be marked as a flight candidate. Besides reliability and robustness the software framework should also be user friendly. Because the Delfi-n3Xt’s ADCS incorporates two different micro controllers the software framework should be easy to adapt for different micro controllers. For future purposes the software framework should have a modular structure in order to make re-usability and extendibility possible. In this thesis the design and implementation of such a software framework is described. Fur- thermore, the process and results of testing the hardware thoroughly are presented.","Delfi-n3Xt; Attitude Determination and Control; magnetometer; reactionwheel; sun sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor); Willemen, K. (mentor); Bertens, C. (mentor)","2013","The Efteling has been welcoming and entertaining its visitors since the opening of the Sprookjesbos in 1952. The Efteling is accessible for every guest. It offers special facilities for wheelchair-dependent people, but people with hearing loss are not supported by any facilities. The company is advised to tackle this problem early on, because the number of people affected by hearing loss continues to rise due to excessive noise levels and the demographic aging of our society. The Efteling will have to deal with more people that have difficulties with hearing and understanding auditory information of an attraction. If a solution for this problem is found for people with hearing problems, this can also benefit foreign visitors, thus making the Efteling accessible for many more guests. Then the Efteling will increase its revenues and enhance its brand value that stands for ‘Efteling is for everyone’. This project focuses on the design of a facility that enhances the Efteling experience for Deaf and hard of hearing people. People suffering from hearing loss can roughly be divided into two groups: those belonging to the hearing world and those belonging to the Deaf world. People with severe or profound hearing loss and postlingual deafness live in the hearing world. Prelingual deaf people live in the Deaf world with its own culture and values. Various types of hearing loss exist between these worlds and their characteristics are difficult to identify. The variation in types results in a custom-made hearing aid for each individual. Due to the wide range of existing hearing aids it is not interesting to design a new hearing aid. The focus will be on designing a universal product for creating a specific Efteling experience to reach the majority of Deaf and hard of hearing people. The total experience of an attraction is determined by three factors: visuals, spoken text, and music/soundscape. People with different types of hearing loss experience these factors differently. In the current situation, hearing people understand spoken texts, hear the music and soundscapes, and have a broad view of the visuals. Hard of hearing people see more details, but hear blurred spoken texts because the severity of their hearing loss affects the degree of audibility. In the absence of music or soundscapes, spoken texts are more clearly understandable. The presence of music reduces the audibility of spoken texts. Deaf people see the visuals in most detail because of their keen peripheral vision. Even though they cannot hear texts, soundscapes or music, they are able to hear and feel the bass of the music. In family situations, hearing relatives explain parts of the spoken story and soundscape to hard of hearing and Deaf people. As a result, the hearing relative will miss out on part of the experience of the attraction. The ideal situation would be the offering of a product that explains the situation regarding stories and soundscapes so that hearing people will not have to do that. The product is Twinkel, a smartphone application (abbr. app) designed as a continuation of the attraction in order to enhance the Efteling experience for Deaf and hard of hearing people. The app fits well in the Efteling vision and the technological trend among young people (and the elderly). Twinkel gives them the feeling that they are equal to hearing people, because the use of smartphones is so common that they will not be recognized as being Deaf or hard of hearing. The main function of Twinkel is to make fixed auditory information understandable through written text. Now they are able to ‘read’ sound in order to see the overall picture of an attraction. The improvement of the comprehensibility will strengthen the experience of the attractions as well. The advantage of written text is that it can be translated into multiple languages so that foreign guests can read the essence of all stories in their own native language. The underlying thought of the application is to enable people with hearing loss to be the main character of the attraction. They have to feel a bond with the story and use the smartphone as the attribute of the main figure. The unusual but logical interaction with the smartphone (attribute) leads to the creation of magic and appearance of texts. This arouses the curiosity of Deaf and hard of hearing people. Also hearing people benefit from the additional experience Twinkel gives them, thanks to the playful interactions. In the presence of Twinkel, people with hearing loss can enjoy the Efteling independently. As a result, it unburdens their hearing family members. A striking effect is that its users take over the ‘leading role’ from hearing people. In this new situation, people with hearing ability ask the leader what secrets Twinkel reveals. Twinkel, for a boundlessly enchanting family experience.","interaction design; deaf; hard of hearing; smartphone; app; enchanting; sound; spoken text","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-05-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The beaches along this shoreline are formed due to the implementation of anthropogenic structures all along this stretch of coast through so-called headland control. These structures were meant to stabilise the newly reclaimed land, which was placed on top of a thick layer of marine clay. In time, however, several phenomena have occurred along this new stretch of coast, indicating coastline retreat due to erosion and in some cases flooding of the coastal area. Researchers of the EcoShape Consortium have therefore decided to investigate the possibility of applying the so-called Building with Nature principles in solutions to coastline retreat along East Coast Park, resulting in the East Coast Park design pilot. A key aspect in this investigation is the understanding of the underlying coastal processes, which has resulted in the study of this thesis. In this thesis an analysis is made of knowledge to date and a conceptual model is developed to analyse coastal processes on both a small and a large scale. Driving forces underlying these processes are waves, the tide, monsoons and relative sea level rise. On the large scale the influence of waves, the tide and relative sea level rise on the coastal morphology is assessed (semi-)quantitatively using numerical modelling tools Delft3D, Unibest-TC and Unibest-LT, and also using nautical charts and satellite imagery. On this scale the presence of anthropogenic structures is neglected. On the small scale the presence of structures is included. Due to insufficiently readily available data the assessment is made more quantitatively, using satellite imagery and photographs.","Singapore; East Coast Park; coastal erosion; structurally controlled coast; headland control; temporal and spatial morphological scales; sediment transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-05-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor)","2013","Microscopic traffic simulation models are a widely used tools for transport system analysis and management. These tools are used to model the complexity of the systems and to evaluate various traffic management alternatives in order to determine the optimal solution for any traffic scenario. A classical way to represent vehicle interactions at merges at the microscopic scale is to combine a gap-acceptance model with a car-following algorithm. With the gap acceptance the choice for a certain gap is modelled. Recently there are some doubts about the accuracy of the gap acceptance model for simulating a merge movement. Because of the shortcomings of gap acceptance models used in micro simulation tools, recently a new concept framework for modelling merging behaviour was proposed. This concept is based on gap selection. It means that every driver is able to find a suitable gap out of a set of offered gaps without being overtaken by drivers on the shoulder lane and without coming to a standstill at the end of the acceleration lane. The choice decision of a gap out of a set of offered gaps is the main focus for this research. It provides a model for the choice decision of a merging car what can be implemented in a merging model and a simulation tool. The focus of this research is on modelling merging behaviour with such a gap choice model. The main research question of this thesis is: How can merging behaviour on a freeway on-ramp be modelled so that it corresponds to actual observed merging behaviour? With the literature review the state-of-the-art about merging behaviour is studied. The actual merging behaviour is researched with simulator studies and empirical data analyses. For modelling merging behaviour, theoretical frameworks and micro simulation tools are studied. From the studies about actual merging behaviour it is clear that drivers make a choice between gaps that are offered to them and this choice depends on several factors, e.g. vehicle type of putative follower and putative leader, gap size, traffic conditions and geometric design. With these factors, the drivers will choose a gap out of a set of offered gaps at the moment they enter the acceleration lane. Most of the existing theoretical models are based on the principles that there is no decision of which gap is most preferred out of a set of offered gaps. All studied microscopic simulation tools use a gap acceptance model to simulate merging behaviour. With an empirical data analysis at a freeway on-ramp the merging behaviour and gap choice behaviour is analysed. The first factor analysed with the empirical dataset is the average speed per lane. There is not much difference between the average speed of the acceleration lane and the shoulder lane. This can be caused by cooperativeness between the lanes, but also because of the high flow. The second factor is the speed during the merge on the shoulder lane. It is founded that the merging speed of HGV’s and passenger cars are the same. The next factor analysed is the driving behaviour on the acceleration lane. Most drivers have a relative constant speed. This means that the speed of entering the acceleration lane is almost the same along the acceleration lane. Only HGV’s are accelerating in the first 25 meters of the acceleration lane. The last factor analysed for merging behaviour are the gaps. From this analysis it is clear that there is a relation between the merging location of a passenger car and the presence of an HGV on the shoulder lane. Besides the merging behaviour, also an empirical analysis of the gap choice behaviour is performed. From this analysis it is clear that different gap choice behaviour occurs in different traffic states and different vehicle types. Therefore different choice models are estimated. The findings of the state-of-the-art and empirical data analysis about merging behaviour are compared with the results of the simulation tool FOSIM. In FOSIM vehicles are merging much earlier. The number of lane changes in the simulation results is comparable with the empirical dataset. The average speed per lane, is comparable during free flow. During congestion the average speed per lane differs a lot between FOSIM and the empirical data. There seems to be no interaction between the lanes in the simulation results of FOSIM. So the gap acceptance model of FOSIM is not simulating accurately. Especially the merge location has a large difference with an empirical dataset. Therefore the focus is put on estimating a model on the gap choice behaviour. This choice will influence the location for merging. From the gap choice behaviour it is clear that different behaviour occurs between traffic states and vehicle types. Therefore three choice models are estimated, namely a choice model for HGV’s, passenger cars in free flow and passenger cars in congestion. Two parameters are present in all three final discrete choice models, namely ‘gap size’ in seconds and ‘distance towards a gap’. For the HGV model these are the only two parameters. The model for passenger cars during congestion has three parameter. This model also includes the parameter ‘vehicle type of the putative leader’. The last model, passenger car in free flow consist of four parameters. Besides the parameters ‘gap size’ and ‘distance towards a gap’, this model also includes the parameters ‘vehicle type of the putative follower’ and ‘vehicle type of the putative leader’. With these three models a face validation is performed. The face validation of the three discrete choice models is performed on two aspects, namely an aggregate validity test and validity test per individual. The aggregate face validity of the three choice models is good. Only for the model of passenger cars during congestion there are some small differences in comparison with the empirical dataset. The validity test per individual was not as good as the aggregate validity. For all three discrete choice models there are large differences compared with the empirical dataset. This means the discrete choice models in general models the right gap choice distribution, but per driver, the predicted gap and the actually observed gap are not the same. From the research done in this master thesis it is concluded that gap acceptance models do not simulate the merging behaviour accurately. In these kinds of models only one gap at the time and only the gap size is evaluated, i.e. if this gap is large enough, the merge movement is simulated. But most of the time a driver is not merging into his nearest gap. From the research it can be concluded that some drivers are choosing a gap further ahead and sometimes even two gaps further ahead. This is mostly the case during congestion, but it also occurs during free flow. The three discrete choice models are evaluating several gaps at once and take more characteristics into account for choosing a gap. Therefore it can be concluded that the three discrete choice models presented in this master thesis research are accurate models to model actual observed merging behaviour on a freeway on-ramp.","merging behaviour; modelling gap choice; choice model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Kok, M. (mentor); Nicolai, R.P. (mentor); Van Dijk, M.P. (mentor); Verhaeghe, R.J. (mentor)","2013","In the Netherlands one of the most important methods to determine the level of flood protection is a cost-benefit analysis. In this analysis the costs (investment and maintenance costs of dikes) are balanced with the benefits (a reduction of flood risk). Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequence. This approach requires a good estimate of the consequences of floods. A large contributor to the total costs of a flood are the losses due to business interruption. This is defined as forgone value added that is not created due to the fact that firms have to stop production. The causes of the production stop considered in this thesis are material damage to the production facilities of the considered firms and both forward and backward effects in the supply chain. The latter effects include the interruption of firms which are not flooded themselves, unlike their suppliers or buyers. In the Netherlands the software package HIS-SSM (Hoogwater Informatie Systeem – Schade en Slachtoffer Module) is used to determine the consequences of possible floods. This model uses a damage function approach to determine the losses due to business interruption, in which the duration of the business interruption depends on the water depth only. As a result of this assumption, the losses due to business interruption expressed as a share of the material damage range between 1.5 and 5%, independent of the scale of the flood according to HIS-SSM. An analysis of actual floods shows that these figures are between 30% and 125% for large-scale floods. The considered floods for these figures are hurricane Katrina in 2005, hurricane Sandy in 2012, the tsunami in Japan in 2011 and the river floods in Thailand in 2011. Therefore, the losses due to business interruption as calculated by HIS-SSM are expected to be an underestimation of the actual losses due to business interruption. For this reason the ARIO (Adaptive Regional Input-Output) model has been used to determine the losses due to business interruption as well. The ARIO model has only been used for academic purposes so far. Both models have been applied to three cases in the Netherlands, which comprise the flooding of the province of South-Holland, Groningen and the small town of Arcen. The results of the case studies show that the estimates of the losses due to business interruption as calculated by the ARIO model are more in line with figures from actual floods. Both HIS-SSM and the ARIO model have some drawbacks however. The ARIO model appears to be able to determine the losses due to business interruption more accurately than HIS-SSM. Many important processes in the aftermath of a flood are not considered in both models however, such as flood duration and substitution effects. In both models the consequences of flooding of unique firms or infrastructure are underestimated. This is a result of the sector approach in both models, in which all firms are assigned to a certain sector. The transformation of material damage to production capacity has a large influence on the results of the ARIO model. The costs of permanent relocation of firms to foreign countries is also not taken into account in these models, while a simple calculation shows that these might contribute significantly to the total costs of a flood. Some assumptions in this calculation are based on interviews conducted with a member of the Dutch parliament and a professor at Delft University of Technology. Measures to reduce the losses due to business interruption should also be considered in the Dutch flood protection policy, after a cost-benefit analysis has been performed for these measures.","flood consequences; business interruption; HIS-SSM; ARIO model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Heur, R.J.H.G. (mentor); Coenen, L. (mentor)","2013","Chard Safety BV (CS) is a company in automotive crash safety systems. The patented Deceleration Responsive vehicle-Seat (DRS) Albatross is their main concept. The seat is able to drastically reduce forces on the occupant during a crash and claims to eliminate whiplash. It could also be made lighter compared to current car seats, because of its construction. Various stakeholders in the automotive industry identified the DRS Albatross as a breakthrough principle with potential to greatly improve crash safety in general. However, no single party has been willing to invest sufficient time or money to help the company introduce the seat in the market. In the following report an instrumented introduction strategy for the DRS Albatross is proposed. It starts by analysing the company and the product. This analysis recognizes the versatility of the seat, and how this could also be confusing for potential buyers or investors. Two aspects who are expected to be the main sales points are selected; occupant safety and the exciting driving experience the seat could provide. At this point in report the partners of the company are asked how they would want to see the company and the product in 5 years, which provides the desired company situation. Taking this occupant safety and driving experience as main sales points, the environment is explored. The segment is selected where (1) occupant safety and driving experience are most desired by its users, in which (2) meeting the industry standard is most feasible, and where (3) starting business with the seat is most viable. Analysis has pointed out this segment to be premium compact cars. A strategic direction has been determined based on the resources and competencies of the company and a business model is constructed. The business model on the one hand proposes to convince seat manufacturers to license and produce the seat by offering extensive production support and cost-effective testing of their seats. On the other hand it creates need in the market by offering car sharing fleets an adjustment system enhancing the driving experience of their customers which is supported by the DRS Albatross. To support the company in obtaining this position in the market an action plan is elaborated with milestones maximizing the potential of a successful process. An important asset of the introduction strategy is building a strong brand which is associated with the values of the company. Therefore a brand-name, logo and description are suggested.","automotive industry; car seat; innovation; introduction strategy; business model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Flexible work hours and activity related workplaces make it dif- ficult to find each other in the fast paced office environment. Organizations are battling the de- crease in face-to-face contact by encouraging their workers to use remote communication tools such as Short Text Messages, emails, Wikis and Confer- ence Calls. However, problems arise when remote contact takes away spontaneity or creates disruptions and distractions. Flexible offices should enable their workers to employ contact strategies that are less reliant on preceding remote contact. Blinq Systems has a technology that allows for the accurate indoor local- ization of laptops and other wireless devices. They aspire to employ this technology in a new product that helps to bring about effec- tive face-to-face communication in flexible offices: Blinq. When long-term investments in a modern and ef- ficient working environment are made, the right tools that make the transition to activity related workplaces and flexible desks easier should not be ignored. Blinq is the result of a user-centered design process. There are several reasons Blinq can benefit the efficient flexible office. First- ly, Blinq encourages effective utilization of activity related workplaces. Secondly, Blinq makes face-to- face contact between colleagues easier.

(mentor); Bergema, C.P.A.M. (mentor); Santos, A.L.R. (mentor)","2013","The humanitarian aid transition between short-­term relief and long-term development is often poorly managed, since Non-­Governmental Organizations (NGOs) do not understand the nature of challenges that occur within this transitional period. Rethink Relief, an initiative of scholars at both Delft University of Technology and Massachusetts Institute for Technology, is a platform that aims to reach common understanding of these transitional challenges amongst humanitarian professionals by organizing annual seven-­day collaborative design workshops. The objective of this graduation project was to develop a collaboration tool for humanitarian professionals, which supports them in a collaboration process. Preliminary research showed that since there is no institutional location for the humanitarian aid transition, no NGO feels responsible or understands humanitarian aid transition challenges fully. Collaboration between NGOs is mostly hindered by mandate obligations and funding issues. For a successful collaboration process, many factors need to be addressed that maximize the performance of the collaborating team members. These factors include a shared understanding of the content and goals of a collaboration project. Furthermore collaborating organizations must be actively guided towards shared understanding, to be able to achieve satisfying results. Through an iterative design process a concept collaboration tool, in the form of a set of tools for a half-day workshop, was created. Under the supervision of a workshop facilitator, humanitarian professionals work together on a predefined topic within the humanitarian aid transition. The goal of the workshop was to create solutions for a collaboratively identified issue. The workshop process and tool were designed to achieve shared understanding on a selected issue identified by workshop participants, whilst developing suitable solutions. Reaching shared understanding was considered to be the foundation of a potential collaborative partnership between the participating NGOs. Concluding from two separate user tests of the concept collaboration tool, participants felt they had reached shared understanding on the issues they had been working on. However, the general tendency amongst participants towards starting a collaborative partnership was reticent. It was found that the created solutions were not detailed enough to build a collaborative partnership on. Improvements to the concept collaboration tool have been made to help participants make the end results of workshop more specific to their identified issue. The created collaboration tool gives Rethink Relief the means to build shared understanding on the humanitarian aid transition amongst humanitarian professionals at a quicker pace. Smaller half-­day events can be organized next to the annual seven-­day event. This way, the threshold to get involved will become lower for humanitarian professionals, resulting in an increase of professionals with the same understanding of humanitarian aid transition challenges.","humanitarian aid; networked innovation; collaboration; facilitation; shared understanding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

All the beer, packed at the packaging department is subject to strict food regulations and HEINEKEN has additional requirements to meet the customers‟ expectations. Therefore, Quality Control, which makes sure that only conforming products are delivered, is an important aspect of the packaging process. Quality Control is performed by taking samples with fixed time intervals according to a sample plan. If a sample is nonconforming, all products since the last conforming sample are referred to as a blockade, inhibited from shipment and analyzed to evaluate if products can be released or must be reworked, inspected or destroyed. HEINEKEN focuses on continuous improvement to prevent blockades from occurring. In the coming years HEINEKEN will decrease its workforce, reduce warehouse capacity and shorten its delivery planning, amplifying a blockade‟s impact. This research will address minimizing the impact of blockades once they occur by focusing on blockade analysis.

When the fine particles are entrained in the armour layer, it is described as ‘winnowing’ or vertical entrainment. A river bed generally consists of a coarse surface layer, which is the exterior or upper boundary of the river bed from where particles can be picked up instantaneously by the flow. Below this a sub-surface layer is situated, which consisting of more fine sediments. The surface or armour layer, consists of particles that can be picked up instantaneously by the flow (depending on their size and the flow conditions). Entrainment of sub-surface sediment by the flow is hindered by the surface layer above it. If the entrained fines are picked up by the main flow, it may result in bed level subsidence which could lead to instability of constructions in the river bed. Winnowing can occur when the pores of the coarse surface layer are large enough and the hydraulic load is strong enough for the fines to be picked up and leave the surface layer. A better understanding of the winnowing process helps to determine if it is necessary to take this process into account in the morphodynamics. The objective of this research is to examine under which conditions sub-surface entrainment (winnowing) of particles occurs and to estimate which parameters are governing the winnowing process. The investigation is executed with laboratory experiments. Laboratory tests has been performed with specific material types, namely M32 sand (D50 = 370 ìm) and Carara gravel (D90 = 23 mm). Model tests performed by Detert et al (2010), show that the lift intensity decreases exponentially vertically through the porous bed. According to Diplas and Parker (1992), the surface layer thickness can be estimated as 2-3 times of the surface material size D90. Applying this assumption, two values of the surface layer thickness are investigated, a surface layer thickness of 6.4 cm (2.8 D90) and of 4.6 cm (2.0 D90). The study of Cui (2007) shows that an increase of entrained fines can be achieved by generating a higher surface layer mobility. For this experiment, the layer thickness and surface layer mobility are varied to investigate their influence on the winnowing process.","winnowing; entrainment; erosion; bed stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

The goal was to get a better understanding of where these worlds of product presentation meet; and use this knowledge to enrich the shopper experience. An exploration of both worlds showed that this separation does not have to lead to a difference in experience. In fact, in many cases an interaction between the two can enrich the experience of one or both worlds. It is in this interaction where the two worlds meet: the shopper. This can be a direct interaction or an interaction mediated through technology. For interaction to be successful, to have an actual benefit, the brand needs to stay true to itself. This principle is defined as the ‘field of values’. In this project Plus was used as a showcase to demonstrate this principle. Plus wants to be the authentic neighbourhood grocery store, focusing on fresh product and service. This can be translated to their values: transparent, fresh and service. From a denominator in these values a starting point can be created for a valuable interaction: knowledge. In the specific case of Plus’ fresh products this interaction is most valuable in enriching the offline experience of these fresh products. After an exploration in the areas of the medium, the content, the interaction and the design an app called ‘Plus Vers’ is developed.

(mentor); Van Lint, J.W.C. (mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Ter Horst, T. (mentor)","2013","Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, (“AAS”), owned by the Schiphol Group (“SG”), plays a key part in the hugely competitive airline industry. One of the primary goals of the Schiphol Group is to provide high service at a low cost. In recent years, Schiphol and the Dutch Government are cutting the relevant budgets with a view to make substantial savings in specific areas, for example, the Security and Border Control Departments. In achieving this goal there is a fine balance to be met. High quality Security and Border Control, (under the control of The Royal Dutch Marechaussee (“KMar”), is crucial for the successful operation of AAS. With this in mind Schiphol Group and the Government should be cautious in making savings as a decrease in service level would be detrimental to the successful operation of AAS. A sound example of ‘high service/low-cost’ improvements could be achieved through more efficient scheduling of staff, namely utilising less staff but still providing a sufficient service level for local departing passengers. Staff scheduling is dependent on the travel behaviour of passengers, more specifically when passengers arrive at Schiphol from landside. The travel behaviour among those millions of local departing passengers is quite diverse. Many passengers arrive hours before departure time when check-in desks are not open for servicing, while other passengers arrive at the last-minute when the check-in desks are closing. Consequently, coping with this ebbing and flowing process by scheduling staff is extremely difficult. Fortunately, AAS runs a model which provides valuable prognoses to achieve an accurate picture of the number of passengers that arrive per time interval, these prognoses are used by the different stakeholders. The Passenger Services Department (“PS”) at Schiphol estimates the number of passengers entering different processes, for example the number passengers arriving at Passport Control. This prognoses, (up to four months), is available for stakeholders to analyse. The ‘operational model’ and the data it has provided has proven its worth but Schiphol could make improvements with regard to the model and its prognoses. The greatest problem is that simple observations measure different passenger numbers than originally forecasted by the model, so prognoses are inaccurate. Security and the KMar make use of the prognoses to calculate and schedule staff, so that a sufficient amount of manpower to service passengers is available. With this in mind overestimations of the forecast model results in high service and a higher cost base than necessary. Conversely, underestimations result in queues, lower cost and a decreasing level of service. Currently Security and Passport Control is decentralized and staff of Security and Passport Control can be moved to another Security or Passport Control area to deal with rising queues in a particular area. Prognoses are important but will be more crucial when the OneXS Project is finished. This new megaproject is about centralizing all Security and Passport Control filters. One location where all passengers are screened, together with their baggage, and have to show their passport at the same location, would certainly be more efficient but on the other hand scheduling would become far more important because exchanging staff between filters would not be possible. Accurate prognoses are needed here more than ever. When Schiphol identifies the causes of inaccuracies of the prognoses and solves these problems, sooner or later more accurate prognoses become available. Altogether by improving the accuracy of the forecast model, Schiphol, Security and the Royal Dutch Marechaussee can provide a higher service at a lower cost. This research seeks to address the following main question: How accurate are the current local departing passenger prognoses, what are the main causes for inaccurate passenger prognoses and which improvements on arrival distributions and accuracy measurement for the passenger forecast model can be made? Methodology This Master Thesis has been organised in the following way; It begins describing the forecast and passenger process, it will then go on to an analyses of the stakeholders involved and end with an assessment on the suitability of the current operational model. Then the methodology of measuring passengers and mathematical measurements to calculate accuracy will be discussed. The systems for measuring passengers, the data and the locations of the measurement have been validated. The most important part is presenting the current accuracy; it will then go onto the causes of inaccurate prognoses and look at adjustments that could be made to increase accuracy. Finally, this thesis contains a conclusion and recommendation. To run the model and create prognoses, two elements are essential: a flight schedule and an arrival distribution of local departing passengers. The flight schedule contains information on all flights, the crucial data being the date, departure time, carrier, destination and predicted number of passengers on that flight. An arrival distribution model simplifies the stochastic travel behaviour of local departing passengers. To put it differently, a distribution indicates how many minutes before departure time passengers are entering Departure Hall 3, for example, 20% of passengers arrive between one hour and 75 minutes before departure time. The flight schedule provides information about the departure time and number of passengers on a flight, therefore the model can calculate for example 25 passengers arriving between 19:15 and 19:30. Once the data numbers of all flights are combined, a prognoses per day is available. For instance this would show 200 passengers arriving between 12:15 and 12:30 and 240 passengers between 12:30 and 12:45. The actual counted number of passengers shall differ from the prognoses, for example the forecasted number of passengers may be incorrect. The inaccurate prognoses are an incentive for this research to take place. Until now a carrier has a single arrival distribution of all its passengers, describing the arrival process (travel behaviour) of all local departing passengers of that carrier. This is a simplification because every flight has different characteristics, like departure time, composition of people, and so on. Should Schiphol Group take into account more factors, like departure time, then the model would contain more distributions and for this reason would lead to a more accurate prognoses. Schiphol Group didn’t have any data on actual passenger numbers per time interval or information on the arrival time of local departing passengers in Departure Hall 3. From a research perspective two measurements were necessary, the first one is to measuring the passenger numbers over time arriving at Passport Control. This Master Thesis focusses on Departure Hall 3, the check-in hall of most inter-continental carriers. The best location to measure passenger numbers is the small corridor passengers have to pass before arriving at Passport Control. Different measurements were examined and compared and finally two different measurements were installed, an optical infrared sensor from Ximes and a video camera sensor from Scarabee. Both systems record a passenger walking to Passport Control when the passenger passes the sensor. The second measurement should be able to measure the arrival time of a passenger and identify the flight the passenger will board. This proved too difficult to measure, but fortunately it turned out that baggage data, (95% of the passengers bring baggage with them), is an excellent predictor. Given these points it was possible to study arrival distribution and had a further advantage of displaying that required data already lay in the hands of Schiphol. When the actual passenger numbers are known it is possible to measure accuracy. There are many mathematical accuracy measurements that all differ in quality and have their pro’s and con’s regarding the data set. The mathematical formulas were examined and tested on a set of criteria. In summary the Mean Absolute Error (“MAE”), the Mean Squared Error (“MSE”) and the Good/Wrong method scored excellent on some criteria and are used for accuracy analyses in this study. Measuring accuracy is impossible without the actual passenger numbers. Passenger numbers can be measured in different ways but two techniques were the best suited for the desired objective: optical infrared sensors by Ximes and video sensors by Scarabee. Both measurements ran for three weeks in January and during this period both measurements and the location were validated. The optical infrared sensors by Ximes were, contrary to expectations, inaccurate, (deviation of ±18%), and a worse predictor of the actual number of passenger, (R2=0.66). The video sensor by Scarabee was more accurate, (deviation of ±7%), the deviation was stable and the data was a very good predictor, (R2=0.96). The updated video sensor is extremely accurate with only a small deviation, (±2.5%), and the data from this measure an excellent predictor of the actual number of passengers, (R2=0.985). Most of the people passing the sensors were intended to be measured, only a small proportion of the measured people were not heading to Passport Control. Results The most important stakeholders in this case are, Security, KMar, Floor Management, carriers and passengers. These stakeholders view the goal of Schiphol to provide high passenger service for low cost and improve the prognoses, very favourably. The current operational model and its prognoses turned out not to be as suitable as it could be, other kind of models could be more useful for other parties. This research evaluates and improves the current prognoses, the two measurements were crucial to identify causes of inaccuracies and to calculate accuracy and passenger numbers. 5,000 to 10,000 passengers arrive at Passport Control in Departure Hall 3 daily. That is a figure of almost 100 passengers per 15 minutes. The MAE is 30 passengers per 15 minutes on average. It is important to realize that 30 extra passengers per 15 minutes can’t be handled by the scheduled amount of workforce of the KMar, so queues will occur sporadically. Not to mention if 30 passengers less are observed, then KMar wastes money, (indirectly the Government), by having too large a workforce. Further, the Mean Squared Error indicated that one-third of the prognoses have major outliers compared to the counted number of passenger, it is here money is wasted or passengers have to wait before being serviced , resulting in low passenger service. Less than 20% of the passenger numbers per 15 minutes are forecasted right. This study has found different causes of inaccurate prognoses:  Generally all arrival distributions are inaccurate, passengers arrive 45 minutes earlier, (on average), in Departure Hall 3 and subsequently arrive earlier than expected at Passport Control.  The accuracy of the prognoses is decreased dramatically by passengers walking to Passport Control in Departure Hall 2, while these passengers were expected to stay in Departure Hall 3 and walk to the Passport Control in this hall. As a result the staff of KMar are outnumbered in Hall 3 and Passport Control in Hall 2 is under-staffed.  The accuracy of prognoses send 1 month before is the same as the prognoses send 4 months before, no improvement over time is seen. When the prognoses are sent to the different stakeholders and Passenger Service cannot therefore make modifications, the accuracy improves but it is not known when the improvement starts, probably in the last couple of days. The main reason is flights are cancelled and added last-minute, nearly 10%, (normally 2% ), of the January flights in the original schedule were cancelled and only a small part of these cancelled flights are compensated by added flights.  One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that the forecasted number of passengers on a plane deviates enormously from the actual number of passengers. To point out, the difference between actual and forecasted passenger numbers is large, (on average +-20%), and therefore is expected to have a major impact on the accuracy of the prognoses of one month advanced readings.  The actual passenger behaviour and thus the passenger numbers per time interval are very stochastic and for this reason there will always be a difference between the forecasted and the actual number of passengers. By using the actual flight schedule as input for the prognoses, many causes were eliminated and still the accuracy increased slightly. This study has taught something important: there is some room for improvement but the effect is still limited and therefore inaccurate prognoses are unavoidable. The PS Department of Schiphol can easily change the arrival distributions of local departing passengers, when the distributions are incorrect and they are so. New findings indicate passengers arrive earlier in the Departure Hall than originally predicted by the current distributions, an average difference of 45 minutes is significant. Another conclusion is a single distribution per carrier is insufficient because different factors are influencing the arrival time of local departing passengers, and consequently the arrival distributions as well. Only three factors can easily be adapted to the model: type of flight (continental/inter-continental), time of the day and carriers. Research found significant differences in the arrival distributions of carriers. The kind of flight is important as well, for example people tend to arrive earlier when going to an inter-continental destination. Departure time is also important. In the evening and morning people tend to arrive late, while in the afternoon people show up earlier. By taking into account these three factors, the MAE and the MSE of prognoses, (based on new distributions), is significantly lower. It can be concluded that the new distributions improve the accuracy. Financially, the savings are limited but easily achievable, so therefore it should be implemented. The savings and the importance of accurate prognoses will become higher when all Security and Passport Control areas are centralized, (OneXS Project). The inaccuracy is mostly caused by the stochastic passenger behaviour, when most causes of inaccuracies are eliminated (using the realized flight scheduling) and the new distributions are implemented, then the accuracy only slightly improves and no extra improvements can be expected. The main conclusion is, the accuracy of the prognoses is lacking and only a slight improvement in accuracy is possible. The new video sensor of Scarabee is very useful for Schiphol to measure passenger numbers continuously, as a result, it is possible to achieve the slight improvements and opens doors for other studies (e.g. capacity or video-based tracking). Recommendation This Master Thesis has thrown up many questions and suggests several courses of actions. In the first place the ‘Passenger Services’ Department should replace the old data on distributions by the new distributions, which is a simple procedure. In addition Schiphol Group should request carriers in Departure Hall 3 to direct passengers to Passport Control in the correct hall and not to other halls. Schiphol can improve the distributions by taking into account more factors, the data is not directly available to Schiphol, so it’s important to convince carriers to share data. In this case SG can assess the effect of these factors and the effect on the accuracy of the prognoses, when these factors are included in the model. Carriers demand high passenger service and low cost from SG but are not contributing to these demands as much as they could do. For this reason carriers must be open and transparent by sharing data of flights, passengers, and so on. Another approach to improve the accuracy is tailoring the distributions to the passenger numbers. Then distributions will be varied to fit the prognoses , i.e. the actual number of passengers. SG should install permanent measurements to attain data continuously and track accuracy. Studying the dataset obtained by these measurements could improve the accuracy and include more factors in the model than it has now. The Scarabee measurement is very useful and gives SG the opportunity to measure other characteristics of passenger flow, like density, walking speed, etc. At the same time further investigation and experimentation into the instalment of a measurement is recommended. Multiple sensors throughout Schiphol are necessary and but more in depth than the pilot of this Thesis. When real-time data is available and the measurement is very accurate (the data from the new video sensor by Scarabee for example), then it is recommended to adjust the prognoses based on real-time passenger numbers. The current operation model is not capable to account for real-time data. In addition, and more importantly, the stakeholders have functional and technical demands on information pertaining to the process of local departing passengers. Other models, better suited to the demands of the stakeholders, could consider coming-up with a new model. Improved prognoses will lead to a higher service and hopefully lower cost and it would be beneficial to inform the KMar and Security about the possible improvements. Both stakeholders base the amount of workforce on the prognoses, so improved prognoses will improve the quality of scheduling. Next it would be more beneficial if both parties would turn the new insights into real concrete actions, for example Security should be more flexible in staffing due to the stochastic arrival process of local departing passengers. The margin of error of the prognoses is decreased, so Security and KMar have more certainty in scheduling staff and can decrease their margin of error in scheduling staff, thus leading to a lower cost of service.","prognoses; passengers; forecasts; Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","TIL","",""

The exact effects of these improvements on the production process have not been quantified. Furthermore, the influences of the order properties on the production process not known. The goal of this project is to analyze the effect of the process upgrades and order properties on the production process. This project also aims to generate and test the effect of additional process improvements. Different order portfolios were created to represent the current order book of IHC Metalix and possible changes in the order book in the next few years. The influences of these order portfolios on the production process were determined using a sub-process capacity calculation and simulation model. The simulation model was also used to implement and test further improvements to the process. This study found that the process improvements installed in the past year should increase production capacity by approximately 25%. The plate cutting machines were found to be the process bottleneck for all of the order portfolios. Large ship types with simple structures (such as pipelaying vessels and construction projects) have a positive effect on the production capacity. Small vessels with complex structures (such as yachts, tugs, and inland cruise vessels) reduced the total production capacity. Coasters and dredgers were found to have little effect on the total production capacity. To improve the production process, it is recommended that two large part finishing tables are removed to make space for two additional flatrack positions. The printing algorithm of the vector plotters mounted to the cutting machines should also be improved as much as possible. If additional production capacity is required, a separate plate printer could also be installed. These improvements can increase the production capacity up to 18%.","simulation; production process; machined steel kit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production, and Operation","",""

(mentor)","2013","The PTC-140/200 DS is the newest generation super heavy lift crane designed by Mammoet. This modular crane can be build in several different configurations and has a capacity of 3200 tonnes maximum. The PTC-140/200 DS is designed to meet both European and American safety standards. Both standards prescribe multiple safety factors to account for the various loads on the crane. However, the loads that occur during exceptional/accidental events, are hard to predict and are thus usually not accounted for by standards. The goal of this report is to provide more insight in the impact of exceptional loadcase on the structural integrity and overall stability of the PTC-140/200 DS. The following exceptional loadcases are investigated; 1. Sudden release of load 2. Breakage of a mainboom luffing wire rope 3. Breakage of a jib luffing wire rope 4. Breakage of a hoisting wire rope 5. Activation of the slewing emergency stop Each loadcase is investigated by means of a finite element model (FEM) that also accounts for the dynamic effects. The FEM model has been verified by the results of a second analytical calculation. The first loadcase investigates the impact of the sudden release of load. The sudden `removal' of load causes an impulse load that gives the boom enough energy to rebound. It has been found that the worst-case configuration does not tip over, because the boomstops stop the boom at 88.88_ (initial angle: 85_). Moreover, the stresses found in the structure are all below yield stress. It is however recommended to further investigate the uplifting forces after load release since the reaction forces at the front of the crane become negative in the first seconds. In the second loadcase, the impact of the breakage of a mainboom luffing wire rope is investigated. Half a second after breakage, the back left bogies start to come of the rail, which results in an increase of the hoist radius. This is aggravated by the swinging of the load and together, this leads to exceedance of the moment equilibrium between counterweight and load. Within six seconds after breakage, all rear bogies are lifted from the rail and ultimately, the crane tips forward. The third loadcase describes the breakage of a jib luffing wire rope. The jib luffing wire ropes transfer forces from the jib through the struts to the under carrier. Due to breakage, the struts are eccentrically loaded. The torsion in the masthead reducer section is 1.5 times the design limit and the upper and lower strut exceed this with a factor of 2.7 and 4.3 respectively. So the breakage of a jib luffing wire results in the plastic deformation of the struts and the masthead reducer section. Whether this leads to a total collapse of the struts, has to follow from an analysis of a detailed model that includes plastic material behavior. The fourth loadcase, breakage of a hoist wire rope, shows similarities with the breakage of a jib luffing wire, because both result in an eccentric loading of the construction. In this loadcase, the eccentric load directly applies to the masthead which gives a higher torsion in the masthead reducer section (two times higher than allowed). The torsion in the struts are below design limits. In the last loadcase, a slewing emergency stop is simulated by applying the brake deceleration to the constraint model. The brake capacity of the crane is sufficient to stop the crane within the specified maximum stopping time. However, it was also found that the back of the crane will come much earlier to a standstill than the front, which could lead to high bending stresses in the components that connect the front- and back base frames. This investigation showed that a sudden release of load and an emergency stop have no consequences for the structural integrity and stability of the PTC-140/200 DS. Breakage of a wire rope however does compromise the structural integrity of the crane. The breakage of a mainboom luffing wire even results in the fall over of the whole crane. Since the breakage of wire ropes have significant impact on the crane, it is recommended to pay special attention to the inspection procedure of the wire ropes. Further more, it is recommended to consider alternative jib/mainboom luffing systems that limit the eccentric loading in case of breakage.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-05-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

More specifically there is an increasing demand of knowledge on how the slipstream influences the wings and empennage. Because these effects are hard to map with only theoretical methods, the use of wind tunnel is often required. An important issue that rises here is the one of scaling when comparing the full scale and wind tunnel data as it contributes a great part to the eventually made error. The goal in this project is to concentrate on scaling effects. Many studies were executed to determine the influence of scaling effects on important parameters like lift and drag. A good understanding of the uninstalled (performance, slipstream) and installed propeller (interference effects) is therefore mandatory. Many of these aspects are refreshed in this project. We start by choosing a representable propeller program for the investigation. This is done by validating the performance characteristics, taken from reference, into the program. In a next step, we determine the propeller characteristics by using test data from wind tunnel and full scale. Thereafter, a further research is done to see how the differences in performance between WT and FS are translated into the slipstream of the propeller. We will focus on the induced flow speed components of the propeller since they are relevant for the propeller-wing interaction. In a last stage, a propeller interaction program is used to see how the difference in induced components will influence the wing and more specific how the loading distribution over the wingspan is changed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
