The Delft workbench is a tool chain for reconfigurable computing, making it possible to design software without knowledge of the underlying hardware. One function of this tool chain is to convert source code to a hardware description. The DWARV toolset performs this function. While doing so, it uses Hierarchical Data Flow Graphs (HDGFs), which contain data dependencies in the original source code. HDGFs only exist in a binary format and there is no easy way to modify them. This thesis describes the design process of a program, the HDFG Editor. This process consists of a few steps. First, the functional and non-functional requirements were determined. To prevent improper interpretation of the requirements, a set of use cases was created and prioritized. Next, an analysis of available applications and libraries took place. A concept user interface was also designed to get an idea of the visual outline of the application at an early stage. With the decision of Irrlicht as a graphics engine the implementation could commence. Implementation of an application entails creating algorithms and analyzing code. With adaptability as a main focus point some trade-offs were made concerning run-time as scripts are sometimes preferred to code. Concluding, the running time for the project proved to be insufficient to finish the HDFG Editor. Part of the functionality has been implemented but not enough to put to the program to use. However, the work done provides a solid base should the project be picked up in the future.","hdfg editor","en","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

To perform these specific tasks different tools are used. Using these tools separately is a time consuming, inefficient and expensive process. MIDAS is a tool that integrates sequence alignment, genome annotation, and spectral clustering and alignment under the same application. The challenge in this project is in representing the knowledge and analyzing the genome data. The DNA data is first transformed into Fourier domain and clustered in MATLAB based on Euclidean distances between the sequences. Our tool allows visualizing the DNA spectra together with a hierarchical tree in a multimodal interface. This in turn enables a bioinformatician to analyze patterns of a group of sequences. MIDAS is a standalone application which provides an interface around standard sequence alignment tools such as BLAT, ClustalW, as well as newer alignment tools such as Spectrogram analysis via integrating MATLAB code, server connections and data visualizations. JAVA is used as the main programming language during the development of MIDAS. The Spectrogram Analysis script-files in MATLAB are converted into JAVA classes. These classes are used to run standalone MATLAB applications from within JAVA.","dna; alignment; multimodal; interface; sequences","en","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT)","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); Heijman, S.G.J. (mentor); Amy, G.L. (mentor); Savenije, H.H.G. (mentor)","2008","The topic of this thesis is a concept of zero liquid discharge for nanofiltration technology in drinking water treatment. Nanofiltration, defined as a process between Ultrafiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO), is a rapidly emerging technology. The origin of NF membranes can be traced back to the late 1950s when it was developed to treat sea water. Now it is applied in drinking water treatment, wastewater treatment and oil separation and also in the food industry. It is even called the future process of 21st century. However, nanofiltration is also a controversial process because of the concentrate problem, especially for inland installations. In the Netherlands, this problem is more considerable due to the need of high quality of drinking water and the decreasing quality of the surface water. Concentrate contains high concentrations of dissolved organic and inorganic compounds in high concentration. The conventional approach of concentrate discharge to surface water becomes a growing problem due to the environmental guidelines from the authorities. The discharge of the concentrate is not the only problem. It is also a cost problem that 20% of the feed water is wasted. In the Netherlands, taxes are paid for extracted groundwater. Also the pretreatment is costly. So with every m3 discharged concentrate money is wasted. Therefore, there is a need for a technology by which the discharge of concentrate is not necessary. That is so-called Zero Liquid Discharge Technology. The primary problem to be solved with zero liquid discharge is the recovery. We expect through an innovative technology the nanofiltration membrane installation can be operated at very high recovery (99%) without increasing the treatment cost of drinking water. The cost for residuals treatment and disposal can be minimized because the amount of the concentrate is decreased about 20 times. A series of pretreatment processes is used for removing the scaling components from the feed water. The scaling components mainly include bivalent ions, silica and etc. Preventing fouling and scaling can guarantee a constant flux, reduce membrane area, lower chemical cleaning frequency, extend the lifespan of membrane and decrease energy consumption. In this research, a pilot experiment was performed with sludge softening, sedimentation, weak acid cation exchange and nanofiltration at Kiwa Water Research. By using this treatment process, the recovery can be handled successfully at 99% for at least 11 days. The pretreatment concept can remove the bivalent ions completely. Sludge softening is used to remove most of the bivalent ions, like calcium, magnesium and barium. The remaining bivalent ions can be effectively removed by weak acid cation exchange. In this way, the waste stream from the ion exchange is reduced. In theory, silica can be removed by sludge softening at high pH as the co-precipitation of of Mg(OH)2 and CaCO3. But in this experiment the removal efficiency of silica is low probably due to the shortage of magnesium in the feed water. After this treatment process, the remaining concentrate (1%) 3 is evaporated, only remaining salt which can be sold or discharged to a waste facility. In order to improve and guarantee the good performance of silica removal by sludge softening, a jar test is performed to define the influencing factor for silica removal. pH and the magnesium concentration can influence the silica removal efficiency. Higher magnesium concentration is necessary for silica removal. Also, a ternary ion exchange model is needed to predict the breakthrough of cation concentration in order to guarantee the good quality of the feed water for nanofiltration. A ternary system is more complex than binary system. This short report can not include all the aspects of this model. This is the first step to build a ternary model. In the first phase, the basic equation has been already found. The basic model concept has been built up, but needs to be checked and improved. And some batch experiments have been done to obtain model parameters like equilibrium constants and kinetic constants. Also two groups of column experiments have been done in order to measure breakthrough curves for Ca2+, Na+ and H+(pH). The experimental result is expected to be compared with the model result in the future. The pretreatment concept consisting of sludge softening at high pH (around 10), weak acid cation exchange in series can remove calcium, magnesium and barium completely. The calcium removal by the ion exchange is quite good. After pH breakthrough is reached, calcium still can be removed by the resin because it is exchanged with the sodium on the resin. With high magnesium concentration, silica concentration also can be reduced by the sludge softening to some extent. This combination of the treatment processes is possible to make the recovery of NF membrane reach 99% without scaling at least for 11 days. To put this innovative concept into practice needs lots of efforts on validation and testing. Stable operation of pilot experiment at 99% for a longer time is needed to check the feasibility of this concept. It is interesting and significant work. With increasing demand of drinking water, more and more people in this world needs this kind of technology to improve their living condition and environment. We expect the occurrence of this new big step of drinking water treatment technology.","concentrate; membrane filtration; nanofiltration; zero liquid discharge; membrane fouling; membrane scaling; ternary ion exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

De weg telt 2 x 2 rijstroken, op drukke dagen rijden er ongeveer 25.000 motorvoertuigen over de weg. Ter hoogte van het Kasteel van Helmond ligt deze weg op een viaduct. De weg heeft een regionale stroomfunctie, een stedelijke ontsluitingsfunctie en is ook belangrijk voor de binnenstedelijke bereikbaarheid. In Hoofdstuk 1 wordt uitgebreid ingegaan op de plaats van de Kasteeltraverse binnen het Helmondse wegennet. In Hoofdstuk 2 komen de problemen met de Kasteeltraverse aan de orde. Zoals gezegd heeft de Traverse 3 functies, op al deze 3 vlakken functioneert de weg niet optimaal, voornamelijk omdat de functies moeilijk gecombineerd kunnen worden. De Kasteeltraverse geeft ook veel overlast, vooral op het gebied van geluidsoverlast en luchtvervuiling. Daarnaast wordt de Traverse als een barrière ervaren door langzaam verkeer. In dit Hoofdstuk worden de problemen kort besproken. Hoofdstuk 3 behandelt alle maatregelen die tot een verbetering van de situatie zouden kunnen leiden. Hierbij wordt een onderscheid gemaakt tussen verkeersmaatregelen en andere maatregelen. De verkeersmaatregelen worden vervolgens weer onderverdeeld in maatregelen aan de bestaande infrastructuur en maatregelen die gebruik maken van nieuwe infrastructuur. In Hoofdstuk 4 wordt het oplossende vermogen van de maatregelen onderzocht, waarna maatregelen gecombineerd worden tot pakketten van maatregelen, die een totaaloplossing voor de situatie zouden kunnen zijn. Van deze pakketten worden vervolgens de grootste voor- en nadelen bekeken, waarna er een keuze voor één bepaald pakket wordt gemaakt. De keuze valt op pakket Centrumstraat+, dat de meeste waardevermeerdering geeft, afgezet tegen de kosten die ervoor gemaakt moeten worden. In Hoofdstuk 5 wordt pakket Centrumstraat+ uitgewerkt. Behandeld worden de aanleg van de centrumstraat, de aanleg van het Cortenbachparalleltracé en de komst van een milieuzone. Tot slot worden in Hoofdstuk 6 conclusies getrokken over het gehele project en worden er enkele aanbevelingen gedaan.","wegverbinding; milieuzone; barriere; LARGAS","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Vibrators introduce seismic waves that propagate through the ground and are received by seismic sensors at some distance from the source. This enables interpretation of the sub-soil structure by inverse analysis. To analyze the behavior of the soil below a seismic vibrator, analytical models were developed in the past in which the behavior of the soil is simplified by linear elasticity. This assumption of linear elastic soil model does not describe real soil behaviors. In this research, a seismic vibrator standing on a homogeneous soil is simulated by means of an axisymmetric finite element model with an advanced soil model, i.e. Hardening Soil model with smallstrain stiffness, called HS-small model in which the non-linear, irreversible soil behaviors as well as small-strain stiffness effects below a seismic vibrator are taken into account. The sign and amplitude of displacements of the ground surface in the near field and the far field are observed for a homogeneous sand and homogeneous clay. A comparison between the linear elastic model and the HS-small model in simulation the soil response is made. The response of the sand and clay under delta-pulse load, minimum-phase-wavelet load, chirp load, and harmonic load with different frequencies (5Hz and 50Hz) and amplitudes (10kN/m2 and 20kN/m2) is simulated and evaluated. The influence of stress-strain dependent soil stiffness and porewater on seismic wave velocities is evaluated by means of seismograms.","seismic; elastic soil model; finite element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Het is mogelijk dit te doen met behulp van numerieke modellen die zijn gebaseerd op gediscretiseerde partiele differentiaalvergelijkingen. Maar in dit project is gekozen voor een deeltjesmodel. Dit deeltjesmodel is makkelijk en snel te implementeren. In het model hoeft bijvoorbeeld geen rekening gehouden te worden met negatieve concentraties, problemen met massabehoud en steile concentratie gradienten, wat wel het geval is bij de numerieke methoden. Er is eerst onderzoek gedaan naar de basiskennis die bestaat uit deeltjesmodellen, stochastische differentiaalvergelijkingen, de Fokker-Planck vergelijking, numerieke methoden en simuleren. Vervolgens wordt het model opgesteld voor het deeltjes-transport, dat bestaat uit vier stappen, het advectie-diffusie model; de stochastische differentiaalvergelijkingen; het gediscretiseerde model; achterwaarts model dankzij de Kolmogorov-backward vergelijking. De implementatie wordt besproken en het gebruik van SIMONA. Tenslotte wordt het model toegepast op een testcase. Hierbij worden resultaten gepresenteerd voor drie verschillende kritieke locaties. In twee dimensies is al vaak gekeken naar de verspreiding van deeltjes. Hierbij werd vaak gestuit op problemen. Het blijkt moeilijk om rekening te houden met variaties in diepte en waterhoogte.

(mentor)","2008","Expex is als praktijkgericht inspectie- en adviesbureau werkzaam op de bestaande vastgoedmarkt. Het bedrijf brengt verscheidene adviezen en rapportages uit naar aanleiding van uitgevoerde inspecties. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn onder andere het Meerjarig Onderhouds Prognose (MJOP) over woningen van woningcoraties en Energie Prestatie Label (EPA). Veel van de benodigde informatie voor een advies verzamelen zij door de woning te bekijken. Vaak worden inspecties volgens een vaste methodiek uitgevoerd om de relevante onderdelen van de woning te inspecteren. Ten tijde van de start van dit pro ject vullen de inspecteurs bij Expex de inspecties die ze uitvoeren handmatig op papier in. Het probleem zit in het feit dat het achteraf, handmatig invoeren zorgt voor een minder effcie verwerking van de verzamelde technische gegevens, immers moeten deze verkregen gegevens nogmaals in digitale vorm worden ingevoerd in het systeem. Daarnaast komt steeds vaker voor dat er verschillende combinaties van inspecties uitgevoerd moeten worden. Aangezien iedere inspectie haar eigen speci?eke inspectieformulier kent, zorgt dit ervoor dat de inspecteur mogelijk onnodig veel dezelfde gegevens nogmaals moeten verzamelen en invullen. Om deze situatie te kunnen verbeteren, was men binnen Expex reeds op zoek naar een goede softwareoplossing, zodat het mogelijk wordt om inspecties gecombineerd uit te voeren en alle benodigde gegevens meteen in digitale vorm te verzamelen. Echter was er geen dergelijk, speci?ek softwareproduct voor hun probleem op de markt te vinden. Het ontwikkelde softwareprototype, Combined Inspection Module (CIM), ondersteunt de inspecteurs om diverse, gecombineerde inspecties op locatie uit te voeren. Het systeem leidt hem op een goede, effcie wijze door de inspectie en biedt de inspecteur tevens de zekerheid dat hij voldoende gegevens voor de gecombineerde inspectie heeft verzameld. Een extra functionaliteit dat CIM de inspecteur biedt is de validatie waarbij wordt nagegaan of de inspecteur voldoende gegevens heeft verzameld om zijn advies dan wel rapportage te kunnen uitbrengen. Tijdens de ontwikkeling van CIM bleek vooral het combineren van inspecties een grote uitdaging. Helaas bleek het uit praktische overwegingen niet mogelijk te zijn om inspecties volledig automatisch door het systeem te combineren. Desondanks biedt CIM de inspecteur de mogelijkheid om handmatig op een gemakkelijke wijze de inspecties te combineren. Het grootste voordeel is dat de inspecteur te maken heeft met slechts gecombineerde inspectie en de bijbehorende validatie. De gegevens worden in digitale vorm verzameld, zodat het invullen van een aantal verschillend opgebouwde inspectieformulieren tot het verleden toebehoort. Tenslotte biedt CIM de inspecteur voor iedere (gecombineerde) inspectie dezelfde, vertrouwde user interface en kunnen in de toekomst de verzamelde gegevens direct exporteren naar de verschillende softwarepakketten, zodat ook het achteraf op kantoor alle gegevens moeten invullen in verschillende softwarepakketten tot het verleden behoort. Al met al zorgen de genoemde voordelen die CIM de inspecteur biedt ervoor, dat de inspecteur een stuk efficier zijn werk kan verrichten en veel minder tijd kwijt is aan onnodig papierwerk en het invoeren van verzamelde gegevens in de softwarepakketten. Expex heeft met het ontwikkelde softwareprototype CIM een nieuw concurrentievoordeel op de bestaande vastgoedmarkt.","abstractie; inspectie; expex","nl","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sci, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

In the real situation an object moves through the air, while in a wind tunnel it is the air that is moving. So a wind tunnel needs to generate an airflow. In this airflow, at the walls of the wind tunnel, an undesired effect occurs called boundary layer development. A thin layer of air is retarded due to friction of the airflow with the walls of the tunnel. In an automotive wind tunnel, which simulates airflows around cars, this boundary layer will also develop over the ground plane under the car. Because this boundary layer is not present on the road, this ground plane boundary layer should be minimized for accurate simulations. To minimize the ground plane boundary layer many techniques are implemented in wind tunnels and one of them is boundary layer suction. With boundary layer suction, a suction section in the wind tunnel floor removes, or partly removes, the boundary layer by sucking air away from the main airflow. This suction section is the main subject of this master thesis. Research will be done on a new suction system with an adaptive suction duct geometry. It will explore the possibilities to control the suction speed distribution on this suction system by adapting the geometry of the duct by actuators. A model of a system with an adaptive geometry is made based on the physical properties of the airflow in the duct. This model is verified by measurements on a test setup. It is found that different control techniques can be used to control the suction speed distribution of the airflow through a porous material. The capabilities of the controlled system are quantified for wind tunnel integration.","wind tunnel; embedded system; actuators; adaptive system; boundary layer suction","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Control and Simulation","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

The combinatorial problem consists of finding the sequence of a fixed number of asteroids that will allow to find the optimal trajectory. The trajectory optimisation problem is aimed at finding the optimal rendezvous trajectories connecting the asteroids of the selected sequence. To quickly assess the optimality of the possible sequences it would be interesting to have a fast algorithm that generates a good initial guess. If no limitations on the thrust or constraints on the departure and arrival velocity are considered, this 2-Point Boundary Value Problem is analytically solved by the Lambert Problem. This analytic solution has a ballistic arc in between impulsive manoeuvres and sometimes this trajectory is no good approximation for an optimal low-thrust trajectory. The method developed here, describes the shape of the 3-dimensional trajectory with expansions in power series. These expressions contain a number of unknown coefficients or Degrees of Freedom. Substitution of the Boundary Conditions leads to conditions that guarantee the satisfaction of the Boundary Conditions. The remaining Degrees of Freedom then act as optimisation variables. During the optimisation process the propellant mass is minimised for 8 selected test cases. It is shown that the method works very well for relatively short transfers. This new and fast algorithm provides a trajectory that is close to the optimum one, has a small error in final mass and allows to derive the structure of the optimal thrusting profile.","coltreps; trajectory optimisation; initial guess/estimate; shape based method","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Astrodynamics and Satellite Systems","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

De grondstoffen (bulk) en containers zullen met steeds grotere schepen worden vervoerd. De vraag naar nieuwe havenruimte neemt daardoor toe. De Rotterdamse haven, van de economische pijlers voor de Rotterdamse en de Nederlandse economie, speelt hier op in door het aanleggen van de Tweede Maasvlakte. Voldoende havencapaciteit is goed voor de concurrentiepositie. Echter, de kwaliteit van de achterlandverbindingen is minstens zo belangrijk. Het transport over spoor, via pijpleidingen en via de binnenwateren hebben nog voldoende capaciteit om een groei in de toekomst op te kunnen vangen. De problemen liggen bij het wegvervoer. Ook in de toekomst blijft het wegvervoer een groot aandeel in de transportstroom houden. De toenemende mobiliteitsvraag in zowel het personen- als het vrachtverkeer zal de bereikbaarheid en de verkeersafwikkeling op rijksweg 15 verslechteren. De bereikbaarheid van het Rotterdamse havengebied is van groot belang voor de ""BV Nederland"". Door de toenemende filedruk en de onbetrouwbaarheid van het wegennetwerk, komt de bereikbaarheid van de Tweede Maasvlakte onder druk te staan. De probleemstelling van het onderzoek is dat het huidige wegennetwerk rond Rotterdam, zonder extra maatregelen, in 2040 onvoldoende kwaliteit heeft en onvoldoende robuust zal zijn. Vanuit de probleemstelling is de volgende hoofdvraag geformuleerd: Welk infrastructureel alternatief kan de bereikbaarheid van de Tweede Maasvlakte over de weg en de robuustheid van het wegennetwerk tot 2040 verbeteren? Het onderzoek is opgedeeld in drie (A-)fasen: Analyse, Alternatieven en Assessment. In de analysefase worden de toekomstverwachtingen van het verkeers- en vervoersbeleid en de knelpunten in de huidige en toekomstige situatie op het wegennetwerk uitgewerkt. In de huidige situatie is de verkeersafwikkeling via rijksweg 15 problematisch. Met het uitvoeren van project MaVa tracht Rijkswaterstaat de Rotterdamse haven in de toekomst bereikbaar te houden. Uit de analysefase volgt, dat dit een korte-termijnoplossing zal zijn. Als er dan geen extra maatregelen worden ondernomen, zal de situatie in 2040 vergelijkbaar of zelfs slechter zijn als vandaag de dag is. Het gedeelte tussen rijksweg 57 en rijksweg 29 is kwetsbaar. De Botlektunnel kan worden gezien als de ""poort"" naar mainport Rotterdam. Als hier een incident gebeurt, zijn er geen alternatieve routes mogelijk om de Tweede Maasvlakte toch te kunnen bereiken. Daarnaast heeft dit deeltraject onvoldoende capaciteit om de verkeersstroom goed en vlot te kunnen afwikkelen. De oplossingsrichting leidt voornamelijk tot alternatieven buiten het bestaande tracan rijksweg 15. Na uitvoering van project MaVa biedt het bestaande tracmmers geen ruimte meer voor een capaciteitsuitbreiding. De uitbreidingsalternatieven voldoen aan het verkeerskundige wensbeeld om in 2040 een goede bereikbaarheid en een robuust wegennetwerk te hebben. De alternatieven kunnen resulteren in een Tweede Ruit rond Rotterdam. In de assessmentfase worden de alternatieven beoordeeld op ambitie en haalbaarheid. Bereikbaarheid en robuustheid zijn de criteria voor het ambitieniveau, kosten en ruimtelijke inpassing hebben invloed op de haalbaarheid van een alternatief. Middels een scorekaart worden de alternatieven kwalitatief gelueerd. Over het algemeen geldt, hoe ambitieuzer het alternatief, hoe slechter de score op de haalbaarheid. Bij de Multi Criteria Analyse worden de wegingsfactoren actor afhankelijk bepaald. Het resultaat is dat de referentiesituatie niet gewenst is. De doelgroepstrook scoort hier het beste, ook de Blankenburgtunnel behaalt een redelijk goede waardering. Voor de overige uitbreidingsalternatieven geldt wederom, dat de waardering op haalbaarheidniveau negatief zijn. Als belangrijkste conclusies worden ""noodzaak en urgentie"" genoemd. Uit de verkeerskundige analyse blijkt dat in 2040 vergelijkbare problemen als vandaag de dag zullen voorkomen. De noodzaak om nu maatregelen te nemen is groot. Daarnaast vraagt de noodzaak om een urgente aanpak. Alleen met een daadkrachtige aanpak kan de bereikbaarheid van de Tweede Maasvlakte over de weg ook in 2040 worden gegarandeerd.","bereikbaarheid; robuustheid; tweede Maasvlakte; wegennetwerk","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Recent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging advances enable to non-invasively quantify structural integrity of normal appearing white matter. Studies into white matter integrity in the general elderly population, aim to gain insight into the pathophysiology of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), a novel analysis technique, allows the automated analysis of microstructural integrity in the tract centres of cerebral white matter. Fractional anisotropy images, derived from Diffusion Tensor MR data for every subject, are spatially normalized in a constrained manner. Subject specific measurements are then projected onto a skeleton of the common white matter structures to allow comparison of measurements between subjects. A feasibility study using TBSS was conducted in a small subject group. This study helped identify methodological components that needed adaptation or extension in order to analyse Tract Based Spatial Statistics of the normal appearing white matter in the general elderly population. In order to best drive the registration in the first stage of TBSS, a study specific template was established by crosswise registering all subjects' fractional anisotropy images. The time required for this operation was reduced by the adoption of a hierarchical registration scheme. To allow a specific focus on the normal appearing white matter, and thus to exclude visibly abnormal white matter, we used an existing white matter lesion segmentation. Once maps of white matter lesions were transformed into the subjects native space, we projected these maps onto the skeleton to earmark skeleton voxels originating in white matter lesions for subsequent exclusion in the statistical analysis. Furthermore, brain masking was improved, laterality is ascertained to be consistent between the different image processing pipelines and the followed TBSS pipeline was transformed to allow a large epidemiological cohort (N=832) to be processed. The latter modifications include adaptations to enable nonparametric permutation based multiple comparison correction in conjunction with a clustering approach. This thesis mainly addresses the methodological extensions and adaptations implemented to allow the proposed analysis. A manuscript ""White matter atrophy and lesion formation explain the loss of structural integrity of white matter in aging"" is included in Appendix 2. This manuscript, accepted for publication in NeuroImage, introduces the adaptations and extensions, but most importantly describes the application of the developed methodology and the conclusions that can be derived from the obtained results. The successful application of the adapted methodology offers numerous opportunities for future research. The aggregation of tract-specific measures derived from diffusion tensor MR images into imaging based biomarkers for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases can be investigated. A first start will be made in studying the cingulate bundle. Another future direction is to define local measures to describe lesion load or white matter atrophy. This would yield insight into the link between macrostructural white matter changes, lesion formation and atrophy, and microstructural properties derived with diffusion tensor MR.","mri; dti; Rotterdam scan study; aging; neuro image analysis","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineering, Biomedical Engineering","","","","","","","","Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, R.L. (mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Paap, G.C. (mentor); Spaan, F.J.C.M. (mentor)","2008","Installed wind power world wide is increasing rapidly. The increase in wind power in the European electricity grid is expected to have its impact on the system behaviour. A European study, European Wind Integration Study (EWIS), was thus set up to study the impact of wind power. This thesis was carried out in parallel with EWIS and overlaps at some points. The impact of large scale wind power integration on transient stability in the Dutch grid was studied. For the simulations the Dutch part of the UCTE interconnected system load flow model was used. Speed controls and excitation controls were added to the thermal power plants, and at the interconnections equivalent generators were placed to represent the external grids. Nine connection points were defined and all installed wind power was aggregated in wind parks at those nine connection points. The distribution of wind power amongst turbine type and location was determined to get a realistic distribution. Several simulation cases were then taken into account, first a comparison was made between the dynamic grid behaviour of the year 2008 and the year 2015, when no changes in the current regulations regarding fault-ride-through capabilities are made, i.e. all wind power will be disconnected from the grid on a voltage drop below 0.8 p.u.. Secondly a comparison of the dynamic grid behaviour of 2008 and the year 2015 was made, with no wind included in this case. As a third case, different connection requirements were applied, so the wind turbines had to stay connected to the grid in case of a fault. These `new' regulations were applied to the 2015 grid situation. From the calculations it followed that the 2015 grid without wind power installed shows a less stable behaviour than the 2008 grid. In the 2008 situation a short circuit in the centre of the grid may cause the disconnection of up to 1258 MW of wind power. For the 2015 situation this can become over 5000 MW. A disconnection of such a large amount of wind power is leading to voltage oscillations and oscillations at interconnection power flows. These oscillations however damp out fast and do not increase in amplitude. The voltage recovery time increases enormously between these years. Applying new regulations, where all variable speed wind turbines will have to stay connected to the grid during a short circuit, reduces the oscillations. As can be concluded from the calculations, a rather stable grid situation is created. This is mainly caused by the fact that the external grids are not taken into account, but modelled as an equivalent. When a larger part of the surrounding UCTE grid will be implemented the results will be different and most probably show a less stable behaviour. This thesis also looked into the large differences in wind power penetration in Europe. Several countries have a leading position in installed wind power, whilst a country like the Netherlands stays behind. Governments in Germany and Spain are very supportive and show a stable position towards renewable energy. Furthermore social acceptance is high in Germany and Spain, and both have a large local wind turbine production. These are important explaining factors for the differences in local selection environment and increase in installed wind power.","stability; dynamics; wind power; power system","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Electrical Power Systems","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Electricity is one of the most utilized energy carriers for energy transmission in the world. In recent years more electricity is generated from renewable energy sources. The main drawback of renewable energy sources is that renewable energy power plants are often connected to certain locations. Sometimes these renewable energy power plants are located in very long distant areas across the sea, so consequently bulk electricity transport to major electric power consuming areas across the sea is not done due to economical difficulties. Therefore the aim of the report is to develop and to analyse different electricity transport concepts to achieve bulk electricity transport across the sea in energy efficient and cost efficient manner. In this case the feasibility of bulk electricity transport between the hydroelectric and geothermal energy sources in Iceland and the electric power consuming areas such as Scotland and European mainland is investigated. During the development of the electricity transport concepts three electricity transport concepts emerged. The three electricity transport concepts are the submarine electric power transmission, the battery ship and the synthetic fuel. In the study the three electricity transport concepts are further developed and analysed. The three electricity transport concepts are analysed by investigating the energetic performance and the cost performance of the three electricity transport concepts for the distances from 0 nautical miles till 6000 nautical miles. In addition the influence of the cost per MWh of power plants on the three electricity transport concepts is examined for the distances of 500 nautical miles and 1000 nautical miles. Currently the electric power transmission with submarine electrical power cables is the only way to deliver electrical energy across the sea. The electric power transmission system is composed of two converter stations and one or two submarine power cables. The other electricity transport concept consists of a battery ship and two small offshore terminals. The battery ship is a 300.000 dwt ship with integrated redox flow batteries. The battery ship is charged and discharged at small offshore terminals. In this report the battery ship is developed till conceptual design. The last electricity transport concept consists mainly of a production plant for the conversion of electricity into synthetic fuel, a cargo ship and a power plant. In the thesis different synthetic fuels are compared. The different synthetic fuels are hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether (DME), sodium borohydride and zinc. The results of the investigation are that the synthetic fuels hydrogen and ammonia are attractive synthetic fuels for bulk electricity sea transport. Hence follows that the bulk electricity sea transport by means of compressed hydrogen and ammonia is examined in more details and afterwards the two synthetic fuels are compared. The comparison shows that ammonia is a more energy efficient and cost efficient synthetic fuel than hydrogen, so ammonia is the appropriate synthetic fuel for the purpose of bulk electricity sea transport. Finally, all electricity transport concepts are compared with each other and evaluated.","shipping; energy; electricity; hydrogen; ammonia; electricity storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Section Ship Design, Production & Operation","","","",""

(mentor); J van Leijen, F. (mentor)","2008","The persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is a relatively new technique in radar interferometry which has matured, within a last decade, to a practical technique for measuring the deformation of the Earth’s surface. PSI overcomes the main limitations of conventional InSAR methods by identifying radar targets, called persistent scatterers (PS), which have stable backscattering characteristics in time. In 2003, ESA (European space agency) initiated the PSI Codes Cross-comparison and Certification (PSIC4) project to produce reliable information about accuracy and validity of PSI methodologies. The results of the experiment clearly indicated that different PSI approaches resulted in different number of detected PS (or PS density). Especially in deforming areas with strong deformations, the experience shows the low PS density. This causes that main areas of subsidence could not be assessed and identified. This lack of PS in deforming areas raises the hypothesis of type-I errors (falsely rejected PS) due to imperfections in the mathematical model of PSI processing. The background of this thesis is formed by the idea of using the results of the PSIC4 study to evaluate algorithm performance and assess which approaches are most suitable to retrieve reliable deformation parameters at a high spatial density. In this study, the contribution of four different sources of type-I errors is investigated, and some approaches to improve the PS density are proposed. The Gardanne mining area (the test site for PSIC4) was chosen as the case study for validation of the proposed approaches. The following optimizations are addressed in this study: 1) Initial network optimization 2) Optimized atmospheric phase screen (APS) estimation 3) Azimuthal subpixel position estimation 4) Non-linear deformation modeling In addition to these optimizations, the new approach for the final selection of PS is presented. Spatio-temporal consistency (STC) is introduced as a quality assessment for the final selection of PS. The advantage of using STC is that it can reduce the dependency of the PS quality assessment to the assumed deformation model and therefore it is better indicator for the observations precision. Integration of all proposed optimizations together results in 236% improvement in the number of detected PS in the Gardanne deforming area, leading to the improved identification of the Gardanne deformation field. Results of the study show that application of the proposed optimizations can improve the PS density. However, detected PS in areas with fast deformation mechanisms suffer from the unreliable estimation of ambiguities (unwrapping errors), resulting in unreliable estimates of deformation time series. The main reason for this localized effect (as it occurs mostly in deforming areas) is the fast evolution of deformation mechanisms. For example, in the case study of this thesis, the deformations range from few centimeters up to some decimeters occurred in few months. These deformations are strong ”fast deformation” for the view point of C-band radar (with wavelength of 5:6 cm) with at most monthly acquisition of ERS data. Different methods with restricted or relaxed conditions for removing unwrapping errors are presented. The decision for removing unwrapping errors from final selected PS or relaxing the acceptance condition of unwrapping errors is dependent to the application of PSI results. However, in order to deliver the PSI results including unwrapping errors to end users, a PS quality description which contains the quality of estimated ambiguities is required.","persistent scatterer; radar interferometry; remote sensing; deformation monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Department of Earth Observation and Space Systems","","Section of Mathematical Geodesy and Positioning (MGP) - MSc.

The Slijkgat is the approach channel for the fishery harbour of Stellendam. The delta area west of the Haringvliet Dam started to accrete after the construction of the dam around 1970, therefore maintenance dredging became necessary. Recently it was decided to deepen the channel over a width of 100 m from -5.00 NAP to -5.50 NAP and to maintain this depth. Based on the Stakeholder Agreement for Maasvlakte 2 the municipality of Rotterdam will become responsible for this deepening and maintenance. The responsibility for the implementation is transferred to Project Organisation Maasvlakte 2 of the Port of Rotterdam. This study investigates the possibilities for maintaining the Slijkgat; the possible maintenance scenarios are based on future morphological developments. These future developments are derived from a historical morphological analysis. This analysis is based on bed level measurements and Delft3D Flow calculations. Data sets of 1986, 1992, 1998 and 2003 were used and these data were compared. From this analysis it can be concluded that the sediment volume in the total study area is approximately stable, but that the sediment volume is shifted within the area. The Inner Area has become shallower, while the Outer Area has eroded. The Delft3D Flow calculations show that the amount of water that is discharged through the Slijkgat has increased in the period 1986 -2003. In the future the Slijkgat will most likely remain open as a result of river discharges. The dimensions of the cross-sectional area of the Slijkgat depend on these high river discharges, since these move sediment from the channel. As a result the Slijkgat is in a dynamic equilibrium since these high river discharges only occur a few times per year. The rest of the year the Slijkgat is accreting. The past ten years ebb and flood channels have developed in the Slijkgat. As a result the bed level in the Slijkgat is varying. Although the dimensions of the cross-sections increase in general due to the increase of tidal volume, some locations will remain around -4.5 to -5 m NAP due to ebb and flood channels. To utilise the system dynamics, the dependency of the cross-sections on river discharge is used as base for the scenarios. During high river discharge current velocities are high in the Slijkgat and sediment is transported, which makes that the channel dimensions increase. This principle is used for the formulation of different scenarios, which are all evaluated based on the increase of current velocities in the Slijkgat. In general it can be concluded that velocities in the Slijkgat can increase by opening the sluices during a shorter period. For the shallow areas near the sluices these effects are significant. Where the Slijkgat meets the Outer Area velocities decrease and the effects of the change in discharge regime is less noticeable. A permanent change in closing policy can reduce the maintenance activities at the locations closest to the sluices. A new closing policy that will be implemented is 'de Kier'; the sluices will opened during high water and salt water will enter the fresh water reservoir. If this new policy is implemented current velocities will increase in the Slijkgat, since the total amount of water will increase. Furthermore discharging though only the southern or the northern sluices does not make a difference for the current velocities.","Slijkgat; Haringvliet; morphology; delft3d","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

With rotor diameters exceeding the size of a soccer pitch [I1][I3], it s not hard to imagine that designing such gigantic structures is a formidable task. The multidisciplinary nature of wind turbine design adds to the complexity of this task, as the subsystems of a wind turbine need to be tuned with respect to a common objective to achieve a cost effective and structurally sound design. This rapport describes the construction of a model that can be used in an optimization routine with the goals to automatically design an optimized wind turbine drive train on the conceptual level and to allow the investigation of changes in subsystem design with increasing rotor diameter. A secondary objective is to gain insight in the construction of an optimization model of a wind turbine drive train and the problems one encounters during implementation. The drive train under consideration consists of three subsystems: the rotor, the gearbox and the generator. Only the necessary level of detail to describe the relationships between the subsystems and their geometry and constraints is implemented. Without making a trade off between computer languages, Matlab’s optimization toolbox was used for the implementation. The model and constraint of the rotor has been verified. The gearbox model has not been verified due to lack of reliable data. The primary objective has not been met due to the inability of the optimizer to find a global optimum. Also, the optimizer was only able to deal with the implemention of the constraints and models if they were further simplified.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","When a pile is driven into soil, the soil is pushed away which results in significant changes in both stress state and strain state. Using Finite Element Code to simulate the pile installation process has been not yet completely successful partly due to the limited knowledge of the governing behavior of the soil around a displacement pile. An investigation into the soil behavior during a static installation of a jacked-in pile in dry sand is conducted in this research. The mechanism of pile installation is studied under a plane strain condition. A measurement method based on (1) digital photography and (2) digital image correlation was applied to observe the soil deformation around the pile during installation. Series of simple tests were performed and proved that the method offers sufficient accuracy concurrent with large number of measurement points within the observation area. A series of four pile installation tests, with stress controlled on the top boundary, is conducted. The influence of initial void ratio and an additional surcharge on soil deformation was examined. The resulting displacement field was used to deduce the strain field around the pile and strain paths during pile installation process. The rigid/nearly-rigid cone of soil is found under the pile tip. Zone of high high volumetric strain and high shear strain locates below the cone and radially extends with respect to the cone. That a zone of high volumetric strain and considerable shear strain occurs along the pile shaft during continued penetration suggests an existence of the shear band. The inwards relaxation of soil elements near the pile shaft is confirmed by the tail at the end of the displacement trajectories and the peak of rotation paths in loose condition. The steady state deformation is also observed in loose assembly only.","jacked-in; pile; penetration; static; dry sand; digital image correlation; displacement trajectory; strain path; rotation path","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Echavarria, E. (mentor)","2008","In the last 25 years, the size of the largest commercial wind turbines has increased from approximately 50 kW to 3 MW, with machines up to 5 MW under design (Manwell et al, 2006). In these years, hundreds of sensors have been added. This high number of sensors leads to a high complexity of the wind turbine. As a result, wind turbines suffer more and more under frequent short stops. In order to evaluate the need of a particular sensor, a tool is needed that gives more insight in the whole sensor network. This tool should give more insight in the relations between the sensors and their values. Some sensors can become obsolete because other sensors are able to measure these values. The goal of this research is to come up with a tool that can assess the sensor network. In order to find such a tool, more insight is needed in the sensors on the wind turbine and what the criteria are of an optimal sensor network. In literature, 145 sensors at different locations are found in the wind turbine. These sensors together with the reasoning system form the sensor network. The sensor network is responsible for supplying the controllers, protection system, and condition monitoring system with the appropriate and correct information. The reasoning system uses the redundancies in the sensor network to make an as good as possible representation of the physical world. These redundancies are: - Physical laws dictate the relation between physical variables - Operation states give the expected variable combinations - Parallel sensors should measure the same value - Failure modes help to interpreted unhealthy behaviour - Expected sensor values according to control signals There are four criteria on which an optimal sensor network can be assessed. First, the sensor network for a wind turbine must provide the physical variables for control, protection system, and condition monitoring system. Second, the sensor network must provide redundant information for fault diagnosis. Third, the sensor network must have redundant information to have a sufficient high chance of detecting limit values. As long as variables do not reach their limit value, it is safe to continue operation. Fourth, the sensor network has as few sensors as possible in order to keep costs for designing, building and maintaining the sensor network low. The third criterion is assessed with a qualitative diagnostic model (QDM), which is a promising tool for fault detection. Of a single pitch system, a qualitative model is build to test if a QDM with an additional health variable is capable to detect situations where possible limit values remain undetected. The results are promising. The output shows all the situations (component failure combinations) were a limit value could remain undetected.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

MIDAS is a tool that integrates sequence alignment, genome annotation, and spectral clustering and alignment under the same application. The challenge in this project is in representing the knowledge and analyzing the genome data. The DNA data is first transformed into Fourier domain and clustered in MATLAB based on Euclidean distances between the sequences. Our tool allows visualizing the DNA spectra together with a hierarchical tree in a multimodal interface. This in turn enables a bioinformatician to analyze patterns of a group of sequences. MIDAS is a standalone application which provides an interface around standard sequence alignment tools such as BLAT, ClustalW, as well as newer alignment tools such as Spectrogram analysis via integrating MATLAB code, server connections and data visualizations. JAVA is used as the main programming language during the development of MIDAS. The Spectrogram Analysis script-files in MATLAB are converted into JAVA classes.

(mentor); Hendriks, M. (mentor); Schreppers, G. (mentor)","2008","With the advancement of solution techniques and solving computers, 3D analysis of civil engineering problems has increasingly become more interesting. The multiple spring model is one of the tools to give good solutions to 3D liquefaction analyses. In this model, the deviatoric stress is determined in a finite number of springs distributed over virtual planes in the soil element for which liquefaction analysis is to be undergone. Among the several options for the distribution of the virtual planes in the soil element, it was previously found that an icosahedral distribution results in an isotropic model. For the displacement based analysis which is going to be discussed in this report, the global strains will be decomposed into one-dimensional strains in each spring through transformation matrices. Then the Masing rule after several modifications will be used to obtain stress ratio from those transformed strains. The product of the stress ratio and the mean effective stress gives the shear stress in each spring. The global shear stress of the soil mass is calculated from the shear stress in each spring through transformation matrices. The model also uses stress-dilatancy relationships to calculate volumetric strain due to dilatancy which enables to calculate the volumetric strain due to consolidation. Expressions for a curve of isotropic compression or swelling help to calculate the mean effective stress. Along with the stress ratio, it is this mean effective stress that will be used to calculate the shear stress in each spring. In this report, it is discovered that the icosahedral distribution of planes results in an isotropic behavior. However, the way the springs are oriented on those plane as described in the original model by Nishimura (2002) will not result in an isotropic behavior. At the end of the report, suggestions will be given to overcome this anisotropy. It will also be seen that the volumetric strain due to dilatancy is overestimated in the model. The source for the overestimation is discovered and will be forwarded for further improvement. Suggestions for the modification of the hysteresis loop when the stress ratio in the past is exceeded will also be given.","multiple spring model; liquefaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""
