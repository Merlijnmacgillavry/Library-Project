(mentor); Hassan, R.M. (mentor)","2004","Vietnam has more than 3200 km of coastline, primarily consisting of low-lying coastal areas which are protected by sea dikes, natural dunes and mountains. More than 165 km of coastline lies within the Red River Delta, a densely populated region which experiences substantial dynamic changes and destruction due to frequent intense impacts from the sea (typhoons, changes in sea level, currents, etc). This dynamic coastline is mainly protected by sea dike system which has been developed for almost hundred years. The NamDinh coast, constitutes part of this coastline, has total length of about 90 km long of low-lying coastal zone, which is and had to be protected by sea dikes. This coastline changes very often due to erosion and accretion processes. Since the beginning of last century, about more than 30 km of the coastline of Hai Hau district has been facing erosion with estimated erosion rates of about 10-20m per year causing damages to the local economy housing, and loss of land, etc. Furthermore, the sea dike system along NamDinh coast has been heavily damaged. There were many times of dike breach which caused serious flooding and losses. The situation of NamDinh coastline and sea dikes can be considered as a representative for coastal area in Northern part of Vietnam. In recent years there has been a number of studies aiming at understanding the situation of coastline changes and sea defences system in NamDinh. However, due to the lack of data and design tools the results of these studies, somehow, are still limited and the problem is still poorly understood. Therefore, study on natural processes of coastline changes and assessments of the safety of the sea defensive system are necessary. This study focuses on assessment of safety of Namdinh sea dikes. Firstly, the historical development of sea dike system in Namdinh province is analysed base on historical record and collected data. Based on that the possible causes of old-dike failures are carried out. Secondly, the study investigates all possible failure mechanisms and their causes of the existing dikes. Follows by, the safety assessment of the dikes is performed for possible failure modes in terms of hydraulic, structural and geotechnical related aspects. Finally, conclusions on safety of Namdinh sea dikes are stated and some recommendations (guidelines) of new sea dike design in Namdinh and Vietnam, in general, are given. Safety assessment in this study is based on both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. The latest Vietnamese codes and Dutch codes for design of sea dikes and revetments are the basic references for these analyses. Comparisons will be made to applying different design codes for design of sea dikes in Namdinh as well as in Vietnam. In general, analytical methods are applied in this study. However, for solving some specific related problems the advanced mathematic models are used as calculation tools, such as: Using CRESS for some hydraulic related problems; GEO-Slope and PLAXIS for geotechnical related ones; VaP and MathLab models for probabilistic calculations.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Meek, J. (mentor); Pinkster, J.A. (mentor); Steenhuis, A.L.J. (mentor)","2004","To support cost calculations for tendering a pipe lay project, the influence of weather conditions has to be incorporated by applying workability predictions for the pipe lay vessel. When assuming constant good weather conditions it is possible to accurately determine the duration of an offshore pipe lay project. In practice however, changing weather influences have to be incorporated to determine the actual total project duration. The objective of this study is to find a new calculation method that is more accurate and has a short calculation time. First the existing method to predict the workability during pipe laying has been analysed and shortcomings have been identified. Historical project data for the dynamically positioned pipe lay vessel Solitaire has been used. Four areas for improvements of the existing method have been identified: - Wave Prediction: Extra deviation factor - Criterion Limits: Incorporation wave period - Wave Heading: Chosen on solid base - Abandonment and Recovery (A&R): Dependent on project location The first aspect of interest is the wave prediction. Currently used wave measurements are satellite data combined with buoy measurements. A scatter diagram represents the occurring sea states for a certain location, as combinations of the significant wave height related to the zero crossing period. This is at the moment the best available representation used for wave predictions. In this study a program has been written to determine the standard deviation of the workability prediction caused by variation in the weather conditions. As input for the composed program the limiting sea states for the vessel, project duration and scatter diagram are used. Logically, the project duration has a direct relation to the deviation. Five criteria, (i) pipe strain, (ii) stinger tip clearance, (iii) stinger forces, (iv) tensioner dynamics and (v) dynamic positioning (DP) system limit the sea states for the workability. The vertical stinger tip motion is a good parameter to determine the workability for the criteria concerning the pipeline (i to iv). When the critical value for one of the criteria is reached, the accompanying vessel motion is determined. The vessel motions are known for the whole scatter diagram and compared with the critical motion to determine the workable limit. For the criterion (v) DP system, which can compensate displacements in the horizontal plane, the same program as for the existing method will be used. For the other criteria the new method incorporates the influence of the wave period, while for the existing method only the wave height is regarded. The third area is the wave heading. As mentioned before, the vertical stinger tip motion is a good parameter to give an indication of the influence of waves. For different wave angles the stinger tip motion is plotted. Two angles are chosen as representative values for the whole compass rose. The existing method treats the average and worst wave angle for the vessel. By using the new method more accurate results can be achieved based on solid assumptions. A&R is the lay down process of the pipeline because of bad weather conditions. Currently a fixed percentage of the production time is used to predict the duration of A&R. Not only the duration of bad weather but also the number of times a critical sea state is exceeded determines the duration for A&R. By using old project data a relation between the duration for A&R and the workability percentage has been found. For North Sea projects a relation with the probability of exceedence of the significant wave height is found.","workability; pipe laying; wave prediction; wave heading; criterion limits","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Bliemer, M.C.J. (mentor)","2004","Like in many countries congestion is also a big problem in the Netherlands. Congestion is damaging for the economy, the environment, and our own health. There is a big need for solving this problem. Possible solutions are: increasing road capacity, road pricing, fuel taxation, using other modes of transport, etc. Road pricing is seen as one of the best ways to decrease congestion. The traffic authorities want to influence travellers' behaviour with the help of road pricing causing them to change route, change departure time, change mode of travelling, etc., resulting in a more efficient use of transportation resources and relieving congestion on the roads. The road pricing problem can be seen as a situation where two decision makers have conflicting interests. The traffic authorities want to find an optimal toll pattern to achieve a situation in which the road system is in optimal form. I n other words, the traffic authorities want to minimise the total time travellers spend on the network. Travellers, on the other hand, want to minimise their own travel times. It is possible that there are travellers in the optimal network conditions, that can improve their own travel time. If they indeed choose another route for improving their travel time, network conditions deteriorate. The road pricing problem is restricted by some boundary conditions and basic assumptions of which 'the traffic assignment and the traffic flows will be static' is the most important. This research will focus on solving a mathematical representation of the road pricing problem using different methods taking into account the complexity and the properties of the road pricing model. Restrictions are made about the value of toll (lower and upper bound) and the number of roads that may be tolled (not all roads may/can be tolled). Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is not to toll every link, but to achieve a system state that is near the system optimum by charging toll on a subset of links and taking into account a lower and an upper bound for the tolls. This means that i t is a constrained optimisation problem and that some of the variables of the solution may be lying at the boundaries of their allowed ranges. The plan of approach for this research is to do first a literature study on bi-level optimisation and later on solution methods. The road pricing problem can be written mathematically as a two-level optimisation model (a special case of bi-level optimisation). The mathematical model consists of an upper and a lower level. The lower level is a representation of the behaviour of the travellers and in the upper level the traffic authorities are modelled. Both levels consist of an objective function and some constraints. The complexity and the convexity of the road pricing model are discussed. After that some solution methods and their convergence are discussed. Finally, these methods are tested on four networks and the results are reviewed. In complexity theory there are four classes of problems: P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard. Problems belonging to the class P are called (computationally) tractable. Problems that belong to the other three classes are called intractable problems. In the literature much is proved about the complexity of a bi-level problem. The conclusion is that the road pricing problem is NP-hard. This means that it is not likely to find an exact solution with a polynomial-time algorithm. Heuristics will therefore be used to solve the road pricing model. It is plausible that the road pricing model is a convex optimisation problem. In that case existing solution methods in order to find local optima can be used. Therefore, line search, first order gradient, direction set, and simplex methods are used to solve the road pricing model. These methods are implemented and eleven test cases are considered to assess and compare the methods. The seven best performing methods in the first four test cases are tested on the resulting test cases. These are the EDO/BS, the SD/BS, the Hestenes/Stiefel, the cyclic coordinate, the Rosenbrock, the Powell I I , and the complex method. They are compared per test case with respect to the value of the objective function (1), the number of the function evaluations (2), and the number of iterations (3). The methods are given notes from 1 t i l l 7 for these three criteria. The best performing method is given number 7 and the worst is given number 1. The average over all the test cases is shown in Table 6.1. Best performing means the smallest value of the objective function, the smallest number of function evaluations, or the smallest number of iterations. This is not the best way for comparing the methods, but it forms a notion of the performance of the methods compared with each other.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport and Planning","","","",""

Om tot een ontwerp te komen zijn een aantal alternatieven opgesteld. Deze alternatieven worden begrensd door de Noorderpier (4.5km uit de huidige kustlijn) bij Hoek van Holland en de Zuiderpier van de haven van Scheveningen. De alternatieven hebben allemaal een totale oppervlakte van 2500 ha en verschillen van elkaar op het gebied van indeling en vormgeving. Voor de vormgeving wordt uitgegaan van drie vormen: een rechthoek, een driehoek en een kromme vorm. De alternatieven zijn op een aantal criteria beoordeeld, te weten: morfologische stabiliteit, kosten, fasering, ontsluiting, acceptatie, esthetiek, natuurwaarde, recreatiewaarde en woonkwaliteit. Er zijn een aantal weegsets (o.a. economisch en milieuvriendelijk belang) opgesteld om vanuit verschillende oogpunten de alternatieven te kunnen afwegen. Over de exacte uitkomst wordt geen uitspraak gedaan, dit is de taak van beleidsmakers. Wel is een alternatief gekozen voor verdere uitwerking, dit alternatief scoorde met verschillende weegsets het beste. Aan de hand van verkregen inzichten is dit alternatief op enkele punten nog geoptimaliseerd.

The main property of these plumes is their buoyancy; fresh water discharged by rivers is less dense than the receiving, saline waters. Due to the rotation of the Earth, these plumes tend to turn to the right in the Northern Hemisphere after entering the sea. Previous studies investigated the advection of buoyant river plumes due to wind forcing and ambient currents. However, most studies have neglected the influence of tidal motions. Consequently in this study attention is paid to the spring-neap tidal cycle and tidal straining, in order to investigate the effects of tidally generated turbulence to the stratification. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of tidal forcing on the evolution of a river plume in a shallow frictional sea. The numerical experiments presented employ a three-dimensional, idealised coastal basin set-up. The basic physical properties of the basin are an approximation to the typical conditions associated with the Rhine River Plume. In addition the effects of wind stress and a high discharge are brieflydiscussed. The model set-up enabled the performance of a large number of simulations concerning the sensitivity to open boundaries, forcing conditions and numerical properties. The most apparent effect of tidal forcing appeared to be the on- and offshore movement of the plume and the recurrent mixed and stratified conditions associated with the spring-neap tidal cycle. A pulsed discharge and instabilities (see figure) in the coastal current are also identified. Despite a number of simplifications, the results of the study exhibit a fair resemblance with the behaviour of the Rhine plume. This indicates the significance of tidal forcing on a buoyant plume in a shallow basin; it appeared to be the most important process controlling the stratification.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The current situation at the Directorate-General increases the complexity of the research question. Commonly organizations with stable processes (and need of information) are preferred to investigate the need of information. At the Directorate the situation is more dynamic, because of reorganization. Therfore the role of the Dienstkring and their appoaches and procedures, regarding maintenance, are changing. Also new instrument, performance contracts (also called innovative contracts), has to be uesed to control maintenance of the highway network. The fitnes of use of the geograpbic data sets is focused at the objects (including thematic attributes) stored in the data set and the quality parameters: geometric accuracy and up-to-dateness. The need of information according to the users is presented in Object Models. According to directives from the Head Office, performance contracts have to be used instead of traditional contracts. The need of information will be investigated while using traditional contracts as well as performance contracts. To control and structure the different problems, the Integrated Architecture Framework developed by Cap Gemini has been used. By stating the work processes regarding maintenance of the Highway Network at a detailed level, the need of information should become clear. The need of information is presented by different Object Models separated by the themes: Pavement, Traffic Requirements, Nature and Environment, Exploitation and Civil Infrastructures. Also distinction by traditional contract or performance contract has been made. These Object Models will be used to relate to the data sets (and applications). Besides the desired objects and quality parameters, also the functionality (operations) of the applications has been invested. The main research question should be answered from the perspective of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). A SDI consists of four elements: policy and organization; geogrraphic data; technology to store, communicate and use geo-informatin; standards for description, exchange and relating geo-information. All these elements contain parts of the answer to create an optimal information supply. Only mentioning geographic data sets (with Object Models and quality parameters) wouldn't be useful. It can be concluded that usage of performance contracts requires a geographic data set with the characteristics of the Object Model presented in Supplement 19. Although only usage of this data set won't improve the information supply. Long term solutions require the developoment of a SDI. Starting with a SDI on RWS level (corporate SDI) and participation at an SDI on national level (National SDI) is recommended. Besides conclusions about the data sets also conclusions about the used method can be presented.

(mentor)","2004","The main question of this research is: What is the potential and performance of a geo-DBMS to structure, index, query and visualize spatiotemporal points clouds of moving objects? Some researchers have been developing spatiatemporal data structures. These structures have some disadvantages. For instance, the model made by Vazirgiannis and Wolfson is especially made for road networks and anoter data model (developed by Wolfson) is relatively complicated and can be used for objects that move freely in space like aircrafts. Some approaches have been the disadvantage that they a lot of redundant storage. To overcome these disadvantages, a new approach is introduced. Thi smodel could be used for every purpose that deals with moving point object data (this makes it generic) and it does noet contain any redundant storage. An efficient indexing method makes quering of the data in a DBMS faster. For many query tpes, indexing methods are available. In moving point object cases, most of these indexin gmethods are based on the R-tree. Often it is not known in advance whih queries are going to be done on a data set and which structure and which indexing methods are going to be chosen. So it needs to be investigated which indexing methods give the fastes access to the data. The main principle of this generix model is choosing a base table, from which, by using (materialized) views, three other data representations (based n different geometric data types) easily could be derived. In this way a set of four data representations is available for quering. These four data types are 2D points, 3D points, 2D lines and 3D lines. In the 2D representations time is regarded as an attribute. From tbis set, many queries cold be formulated, like the objects speed, direction or acceleration. After the model is introduced, an efficient querying and indexing needs to be found. BEcause in Oracle 9i Spatial only the 2D and the 3D R-tree are implemented, the only way to manipulate the efficiency of accessing the data by the user is by formulating efficient queries. To demonstrate that this generic model is fast and flexible, two chase studies have been done. In the first case, the data has been collected in advance and being analyzed afterwards. So, the data set is static. The second case deals with real-time data. The main conclusion is that the generic data model for storing moving point data in a geo-DBMS is flexible and efficient. The data can be accessed in a fast way, depending on the type of query and the moethod used for indexing.","geo-dbms; moving objects; structuring; indexing; quering and visualizing spatiotemporal point clouds of moving objects","en","master thesis","Delft University of Technology, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Geo-Database Management Center","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","GIS technology","","","",""

Mayabeque is a small local holiday village. 20 houses are permanently inhabited and in the summer the population goes up to 3000, mostly Cuban people all spending there holidays here. Mayabeque suffers from an average coast regression of 1.1 meter per year. The main objective of this project is the rehabilitation of the Mayabeque Beach. Therefore an investigation to the causes of erosion needs to be made and after that solutions will be proposed. The first step in the research was gathering relevant information. Information on bathymetry, wind, waves etc. was collected. Furthermore the influence of nearby rivers, the neighbouring mangrove coasts and the Coral reefs in the gulf of Batabano has been investigated. With all this data a qualitative analyses was made to identify the probable causes of erosion. The following circumstances were identified as possible causes of erosion: An increase in the frequency and intensity of storms (thus an increase of offshore transport), global sea level rise, a dominant long shore transport and the construction of houses on the dune. All these possible causes have been integrated in a complete erosion theory. The principal idea is that sand from the beach and dune is transported to the foreshore and then moved out of the area by long shore transport. Both long shore and cross-shore transport have been calculated, using the CERC formula and Unibest CL+ for long shore transport and the convolution method and Sbeach in combination with BMAP for cross-shore transport. It appeared to be difficult to combine the results from both gradients in order to simulate the history of erosion. Mainly qualitative insights were gained. The results though do prove that the developed theory is a good description of the history of erosion at Mayabeque Beach. With this theory in mind three concepts are presented for the rehabilitation of the Mayabeque beach. These concepts are: nourishment, nourishment with groins and nourishment with offshore breakwaters. Every concept contains several alternatives. With the help of a Multi Criteria Analysis one alternative from every concept was chosen to be designed. These alternatives are: Beach nourishment, groin field with nourishment and multiple offshore breakwaters in combination with nourishment. After designing these alternatives a multi criteria analysis was performed again and it was found that the groin field with nourishment was the best solution. After an optimization a cost reduction of 30 % was achieved and this alternative ultimately arrived to the following dimensions: The groin field exists of four groins with a distance of 500 m between them and with a length of 133 meters each, with a crest height of 1,5 meter above mean sea level and a crest width of 5,04 meter. Each groin has an armour layer, filter layer and care. At both sides at the toe a filter is placed. The armour layer exist of quarry stone with a Dn50 of 0,63 m, the filter layer of armour stone with a Dn50 of 0,32 m and the core exists of quarry run with a Dn50 of 0,16 m. The filters at the toe are made up of three layers. Each layer has a width of 20 cm. In downward direction these layers have a Dn50 of respectively 108 mm, 18 mm and 3 mm. The slope of the groin is 1:1 and of the head 1:23. The average width of the beach nourishment is 30.2 meter with a total volume of 428800 m3. The construction of the whole alternative will claim about 24 weeks and the costs of this project are calculated at 1.4 million dollar. Due to the groin field with nourishment the beach will be stable and after a storm accretion will return to equilibrium situation. Erosion is present at the down drift side (at the mangroves) of the groin in the west but due to the initial placement of the nourishment in the form of the equilibrium profile the erosion will be less. It is realized this solution still is expensive and that it will take time for Melena del Sur to raise funds. Therefore a cheap initial solution is presented, which can be used to cover the time until sufficient funds for the definitive solution have been found. This cheap initial solution involves a redistribution of the available stones presently situated in seawalls and groins in an orderly sequence of berm breakwaters.","erosion; beach erosion; Mayabeque; rehabilitation; nourishment; breakwaters","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","22.671444, -82.142024"

Red River Delta, Vietnam","de Vos, W.J.","Stive, M.J. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Baptist, M.J. (mentor); Ursem, W.N.J. (mentor)","2004","Mangrove forests cover the shores of many tropical and sub-tropical coast lines. These trees are tolerant to saline environments which enables them to grow in the tidal zone. They are known for their often complex and impressive root system. From a Civil Engineering point of view, mangrove forests are interesting for since they reduce transmitted wave energy of incident waves and thus serve as a natural coastal protection. In Vietnam, mangroves grow in the deltas of the Red river Delta and Mekong River where they protect valuable aquacultural and agricultural lands. Although awareness on the value of mangrove forests has risen in recent years, there is still little known about how (much) waves are reduced in these forests and how to investigate this effect. This study deals with the physical processes involved in the dissipation of wave energy by vegetation and with wave measurements in mangrove forests. From the analysis of the physical processes, it followed that the dissipation of wave energy is relative to the vegetated cross-area exposed to waves and the third power of the amplitude of horizontal particle velocities. It also turned out that the effect of shoaling was very small on slopes, typical in mangrove forests, which makes calculation less complicated. This study also included a trip to Vietnam for wave measurements in a mangrove forest. This fieldwork was carried out together with the Hanoi Water Resource University. Unfortunately, no wave measurements were carried out successfully. However, the fieldwork did yield interesting information about mangrove vegetation and its habitat that is useful for future measurements.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Effect van ontpolderen op natuurontwikkeling in het Schelde-estuarium","Kemerink, J.S.","de Vriend, H. (mentor); van Mazijk, A. (mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Jeuken, C. (mentor)","2004","Het Schelde-estuarium is een van de zeldzame riviermondingen in west Europa waar het getij nog vrij spel heeft en een dominante rol speelt bij de vorming van het estuarium. Dit kenmerkt zich door een sterke dynamiek en schept daarmee een unieke leefomgeving voor mens en natuur. Door een toename van het menselijk handelen in het systeem en externe veranderingen, zoals de relatieve zeespiegelstijging, staan de functies van het estuarium onder druk. Om deze functies te waarborgen in de nabije toekomst (2030) zijn ingrepen noodzakelijk. Ontpolderen, het teruggeven van binnendijks gebied aan de zee, wordt als meest effectieve maatregel gezien voor natuurbehoud en ontwikkeling. Deze zeer ingrijpende maatregel stuit echter op veel verzet bij de locale bevolking. ProSes laat, als de verantwoordelijke projectdirectie, in het kader van de strategische milieu effectenrapportage (S-MER) onderzoek doen naar de gevolgen van de ingrepen voor het estuarium. Dit afstudeeronderzoek loopt parallel aan de onderzoeken van ProSes en concentreert zich op de morfologische effecten van de ontpoldering van de Hedwige- Prosper en Doelpolder. Voor het onderzoek wordt gebruik gemaakt van het semi-empirische model ESTMORF. Dit model is echter onderhevig aan onzekerheden en alleen relatieve analyses worden als voldoende betrouwbaar geacht. Hiervoor is eerst de autonome ontwikkeling van het estuarium als referentiesituatie beschreven. Daarnaast is een gevoeligheidsanalyse uitgevoerd om de invloed van onzekere invoergrootheden op de modelresultaten te bepalen. Hierbij is specifiek gekeken naar de toekomstige zeespiegelstijging. Uit de analyse van de ontpoldering, waarin de beschouwde onzekerheden zo goed mogelijk meegenomen zijn, blijkt dat de initi winst aan intergetijde gebied nagenoeg behouden blijft. Benedenstrooms vindt echter een afname plaats van waardevol intergetijde gebied. Deze afname is gering in vergelijking met de afname van het intergetijde gebied bij de autonome ontwikkeling van het estuarium. Daarmee lijkt ontpoldering een goede ingreep uit het oogpunt van vergroting van het intergetijde gebied. Onduidelijk blijft wat het effect is van niet onderzochte onzekerheden. Het 'morfologische succes' van ontpolderen betekent niet automatisch ook een succesvolle natuurontwikkeling, noch dat het een maatschappelijk gewenste ingreep zou zijn. Hierbij spelen veel meer factoren een rol. Alleen gedegen onderzoek op alle terreinen zal antwoord kunnen geven op de vraag 'ontpolderen: wel of niet?'.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
