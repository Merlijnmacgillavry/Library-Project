(mentor)","2012","The company PEEC-Power BV is developing a Range Extender for electrical vehicles. The purpose of this Range Extender is to extend the driving distance when the battery of the electrical vehicle has emptied. Since most of the distances people are driving are short, 90 percent of the journeys can be performed fully electric. Only a small battery is required in this type of hybrid electrical vehicles. However, when a large distance has to be driven, the Range Extender generates enough power to reach the destination without stagnation. The design of the PEEC-Power Range Extender differs from a normal generator. An opposed piston engine with an integrated generator is used. This special design has a different behavior compared to normal combustion engines. In the current study, the control for the generator of the PEEC-Power Range Extender was investigated. Models were created of certain parts of the system and diverse control strategies were explored. Some of the system parameters were determined in previous publications. Based on the developed models, three different control strategies were considered: cascaded PID control, Model Predictive Direct Current Control and Predictive Current Control combined with Space Vector Modulation. These three current control methods were discussed and simulated in combination with a (modified) PID speed controller and a predictive speed controller. The best performing strategy was determined based on the simulation results. For reliable operation, encoders or resolvers are not desired. Therefore, sensor less control is required. To determine the position and speed of the generator, a position estimator is required. Diverse types of position estimators were described in literature. An overview is presented in this thesis. Based on the design, a selection was made and the three resulting estimators (Flux Linkage Observer, Sliding Mode Observer and Simplified Kalman Observer) were simulated. Based on the simulation results the best performing estimator, Sliding Mode Observer, was chosen. To verify the performance of this position estimator, its functioning was tested in practice with measurements of the PEEC-Power Range Extender prototype.","Range Extender","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","EPP","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The research focuses on the challenges that Dutch design companies have encountered in their practical work for the Chinese clients. Ten different respondents are interviewed for the research, including Dutch designers, a Dutch business director, a Chinese employee and so forth. The collected interview data contribute to explore the culture influenced challenges in the cooperation with the Chinese clients, the consumer research in a foreign context and some specific manufacturing issues in China. The trends of globalization make a great impact on companies’ international business. It ensures that companies can exchange goods and services internationally, shift production to other countries, and learn from abroad more efficient means of operating (Daniels, 2002). China, as one of the fastest developing countries, is not only a big manufacturing base but also a tempting emerging market. On one hand, some western companies hand over their production into China. Some Dutch design companies, therefore, have to contact with Chinese manufacturers and together make a successfully product. On the other hands, some of Chinese companies also have realized that design brings values and the competitiveness to their products. Therefore, in order to compete in a global market, the Chinese companies also seek for the foreign design agencies for the sake of their mature design techniques. The trends indicate that here is a good timing for some brave Dutch design companies to consider launching their business in China. However, the international cooperation is facing several cultural challenges. The culture differences between Dutch and Chinese raise some problems, which reduce the working efficiency, increase the cost and the time. Some problems even hinder a long-term relationship between Dutch design companies and their Chinese clients. Therefore, it becomes essential and important to learn from some experienced Dutch designers and design companies, who have worked with Chinese companies for several times. Their stories and existing cultural challenges will enlighten those people who are preparing to newly start a Dutch-China design project. They can take advantages of knowing what happens in others’ Chinese projects, therefore be consciously aware the different way of communicating, doing the consumer research and translating designs.","cross-cultural; practical design challenges; Dutch-China design project; cross-cultural cooperation; foreign consumer research; cross-cultural manufacturering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The latest stage in treating Municipal Solid Waste Landfills is the aftercare of these waste sites. An important issue, concerning the aftercare of landfills, is the reduction of long term emission potentials. The research in this field, which has been carried out the last couple of decades, has lead to different concepts for describing the processes occurring inside the landfills. The knowledge gained has resulted in two approaches for enhanced stabilization of the landfill body. The first approach is based on infiltration and recirculation of landfill leachate, which stimulates the anaerobic degradation of solid organic matter and leads to enhanced methane production. The second is based on stimulated aeration of the landfill body leading to enhanced degradation of organic matter by creating local aerobic conditions. The infiltration and recirculation of leachate has an impact on the flow of water and transport of solutes inside the landfill. A significant amount of the research on this matter involves the interpretation of such phenomena by using water flow models for soils. Many of these models are implemented to describe such events. The research objective of this project is to create a one-dimensional two-domain model that simulates preferential flow inside landfills. In order to reach this objective an implementation of a model, which couples a two-domain flow along with the transport of solutes throughout these domains, is required. The outcome of this study will be used for an up-scaling process of the numerical modeling of the preferential flow events.","preferential flow; landfill; model; Richards'; two-domain flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor); Cuperus, Y. (mentor); Konstantinou, T. (mentor)","2012","High vacancy rates of offices are a major problem in the Netherlands. Especially since the start of the economic crisis, the number of empty office buildings has increased significantly. The highest vacancy rates can be found in non monumental offices with column structures build from 1960 till 1980. This office vacancy is due to esthetical, technical, energetically and functional decay of the facades, installations and infrastructure. Structural vacancy is not lean because the building area and building are not in use, the fact that the structure can probably last for many more years and the unnecessary losses of energy and money. The vacancy problem is completely strange when looking at the housing demand. To meet the plans of the ministry of housing, in theory every year 80.000 houses must be built. This number is (partly because of the economic situation) far from what is built. These observations are not unnoticed, recently the politics and media have given their attention to this problem. When a vacant building is finally transformed, an import question or comment can be placed; is the transformation not again part of an existing ‘discard’ cycle? If the user can’t perform his activities qualitative or live in the desired comfort and luxury, then there is a discrepancy between the building and the user. The future can’t be predicted, so are we not building new vacancy? Taking this question into account, a new dimension can be added to the vacancy problem: we do not only need to transform from office to dwelling, but also from dwelling to user.","Vacant office buildings; Transformation; Open Building; Integrated Facade- and Climate design; The individual user","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-01","Architecture","Building Technology","","Facade Master","",""

The increase use of mobile service poses challenge for actors in mobile ecosystem to constantly meet the dynamic change of needs and requirement of mobile users. Through market segmentation, actors such as network operator, handset manufacturer, and application provider are able to distinguish behavior usage or preferences on mobile services for each market segment and use this information to design or offer specific product that meet the behavior or preferences of the user in each market segment. This paper explores the use of market segmentation on the perspective of actors in mobile ecosystem which are network operator, handset manufacturer and application provider. Furthermore, this paper also explores the interaction that may exist between each actor by analyzing the relation between the resulted segments of each perspective. Our findings show that the resulted market segment can be identified based on their level of voice, SMS and data usage and also based on their application usage behavior. Related to interaction among actor, by correlating the resulted segment of each perspective, we find that handset manufacturer can easily cooperate with both network operator and application provider in designing or offering product and services to each market segment, while the cooperation between network operator and application provider may be quite complex. We also note that incorporating demographic and psychographic for profiling the market segment based on behavioral usage provide additional insight for each actor to perceive their target users and respectively type of marketing strategy and product usage to be offered.","Network Operator; Application Provider; Handset Manufacturer; Mobile Service; Market Segmentation; Target Segment; Latent Class Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2012","Tiga Co., Ltd. is based in Thailand and was founded by four shareholders in 2007. The company is the creator of ‘Voravan’, a home accessories brand whose first product, ‘Keawkoi’, is a surface decorative product that won an iF design award from Germany. Keawkoi unique feature is an interlocking joint that enables users to connect pieces together and create their own designs and functions, such as wall and floor decorations, partitions, and table runners. Currently, Voravan has two product categories: D.I.Y. (Keawkoi) and Ready-to-Use. Tiga Co. has exported its products to many countries around the world since 2008, and its biggest market is Europe, where it distributes Keawkoi through agents, wholesalers, and retailers (both offline and online). However, since 2010 the sales volume in Europe has unexpectedly decreased dramatically for reasons that are unclear. The exploratory research that investigates the reasons behind this decrease in sales is the subject of this graduation project, which then analyses the findings to propose a suitable strategy for Keawkoi and the Voravan brand. As the business problem was not clearly defined, the project adopted an exploratory research approach—a type of two-phase mixed research design recommended for this scenario (Creswel & Clark 2007). The first phase of research comprised both internal and external analysis—looking at the company, its market, and competitors. This phase produced the preliminary SWOT—an analysis that determines Voravan’s strengths and weaknesses, together with a market and competitor analysis that identifies the opportunities and threats. Information from this first phase helps to identify and purposefully select participants for follow-up, in-depth, qualitative study in the second phase, which consists of customer (intermediaries) and consumer research. Qualitative research using interviews and a focus group was performed to discover customers and consumers’ need and their perception of the products. Results from both phases of research were used to help pinpoint the key problems and form directions for an appropriate product strategy. The findings show that the main issues lie in the limited distribution channel, ineffective cooperation and newness of the products. The product strategy has therefore been developed to deal with these problems and to acquire prospective consumers by providing the product and service in the way that best satisfies their needs. The proposed strategy comprises a business model, giving a holistic view of the strategy including guidelines on the distribution channels, and a marketing mix elaborating the product introduction plan for the Dutch market. The strategy suggests that Voravan should find a new Dutch distributor, which should be an importer or wholesaler since this provides the most benefits to Voravan. Voravan should facilitate their partners’ operation with a visual presentation, brand manual, and point of purchase (POP) to support the sale of their products in department stores (de Bijenkorf) and design stores. The point of purchase display as a Voravan virtual sales person, located on a shelf top, counter or table, so that it is easily accessible. It illustrates the Voravan product concept, which has been formulated from Dutch consumer insights, including their preference to have a variety of products in one package. Accordingly, the purchasing program offers them a self-design package whereby they can select a combination of their own preferred patterns, colors and quantities. Furthermore, the POP is designed to encourage consumers to experience Keawkoi—they can see the actual materials and patterns that are displayed on the panel. Consumers can place their order using the POP purchase program, and via the system, the store assistant will prepare the designs chosen in the inventory room and deliver the package to the counter where the consumer can receive it and make payment. It is suggested that most promotional activities for the Voravan brand are undertaken online, because it is less expensive and Tiga can manage them directly from Thailand, for example, sharing Voravan designs through social media. However, items such as the window display and the bicycle advertisement are best managed by the retailers and distributor.","Home decoration; business model; market research; AIDA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Taheri, M. (mentor)","2012","Delft is known as a city of knowledge and technology in the Netherlands. The research institute TNO, the Technical University and also the business incubator in Delft are designated to encourage the rare creation of new economic activity. Academic spin off firms believed to be the new potential source of innovation leveraging the economic growth in the region. Although the number of academic spin-off firms in Delft has increased in the last few years there seems no significant contribution to the GDP growth and employment growth in the region of Delft. Further, the GDP growth of Delft region is below the average GDP growth in South Holland Province and also below the GDP growth at the national level. This leads to the question to what extent the academic spin off firms do survive and grow. With respect to this argument, our research aims to analyze the factors that influence the spin off firm survival and growth. We conducted an empirical research using 105 academic spin off firms to reach this aim. The sample contains spin off firms in Delft and also in Trondheim, Norway. Our study emphasized the demographic approach and we identified ten demographic components that potentially influence the firm survival and growth. These include firm age, birth cohort, size of the founding team, number PhD student in the founding team, discipline diversity of the founding team, managerial experience of the founding team, technology, market, financial support and office support from incubators. These variables acted as the independent variables. In our analysis we defined firm growth in terms of average annual turnover growth and average annual FTE growth. Therefore, our models comprise of three dependent variables: firm survival, average annual turnover growth and average annual FTE growth. The result of single correlation and regression analysis identified the factors that significantly influence the firm survival and growth. The statistical analysis shows that the firm survival influenced by age, discipline diversity, technology, market, and financial support from or with help from the incubator. The firms’ average annual turnover growth influenced by size of the founding team, number of managerial experience in the founding team, and office support from or with help from the incubator. The firms average annual FTE growth influenced by number of PhD in the founding team and technology. Our research concludes that the founding team composition will determine the capabilities of firm to survive and growth. We also deduce that the technology used by the firms and the market they choose determine their ability to survive growth. We suggest that it is better off for the firms using science-based technology and market their products in manufacturing industry. We also suggest a policy to connect spin-off firms and potential customers in so-called ‘living labs’. In addition, the general economic climate tends to influence the behavior of business actors such as investors and banks, and customers. After the crisis situation particularly venture capitalists seem to avoid investments in spin-off firms. Therefore, policymakers at the regional or even national level need to be able to ‘organize’ supply of venture capital with a set of different stakeholders in those cases of spin-offs.","Firm Demography; Academic Spin Off; Entrepreneurship; Firm Survival; Firm Growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Economic Innovation","",""

(mentor); Van Kampen, E. (mentor); Mulder, J.A. (mentor); Remes, B.D.W. (mentor)","2012","The development of systems that allow unmanned aerial vehicles, known as UAVs, to perform tasks autonomously is a current trend in aerospace research. The specific aim of this thesis is to study and achieve vision-based automatic landing of a quadrotor UAV on a floating platform, a known target that possesses oscillatory behavior. The research contributions to be taken from this study can be divided into two perspectives, as described below. From a theoretical point of view, a design solution is proposed which includes GPS navigation to enable the quadrotor to find the target, and vision-based control to approach and land upon it. From this design, several control-related issues must then be solved, mainly the development of a controller for the autoland mission. To accomplish this control task, an incremental backstepping control law is developed. Additionally, linear and standard backstepping controllers are designed for comparison. The derived control laws require knowledge of the states to close the feedback loops; therefore, state estimation algorithms are designed for complete state reconstruction. The approach selected is modular, thus separating position/velocity estimation from attitude determination. The former is performed using an extended Kalman filter, and the latter using a complementary filter. Furthermore, an augmented Kalman filter formulation is developed for estimation of the platform’s vertical motion. The combination of control and state estimation algorithms is tested in a simulated environment using a simulation tool developed in this study for Monte-Carlo analysis. This tool allows for evaluation of the design not only for the nominal case, but also for random combinations of external conditions. Results show that successful performance is obtained for the nonlinear controllers since the desired criteria is met and the risk of crashing is demonstrated to be residual. Additional tests show that incremental backstepping is, in general, more robust than standard backstepping in the case of model mismatch, even in the presence of state estimation errors. From a practical perspective, the findings are twofold. First, this thesis presents a procedure to experimentally determine the moments of inertia of the quadrotor by using a two-axis motion simulator and a six-component force/torque sensor. The inertia properties are also determined analytically using two modeling approaches: point mass analysis and assumption of simple geometric shapes. The results show that point mass analysis can lead to erroneous inertia estimation deviation of 20-30% from the real value), thus resulting in a significant model mismatch. The experimental and simple shapes assumption methods render similar results, which strongly indicates not only that the experimental method proposed is valid, but also that the assumption of simple geometric shapes can be used as a reliable and cost-effective method to determine moments of inertia of small UAVs. Second, in this thesis the system is tested in real time using an actual quadrotor. Flight tests are performed for hovering above a target with known characteristics, and to achieve this end, a vision system is developed to obtain relative position measurements from images captured by an on-board camera. A Kalman filter is implemented for real-time integration of vision with IMU data, and a linear controller with reference command filters is used. Tuning procedures are then carried out until satisfactory performance is achieved.","Quadrotor UAV; Moments of inertia experiment; Computer vision; Augmented Kalman filtering; Incremental backstepping; Monte-Carlo simulations; Real-time implementation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","Dynamics and Control of Aerospace Vehicles","",""

(mentor); Sonneveld, M. (mentor)","2012","In a business world where innovation is the main competitive advantage for a company, facilitating and improving the creativity of employees is of paramount importance. This graduation thesis, executed at Logica, comprises the report of a product design which can contribute to a more inspiring working environment. For this project the interaction centred design methodology Vision in Product design (ViP) was used. To gain insight into inspiration, creativity at work and the influence of office design, a literature study has been conducted. The most important findings are that inspiration is needed for continuing creativity, being inspired is a competence which one can develop and that it is a highly personal construct which requires deliberation and planning. The current trend in office environments is that of “smart working” which makes use of flexible work environments, which are aimed at collaboration and making optimal use of floor space. Employees do not have owned work stations anymore, which means there is little to no opportunity to personalize the working environment to fit the needs and wants of the individual. By means of a focus group the target user was involved in the design process. It was confirmed that employees felt limited due to the impersonal nature of the flexible working environment. Employees expressed they first need to feel comfortable and at home before they can be inspired. As the standardized office environment is experienced as highly impersonal, the need for personalization was identified. Furthermore, it was found that employees in a technical working environment are often unaware that the work they are doing requires a lot of creativity and as an effect; they do not spend time and effort to inspire themselves. The starting point for the development of a product proposal is the design vision. Using the information from the analysis, factors are formulated. Evaluating these factors results in the distinction of the following clusters: inspiration state, inspired by, managing inspiration, territoriality, office nomads and paradox of work, which make up the context vision. The goal for the project is formulated in the following design vision: “I want knowledge workers to learn that they can inspire themselves, by allowing them to shape their own working environment.” Inspired by the metaphor of Guerrilla Gardening the following qualities have been drawn up to describe the new interaction between the user and the office environment: deliberated response, customized effort, inspiring transformation and exploring freedom. The concept development has led to a personal virtual extension of the flexible work station for use in the Logica office environment. The selected concept proposal uses a DLP projector linked to an online profile to display personalized visualisations on privacy screens. It allows the user to quickly personalize the flexible work station with his or her sources of inspiration. Furthermore it promotes an engaged attitude towards the office environment and inspiration as a personal construct. For the proof of concept a user test with a mock-up is performed. Six Logica employees participated and performed their daily work activities at a personalized work station. They were asked to quantify their feeling of inspiration. In the end, all six participants felt more inspired while working on the modified work station. Concluding, the product is evaluated based on knowledge from the analysis phase and the design vision. Overall it can be said that the application of personalized projections in the office environment offers high potential. It gives the user an opportunity to virtually create an inspiring work environment in a setting where the possibilities for physical modifications are limited.","inspiration; office design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor)","2012","Nowadays durability plays a bigger and bigger role in structures. The so-called crack width is a very important issue in the durability. The addition of steel fibres to the concrete matrix is not unheard of and tests concluded that the crack width can be reduced. Currently steel fibres are added to the concrete matrix in different projects, however these projects were mainly floors. For more general use of steel fibres, calculation rules are needed. The main question of this graduation thesis was to study the influence of steel fibres on the crack width. The study of the crack width in steel fibre concrete shows that the steel fibres influence the transmission length and the steel stress. A crack width expression has been derived in two different ways: a semi-empirical method and by the use of differential equations. The expression which is found is the same expression as found in reinforced concrete without steel fibres. In this expression an extra variable has been added, the variable that contains the influence of the steel fibres. The expression that has been found for the crack width is based on an axial tensile bar. In beams which are loaded in bending, a part of the cross section around the reinforcement can be seen as an axial tensile bar. The height of this tensile bar is the effective height. For steel fibre reinforced concrete the same effective height is found as for reinforced concrete. By using the expression for the crack width, the influence of the steel fibres can be found of the crack width and the amount of reinforcement. Two different case studies have been carried out: one case study is a bicycle and pedestrian bridge that is loaded in bending. The second case is a case study where the floor of the parking garage is loaded in bending and imposed deformations. From both cases it is concluded that the crack width will be significantly reduced by the use of steel fibres. This reduction is mostly dependent of the post-cracking strength of the concrete. With a post-cracking strength of 2.00 N/mm² the crack width can be reduced by 75% in the case of bending moments. In case of an imposed deformation the crack width can be reduced by 90% with a post-cracking strength of 2.00 N/mm². In practical application for e.g. an amount of 25-35 kg fibres per m³ is used. This results in a post-cracking strength of 0.75-1.00 N/mm². By the use of this post-cracking strength, the reduction of the crack width is in the range of 30-55%. Not only the crack width can be reduced, but also the reinforcement can be reduced if steel fibres are added and the calculation is made for the same crack width. The amount of reinforcement which can be reduced is at a post-cracking strength of 2.00 N/mm², about 50% of the reinforcement. With an imposed deformation a reduction of 70% is possible by a post-cracking strength of 2.00 N/mm³. The amount of steel fibres in the range of 25-35 kg/m³ can reduce the reinforcement by 20-35%.","crack; crack width; steel fibre concrete; steel fibre; fibre; steelfibre; steelfiber; fiber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

Currently a three-stage method is in use: the first stage looks into the greenfield deformations, the second stage is a linear elastic 2D method in which greenfield deformations are applied onto a building and the third stage uses finite element methods and 3D models. The goal of this thesis was to improve the second stage by incorporating a non-linear masonry model and a soil-structure interface. A 2D parametric analysis has been performed in which various material and geometrical parameters were varied. The soil model was simplified to a linear-elastic model. The results of the research are twofold. On the one hand there are the results of the parametric analysis showing the effect of incorporating the non-linear masonry model and the soil-structure interface. On the other hand incorporating these two aspects a number of issues came up: the influence of the crack model and convergence criterion, the influence of the building location, the influence of the initial stress and the influence of the participating soil width. For each issue an explanation was sought and the consequences were determined. The results of the parametric analysis showed that including a non-linear material model and a soil-structure interface leads to lower acceptable volume losses. In practice it is generally believed that the current models are already too conservative. The difference between reality and the models must be sought in components that are still missing in the current model.","Settlement damage to buildings; Non-linear masonry model; Soil-structure interface; 2D parametric analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Design","",""

(mentor); Visch, V.T. (mentor); Rotteveel, K. (mentor)","2012","This project is done in collaboration with DOKLAB part of the Delft library, with the main goal of developing a storytelling tool for in the library with the implication of a multi-touch surface. The target audiences are the visitors of the library. First we need to understand what a story is, a story: true or fictitious, in prose or verse, is designed to interest, amuse, or instruct the hearer or reader. Works of digital storytelling always have elements of narrative and always offer some degree of entertainment. With a questionnaire I discovered that people would like to share stories of their own interests within the library. Although I previously wanted to socially connect the visitors, discovery made it clear that not everyone want to feel connected. A creativity session with a young audience gave more insights about how they would prefer sharing stories and this was by means of images; however later I understood that this group of people where just a small portion and elderly people and adults were a much bigger group. A brainstorm session gave more insight in how you can share and create stories as well as award and connect people. An interview with the visitors of the library gave more direction of how and what people really want to share. In short there was not one topic or medium which had a greater preference. Visitors have very broad interests and prefer consuming stories in text, images as well as video. Creating and sharing of stories were preferred individually and with name. At this point ideas were generated considering the content of the stories. The ideas include stories about cooking, travelling, hobbies, photo contest, poetry, comics and people’s opinions. From these ideas a combinational idea then came to light which emphasized the diversity of stories and creating stories in the library on the spot. This idea consists of 3 parts the first part is a proposition which is provided by the system, this is the so called stimulus which is a universal element in all storytelling. Then the users are to take a position by voting for or against the proposition. The second part is the stepping stone to the actual story creation the third part which is commenting on the proposition. From this I conducted a test for two days within the library with a robot made of carton box on its chest there was this proposition and people could vote by using a pen to either choose for or against by placing a short line in the designated area. After which they could write a small comment on post-its and paste them on the robot. In total 23 people casted their vote and 6 people contributed with a short story. So it became evident that people are willing to cast votes and write short comments. There was even a real live interaction where two people started talking to each other about the topic that was presented. Of course the carton robot was just simple prototype, so I did an interview survey to find out whether people like the shape of a robot to interact with or would it better to be a less characteristic design like a simple ATM kiosk. It was clear that the robot was not appreciated by the majority of people and they preferred an even more simple design with a screen. With the help of playacting the concept was further developed and only text as an input method and means of consuming a story was left and it was also decided that the screen should have a 45 degree angle. Hereafter components were selected that should be present; these include comfort of use, attractiveness, inviting, visible from a distance, layout, organizing the components and having a low threshold. Through sketching the embodiment of the concept developed further from being a robot with a screen to being just a screen on a stand. At the same time interface ideation was done, considering where to place the buttons and how to make the graphical interface attractive, intuitive and easy to understand and use. After this a final concept was created called Storobo, the name combines the two original concepts Story and Robot. The concept has a proposition on top and two voting buttons on the either lower side of the screen and a button to place stories in the middle. Stories appear like post-its on the screen and can be dragged and ordered intuitively. One can simple click on the small posts to see the full text and can reply on posts as well as up-vote them. A comparison is made with three existing state of the art systems, which are a website called stand.nl which is connected to a radio show, Storytable which is designed as a media player for the elderly and a story tool in het scheepsvaart museum in Amsterdam. The prototype is made from MDF 18 mm thick to support the full HD multi touch surface screen. A working interface is designed using Flash that supports voting and adding stories but not commenting on stories. It also supports dragging of stories across the screen maximizing and closing them. The Storobo prototype is put in the library for demonstrational purpose and to see what people think of it. Although there were twice as much votes and stories than with the carton robot the expectations were a bit more. But the people who used the Storobo were all very enthusiastic. I recommend the Storobo to be used in the library it will be a great asset to the already existing entertainment and information.","design; multi-touch; storytelling; library; interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2012","Every change to an application should be followed by a regression test if we want to assure that the application keeps functioning in conformance with its requirements. Executing such a test manually can be a time consuming and boring task. Time pressure often causes the regression test to be skipped, or only partially executed. Executing these regression tests automatically can be a solution to this problem. However, large costs, especially for maintenance, are involved in automating a big regression test. Also, many potential pitfalls can cause test automation projects to fail. A Dutch health insurance company called DSW has tried to incorporate automated GUI testing in their test process before. A testing tool called WinRunner was used to automate the regression test of a mainframe application called ISIS. We identified the causes for failure of this project to be high maintenance costs due to GUI object recognition problems, ignoring possibilities for reusing overlapping parts in test cases, and using hard-coded values in test scripts. These findings alongside with the pitfalls and guidelines identified by other researchers were used to avoid project failure and create a maintainable automated GUI testing solution. This automated GUI testing solution is called DARTH VADER. Key points in the design of DARTH VADER are separation of test case data and test case logic, an easily maintainable GUI mapping, the use of a tool to maintain the test cases, and restoring a fixed set of test data prior to each run. We concluded that the improved bug detection and work satisfaction, and the fact that no changes to the application under test are taken into production without being tested, outweighed the costs of developing and maintaining DARTH VADER.","Automated GUI testing; test set maintenance; pitfalls and guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-23","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering research group","",""

(mentor); Van der Ham, E. (mentor); Prendergast, E. (mentor); Schipper, H.R. (mentor)","2012","The main focus of this research was on the heat flow (density) through a roof in summertime. The effect of different roof toppings and construction types on the heat flow are investigated. Both a field experiment as well as a model were set up, to acquire data and generate results. Central research question was: What difference does roofing material and insulation make on the heat transfer/flow through a roof? With the following sub questions: What is the amount of heat transferred through a roof in summer conditions? How can this heat transfer be modelled? Key parameters that determine the heat flow through a roof are the reflectivity of the roof top, the insulation value and the (thermal) mass of the roof construction. Literature reports that change of the albedo of roofing reduces roof top temperature, inner temperature and energy usage for cooling. The higher the insulation value of the roof, the less reduction in energy demand for cooling when a cool roof is installed. Planted roofs give similar results. The soil and leaf layer function as an extra insulation layer on the roof. Nevertheless, plants cannot replace traditional insulation. A field experiment was performed in the summer 2011 on four locations. On three locations the rooftops were black, while a part was covered with white roofing. The Rc-value and mass of the roofs differs. The last location concerns a green (or planted) roof. The difference in outer surface temperature between black and white roofing was at maximum 25°C, the average on warm summer days was 9°C. The outer surface temperature of the green roof was of the same value as white roofing. The heat flow (qin) through roofs covered with white roofing was lower than in case when black roofing was installed. The size of the difference (?qin) depends on Rc-value and thermal mass of the roof construction. The peak in qin and ?qin were not measured exactly at the same time, but variance was not more than a hour. Due to insufficient data from the field experiment, the heat flow qin through a green (planted) roof was not determined. A model in CAPSOL is set up in order to gain results of the difference in heat flow through roofs covered with black and white roofing. Model and field experiment outcomes were in good agreement. In the model heat transfer coefficients ?e and ?i must be defined. It was found that a value of ?e between 15-20 W/m2K give good results when compared to the field experiment. For ?i a value between 5-9 W/m2K can be chosen, it doesn’t effect the model results of qin. White roofing (a=0,2) lowers the heat flow through a roof. With the model outcomes graphs are generated which give the relation between Rc-value and difference in heat flow (?qin) between black (a=0,9) and white (a=0,2) roofing. This is executed for light roofs (wooden construction, 20-50 kg/m2) and heavy roofs (concrete construction, 300-400 kg/m2). Thermal mass influences the moment in time of the ?qin. It was found that the peak in ?qin for light roofs with an Rc< 4,5 m2K/W occurs during office hours. In case of a heavy roof the peak ?qin is around midnight. Finally the daily Heat Flow Factor is introduced. It gives the daily difference in heat flow between black and white roofing in percentage of the daily incoming solar radiation. This percentage is translated to values for ?qin on a mean Dutch summer day (?qsun=7200 Wh/m2)","heat flux roofs black white roofing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Fitch, R. (mentor)","2012","This research, which is based on developments and innovations in mobile technology and attempts to provide guidance to applications of mobile retailing or shopping, focuses on Human Behavior and Interaction. A research framework is established with the thinking of customer relationship, which leads to 4 issues to be explored. Therefore, this research is composed of 4 stages of studies. Urban citizens, aging from 25 to 34, in Hangzhou city, one of the shopping paradises in China, are chosen as the target people to conduct quantitative studies. Among these studies, gender difference is considered as a big issue for inspection. The first study that aims to discover potential customers and their attributes provides evidences to divide potential customers into active shoppers and inactive shoppers. Most of respondents tend to shop weekly (some of them even shop less frequently) at familiar or original retail outlets or through the Internet at home. It is noteworthy that the reasons that motivate them to perform frequent purchases or conduct housework related shopping activities are potentially shifting form purchase-driven to leisure-driven. The second study that attempts to investigate shopping motivations in different situations provides further evidences to support findings in terms of the potential shifting in shopping motivations in the first study. Respondents are unlikely to simply shop for either necessity or out of personal pleasure. They tend to pursue a holistic shopping experience or an experience that is free of responsibility. Additionally, respondents all prefer to shop in original stores although active shoppers are likely to shop in multiple channels. In addition, a majority of respondents agree that in general shopping is quite time-consuming. Therefore, regarding shopping frequency, time cost, motivation transformation, and shopping channel, being able to capture frequent touches, namely to generate a greater degree of exposure to shopping information, to shape holistic experiences, and to facilitate initial search is considered as the role of mobile search. Considering adaptation of mobile search, frequent consumption, in which consumers shop products with relatively short replacement cycle, is chosen as the focused area to conduct subsequent studies. By focusing on this area more trials or frequent experiences of mobile search can be generated or applied among consumers in their regular shopping activities and in their regular use of mobile devices. Since indulged shopping in frequent consumption reflects the potential shifting in shopping motivations three desirable attributes, namely informativeness, enjoyment, and efficiency, are selected as important criteria to measure mobile search experiences. Next, in order to find out which information elements are most relevant and important for initial search, the third quantitative study is performed. Information content elements in relation to product comparison, payment security, product settlement, and non-marketer dominated recommendations are found most relevant and important for initial search. Moreover, females are usually informed better than males, and active shoppers are likely to be more knowledgeable than inactive shoppers because females and active shoppers tend to receive and process more information in initial search. In addition, respondents prefer non-marketer dominated information sources much more than market-dominated information source. Electronic word of mouth recommendation (e-WOM), as proved, gains equal preference with traditional word of mouth recommendation (WOM), and it is more likely to be utilized particularly for evaluating and selecting products that have experience attributes. Furthermore, the perceptions towards most of information content elements which respondents are likely to search for embody both perceived hedonic usefulness and perceive utilitarian usefulness. This, to some extent, further explains why consumers are unlikely to simply shop for either task completion or leisure and recreation. This also further supports the previous findings in terms of motivation transformation. Among those information content elements which are high of relevance and importance for initial search product attribute comparison, price related information, and non-marketer dominated recommendations are the information elements that respondents often search for and usually process at the earlier stage of a search process with greater input of time and effort. In order to make initial search less intensive but more efficient, judgment support and easy of recall are considered relevant and positively correlated with efficiency in product selection and evaluation. This means if consumers feel judgment can be quickly and easily made through information they exposed to or through information that can be better and easier accessed in working memory their feeling of efficiency can be enhanced. Therefore, judgment support, easy of recall together with informativeness, enjoyment, and efficiency are the 5 indicators to evaluate effects of information presentation. Since product attribute comparison gain highest priority in a search process and is also perceive high of search intensity. It is selected as the focal and starting point to improve mobile search experiences, which is involved in the investigations of information presentation. The results of information presentation in terms of product attribute comparison reveal that being able to have better understanding of products or product characteristics is the foundation based on which right decisions of information selection and information presentation can be made. Additionally, a good organizational structure of information presentation can contribute to enjoyable and efficient information processing. Thirdly, comparison facilitation enhances judgment making and ensures that information interaction is of coherence. Furthermore, information interaction should not only be easy but also should be flexible and compatible in order to fit different search approaches or search logics that shoppers follow at the time. Last but no the least, information presentation need to provide essential and effective evidences based on consumers’ own evaluation strategies.","mobile commerce; mobile shopping; types of shoppers; shopping motivations; search experiences; gender differences","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

At first, during the analysis phase, interviews were conducted with the different stakeholders. These interviews included teachers, students, and lab staff. The interviews resulted in a list of complaints of these stakeholders. Main complaints were about the bad connections between the Arduino and the breadboard, and the lack of debugging tools. Next an overview of different hardware and software platforms was made, and a literature study was executed. The literature study confirmed that the problems, reported by the different stakeholders, are also present at other educational institutes. The input of this analysis was used to generate a list of wishes and demands. The list of whishes and demands was used during an idea-generation process. The different ideas developed during this creative session were then elaborated into two concepts, of which prototypes are made: the 1-4-ALL-board and the IO-board. The IO-board turned out to be the most pleasing design, according to the list of wishes and demands. Main features of the IO-board are: 6 analog inputs, 6 PWM outputs, 6 digital I/O, and 8 included modules (2x pushbutton, 2x LED, LDR, potentiometer, 2x clamp terminal). The design of the IO-board was finished during the embodiment design phase. Minor adjustments and improvements were made to the product. Production drawings were made, and three complete products were manufactured. The first models of the IO-board were evaluated during a user test. Nine students, of different faculty’s and study-years, worked on different assignments using the IO-board, and the regular breadboard. The usertest showed that the IO-board does not influence learning in a negative way. The IO-board does improve usability, and 8 out of 9 students prefered the IO-board above the regular Arduino. The test resulted in a re-design of the supplied Quick Start Guide.","Arduino; electronics; microcontroller; education; design; engineering; mechatronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Siltation of harbour basins and navigation channels is a serious problem in the port of Rotterdam as well in many other harbours all over the world. Due to siltation, basins and channels require frequent maintenance dredging to guarantee safe navigational depths. The costs associated with these dredging activities are quite high. To keep the channels and harbours in Rotterdam navigable, Rijkswaterstaat and the Port of Rotterdam are dredging approximately 15 million m3 of sediment a year. The dredging cost of the Botlek Harbour only is already about 3 million Euros a year. It is a task to keep the costs in the Port of Rotterdam as low as possible to compete with other ports. Reducing maintenance dredging costs is in line with the goal of the Port of Rotterdam to be the most competitive, innovative and sustainable port in the world. Most sedimentation within the maintenance area of the Port of Rotterdam occurs in the Botlek. According data, between 1.5 and 3 million m3/year is dredged in the Botlek Harbour. Although the current dredging philosophy more or less works, the question arises whether there are solutions that are more cost-effective. However, the problem is so complex that it narrowed down for the sake of research quality. The main causes of siltation in general and specifically in the Botlek Area form an important part of the study. Hydrodymical models (SIMONA & Delft3D), were used to gain insight in the sedimentation problem. The focus in this thesis was more on the hydrodynamics. The exchange mechanisms between the river and Botlek Harbour were investigated, which were needed to examine the effectiveness of certain solutions. In practice a lot of solutions are proposed in literature, however in this study only a couple of ‘hard’ measures are investigated. The first possible solution that was examined was the use of a Current Deflecting Wall. It turned out that the hydrodynamics were very sensitive to the configuration of the CDW. While sometimes it would lower the exchange flow, at other cases it would even make the problem worse. The second solution was to make a gap in the Geulhaven dam. However this was not a good solution as high exchange flows occurred. The last proposed solution, the filling of the underwater dam, seemed more feasible as it would decrease the exchange flow according the numerical models. The research has first order results which can be used in further studies. According to this results, certain solutions will decrease the exchange flows. On turn it would very likely result in lower sedimentation rates in the Botlek Area. It is expected that some CDW configurations and the filling of the underwater dam would have a positive effect when it comes to sedimentation. However, this research is the first step of an extensive study that must made to deal with the problem. First of all many things can be done to improve the models, for example by using a higher spatial resolution. Secondly, other sets of conditions must be modelled to see what kind of effect this has on exchange flows. In addition, sediment must be included in the models to have more insight on the sedimentation itself. The next step would be a feasibility study, including a cost benefit analysis. It would be wise to improve the models further and to make a scale model for the most feasible solution. In the ideal case, were all steps are positive and hard conclusion can be made, it would be a good idea for the Port of Rotterdam to start a pilot.","sedimentation; Botlek Harbour; water exchange mechanisms; CDW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, R.C. (mentor); Berkhoff, A.P. (mentor); Loog, M. (mentor)","2012","Undesired, human behavior in public environments is an increasing issue in today’s society. The overload of security operators and law enforcement addresses the need for automatic detection of anomalous behavior. The EU-project ADABTS aims to facilitate the protection of EU citizens, property and infrastructure against threats of terrorism, crime and riots, by the automatic detection of abnormal human behaviour. At the Acoustics & Sonar department of TNO Defence and Safety, part of this problem is addressed by means of acoustical detection of anomalous events. The approach is based on ‘scanning’ public environments by applying beamforming on the outputs of an acoustical sensor array and applying classification algorithms for detecting specific sources. In this Master’s thesis, an initial step is taken with the development of a real-time beamforming system that delivers required sound parameters used in sound classification. A number of different beamforming methods have been considered, differing in performance and computational complexity. Conventional methods like Delay and Sum (DAS), possibly combined with the use of static, frequency-invariant windows, lack spatial resolution at especially lower frequencies and are unable of coping with multiple interfering sources. Other methods provide an improved performance on the cost of increased complexity. The method known as Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming maintains a high spatial resolution at lower frequencies. Two main versions of this method are frequently used: a static (non-input-based) one and a dynamic (input-based) one. Static MVDR (SMVDR) is able to maintain performance at lower frequencies, but due to its static nature it does not add any extra value in multi-source environments. Dynamic MVDR (DMVDR), on the other hand, is partly capable of filtering away undesired coherent interferers and also has an improved spatial response in single-source environments. Its computational complexity, still, is an important bottleneck. The search for less intensive beamforming methods leads to a way of adaptive beamforming. Beamformers in which static beamforming and dynamic filtering are split in two different parts, are able to alleviate complexity. However, the need for adding extra elements to account for target-signal cancellation in multi-source environments destroys the computational advantages, making it unsuitable. The developed real-time application takes into account the intensive routines of DMVDR. Since the properties of the deployment platform are not known in advance, it is supplied with a mechanism for adapting to different and changing, available hardware resources such as available CPU-time, arithmetic units and memory. In this way it will always deliver the best possible solution, based on what the user is offering. Still, an extensive implementation process has led to a relatively fast execution of the algorithm. The system is supplied with a user interface for controlling a number of parameters and for obtaining the first visual effects. Furthermore, it is provided with a user-friendly mechanism for calibrating the system for each possible deployment environment.","beamforming; real-time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","MSP","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The steadily growing amount of orbital debris increases the probability and amount of collisions between two objects in orbit about the Earth. These collisions in turn create even more debris, and it is therefore important to keep track of future conjunctions. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) uses ground- and space-based sensors to observe and track objects of about 10 cm and larger, of which the orbital information is coded in Two-Line Element (TLE) sets and listed in a catalog currently containing about 20,000 objects, which is partly distributed to the public. Using this TLE data, the Simplified General (and Deep-space) Perturbations 4 (SGP4/SDP4) analytical propagator is used to propagate the orbits of these objects, and includes secular, long-period and short-period perturbations due to the Earth's gravity field including J2, J3 and J4 and resonance effects for 12- and 24-hr orbits, as well as perturbations due to atmospheric drag, solar radiation, and gravitational attraction of the Sun and the Moon. The propagated orbits are used to predict conjunctions of pairs of objects. However, due to the large and increasing amount of objects in the catalog, numerically analysing all pairs would be too time-consuming. Therefore, numerous fast filters and sieves were designed to limit the search space of conjunction analysis, by discarding object pairs that are proven to never be able to conjunct. Four implementations of the classical perigee-apogee filter, next to six sieves with a new fine conjunction detection method, were analysed, implemented, and tested in terms of performance. The filter makes use of the altitude band of an object, and can be applied pre-hand. A method based on minimum and maximum radius determined from ephemerides, was found to be the most accurate and reliable in long-term application, while being able to be fine-tuned to the performance needs of a conjunction analysis process. Increasingly complex sieves are subsequently applied to the ephemerides at each time instance in a time interval, in order to efficiently discard object pairs. Eight possible improvements to the underlying theory and application of these sieves were made, resulting in one optimal combination of these improvements, and eventually resulting in a conjunction analysis system that is almost three times as fast as the best found reference method.","orbital debris; space debris; space junk; space waste; conjunction analysis; collision probability; filter; sieve; TLE; SGP4; SDP4; Tudat; C++; Two-Line Element; Simplified General Perturbations; Space Surveillance Network; SSN; catalog; collision chance; msc thesis report; Simplified Deep-Space Perturbations; analytical propagator; satellite; space engineering; astrodynamics and space missions; perigee-apogee filter; Aerospace Engineering; astrodynamics theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","",""

(mentor)","2012","Rip currents are narrow, seaward directed flows in the surf zone that can pose a serious threat to swimmers. This issue has received attention particularly on swell dominated coasts (such as the US, Australia, France and UK) where numerous field experiments have been undertaken. However, the threat of rip currents is less recognised on wind-sea dominated coasts such as the North Sea, even though a consistent number of swimmers drift offshore (in rip currents) and require rescue by surf lifeguards each year (for example at Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands). In August 2011, a five day field experiment was conducted at Egmond aan Zee. Lagrangian velocities in the surf zone were measured with drifter instruments and human drifters that were tracked via GPS. An extensive dataset of measurements was collected from which parameters that govern the strength of rip currents and affect their mean flow properties were identified. Three flow patterns were observed in the experiment: (1) a locally governed circulation cell, (2) a pattern in which the drifter initially floats offshore and then is advected by a strong long-shore current and (3) a meandering longshore current. A variety of rip current velocities were measured with the strongest being approximately 0.6 m/s. A statistically significant correlation between the ratio of offshore wave height over water depth on the bar and rip current speeds was established from the data. A 2-dimensional hydrostatic XBeach model was validated against laboratory rip current experiments and field data from Egmond aan Zee. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test a range of parameters that were categorised into two groups of different time scales: hourly and daily altering hydrodynamic parameters, and daily to weekly (sometimes longer) varying geometric parameters. Various hydrodynamic scenarios of wave height, wave period, wave angle and tidal water level were tested to evaluate the influence on rip current initiation and mean flow properties. Additionally, the importance of wave and tidal driven longshore currents was investigated. The key geometric parameters tested were channel width and depth. A reduction of the hydrodynamic parameters along with simplification of the model bathymetry allowed for identification of the governing rip current parameters. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that rip currents strengthen with increasing wave height, decreasing water depth over the updrift bar and increasing channel depth. The influence of the wave period was of secondary importance and the wave angle did not affect the offshore rip current velocity for site specific channel dimensions. The wave angle was observed to only have an impact for relatively narrow channels (relative to the forcing). This study revealed similarities and differences of rip currents at the Dutch coast and rip currents at previous field sites. The driving parameters of rip currents were identical; however, the flow patterns differed. While in previous field experiments drifters were predominantly retained within the surf zone, most drifters at Egmond aan Zee were ejected from the surf zone and did not return shoreward. Offshore of the channel the drifter behaviour was governed by the tidal current that advected the drifters alongshore. In case of weak tidal currents (slack water) the rip currents extended far offshore.","Rip currents; Egmond aan Zee; Field experiment; Lagrangian flow measurements; GPS drifter; Numerical modelling; XBeach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

These benefits involve the formation of a creative team climate. Among the variety of icebreakers, the game type enhances the sense of teamwork giving the base to forming more effective and productive group works. The multidisciplinary composition of a team increases its creative potential. Considering the design process, creativity takes place during the idea generation stage. This study presents the explorative investigation of the possible impacts of a game-type icebreaker applied as a starter activity of the idea generation process of newly formed design teamwork. The focus was addressed to the team-working atmosphere, the teams’ dynamics and the design outcomes. Six workshops involving teams of four students, two with design-oriented background and two engineering-oriented one, performed a brainstorming session to solve a given design task. Not previous acquaintance among the students was required. By pair of teams, three different workshop conditions were tested: 1) participants were asked to simply brainstorm to generate solutions to the task, 2) they were exposed to the icebreaker game, and 3) they were asked to start brainstorming right after a short personal introduction. The six teams processes and design outcomes were compared among the three brainstorming settings. Protocol and content analysis were carried out of data collected by the videotapes and the sketches of the ideas produced. The aspects leading the discussion of the results were group interactions, cognitive activities of the teams’ design processes and typology of teams’ outcomes with focus on the levels of creativity. The study reveals three main positive effects of the game-type icebreaker: 1) create a collaborative group atmosphere by enhancing the group communication and reducing the tensions; 2) produce effective and collaborative teamwork strategies by structuring the cognitive activities of the teamwork process; and 3) empower the team’s creative thinking potential in the design solution generation.

Strukton Rolling Stock (SRS) – a business unit of Strukton Rail – is a system integrator with a focus on wiring, traction electronics, and auxiliary power-supply in trains. They know the importance of innovation and want to be prepared for the future. However, there are some gaps in their current innovation process. After analysis it became clear that the problems are in the initial stages of the innovation process, the so called ‘Fuzzy Front End’ (FFE). A model is created to structure the different parts of the FFE of their innovation process. Based on this model a toolkit is designed for this FFE of the innovation process of SRS. The challenge is to create a toolkit that is lean and easy to use, so it is actually used by the company. The model is tailored to fit the situation of SRS. ‘Propportunities’ are introduced as a name for opportunities that are based on problems. These propportunities need to be categorized in different abstraction levels, which result in abstraction trees. This makes it easy to see the relationship between different propportunities and gives a structured overview where new propportunities can be found. The model is easy to understand, while all the necessary elements for innovation are included. This is achieved by splitting up the process in different parts that can be executed at different moments. The toolkit guides the user through the early stages of the innovation process. By means of a flowchart with color coding, the user is sent to a corresponding chapter of the toolkit. The result: an effective toolkit of which only the steps need to be followed that are relevant at that moment. Therefore it is more attractive to use the toolkit. Three employees of (top-management of) SRS have followed the two workshops that are described in the toolkit. The toolkit therefore is presented to these three people and they are taught how to use it. By regularly using the toolkit, more people within SRS come in contact with the methods described. Eventually, using the toolkit should become a routine (although the workshops should never become a routine, since each time a workshop is done it deals with different topics). The result of following the toolkit will be one best concept for a particular propportunity. Since engineers are already involved during the FFE, the transition to the more structured new product development will be relatively smooth; the engineers involved can further develop a concept which they helped to create.

Tremors can have peripheral and central oscillatory components which properly assessed and separated may improve diagnostics. An MR-safe haptic wrist manipulator enables simultaneous measurement of proprioceptive reflexes (peripheral components) and brain activations (central components) through fMRI. For such a MR-safe manipulator, this study determined the design criteria, created the design and presented its prototype. The prototype is divided into an MR-safe and MR-unsafe part. The hydraulic MR-safe vane motor (end effector) and optical sensors in the MR-environment are connected to the MR-unsafe part in the control room via hydraulic tubes and optical fibers. As a result, the fMRI quality is ensured and the manipulator is suited for safe use in any MR-environment. During a test in an MR-scanner (AMC, Amsterdam) no distortions in the MR-image or sensor signal were observed. The vane motor has a range of motion of 134° with a designed torque delivery of 8 Nm at a 3 bar pressure difference. The achieved accuracy for the torque sensor is ±2% full scale (F.S. = 14.3 Nm) and for the absolute position sensor ±1% full scale (F.S. = 70=1.22 rad). The prototype vane motor had some leakage along the axis, this prevented the use of pre-pressure and consequently reduced the bandwidth and maximum torque. However the maximum achieved torque of 1.5 Nm was still enough to met the requirement of 1.2 Nm. A PI controller was used to control the system, however this controller could not cope with the inherent non-linearities of hydraulics over the intended bandwidth (20 Hz). Despite the fact that the controller was not optimal, typical responses were obtained with impedance FRFs of two inertial loads. For future research it is recommended to remedy the axis leakage and implement a model-based controller. The open-loop FRF of the commanded velocity to the measured vane velocity was determined to characterize the system. Even with leakage and without pre-pressure, the measured bandwidth (-3 dB) was approximately 5 Hz and the -180° phase is passed at 7 Hz. Although the bandwidth does not fulfill the requirement for proprioceptive reflex identification it does allow for various motor control experiments. With the recommendations carried out, it is expected that the next prototype will be suited for proprioceptive reflex identification during fMRI.","MR-safe; haptic wrist manipulator; fMRI; MR; MRI; optical sensor; vane motor; hydraulic; movement disorder diagnostics; robot; reflex","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BM","",""

The reason for that is that compliance decreases the need for accurate positioning of the robot with regard to the door and door handle. One way to accomplish that is to add a compliant hand (e.g. an underactuated hand). Another way to improve a door opening task is use Shared Control to guide the human operator to approach the door and guide him with unlatching the door open. Shared Control helps the operator to be more accurate in his movements. Therefore in this study an experiment was perform to analyze the influence of Shared Control and an Underactuated hand when a human operator remotely controls a non-holonomic, non-redundant mobile robot during the unlatching of a door.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

A historical data analysis has been performed, contemplates over 220 of the worlds largest locks throughout time, analyzing the development and application of conventional lock gate technologies. From this, the conclusions have been drawn that the required lock gate dimensions of a number of future projects, fall far outside the application area of current technologies, and that it may not be assumed that conventional technologies will lead to optimal solutions at this scale. In addition, a number of aspects will be highlighted for future large & high head lock gate design, especially reliability, water consumption and its effects on the locks accessibility. A new lock gate technology has been developed specifically attuned to the future dimensions and highlighted requirements resulting into the design of: ‘The Sliding Arch Gate’, an extremely slender gate design, using (tension) arch action to transfer loads to the lock head structure, minimizing recess dimensions and water consumption. In addition, the absence of submerged moving / mechanical parts, minimizes maintenance requirements and the modular design of the gate enhances ease of maintenance, transport and manufacture. The Sliding Arch Gate has been worked out to an operational design level, using the Panama Canal Expansion Project as reference, in order to evaluate its potential performance and to make comparison with conventional technologies. From the evaluation it has been concluded that Sliding Arch Gate will require higher initial investments but that major benefits are achieved by reduced water consumption and low maintenance. The first of which can result into over $2,000 mln. in added revenues for the Panama Canal, during the commercial lifetime of the gate, due to increased lockage capacity. It has thus been concluded that new/innovative technologies, like the Sliding Arch Gate, can outperform up-scaled conventional technologies. However as the design of the Sliding Arch Gate is still in a pioneering stage, there are many optimizations to be found and uncertainties to be investigated.","locks; lock gate; innovation; arched Gate; arch; Panama Canal; hydrofoot; hydrostatic bearings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

In the aircraft industry, emissions need to be reduced as well. Fuel can be saved by ensuring that the flow over the wings of the aircraft is completely or partly laminar. A laminar boundary layer creates less skin friction drag than a turbulent boundary layer. It is however more prone to separation. Nevertheless, at the cruise speeds of transport aircraft a laminar boundary layer can be beneficial (because of the small angle of attack). At these speeds a shock wave can however be present on the airfoil at off-design conditions. This shock wave can cause a local separation of the boundary layer, if the pressure gradient is however not too strong, the flow will reattach after the shock and hence the drag of the aircraft will be reduced. During flight disturbances in the flow can set the aircraft into motion. This motion can be damped or amplified. The boundary between these types of motion is called the flutter boundary. This boundary is an important constraint of the flight envelope of aircraft. The influence of boundary layer transition on the flutter behaviour of transonic aircraft has not been investigated yet, therefore a first step has been taken in this thesis. The objective of this thesis is to: Investigate the influence of laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition on the flutter boundary and damping characteristics of a supercritical laminar airfoil (the CAST-10 airfoil) in transonic flow using numerical simulations. In order to do so numerical simulations are performed with the CAST-10 airfoil with two RANS codes: the DLR TAU code and the ANSYS CFX code. The DLR TAU code uses the eN-method for transition prediction, whereas CFX uses the γ − Re_ transition model. Steady and unsteady flow simulations have been performed with both codes. The steady flow simulations are used to initialise the unsteady flow simulations. In these unsteady flow simulations, the airfoil is forced to perform a sinusoidal pitching or plunging motion. The response of the airfoil to these applied motions serves as input to a flutter program, which uses the k-method to compute the flutter boundary. Simulations with both free and fixed transition are carried out. In case of fixed transition, transition was fixed at the leading edge of the airfoil.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","During conceptual design a problem arises when predicting the buffet onset boundary. Due to the pressure on payload-range and cruise altitude capability, improvement on the buffet onset boundary is often of great importance. It is one of the primary constraints in establishing the low and transonic speed performance capabilities of transport aircraft. Buffeting, a high-frequency instability caused by airflow separation or shock wave oscillation, can be seen as a random forced vibration. Depending on the angle of attack and freestream velocity, the separations in the flow can result in an aerodynamic excitation. The main motivation for this thesis research is to create a more advanced but fast transonic buffet onset prediction tool to permit greater design freedom during the conceptual design phase. This implies this tool should be faster than conventional tools, it should be reliable and able to deal with unconventional configurations. In addition, it should be built in a modular way so it is easy to use, alter and replace parts of the tool. The transonic buffet prediction tool was demonstrated using the Fokker 100 wing-fuselage combination test case. A modular transonic buffet onset prediction tool was successfully developed by combing a Vortex-Lattice method, 2-dimensional Euler code, a critical pressure rise separation criterion and the Matrix-V code program. It is approximately 90% faster with respect to the use of only the Matrix-V code and it is reliable in the region left of the coffin corner at high CL and low Mach number combinations. The expected error in the regime which can be correctly predicted by this tool is in the order of 0.05 With respect to further use of this tool, it is most interesting to see how this transonic buffet prediction tool behaves when less conventional wing geometries such as a flying wing, blended wing body, or Prandtl plane are tested.","Buffet Prediction; Transport Aircraft; Conceptual Design Phase; MSES; TSFOIL; AVL; Matrix-V","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","Design of Aircraft","",""

In this thesis, the design of an RF front-end for an UWB Microwave Imaging Radar based on MIMO 2-D array and multichannel FMCW electronics is presented. Requirements to the design were low power emissions and minimization of data acquisition time, cost and complexity. The UWB technology provides high resolution, while MIMO technique helps reducing the number of required antennas in the 2-D array, without a net degradation of performance. The final RF-scheme was selected based on the availability of commercial off-the-shelves RF-components. The performance of the designed RF front-end was evaluated both via theoretical analysis and simulations in a dedicated software Advanced Design System (ADS, by Agilent). The obtained results in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, down-range resolution and measurement speed demonstrate that the proposed solution is feasible for through-dress detection of concealed weapons.","UWB; 2-D MIMO; FMCW; radar; Concealed Weapon Detection; ADS simulations; multichannel electronics; commercial off-the-shelves components; fast screening","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Microwave Technology and Systems for Radar","",""

(mentor); Sijtsma, F. (mentor)","2012","The demand for wireless services and the need for high data-rates are growing rapidly. Future generation networks are expected to provide high data-rates in the order of 1Gbps in local area and 100Mbps in wide area. It is a challenge for operators to meet this rising demand for high data-rates as the radio-spectrum is an expensive and scarce resource. In the last World Radio Communication conference (WRC'07), less than 600 MHz bandwidth has been allocated to mobile communication systems. When considering the total predicted bandwidth demand of 1200MHz - 1700MHz in 2020, it is clear that there is a spectrum scarcity for mobile communication systems. This scarcity arises due to the exclusive allocation of the spectrum among different Radio Transmission Systems (RTS). A further exclusive splitting of spectrum among different operators leads to an apparent scarcity of the resources. While doing so, it should be clear that no operator will suffice in its own to meet the rising demand for high data-rates, when the current traditional way of spectrum utilization continues. Based on the arguments mentioned, the idea of spectrum sharing was born. When the operators share their licensed spectrum bands, they simply will reach higher bandwidths, the spectrum will always be utilized when an operator does not utilize it. Spectrum sharing among cellular operators introduces a new concept of Inter-Operator Interference (Inter-OI). Interference which is a natural result of operating in the same common spectrum band limits the capacity obtained from the spectrum. Therefore, it should be mitigated in an intelligent way. As opposed to other interference generation mechanisms known in wireless-networking, Inter-OI is a problem of two independent networks with conflicting objectives on the common resource. When this conflict is not solved, the advantages may turn into disadvantages. To solve the Inter-OI in the uplink and downlink of the involved cellular networks, there are some considerations that one has to take into account. First of all, information exchange: How much information can we gather about the interfering signals? There are two extreme cases possible: When we do not know anything about the interfering signals, we can make a Gaussian Random Signal Approximation which is not a realistic model of Inter-OI as it can be more severe due to the overlapping-cells of two different cellular networks. When we could get the whole interfering signal structure, we could jointly construct the signal or pre-cancel it in a multi-cell processing-fashion. However, due to the limited information exchange capability of the operators, full information exchange is not desirable. Once the exchangeable amount of information is fixed, the solution should provide enough efficiency to satisfy the operators above their non-sharing case. Furthermore, the solution should provide fairness among the operators. Of course, all should occur within an acceptable complexity. In this thesis, to cover the considerations mentioned above, a possible solution for the uplink-problem has been proposed by the means of a receive-beamforming approach for which the basestations need the Channel State Information (CSI) of the direct channels to their intended users and crosstalk channels to their non-intended users. To capture the needed CSI in this heterogeneous environment, the mobile terminals have been given user-specific pilots which are recognized by the basestations. For this approach, registration to both operators is required in order to capture the CSI while the users get the service from their own operator. For the downlink case, a transmit-beamforming approach has been proposed. The downlink-part of the problem is different. In this case, there are two base-stations, two decision-makers with conflicting objectives. Resource sharing problems with multiple decision-makers are subjected to Game Theory of the Applied Mathematics. Game Theory provides tools to predict the results of selfish and cooperative actions in a resource sharing problem. Instead of applying their best-response strategies selfishly, this thesis has proposed to apply SLNR-based beamforming for the beamforming-dimension of the problem and to apply the power levels in a leader-follower relationship as described in the literature. The needed objective functions have been constructed for the leader operator and follower operator by the means of capacity functions and have been solved as a non-convex optimization problem. The proposed approach has been simulated in a realistic scenario with i.i.d. Rayleigh Fading. The results have been shown to be satisfactory in comparison to the non-sharing case qua efficiency and fairness.","Spectrum Sharing; 3G and 4G networking; Interference Mitigation; Game Theory; Non-convex Optimization; Beamforming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Wireless and Mobile Communications","",""

This thesis describes the implementation of a ratio metric analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for an eddy current displacement sensor interface. The interface which has been implemented by Dr. Nabavi as a PhD project, consists of a low-power front-end oscillator and a synchronous demodulator. An excitation frequency of 20 MHz enables the accurate sensing of targets with only a few tens of ?m thick conductive surfaces. The ADC sampling frequency is 1.25 MHz, which provides an over-sampling ratio (OSR) of 312. The sampling frequency is obtained from the excitation frequency, which synchronizes the ADC and the interface. A ratio-metric measurement approach is applied to suppress the oscillator's noise contribution. The ratio-metric ADC has been realized in a 0.35?m BiCMOS technology and consumes 1.8mW. Measurement results demonstrate a total harmonic distortion of about -85dB, and a resolution of 16 bits within 1 kHz signal bandwidth.","eddy current; sensor; Delta-Sigma; ADC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Van Breemen, E. (mentor)","2012","Philips Consumer Lifestyle in Drachten makes numerous meaningful innovations a year. In the field of wet floor cleaners (combination of mop and vacuum cleaner), Philips has developed a high-end product. To complete the range, the graduation student is asked to develop a low-end wet floor cleaner. Before a product is developed, it is essential to know what cleaning is. Cleaning is seeing that the amount of dirt decreases. The faster the dirt decreases, the more high-end a product is. A low-end product can have lower cleaning abilities than a high-end wet floor cleaner, but it should have advantages over a separate vacuum cleaner and mop. With a price of 70-130 euro’s, and the use of the strong microfiber brush system of the high-end wet floor cleaner, the low-end device is well positioned compared to competitors. Requirements can be divided into must-be (what should a product have), one dimensional (the better a product fulfills, the more satisfied the user), and attractive requirements (this is extra and cannot negatively influence consumer satisfaction). All requirements, coming from earlier investigated subjects, are divided over the categories. Since the must-be requirements should be met and low-end is a demand of the assignment, ideas will be judges on the maximum cost of 130 euro’s. From the six main ideas, only two meet the cost requirement: the vacuum cleaner add-on idea and the spray Swiffer idea (moving cloth over a Swiffer-like product). These two ideas are elaborated into concepts, whereby they are checked for feasibility. In a ranking with the requirements, the add-on concept scores best. After verification with Philips this concept is chosen to go on with. With help of functional models, the functions of the add-on concept are tested. The models prove that the concept can detach adhesive dirt (mop), pick-up loose particles (vacuum) and pick-up liquid particles (dry). It cleans standardized coffee stains from a hard surface in an average 6 back and forth strokes. Furthermore the concept is self-cleaning. With the functions proven to work, a CAD model is composed that includes all the necessary components. One injection mould part, the nozzle bottom frame plate, is elaborated in more detail.","develop; design; concept; low-end; wet floor cleaner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-02-03","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Anderiesen, H. (mentor)","2012","This graduation project was setup as a collaboration between Delft University of Technology faculty of Industrial Design Engineering and Philips Lighting. The project focuses on lighting for demented elderly in a nursing home. Demented elderly suffer from disturbances in information processing in the brain. This causes not only memory deficits and problems in understanding the environment, but also disturbances in the circadian rhythm (also known as sleep-wake rhythm). Sufficient exposure to daylight can restore the circadian rhythm. However, the aging eye requires higher lighting levels while demented elderly residing in a nursing home often do not receive enough light. Previous studies show that artificial bright light can have a positive influence on residents' circadian rhythms, mood and energy levels during the day. The goal of this project is to design a lighting solution aimed specifically at demented elderly in a nursing home, to increase their level of physical activity during the day. A light table was developed, which brings dynamic bright light more efficiently into the eyes of residents than conventional ceiling mounted solutions. The bright light follows a dynamic pattern with varying intensity and color temperature levels during the day. The light table includes objects that alter the table edge ambient lighting when residents interact with the objects. This will engage residents at the table, hence they will be exposed to beneficial bright light for longer periods of time. The ambient lighting also makes the atmosphere in the room more pleasant, because bright light with a high, ‘cold’ color temperature usually creates an unpleasant atmosphere in a room. A qualitative user test was done. 15 residents participated in the user test, of which 8 were in the intervention group, receiving light table prototypes and 7 were in a control group, receiving conventional tables with colored tabletops to control for confounding variables. The effects of the light tables on participants were observed and interviews were held among participants and staff. Early results show positive indications that the light tables have the desired effects on activity and mood of participants. Participants are more awake and communicative while sitting at the tables and staff reported that participants are more at ease and relaxed during dinner. The light tables are accepted well by the participants and they interact with the objects as intended in the concept. Psychology students from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam are currently executing empirical research on the exact effects of the prototypes on the physical activity of participants.","light design; elderly; dementia; activity; nursing home","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

In order to attempt to resolve the challenges, which path will it take? It is the hypothesis of this thesis, that the underlying framework of the city, its streets and public spaces, is the basis for development, because these are a lasting foundation for years. The thesis takes on the perspective of ordinary public places that are meaningful for everyday life. Therefore it is crucial to understand space, the Chinese perception of it and how to structure it. The result of this thesis is a proposal for an alternative urban architectural model that will guide the city towards compact growth, giving at the same time ‘place’ to the millions of new migrants.","placemaking; China; public space; density; air quality; sprawl; Heidegger; perception of space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Vertical Cities Asia","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor); De Sonneville, B. (mentor); Dorst, K. (mentor)","2012","This research focuses on the behaviour of a granular scour protection around piles when the bed is subjected to bed degradation. Furthermore, engineering guidelines are provided to account for bed degradation in the design of the initial scour protection. To address the behaviour of the protection, a physical model is used and to obtain the engineering guidelines, a theoretical approach is used which includes the phenomena that are observed during the physical model tests. As stated by many authors [Breusers et al., 1991; Chiew, 2004; Melville et al., 2000], a granular scour protection around a pile can fail due to several mechanisms. In clear-water conditions these mechanisms include shear failure, winnowing and edge scour and in live-bed conditions two other mechanisms can be added, namely bed degradation and bed form induced failure. This research focuses on the bed degradation mechanism, which can endanger the granular scour protection around a pile. Just like Van der Hoeven [2002] observed during his research on falling aprons, the stones spread evenly over the front and side slopes of the mound, which form after undermining of the protection has led to the ‘falling’ of the edge stones of the protection. This coverage of stones on the slopes of the mound effectively rearmoured the slopes and prevented further erosion. At the back of the mound this rearmouring is not observed, because the high turbulence levels, introduced by both the mound and the pile, caused stones to become unstable in this area. Furthermore, at the front and side slopes, where the slope of the mound was totally covered by the stones of the protection, the slope angles were constant and comparable to the slope angles that Van der Hoeven found in his research, namely 1:2,0. However, a remarkable difference between the observations of Van der Hoeven and the observations of the current research concerns the layer thickness of the protection on the slope. Van der Hoeven observed that the layer thickness after launching of the apron was only 1*df,50 thick, while the current observations show a decreasing layer thickness from the top of the slope to the toe of the mound. The theoretical approach that is used to develop a design formula focuses on the side slopes, where the flow is parallel to the interface between stones and base material. A balance between the volume of the initial protection and the required volume of stones after bed degradation has led to the formulation of the internal slope angle, ?. This angle describes the assumed linearly decreasing thickness along the slope, starting with a certain required thickness at the top, Df,A, to a thickness of only 1*df,50 at the bottom. Because the hydraulic load decreases with increasing distance from the pile and the thickness of the initial protection is based on the maximum load near the pile, the assumption that Df,A is equal to the initial thickness of the protection, leads to a conservative design formula. This approach is however taken in the development of the simplified design formula, which results in a linear relation between the bed degradation and the extra extent of the initial protection that should be constructed to deal with that bed degradation.","Pile; Pier; Falling apron; Scour protection; Flexible protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Koopman, F. (mentor)","2012","The heart of the Baixa de Maputo, the place where the city originated from and which now is both the historical centre and part of the Maputo CBD, is under threat of 1.) further deterioration (socially and physically); 2.) losing its identity to the rapid growth of large scale real estate development and 3.) the quickly expanding number of cars in Maputo. To treat these three issues simultaneously, I propose small scale “acupunctural” interventions aimed specifically at imposing functions on currently vacant sites in the heart of the Baixa. In due time, this will turn the tide of the general deterioration, which is partly due to vacant plots being inhabited by homeless, causing a dirty and generally unsafe environment. Introducing a function of “informal living” on one of the vacant plots offers a solution to both the vacancy of the plot and the dirty environment. Moreover, the large scale property development on the edges of the heart of the Baixa will force only more semi-homeless away from their makeshift homes and onto the streets. Not offering these people a suitable alternative will only further deteriorate the streetscape of the Baixa. By introducing these small scale interventions the character of the heart of the Baixa can be maintained, protecting it from further large scale property development. Encouraging people to live in the Baixa can eventually help limit the number of people having to travel into and away from the Baixa daily. The design can be summarized as followed: to provide a structure for ‘urban informal living’, adapting the informal settlement typology into a dense urban context. Based on four ‘pillars’ (uitgangspunten): 1.) an alternative for living on the streets or far outside the Baixa, offering a place to sleep, work and recreate and thus have people ‘living’ in the Baixa; 2.) to be sustainable and self-sufficient (water and waste), to limit costs and react to the currently unstable water and sewage system; 3.) the growing building typology, typical for the informal settlements on the outskirts of the centre of the city, and allowing inhabitants to start off with a very small home, and building on to it as their wealth and family increases; 4.) to be flexible in use over time, to easily adapt to a new function if first function is not successful.","Mozambique; informal; Baixa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-05","Architecture","Architecture","","RMIT","",""

The research is focussed on the value of use during the Games as well as the post-Games value. The Rotterdam 2028 Olympic stadium fleet can be dismantled after the Games into a floating residential community in the Rotterdam Waalhaven. Other pieces of the stadium can be reused elsewhere as smaller stadiums and single floating housing blocks. The design gives a vision of how a future stadium could be designed with the afterlife already implemented during the design process of the stadium.","Rotterdam; Olympic; Conversion; Housing; Sustainable; 2028; Stadshavens","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-08","Architecture","Building Technology","","Architectural Engineering","",""

The belief in contradiction as a possible way to determine tension in design lead the whole exploration. How an architectural composition can relate to environmental conditions, so how natural and artificial collide, how smooth and rigid interact or how space and time dialogue. Basically understanding the ambiguity of compromise. La casa del Paguro has also been guided by a clear parametric approach that controlled every phase of the design from the biggest scale to the smallest one. A traversal method that tests minor changes in comparison to the overall composition, a rational development of options, a way to systematize intuition, a sort of ritual to guide creativity. A framework of design that is strongly related to its own body of tool both in terms of architectural composition and architectural fabrication. How a fully digital script or a massive foam modeling can determine the formal results or how a machine can impose his presence by radically changing the properties of materials. A biologically understanding of reality that can lead a geometrical inquiry of space through a craftsmanship like idea of Architecture. Finally we can notice how five different topics can inform five different scales reinventing every time the project form within.","biology geometry craftsmanship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-15","Architecture","Architectural Engineering","","Parametric Architecture","",""

This can result in local improvements but decreasing network performances. To optimize the network performances by the implementation of DTM measures, an optimization method is required. Model predictive control (MLP) is a network-wide and dynamic optimization method, but has the disadvantage of high computation complexity what makes the method less suitable for real time control of large networks. In this research a control method is developed which reduces the computation complexity, by transforming the control problem in a mixed integer lineair programming (MILP) problem. The control problem is based on a piecewise affine network model, which represents the traffic network, and is rewritten to a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) model. This model contains only lineair equations and gives a less complex control problem, which can result in lower computation times.","freeways; DTM measures; network-wide control; MLD; MILP; MPC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Dynamic traffic management","",""
