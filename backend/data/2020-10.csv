(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In regions which experience arctic conditions, structures like offshore wind turbines, oil-platforms, light houses, piers and bridges suffer from abrasion by moving ice sheets. This results in challenging maintenance and repair works. At the ice-structure interface, several mechanisms exist which are responsible for the wear of concrete such as: freeze-thaw cycles, chemical effects of sea water, and mechanical loading of concrete. The main cause of concrete abrasion is however thought to be the flow of ice floes together with a layer of crushed ice, which is partly controlled by friction and adhesion between the two interfaces. Adhesion is thought to be the main component of the static friction and is, under certain circumstances, also directly responsible for concrete abrasion. It is yet not well known to what degree ice adhesion contributes to concrete abrasion, and how extrinsic parameters such as: pressure, hold time and submergence relate to the ice-concrete bond strength. This research aims to better understand the physical phenomena happening at the ice-concrete interface by shearing an adhesive ice-concrete bond to get a better understanding of the role of ice adhesion in concrete abrasion processes. To achieve this goal, a double shear apparatus has been designed and ice-concrete shear tests have been performed in a thermal laboratory. The apparatus was designed to be relatively simple compared to conventional soil shearing machines. The design allowed for the ability of submergence, accurate and sustained application of normal load, improved implementation of standardisation procedures, and easy portability. The temperature during the test was remained relatively constant at around - 9° for dry the ice-concrete adhesion test, and around 0° C for submerged tests. The influence of hold time, varying from very short (6 seconds) to overnight, and pressure (51, 316 and 682 kPa) on the force required to break the ice-concrete bond has been investigated following a series of five test sequences. In sequence 1, the applied pressure was remained when shearing the ice. In test sequence 2, the shearing was initiated immediately after removing the applied pressure. In sequence 3, the time between removing the pressure and shearing has been varied. In sequence 4, different materials have been used to clamp in the ice and sequence in 5, both the concrete and the ice has been fully submerged before shearing. The force required to shear the ice has been measured using a load cell. The results show a positive influence of holding time on the force required to perform the shearing, and although a higher normal load results in a higher shearing force, it is unclear what the result of a higher normal load is on the adhesive force. These result are found for both the remained and released pressure tests. The bond strength also appeared to increase when waiting after removing the applied load. Submergence showed to have a negative influence of the bond strength compared to the dry tests. When using a different surface as the concrete specimen, a pure paste surface showed to give the highest bond strength and a pure sandstone surface resulted in the lowest bond strength. The force required to break a bond between ice and a cut-concrete surface, as used in all other tests, was in between the pure paste and sandstone surfaces. All three types of failing mechanism have been observed. And the failing mechanism is dependent on hold time and pressure. Visual observations show an increase of ice stuck to the concrete surface for both higher normal loads and longer holding times. It is concluded from the experiments in this research, that mechanical adhesion theory seems to be the main mechanism of ice-concrete bonding. The failure type of the ice-concrete bond is dependent on holding time and pressure. The bond strength is strongly dependent on holding time and it is unclear what the influence of pressure is on the bond strength. Ice adhesion has many mechanisms by which it can contribute to the abrasion of concrete.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We select log-Mel spectrogram as the audio representation and use two types of neural networks to perform the classification task. The first is the convolutional neural network (CNN), which is the most straightforward and widely used method for a classification problem. The second type of network is autoencoder based models. This type of model includes the variational autoencoder (VAE), beta-VAE and bounded information rate variational autoencoder (BIR-VAE). The encoders of these systems extract a low dimensionality representation. The classification is then performed on this so-called latent representation. Our experiments assess the performances of different models by evaluation metrics. The results show that CNN is the most promising classifier in our case, autoencoder-based models can successfully reconstruct the log-Mel spectrogram and the latent features learned by encoders are meaningful as classification can be achieved.","Deep Learning; Signal Processing; Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The increasing population and the aggregation of people in dense urban pockets adds to the pressures on already complex and volatile global systems. Our systems need to adapt and be resilient to not only natural phenomenon such as climate change or the recent COVID crisis, but also resist socio-economic and geo-political disturbances. The global food system experiences many systemic bottlenecks making it susceptible to such disruptions. The dependency of urban populations on external food systems makes these populations vulnerable to systemic breakdowns. Food is a primary physiological need and essential to survival, and it is imperative that everyone world-over has access to affordable, fresh and nutritious diets. In line with this, this research investigated the potential of urban neighbourhoods to be self-sufficient by the introduction of decentralized food systems into these neighbourhoods. The study focused on a case study site in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. The research employed literature studies, data collection, and dynamic simulations to facilitate the creation of a methodology to assess the extent of self- sufficiency attainable. This research was conducted not only in the current context but also in a 2085 future context, to assess the adaptability of the systems to climatic and social changes. With the intent of a holistic approach, energy producing PV systems were introduced along with the food systems, to address its energy demands. The study concluded that the electricity demands of the neighbourhood in addition to the energy demands of the food producing systems, can be addressed by the PV installations. Furthermore, the surface areas afforded to intervention in the case study site were found to be sufficient to address the part of the diet considered in the study and the energy required to be produced to meet these demands. The study also provided insight into the energy demands of various vegetables and their corresponding yields. However, the study also found discrepancies in the results obtained in comparison to reliable scientific and academic literature.","Urban Farming; Kattenburg; climate change; Decentralisation; Urban; Neighbourhood; Crops; Vegetables; Energy demand; Food; diet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","","52.3731, 4.9193"

Researchers often first segment this abnormality with a neural network trained by voxel-wise labels and thereafter extract the volume. Instead of this indirect two steps approach, we propose to train neural networks directly using the volumes as image-level label and predict the volume directly. Using image-level labels to train automatic abnormality prediction could decrease the labeling burden for clinical experts, which is both expensive and time consuming. In this report, a neural network that consisted of a segmentation part and an appended regression part was compared with the indirect segmentation approach. It was investigated if networks trained with image-level labels have the same performance of image-level prediction as networks trained with voxel-wise labels. The neural networks were trained on a large local dataset to quantify white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden from brain MRI, and their performance was evaluated on a held-out test set. Furthermore, generalization properties were compared by applying the trained networks on four independent public datasets. The networks trained with image-level labels achieved volume quantification that was slightly better than their counterpart on the held-out test set. The attention maps of these networks showed that the networks were able to focus on the surroundings of the WMH, and hence learned meaningful image features. Nevertheless, the attention maps were not suitable to achieve a compatible segmentation. In terms of generalization towards external datasets, the advantage of weak labels for volume quantification did not hold as there was no significant difference between the performance of the label types. The results suggest that neural networks optimized with image-level labels were able to directly predict WMH volume as well as neural networks trained with voxel-wise labels. Subsequently, we also studied networks that were optimized on both image-level and voxel-wise labels. Those networks reached a lower performance, which suggested that the tasks and their image features learned were not similar enough.","Deep Learning; White Matter Hyperintensities; Weak labels; WMH; Robust Quantification; Image-level labels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Performing tasks in dynamic environments is still an open challenge in robotics. To be able to perform a task reliably in such scenarios, the state of the world has to be continuously monitored. In this context, most state-of-the-art perception methods focus on the recognition and classification of individual objects. However, these methods require extensive data collection and artificial neural network training, especially in complex scenes when the number of unique objects to recognise is large. This is for instance the case of retail stores, where there can be as many as 120,000 different products. Applying the state-of-the-art learning methods in this domain is not only expensive in terms of data gathering, but it will also require models so complex that product recognition would be significantly slow. This research tackles the problem of cabinet classification in a retail store, introducing a method to identify cabinets with missing or misplaced products without individual object recognition. Prior knowledge on the layout of the retail store is used to generate an image of what a cabinet is supposed to look like when it is correctly stocked. Taking an image of the current state of the cabinet and comparing this to the previously created image allows for a verification network to verify whether the cabinet is still fully and correctly stocked or not.<br/> This research provides three main results. First, verification learning is demonstrated to transfer well to the retail store cabinet domain, maintaining high speed and accuracy. Second, this work shows that the verification network generalises well to both unseen cabinet configurations as well as unseen products, eliminating the need to include every product in the dataset used to train the network. Lastly, this research shows that verification learning transfers well from simulation to the real world to classify cabinets with missing products. However, this last result does not hold for cabinets with misplaced products, due to the smaller difference between a correctly stocked cabinet image and an incorrectly stocked cabinet image. Furthermore, while the verification network is very fast on the hardware used for this research, it will be significantly slower when applied on the less powerful hardware more commonly found in robots. This thesis represents a starting point for the detection of missing and misplaced products in retail store products, and it serves as a foundation for future research in this domain.","Verification Learning; Deep Learning; Image Classification; Retail Store Cabinets; Data Generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","AIRLab Delft",""

(graduation committee); Huijs, Fons (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","At the moment, offshore wind is an indispensable source of energy. Compared to onshore wind, wind speeds offshore are considerably higher and more constant. Furthermore, offshore wind turbines reduce noise and visual impacts. In contrast to fixed bottom foundations, floating wind can be economically feasible in global offshore waters that exceed a depth of 60 meters. However, floating wind has its challenges. Research has shown that the interaction between floater motions and wind turbine controller can be significant, especially above rated wind speed. The interaction between the hydrodynamics and aerodynamics above rated wind speed is the main reason why fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations are needed to determine the motions and mooring loads of the system. The downside of fully coupled simulations is, next to the need of comprehensive technical background, the high computational time which makes these simulations unsuitable for concept design studies. The purpose of the research is to developed a fast and simplified model that can be used for design iterations in concept design stages of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs). The simplified model must be able to predict the general motions and mooring loads with acceptable accuracy. Moreover, the simplified model should be based upon available wind turbine input data in an early design phase. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the contribution of various physical phenomena, present in fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations, on the motions and mooring loads of the GustoMSC Tri-Floater with a 5MW NREL wind turbine located at its center. The fully coupled simulations are performed with aNySIM-Phatas. By this analysis, the main physical contributors to the motions and mooring loads of the GustoMSC Tri-Floater are selected to include in the simplified model. It is confirmed that the interaction between the aerodynamics and hydrodynamics is significant, especially for platform pitch motions in the above rated conditions. Furthermore, the (controlled) aerodynamic thrust calculated from Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, as well as the wind drag loads are found to be the main driving forces on the system. The simplified model is constructed by coupling an external Python code to the multi-body time-domain software aNySIM. Whereas aNySIM is responsible for the hydrodynamic and mooring calculations, Python is used for the simplified aerodynamic calculations. The effect of the wind turbine controller on the aerodynamic thrust is included by the use of the steady state thrust curve, aerodynamic damping ratios and filter on the incoming turbulent wind. The simplified model is compared with fully coupled aNySIM-Phatas simulations. Compared to fully coupled simulations, obtained results suggest that in a free floating condition the differences in the mean are found to be within 5% and 10% for platform surge and platform pitch, respectively. The mean and maximum differences in the forward fairlead tension were found to be within 2% and 5%, respectively. Moreover, the results show that the simplified model is 5 times faster and much easier to construct compared to the fully coupled simulations. The results of this research are encouraging as the simplified model can serve as a tool to predict the general motions and mooring loads with acceptable accuracy. Also, as Python is not coupled to aNySIM before to the best of the authors knowledge, this coupling opens doors to other simplified modelling strategies.","Floating offshore wind turbine; Time domain calculations; aNySIM; Phatas; Simplified modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Equinus gait is characterized by toe-strike, abnormal ankle plantarflexion and decreased ankle range of motion (ROM). A new ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) with negative stiffness was previously developed to compensate for the increased ankle joint stiffness and improve equinus gait, reducing plantarflexion and increasing ankle ROM. The goal of this project was to predict the effects of ankle stiffness compensation on equinus gait simulations.<br/><br/>Methods: Forward simulations of unimpaired and equinus gait were generated in<br/>the sagittal plane with a musculoskeletal model implemented in OpenSim and a<br/>neural controller implemented in SCONE. After validation of the unimpaired gait<br/>simulation, a sensitivity analysis on ankle kinematics was performed, introducing<br/>structural and/or neural alterations of the ankle muscles to achieve an equinus gait. Consecutively, equinus gait simulations were validated with previously collected data of CP patients. Finally, an AFO model was developed in OpenSim to simulate AFO-assisted gait.<br/><br/>Results: The unimpaired gait simulation yielded realistic results, and was robust to all alterations, generating stable gaits. Shorter Gastrocnemius fiber length and/or increased plantarflexor muscles activations, with Tibialis Anterior weakness, had the largest effect on the ankle joint kinematics and resulted in realistic CP equinus gaits. Simulations of AFO-assisted gait resulted in reduced abnormal plantarflexion, and increased ankle ROM in the condition with shorter Gastrocnemius.<br/><br/>Discussion and Conclusion: This study presented realistic simulations of equinus<br/>gait, by modelling structural and/or neural alterations of the ankle muscles and<br/>predicted improved ankle function when compensating ankle stiffness with an external force. Although higher stiffness compensation and more simulations should be obtained, this study provides a solid ground for further investigation of the AFO effects.

Climate change, urban expansion on floodplains, degraded ecosystems due to human interventions, lack of effective emergency flood risk management plans contribute to flood intensification and risk exposure. The heretofore flood mitigation practices seem to stop short of both mitigating flood risk and providing further economic, social, and environmental benefits. Instead, practices co-working with nature and its physical processes are constantly gaining ground.<br/>Nature-based solutions (NBS) are measures encompassing the ‘co-operation with nature’ approach; mitigating fluvial flood risk while being cost-effective, resource-efficient, and providing numerous environmental, social, and economic benefits. Current progress is working on strengthening the evidence-base of NBS projects through multiple on-going projects. Such evidence would lay the foundation for the mainstreaming and transferability of the NBS practice that will, eventually, lead to its upscaling.<br/>To this end, there is need for holistic and coherent organisation of all the NBS information and approaches acquired in practice. Therefore, several frameworks have been developed in an attempt to map the NBS design and implementation and/or evaluate them using indicators. Contribution of NBS to sustainable development has also been established since the social, economic and environmental sectors, on which NBS have an impact, constitute the so-called “triple bottom line” of the sustainability concept.<br/>Given the unequivocal link between NBS and sustainability, a growing interest recognizes the need to explore a NBS connection to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as set by the United Nations Organization. Additionally, since NBS seek to complement conventional infrastructure, their engineering characteristics should also be assessed.<br/>Therefore, this research project develops a framework for assessing the NBS performance for fluvial flood mitigation. The framework adopts an integrated approach, using indicators for evaluative and benchmarking purposes. Novel aspects of the framework are the direct link between the NBS for fluvial flood mitigation and the SDGs and the introduction of technical assessment indicators. Ultimately, the NBS framework is meant to assist experts in providing guidance for similar projects and contributing to the mainstreaming and transferability of the NBS practice.<br/>The framework was guided by a review of existing NBS assessment frameworks and methodologies, already realized NBS projects, and the UN 2030 Agenda. The assessment frameworks and methodologies worked as a starting point both for the structure and the components of the deliverable framework. Already realized NBS projects were treated as case studies calibrating the literature findings with what was applied in practice. The UN 2030 Agenda was used for developing indicators that address contribution to the SDGs. Finally, the framework was tested by applying it to an already realized NBS project, the Eddleston Water Project (different from the calibration ones), by giving the project metadata as input to the framework indicators.<br/>Overall, the framework performed well as most of its indicators are having indicative data that were found in publicly available references. Expert consultation was needed for acquiring some of the data but was kept to a limited extent as much as possible. Additionally, some overlaps between the needed data per framework indicator were observed that can probably be attributed to the scope and current state of the Eddleston project. Regarding the Eddleston project it was found that meets its initial objectives, contributes to SDGs 1, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 17 while enhances several provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services of the Eddleston Water.<br/>To the downsides of the framework, its testing with only one case study due to the time frame of the project. Furthermore, it was developed and tested focusing on the developed world. Additionally, the link between NBS and SDGs is based on the author’s self-explanation and gained insights throughout the project. Hence, a more experienced person might create different links.<br/>In line with the aforementioned limitations, future recommendations suggest further testing with ranging, both in scale and in location, case studies. Expert judgment could also be used as another testing way by examining experts’ suggestions and willingness to use the framework. Finally, the inclusion of the SDGs in the indicators offer several opportunities: (i) re-evaluating potential NBS-SDG links and (ii) examining framework changes in case of considering the developing world.","Nature-based Solutions; Framework; Fluvial floods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

In this thesis, an overview of quantum computing technologies is provided, along with a practical discussion of the Traveling Salesman Problem, making use of the D-Wave quantum annealer. Subsequently, the main objective of the thesis can be investigated, which is to<br/>explore how quantum computing can be used to aid in solving structural optimization problems. Two methods are developed with which simple 2-dimensional truss systems can be optimized using the D-Wave quantum annealer. The methods aim to find the most lightweight choices for the truss cross-sectional areas while complying with material limit stress constraints. The first method directly casts such an optimization problem into a QUBO format. However, due to difficulties with formulating the stress constraint, this method was found to produce a trivial optimization problem. The second method attempts to symbolically solve a truss finite-element problem, using the resulting symbolic expressions to set up an optimization objective function. Although these objective functions are confirmed to work via classical brute-force analysis, the quantum annealer is shown to have difficulty finding the global optimum solution for truss systems with three or more elements. These results indicate that it is not currently beneficial to use quantum annealing for these structural optimization problems. Nevertheless, some improvements to the method for setting up the objective functions are suggested. The next generation of quantum annealers is expected to perform better for these practical applications, potentially becoming a useful tool in the engineering toolbox.","Quantum Computing; Quantum Annealing; Structural Optimization; QUBO; Truss; FEM; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

By literature reviewing and inquiring biologists, the vital ecological behaviors of Yangtze finless porpoise are identified as movement and feeding, and vital habitat variables are identified as water depth, flow velocity and substrate type.   A previous developed hydro-morphodynamic numerical model was made available and is further developed to gain a better understanding of the changes to local hydrodynamic variables such as water depth, flow velocity. Substrate type, as one of the identified habitat variable from the results of habitat suitability index model, is determined by taking as implified method of comparison between soil critical shear stress and local bed shear stress. Three scenarios are designed to simulate the situation in the dry, normal-water and monsoon season.   This thesis forecasts the changes to the physical habitat quality of Yangtze fineless porpoise through understanding the changes to local hydrodynamic condition and combining the results from habitat suitability index model. Overall,the submerged sills offer limited potential habitat area, slightly extend the high-quality habitat area and improve the existing habitat.     ","Yangtze fineless porpoise; Habitat suitability index; Hydrodynamic modeling; Ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","32.2333, 119.5000"

For some of these tasks it is desirable to look for a robotic solution to either assist the human or even take over that task, e.g. if it is physically demanding, imposes contamination risks or because of economical considerations. Moreover, recently the COVID-19 pandemic revealed even more vulnerabilities in our food processing chains, when seasonal labourers where blocked at borders and some food processing sites turned out to be ""corona hotspots"" with the result that whole food processing chains were disturbed. A step towards solving some of these problems is studying robotic grasping, since it is a crucial skill for many manipulation tasks. This work focuses on force closure grasps for pick-and-place tasks. Since humans grasp novel objects effortlessly, a human inspired approach is proposed that combines visual and tactile sensory information and learns from its mistakes thanks to reinforcement learning. Visual features obtained from an RGB-D camera in combination with pressure information from sensors on the finger tips of the robotic hand are used to set the desired grasp force adaptively while holding the object. A novel algorithm is proposed for learning to grasp with minimal force: LIFT (Learning of Initial Force and Tuning). The novel grasp approach is evaluated in a Gazebo simulation environment and on a real-world robotic setup. The approach results in successful grasping in both simulation and on the real-world setup in tens or hundreds of learning interactions, depending on the size of the state-action space. Success rates of 96.3 % and 96.7 % are obtained in simulation and on the real-world setup, respectively. The results from the experiments indicate that the approach is successful in grasping with minimal force.","Grasping; Reinforcement Learning; Tactile sensors; RGB-D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In a globalized world, the rapid development in digital technologies and finance has enabled the successful growth of Airbnb around the world. The basic idea behind this growth is to take advantage of the underused assets —houses, apartments, or rooms and to profit from them. The spectacular growth in main cities has caused the social fabric of the city was negatively impacted. The diminishing local welfare, shortage in the housing market, and to the need for identifying ways to regulate the operations are the major concerns of local government who perceive Airbnb as a disruptor of the main city sub-systems —social, urban infrastructure, and governance. In this regard, it is important to understand the evolution in the adoption of Airbnb to explain the conditions that enabled the rapid absorption. Moreover, how people perceive houses as a profitable source of additional income becomes relevant in the discussion of commodification of housing. As a result, the connection with gentrification as an urban process that relates socio-economic conditions and the housing system emerges as a possible connection with Airbnb. The available data on Airbnb, households, and houses allows analyzing the potential correlations between Airbnb and the socio-economic conditions. This can help the decision-makers to understand the relationship between the role of Airbnb and the socio-economic conditions of a city. From a theoretical idea about the causes, effects, and facets of gentrification, this dissertation aims to bridge the gap between Airbnb as a socio-technical platform and the commodification of housing.<br/><br/>This study focuses on three main aspects. Firstly, the gentrification theory is revisited in order to determine the dimensions of gentrification that can be measured. The proposal is based on the measurable characteristics of households and housing. Consequently, income as a proxy of socio-economic conditions is used to identify gentrified neighborhoods. Moreover, a set of novel indicators are derived to quantify the main changes in household socio-economic characteristics and housing dynamics. The framework developed can be adapted to different city cases around the world. To study the relationships this dissertation applies the framework to the case study of Amsterdam by using data from 2007 to 2018.<br/><br/>Second, Airbnb has not evenly spread in the city. The concentration in some areas leads to think that there are neighborhoods more impacted than others. Specifically, the convergence of Airbnb operations and the gentrification process is important for finding potential relationships. <br/>The web-scrapped data from Airbnb for Amsterdam is used to make cross-comparisons with the indicators in gentrified neighborhoods from 2015 to 2018. The analysis focused on the total listings, prices, and expected revenue aggregated at the neighborhood level. Additionally, an analysis of the propensity of short-term rentals given the long term rentals is carried out to identify how Airbnb exert pressures in the existing housing system. The geographical visualization of results helps to identify the main relationships.<br/><br/>Thirdly, To shift from the idea that houses are part of common needs to be a profitable income source represents a challenge for urban planners and governments. Therefore, since gentrification and Airbnb are urban phenomenons with potential impacts in the housing system, the research intends to find insights about the link with the commodification of housing. The analysis of relationships between the household characteristics and housing dynamics with Airbnb revenue aims to identify how some segments of the population benefit more than others. In this regard, three log-linear regression models explain the behavior in gentrified neighborhoods, other neighborhoods, and Amsterdam's city. The comparison is carried out using the growth percentage derived from the regressions to make the effect comparable.<br/><br/>In total 30 neighborhoods out of 98 were identified as gentrified by income growth by applying the methodology proposed. The first comparisons showed that gentrified neighborhoods have more Airbnb listings, higher prices per night, and revenue per year. However, gentrified neighborhoods with low and average income show higher revenues than high income. Moreover, the analysis of the price growth reveals that 11 neighborhoods coincide with neighborhoods gentrified by income. Besides, districts of Oost, Zuid, West, and Noord contains neighborhoods with this condition. <br/><br/>The detailed analysis using the indicators show that short-term rentals are unevenly distributed in the city. Further, this distribution is related to household characteristics and housing dynamics. In particular, the short-rentals growth per year is related to the characteristics of household compositions, age, ethnicity, migration, education level, housing living characteristics, property valuation, and property age. Further, the expected revenue per year shows relationships with these characteristics. However, aspects such as the neighborhood level of privatization are inversely correlated with the revenue in gentrified neighborhoods. Moreover, the growth in Airbnb revenue in gentrified neighborhoods helps identify potential rent gaps and opportunities to exacerbate gentrification patterns. <br/><br/>There are relationships between Airbnb and gentrification, which goes beyond the increment in rent prices. The quantitative analysis showed that some populations are profiting more than others because Airbnb has spread in neighborhoods with specific characteristics. For instance, neighborhoods with higher percentages of young-adults of western origin and highly educated are receiving more benefits from Airbnb. Moreover, Airbnb's concentration is characterized by neighborhoods with relatively small living spaces with medium property values. These findings help understand that people in neighborhoods gentrified are getting more benefits for Airbnb. Besides, these neighborhoods are also characterized by high social mobility and small-medium-sized living spaces with fewer private owners. Consequently, rental prices can increase because the housing market is pressured in two ways; by the ongoing gentrification and the exacerbation of short-term rentals. In this regard, people in these areas can perceive Airbnb as an incentive to shift the living house condition to an economic one.<br/><br/>Based on these findings, the municipality needs to revisit the regulation imposed on the whole short-term rentals. The necessity to evaluate the differential impact per neighborhood matters because some specific populations and houses have more propensity for Airbnb.<br/><br","Airbnb; Gentrification; Amsterdam; policy analysis; Statistical Analysis; Socio-economic pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(graduation committee); Verma, T. (mentor); Huang, Y. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Urban cities are growing every day due to rising population, vehicular traffic, immigrants looking for opportunities and to accommodate this, cities are expanding and reshaping at an immense rate. People travel within a city for various purposes but the destination locations are the main reason for the movement. It is proved that locations influence a person's travel behavior. This research aims to study the influence of points of interest on human mobility available within a city and estimation of the travel flow between specified origin and destination locations. The city of London is chosen as the case study and the travel network is the London Rail. The research question this study aims to answer is ""How to estimate human mobility by using points of interest?"". There are sub-questions developed to guide the process of this study and they are used effectively throughout. In literature, there is not much research regarding intracity mobility and not much regarding estimating mobility with amenities/ points of interest (POI). There is research regarding mobility estimations at scales larger than cities and usually, it is travel flows from multiple origins to a singular destination. This research includes travel flows between both origin and destination locations. There are however implications in research that POI data can be used to quantify the influence of attractions on mobility and might prove to be better than the traditional gravity models. This research can help estimate the travel flows and aims to quantify the influence of points of interest in London. A new data preparation framework is designed from various data sources that lay the foundation for the data availability problem. The final dataset obtained contains the following variables: origin population, destination population, origin-destination distance, POI categories such as Commercial, Community, Educational, Entertainment, Financial, Government, Healthcare, Sustenance, and Transportation. For the model techniques, Negative Binomial and Poisson regression multivariate models are chosen. A series of experiments were conducted and the final experiments and the models within them were determined with the help of methods such as Akaike information criterion (AIC) and p-value. The model selection process was executed through a series of experiments to determine the most effective models. The model selection methods include the Akaike information criterion (AIC), p-value, Root-mean-square error (RMSE), and Coefficient of determination (popularly known as R-squared or R2). The RMSE and R2 methods were used to determine the best models among the sets of experiments created. Finally, model validation was conducted using the 'Sorensex Similarity Index' (SSI) method to quantify the similarity between the estimated and empirical data. The models were built separately for each of the days (MTT, FRI, SAT, and SUN) as time could not be included as a variable to the model. First, the process was executed for the day MTT and then it was replicated for the rest of the days. There were not many differences observed between the days as the POIs selected did not contain any difference between the days. If the timings of the POIs were available, then there could be clear differences observed between the days. Limitations and assumptions such as these were elaborated discussed throughout the thesis. The selected models are the first models for both Poisson and Negative binomial regression generalized linear models (GLM) and they perform better than the traditional gravity models. Though the differences observed are minimal, it is important to note that the Negative binomial models performed better on SSI while the Poisson models performed with the model selection methods such as RMSE and R2. The first models performed better using both the model selection and model validation methods. All the first models contain all the variables i.e. all the POI categories including the origin and destination populations along with the distance between them and the Differentiator variable. However, the SSI values are around 0.46 leaving a difference of 0.54 to reach the optimal estimations. This issue is discussed in detail and multiple methodologies including adding additional categorical variables such as economic/demographic indicators are suggested to overcome it. This research achieves the objectives presented in the paper and answers the main research question. The idea that POIs can be used to estimate mobility and they can be quantified within a city is novel and developing a new model satisfies and extends the research for both academic progression and policy implications. Regarding future work, there are limitless possibilities. The research can be extended for other cities, transport modes and also can be extended to other mobility models. The data availability problem is evident in the research and if that issue is not prevalent then the study could have been seamless. The POI categories are created using a subjective ideology and that can be improved using modern classification techniques. For policymakers and urban planners, this can help plan the city effectively and efficiently towards a sustainable future solving many problems such as ineffective traffic models, last-mile hike problem, congestion reduction, inequality minimization, irregular spatial designs, livability index, and much more. This study provides the foundation for a new thought process in Urban Science and it also discusses the possibilities this research could provide if extended further. Urban planning policymakers can understand the importance of amenities on human movement through this research and hopefully, allow them to make new creative decisions regarding urban planning.

This method optimises one of the physical actuator’s command and the angular control demands fed to the vehicle’s inner loop, based on linear reference accelerations. It does so while adapting to varying flight phases, conditions and vehicle states, and taking into account the aerodynamic properties of the main wing. XINCA has low dependence on accurate vehicle models and requires configuration using only several optimisation parameters.

From its historical precedents and roots in vernacular architecture, through its analytical capacity to abstract and visualise the socio-spatial patterns of existing cities, its applicability as a digital design interface mediating between humans and machines, its compatibility with advanced computational techniques to finally its ability to generate bottom-up adaptive urban form, the experiments reinforce the idea that such a design approach could indeed be possible as well as feasible. Throughout, an underlying theme guides the project; a vision of the future city in which generic cookie-cutter urban fabric is replaced by customised adaptive urban forms of tremendous diversity. With it returns local identity, the richness of spatial experiences, increased performance and sustainability, higher density, increased equality and much more. Simultaneously, traditional socio-spatial structures are deconstructed and can be translated to other previously unimaginable forms such as a high-rise row house or a slab functioning as a courtyard block offering completely new possibilities for urban living.

With the slowly declining utilization and production of natural gas in Netherlands, geothermal energy shows a promising future in providing sustainable power for heating and various applications. For majority of economically feasible geothermal project, either natural fractures or hydraulic fractures are present. These fractures served as a preferential fluid pathway between geothermal well couplets, which determines crucial parameters such as breakthrough time and project life. In this study, the main focus is the impact of stochastic distribution of fracture aperture with or without pressure dependence and gravity effect on geothermal energy production. The simulation conditions as well as reservoir physical model are collected from analogous enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)that are classified as deep geothermal energy projects. The test cases include base case, case with no pressure or stress dependence, case with half well doublet distance, and case with gravity that has well positioned in the dip or strike direction in relative to the fault orientation. The ensemble simulation of 100 realization is run for each scenario considered. The relevant parameters analyzed are pressure difference between well couplet, production temperature, NPV, and most importantly, net cumulative energy production. It is found out that the geothermal energy production greatly relies on the fracture aperture distribution with or without pressure dependence. For base case, the range of energy production is from 1.50E13 to 3.75E13 KJ with temperature variation of 35 K between the minimum and maximum value. Without pressure dependence, only pressure difference between injector and producer slightly changes, and production temperature as well net energy pro-duction remains nearly identical. For the case with half of original well-spacing, the spread of energy production distribution reduces from 1.50E13 to 3.25E13 KJ. The diminishing energy production results from less total enthalpy in the flow path with shorter distance, yet the outcome of energy production still demonstrates a considerable range. By taking account of gravity effect and populate the reservoir with non-uniform pressure and temperature distribution with corresponding gradient, the net energy production drops to approximately two times less than the base case. However, the ratio of maximum energy production to the minimum over100 realization is similar to that of the base case. Last but not least, two types of well orientation, along the strike and along the dip of fracture plane, are considered to observe the impact of gravity-assisted flow. It is concluded that with the current model setting, the low temperature gradient of injector in the dip configuration case overweighs the effect of gravity assistance, resulting in a smaller net energy production than the strike case. This project concludes that the fracture aperture heterogeneity is an important factor in predicting the outcome of deep geothermal production. The gravity is another crucial component to portray accurate flow behavior between the wells, but it does not result in additional increase in the range of energy production outcome in comparison to the base come with the simulation conditions applied.","Geothermal Energy; Fracture Aperture Distribution; DARTS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

In the Netherlands, housing associations own and maintain almost a third (2.3 million housing units) of the entire Dutch housing stock and could therefore play a significant role in the reduction of CO2 emissions. To come to this reduction, housing associations first have to choose which housing unit they would like to energetically improve, followed by the decision of when and how. In this decision- making process, they utilize data they have generated themselves to make an informed decision. However, the role of data that is generated by another person or organization is unclear, and even less clear is the role of open data in this decision- making process. Against this background, this thesis explores the role of open data in the decision-making process by housing associations in the energetic improvement of housing units. It studies the approaches housing associations apply in the energetic improvement of housing units, stakeholders of housing associations in the energetic improvement, possibilities and limitations of the available and relevant data to the decision-making process, desirable features of the conventional decision-making support systems and unconventional yet relevant decision-making support systems regarding the energetic improvement by housing associations. The data is collected by reviewing policy documents, conducting and transcribing sixteen semi-structured interviews and observing decision making support systems. The research shows that open data could play an enabling role in the decision-making process regarding the energetic improvement. It informs housing associations about the plans of stakeholders, what is happening in the vicinity of their real estate and explore pairing opportunities. It is very useful to housing associations in a first analysis but might fall short for more extensive analysis. Thus, open data enables housing associations to start using another person or organization’s data in their decision-making process. What is of importance for data analysis is the housing association’s primary data and its data quality. Anyone can analyze open data but analyzing open data in combination with the housing association’s primary data is what makes it valuable in the decision- making process regarding the energetic improvement. In the end, it is not the open data itself which will cause a reduction in CO2 emissions. It is the collaboration between stakeholders in the heat transition which will. The necessary collaboration in the heat transition not only requires open data, but also the acknowledgement and involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process regarding the energetic improvement.","Energetic improvement; Housing associations; Decision-making; Open data; Support systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

Majority of them are facing the same problems: partial vacancy, neglect and poor safety condition, short life-span of housing and pauperization of its inhabitants.Housing offers more than just a shelter: it provides stability (both in terms of economics and in terms of peace of mind), feeling of security and a sense of belonging. Current social system does not always foster the situation of those who are in need. Could social housing be designed in a better way?The goal of the project is to propose an alternative for social housing. Haunted by problems such as neglect, vandalization, safety decrease, high turnover rates, the social housing complexes often seem to be a transit accommodation. Les Goujons, the building at the site, is currently experiencing many of those problems. The project will suggest transforming it through means of decreasing its density, modernisation of existing structure and addition of new functions. At the same time, in order to compensate for the lost units and provide more social apartments, a new housing complex will be designed, complementing the existing one. The neighbourhood will gain more residential buildings of better quality, aiming at their longevity. The introduced strategies will impact also the atmosphere of the place, improving its current state.The two parts of the complex will be working together as one, new composition, interlaced in palpable sense of shared scale, building geometry or materiality, but also in imperceptible sense of atmosphere, community and identity.","Architectcture; Social housing; Mass Housing; Spolia; Urban Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

R. (mentor); Vaessen, P.T.M. (graduation committee); Santbergen, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The factory acceptance tests are extremely important for the deployment and service life of Extra-high voltage transformers (EHV) and reactors. An essential part of such tests is Lightning Impulse (LI) tests which are intended to ensure that the transformer insulation withstands the transient lightning overvoltages which may occur while in service. These tests are usually done with negative polarity to prevent air side flashovers. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for additional positive polarity lightning impulse tests to secure the reliability and life of the transformers. The transformer, during its service life, is subjected to massive electrical stresses due to lightning strikes and switching impulses. As a consequence, this may lead to the degradation of the transformer insulation. During lightning impulse tests, ionisations might occur in the pressboard/insulating liquid insulation system, which would lead to the development of space charges. The space charges generated may have an influence on the withstand behaviour of the insulation corresponding to applied impulse voltage. There is also a possibility of field enhancements due to the effect of space charge, especially when tested consecutively with opposite polarity. During the acceptance tests on transformers at SGB-SMIT transformers, a waiting period of one hour is given between the negative polarity LI and positive polarity LI. This arbitrary waiting time is given under the assumption that this will allow any ’trapped’ charges to decay and provide relaxation time for the slower polarisation processes. So the main question is whether this waiting period allows sufficient time for the decay of charges in the transformer insulation. For this analysis, the relaxation time characteristics of the transformer insulation system were investigated by estimation of the time dependency of depolarisation currents in the oil, paper/pressboard insulation. In this thesis, the characteristic of the time-domain dielectric response and the time dependency of the currents due to depolarisation of charges under DC and impulse voltage was investigated by the polarisation-depolarisation current (PDC) measurements on the test samples. The PDC method is a non-destructive diagnostic method for evaluating transformer insulation in the time domain. A test set up was built to represent a simplified model of transformer insulation comprising of mineral oil, paper and pressboard. The measurements of discharge voltage over time were conducted on the test samples of oil, paper and pressboard to understand the time-dependency of polarisation-depolarisation processes occurring within the transformer insulation. Two dominant time constants of decay were estimated for oil, paper and pressboard samples. The results from the discharge voltage measurement were compared with the analytical solution of the output voltage of the equivalent R-C circuit of the test sample which revealed that there were more than two polarisation phenomena occurring within the composite test sample of oil, paper and pressboard. Later, to mitigate the inconsistencies with the simplified R-C model, it was extended and modified based on the linear dielectric response theory to study the dielectric response behaviour of transformer insulation under DC voltage for longer charging times (tc=10,000 seconds). The modified R-C model was envisioned and developed in PSPICE simulation environment. The model incorporates the effect of the individual polarisation processes occurring within the constituent dielectrics of transformer oil-paper-pressboard insulation. The dielectric properties like conductivity and dielectric response function f (t ) can be estimated reasonably accurately with this modified R-C model. A comparison of the maximum and minimum values of the polarisation currents of the composite test sample obtained from the simulated model and from dielectric testing was conducted. The results demonstrated that relative errors were limited to a maximum of 8 %. The time-domain polarisation and depolarisation behaviour of composite transformer insulation was analysed under DC and impulse voltages from simulations of PDC measurements using PSPICE simulation software. It was observed that for the same thickness of solid insulation, as the oil-gap increases, the magnitude of the depolarisation current at the end of the discharging period (10,000 seconds) also increases. For identical oil-gaps, as the thickness of the pressboard in the composite test sample of oil-paper-pressboard was increased, the depolarisation currents show a delayed response to decay to a minimum value at the end of discharging duration. The time dependency of depolarisation currents at the end of discharging time of one hour was realised for impulse voltages. The study of the depolarisation currents under the influence of impulse voltage revealed that the charge induced field at the end of the discharging period of one hour does not exceed the permissible threshold electric field of 2 kV/mm inside the transformer insulation. In the future, the model could be developed into a valuable diagnostic tool for studying the dielectric responses of complex transformer insulation under the influence of different parameters like moisture content, ageing products, geometrical configuration and temperature.","Modelling; Polarisation-depolarisation; Dielectric response; Transformer; oil-paper-pressboard","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","","","","","",""

(mentor); Langelaar, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Although the field of structural optimization has undergone substantial growth the last decades, the efficiency of the programs used to generate structurally optimal designs for industrial applications remains questionable. To make matters worse, as structural problems become more complex, e.g. by adding multi-disciplinary optimization targets to the problem formulation, the slow convergence speed associated with the inefficiency of these programs turns into a significant issue. Thus, one can argue that there is a need for improvements in the optimization methods used to address such problems. One of the most prominent methods to tackle structural optimization problems is SAO. This method is comprised of 2 steps: approximating locally the non-analytical functions that describe the studied phenomenon and solving the resultant nonlinear optimization problem. This report is a thorough investigation of the function approximation part on a fundamental level, and an attempt to improve the quality of the generated approximation. We start by conducting a literature survey of the state-of-the-art function approximation methods and evaluating their performance - in terms of convergence speed - under various scenarios. Then, we focus our attention to the most widely applied family of approximations (i.e. the MMA) by locating and understanding their inadequacies. These inadequacies are then addressed by proposing a solution that includes the generation of novel mixed approximation schemes that can outperform their constituent members for a set of small-scale, albeit challenging, test problems. Apart from implementing, validating and evaluating fairly different approximation schemes, we also generate approximation selection criteria, whose output is the 'optimal' approximation method for any given function at an arbitrary point. The outcome of this process is an 'Optimization Laboratory' that offers an in-depth understanding of the behaviour of any function approximation method under examination on a fundamental level. It is effectively an object-oriented software library that can be used to compare different approximation schemes on a set of problems, while offering a detailed insight on the quality of any approximation at any given point. Numerical examples that support our assertions are presented, building a strong case in favor of the possible superiority of a mixed scheme compared to its component members, as far as adaptiveness, robustness and total computational cost of SAO algorithms are concerned. More specifically, all approximations used herein are analyzed with a benchmark profiling method. Different sets of initial points, multiple convergence criteria and several tolerances are used in order to obtain an objective comparison between the considered methods. The results of this thorough comparison are summarized in performance profile plots and discussed thereafter. The results of the present research suggest that the generated mixed schemes are superior to their constituent members for the considered problem set. A significant reduction in the number of iterations required to converge to a local optimum was achieved and overall convergence was improved. Even in the most conservative scenario, the best mixed scheme outperformed all others for 46% of the implemented problems (compared to MMA that did so for just above 15% of them). What is more, improved robustness was also achieved by successfully solving 95% of the considered problems (compared to 72% for MMA). However, this improved performance is accompanied by an increase in the computational cost of the approximation process. To this end, an analysis of the relative computational cost of mixed schemes compared to the state-of-the-art approximation methods - in terms of time spent per iteration on the approximation - follows the performance results and a method to estimate the viability of approximation enhancement is proposed. Finally, conclusions on the relative performance of all methods are drawn from the aforementioned comparison and recommendations for further research on improving the performance and lowering the computational cost of mixed schemes are given.","Sequential Approximate Optimization; Topology Optimization; Adaptive Approximation Methods; method of moving asymptotes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-01","","","","","",""

The river plume iswarmer than the surrounding open-ocean waters, with temperaturedifferences up to 1.5 ∘C caused by a stratification-induced barrier layerinhibiting vertical mixing and coloured matter increasing solar energyabsorption. Due to its magnitude, the river plume affects thehydrodynamics and the oceanic conditions in the Western Tropical NorthAtlantic (WTNA) substantially, but its variations on interannual time scales andthe corresponding relation to local sea-surface temperature (SST) are notwell understood. The Caribbean Sea is a region of high ecological value as itis home to extensive coral reefs, which are especially sensitive topersistent high SST. Therefore, this study investigates the interannualvariability of the Amazon-Orinoco river plume and its relationship to SSTsin the Caribbean Sea and the WTNA. It is hypothesised that fresh anomaliesof the river plume salinity pattern are indicative of a more extensivetransportation of the heat contained in the river plume. As a result, itis expected that interannual variations of dominant river plume pathwaysaffect the magnitude and location of anomalous SSTs. To test thishypothesis, model reanalysis fields of oceanic conditions from 1993 to 2017are used to conduct statistical analyses. In this context, the river plumevariability is determined using specific regions of freshwater influenceestablished using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis ofanomalous sea-surface salinity (SSS). Cross-correlations analysis relatingthese EOF modes of with atmospheric processes show that the interannualvariability of the river plume is dominated by wind-inducedadvective transport and -mixing. Strong winds along the Brazilian shelfare related locally increased SSS, while a weak southward component makesfor extensive spreading of the low-salinity plume waters. Additionally, weshow that high river discharge affects SSS east of the Lesser Antillesafter a lag of three months. Through its modulation of these atmosphericprocesses, there is a strong indication that the El Niño-SouthernOscillation affects SSS variability in the main along-shelf northwestplume pathway, with low SSS 1–9 months after a La Niña event. DecreasedSSS are found in phases 2 and 3 of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, whileincreased SSS was observed in phases 6 and 7. However, the evidence forthis relation is weak and should be investigated in further research.<br/>The results show that, opposed to the hypothesis,a more extensive river plume is not associated with higher SSTs in theCaribbean Sea. However, strong correlations are found between river plumesurface area and SSTs at a lag of 1 year. Based upon results of previousstudies, we argue that the river plume has the ability to pre-heat themixed layer in the WTNA leading to extreme temperatures in the followingyear.

Since the 1975-1984 rifting event, there was subsidence seen in the Krafla caldera and along the fissure swarm. This subsidence was explained by deflation which decreased exponentially along the years. In 2018, this deformation pattern reversed, and for the first time since 1989, uplift was observed in the region. Therefore, this work concentrates on examining the change in deformation pattern in the region that occurred in 2018. Four geodetic techniques, a combination of ground and space geodetic techniques, are used to study this change in deformation pattern noted in the Krafla region. Data from 2016 to 2019 are considered as they span the time of interest when the change took place. In levelling, InSAR and GPS, the uplift observed is located to the North of the Krafla power plant. Similarly, there is an increase in net gravity seen to the North of the power plant. This suggests there is an increase in mass/density. A possible reason could be movement of magma from the deep to the shallow magma chamber. The reason behind this start of the magma movement is not known. On the other hand, there is continued subsidence and an increase in net gravity seen in the fissure swarms present to the south of the power plant. This result agrees with the fact that the uplift is concentrated (a local phenomena) in the northern region and there is still subsidence seen in the south. A simple Mogi model is fitted to InSAR and GPS data to understand the cause for this change in deformation. But, the fitted model provided very few insights in this work. The results from modelling mainly concentrated on the subsidence in the southern region and corresponding model parameters were obtained. The location of the source responsible for the modelled deformation (subsidence) is found to be near the power plant. The depth and volume however are not properly constrained. But since the model tries to constrain at deeper depths, correspondingly larger volume is also seen. This outcome strengthens the hypothesis that the source for the deformation could lie at deeper depths. Based on the overall results, the following recommendations are made to enhance the results: i) Maintaining the continuity in the data ii) To increase the number of benchmarks measured near the deformation area (especially in gravity and levelling) iii) Use of multiple source modelling for the better understanding of the sub-surface processes.","Krafla; Geodetic techniques; Deformation monitoring; Uplift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","65.714300, -16.766600"

Nearly one third are unable to meet even their most basic needs that involve harnessing energy for everyday essential tasks such as maintaining livable shelter and food preparation. Models of development have exacerbated the problem by promoting and subsidizing fossil fuel-based solutions that require those struggling to survive to do so at the expense of the environment and other species. This is a self-defeating trap, whereby the urgent needs of the most vulnerable are pitted against climate change and the mass extinction of complex life forms. The only way to break this contradiction is through the creation of a new development system that removes incentives for short-term, destructive profit and puts people and other forms of life at its center. Healthy, sustainable development must be rooted in the fair and democratic allocation of resources. Prioritization of truly life-focused progress would allow for human beings to shape their own destinies through the use of locally available, renewable energy resources that do not contribute to mass extinction or climate catastrophe. While the downward spiral towards extinction may seem unstoppable, in reality, the biggest obstacle is simply coming to accept that the old view of what constitutes positive development – an extractive, hierarchical philosophy powered by fossil fuels - must be replaced with the new paradigm based on sustainability and cultural realism. Once that understanding has been reached, it is a matter of targeting key areas for change that will make the most difference in the shortest amount of time. The project outlined herein is a contribution to that new development system. My carefully selected target will address the energy needs for clean cooking and heating for the one third of the world population that relies in low-efficiency biomass combustion technology. Although such technology may at first seem too modest to make a difference, the impacts of making this simple change would have profound, world-wide implications. If that vulnerable one third of the world’s population could access clean domestic technology, there would be enormous improvements in health and environmental conditions. The Kulkan reactor is a biomass gasifier coupled to a burner that optimizes the combustion process and heat transfer by means of heat recovery using an air pre-heater and partially premixed laminar combustion of the syngas. The novel design was founded on three hypotheses that addressed the optimization of efficiency, pollution minimization by flame quenching prevention, and reduction of ultra-fine alkali particle emissions. The first two were investigated using an algebraic model (0-D), and computational fluid dynamics of reacting flow for 1-D, 2-D and 3-D. The algebraic model predicts an efficiency of [60 − 65%] which is 4-8 times higher than traditional cooking technology and 25% higher than the best improved cookstove ever reported. The 1-D and 2-D simulations show reduction feasibility of laminar premixed combustion and a reduction of flame length of up to 50% compared to non-premixed, supporting the idea of more compact combustion chambers and prevention of flame quenching. The 3-D simulations show essential information on the importance of the pressure drop calculations necessary for the design process of a Kulkan reactor, particularly for the burner. Furthermore, arguments for the third hypothesis are presented which invite further investigation to reduce the ultra-fine particles containing highly toxic alkali metals, which are produced during high efficiency biomass combustion.","biomass; cookstove; biomas syngas; CFD; Combustion; syngas combustion; sustainable development; energy needs; energy for development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The composition of 18 desert sands was analysed by means of X­ray fluorescence and estimations of mineralogical composition were made, after which an attempt was made to melt the unmodified sand samples in a microwave furnace built for the purpose. Melt formation was further observed by melting binary combinations of store bought minerals that were found in the desert sands. The composition data and modelling of temperature-viscosity curves were employed to explore lowering the practical melting of the sand point by modification of the composition through benificiation. `Synthetic benificiated desert sand' was produced and melted based on the results. Glass samples produced were characterized using X­ray fluorescence, visual inspection, optical spectrometry, and fracture mirror analysis. It was found that about half of the desert sand samples assessed contain over 90 wt% silica, making it less feasible for use as raw material for glass due to high melting temperatures and/or large waste streams from benificiation, while sands containing larger fractions of carbonates and/or feldspars will form a melt at less than 1650 degrees Celsius if the SiO2 content is less than 55 wt%. Transmission of 85 % of ~550 nm wavelength light was shown to be possible for desert sand glass of 3 mm thickness if Fe2O3 content is lower than 0.1 wt%, while for the same transmission in the complete effective spectrum of silicon based solar cells the iron content needs to be lowered further. Known absorbing species such as Cr2O3, NiO and CuO were detected in desert sand in trace amounts, but were not present in the synthetic mixtures, the influence of these contaminants on transmission requires further research. Mechanical analysis was inconclusive due to a limited number and low quality of the samples produced, but a review of the literature implies that a Young's modulus of &gt;70 GPa and flexural strength of &gt;45 MPa are attainable in a glass produced from desert sand components.","Glass; ISRU; Desert sand; silicates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

AM also allows high degree of freedom and rapid prototyping for functional part optimization. This has led to a renewed interest in the Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs). FGMs are a class of novel materials designed to have graded compositions or microstructures with tailored properties. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is one of the most widely used AM method showing great potential to produce parts made from Inconel 718, a Nickel-based superalloy.This study aims to investigate the microstructural gradients in Inconel 718 produced with SLM by manipulating the thermal fields acting during the production and their subsequent effect on fatigue behavior. Two different laser powers, 950 W and 250 W were used to develop coarse grained and fine grained microstructures respectively. Ungraded and graded specimens were produced to study the fatigue crack growth in individual as well as graded microstructures under cycling loading. The effect of standard post-process heat treatments on the microstructure and fatigue properties of as-printed (AP) AM Inconel 718 was also studied. The two heat treatments under discussion here are homogenisation + solution + aging (HT) and hot isostatic pressing + HT (HIPHT). Direct Current Potential Drop (DCPD) method was used to measure the fatigue crack growth rates in standard tests to identify the fatigue properties of ungraded microstructures. A new approach of using a constant ΔK procedure was employed for graded specimens to investigate the crack growth rate as a function of the crack interaction with local microstructure.The coarse columnar grains with preferred &lt;001&gt; texture were found elongated along the building direction (BD) and their axis of elongation in the specimens changed as a function of BD. Fine grains were found equiaxed and randomly oriented. HT had no significant effect on this observed trend, while HIPHT entirely altered the printed microstructure. The grain sizes, orientation as well as heat treatments were found to be affecting the fatigue behavior of individual microstructures. Fine grained microstructures showed a slower fatigue crack propagation (by ≈70% in AP, ≈40% in HT and ≈45% in HIPHT) than coarse grained. Fatigue cracks propagated slower in coarse grains oriented perpendicular to the crack path in AP (≈80%) while they were slower when oriented parallel to the crack path in HT (≈75%) and HIPHT (≈9%). The interfaces produced in AP and HT graded specimens were seen to introduce barriers for crack propagation and reduce the local crack growth rate. The same was not observed in HIPHT due to diminished gradients, resulting from grain coarsening.Thus, this study has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using AM to fabricate future FGMs featuring altered fatigue response of the local microstructures.","Additive Manufacturing; Selective Laser Melting; functionally graded materials; Inconel 718; Electron microscopy; Fractography; Fatigue; Fatigue crack propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

The IC is located between the low­pressure compressor (LPC) and the high­pressure compressor (HPC). It exchanges heat between the core flow and the bypass flow reducing the temperature in the core flow. This has the advantage of a lower HPC­inlet temperature reducing the work needed to reach maximum compression. This also reduces the combustion inlet temperature which reduces the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) or increases the power density of the core. The ITB reduces the TIT by transferring some of the fuel to the ITB. This reduces NOx emissions. The objective is to analyze the effect that several design parameters have on the on­design performance and to analyze the optimized cycles to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each. Both the IC and ITB improve the thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) of the cycle. They also reduce NOx emissions. The ITB reduces NOx emissions more because of the extra degree of freedom during take­off. Varying the ITB energy fraction dependent on the ambient conditions has a positive effect on the NOx emissions during take­off at a slight TSFC increase. Combining an IC and an ITB in the cycle does not add the benefit of each for the TSFC but does add the benefit for NOx emissions as it reduces this even more. The IC­ITB engine is thus found to be optimal over the other engines because the NOx emissions are substantially lower than for the other investigated cycles.","Aero-Engines; Optimisation; Intercooler; Inter-turbine burner; Parameter; Analysis; GSP; TSFC, Thrust-specific fuel consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The working of SNNs is temporally based, as the spikes are time-dependent. SNNs have the benefit to perform continual classification, and are inherently more low-power than other Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Both the SNNs and other ANNs need to be trained to perform specific tasks. There are several types of methodologies to train SNNs, but there is yet no silver bullet. Backpropagation algorithms can train other ANNs, but SNNs cannot be trained using this algorithm since the spikes are not differentiable. Methods like Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) or Liquid State Machine (LSM) have their limits. Where the complexity of SNNs depends on the dataset, the number of neurons, and other factors. There were currently no known SNN implementations for the given gesture, achieving near state-of-the-art results. The problem with the dataset is that usually no gesture is performed in front of the . The datasets contain noise, and some data samples belong to two or more classes simultaneously. The objective of this work is to develop an architecture and training methodology, that allows the classification of the dataset using SNNs. This work presents a novel, architectural training methodology Suino, which addresses the above problems. The architecture consists of two components: the first is the spatial classifier, and the second component is the temporal classifier. The frames from the dataset are filtered in the first stage, i.e. the spatial classifier. The output of the spatial classifier is the input for the temporal classifier, which deals with the temporal properties of the data. Suino does not provide false positives, that is the neurons do not spike on the input dataset if the input dataset does not belong to any of the trained classes; hence the method is robust. The training method is built around these components, existing of different classical training methods: backpropagation, clustering, or any other consisting of fixed threshold method for auto label correction. The second stage consists of a temporal classification method, trained using the Tempotron learning rule. The time-series dataset of gestures validated Suino. On the test set, the baseline method had an accuracy of 97.0% with 35K parameters, while the presented method had an accuracy of 90.87% with 21K parameters. Hence, the method is more robust against false detections and continuously performs classification.","Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs)); SNN; training method; time-series datasets; time-series","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

With Transmission electron microscope observation up to subatomic level is possible. Generally, the sample is under vacuum in an electron microscope. But in real life sample is under influence of environmental conditions like liquid, gas, temperature. Development in Microelectromechanical systems has made it possible to make nanocell, which encloses sample and provide different stimuli like gas, liquid, voltage, temperature.<br/>Imaging in liquid environment contains encapsulated liquid, which allows high energy electron beam passes through thin windows. While the electron beam passing through the liquid, the interaction of both splits water and generates radiolysis products. These radiolysis products contain gases, ions, radicals, and other chemical compositions. These products affect the chemistry in liquid and therefore the observations in the experiment. So it is important to quantify these generated species. One of the species that is generated due to radiolysis is Hydrogen ion. Because of this, the pH of the liquid changes. Numerical studies are available to quantify this pH change but species generation data is interpolated to several orders of magnitude and very limited experimental work is available.<br/>The goal of this thesis was to measure pH change due to radiolysis. For this, two problems need to tackle simultaneously, making micro size pH sensor on-chip and trying to find out what species due to radiolysis has the potential to affect pH measurements. Radiolysis generates 15 species for pure water and characterizing all of them is difficult. So here approach is taken to measure species effect just outside the electron beam area, which reduces to only 5 species to consider. Species generation and its effect on the platinum electrode are analyzed. For Ultrapure water, the measured voltage shift was negative and for acidic solutions, it was positive with an increase in dose rate. The reason for this could be the generation of excess Hydrogen peroxide for acidic solutions and generation of excess Superoxide for neutral pH solutions. So it is important to shield the effect of these two species for successful pH measurement just outside the beam region. The optimization code is written to decide the place and thickness of two pH measuring electrodes. From literature, it is found that Iridium oxide has a selectivity of 0.0001 for Hydrogen peroxide. Results from the optimization code conclude that the sensing layer should have minimum selectivity for Superoxide of 0.1, to measure any meaningful pH change outside the beam area.<br/>pH sensing characteristics of the Iridium oxide layer reveals maximum error is 0.4 pH. However, according to simulations outside the beam area, the maximum pH change is 1.34 pH. From the optimization code dimensions of two pH sensing electrodes are decided. Considering maximum error from pH measurement experiments and error from species interference from simulations, an electrode configuration has been designed. The design allows pH measurement for the dose rate 50000000 Gy/s and above for initial pH of solution ranging from 6 to 8.","MEMS devices; Electron microscopy; Sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

For securing a project’s long-term strategic success, the importance of the front-end phase is increasingly recognised. In the front-end, fundamental decisions are made under high uncertainty. One of these decisions is the choice of the project concept. The chosen project concept is the initial idea that responds to the problem/need of the client/owner (organisation). It sets the basis for strategic success, and should be aligned with the organisation’s strategies and users’ needs (strategy alignment). Although the development of project concepts in the front-end has long been recognised to be important, little is known about how project concepts are created and chosen in practice. As the project owner is responsible for the project within the client/owner organisation, this graduation research aimed to explore the project concept creation and decision-making process to identify critical aspects for project owners to focus on in creating and deciding on project concepts in practice for projects related to accommodating organisations. A theoretical framework was developed by performing a systematic literature search on studies about the project owner in relation to the project front-end and strategy alignment. This theoretical framework was used to analyse project concept creation and decision-making processes in two case study projects around accommodating organisations. Data was gathered through performing multiple interviews and reviewing documents. Finally, the findings of the two cases were compared in a cross-case analysis. Here it was found that project concepts are created on different levels/in phases, that take place consecutively or in parallel, covering most of the front-end phase of a project. It is a continues and iterative strategy alignment process where stakeholder management is key. By comparing and discussing the case study findings, three critical aspects for project owners to focus on in creating and deciding on project concepts in practice were formed. These aspects all revolve around creating and maintaining urgency and support for the project (concepts). Here it is first of all considered critical for project owners to understand the hierarchy, culture and history of the client organisation. Secondly, achieving strategy alignment requires project owners to be translational and communicative. Thirdly, who to involve, how and when, are important questions to ask concerning active stakeholder management/involvement and can and should be planned and evaluated in creating and deciding on the different project concept levels.","project owner; project concept; front-end","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

To protect flood-prone areas flood defenses have been constructed. To guarantee that they keep meeting the requirements systematic assessments take place. Since 2017, these assessments are performed according to the ‘Wettelijke beoordelingsinstrumentarium’ resulting in a safety judgment category (I_V, which is the highest safety category, to VII_V, the lowest safety category). The category depends on the difference between the norm and the actual failure probability of the assessed dike trajectory. To determine this failure probability each applicable failure mechanism is assessed. However, the assessment of piping at hydraulic structures does not result in a failure probability. The objective of this thesis is to find a method that can be used to obtain a failure probability for this failure mode. The current assessment strategy for piping at hydraulic structures is based on a comparison between the critical difference in hydraulic head and the occurring difference in hydraulic head over the structure. This strategy has only two possible (non-probabilistic) assessment outcomes, II_V and V_V (instead of the entire range of outcomes for probabilistic analyses). Currently, flood defense assessment is mainly based on the application of fault trees. Another possible method is to use event trees to quantify the probability of failure due to piping. Both methods clarify and relate all sub-events before failure happens, both qualitative and quantitative. The event tree method is chosen because an event tree can describe multiple consequences and is not limited to Boolean operators. To test the probabilistic event tree method a case study of the Marksluis chamber lock was conducted. In the event tree approach the piping failure mode is divided in three main phases: A) geotechnical part, B) emergency response and C) remaining strength of the structure. Three different event tree variants have been designed. Variant 1 (shown in the picture) is rather extensive and serves solely qualitative purposes while variant 2 and 3 are more concise and have quantification of the failure probability as goal. The geotechnical part is quantified using Monte Carlo and FORM analyses. However, the other two phases cannot be quantified with a model. The remaining strength of the structure is quantified by expert knowledge and it can be concluded that the upper limit of the conditional probabilities of structural failure and breach formation is 0.1. For the Marksluis the difference between the norm and the actual probability of failure due to piping is more than a factor 30. This leads to assessment category I_V. By using an event tree approach the probability of failure of different types of hydraulic structures due to piping can be quantified. This quantification is based on both models and expert knowledge. Adjustment of the WBI 2017 assessment procedure is useful for failure modes that cannot be assessed in a probabilistic manner yet. By implementing an event tree approach it becomes easier to think of what sub-events must be assessed and how this can be done in a probabilistic manner.","Piping; Hydraulic Structures; Event Tree; Fault Tree; Structural Failure; WBI 2017; Chamber Lock; Primary Flood Defenses; Probabilisitic Analysis; Risk Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

By using an app, customers can order groceries which are delivered to your house throughout the Netherlands. One of the goals for Crisp as a start-up is to grow. Crisp desires controlled growth, where their operations scale simultaneously with their customer base. The framework for start-up growth from McClure (2007) is used for this research. The challenge Crisp faces is to optimize consumer retention, which can be explained by comparing the acquisition rate and the churn rate (McClure, 2007). To grow the customer base, resulting in company growth, retention needs to be increased. To stay competitive, Crisp needs to continuously innovate. According to Schumpeter (1949), who published the first academic ideas about innovation, companies have to continuously introduce ‘new combinations’ in their product design to remain profitable. Hence, the following main research question is addressed. How to increase the retention of digital grocer Crisp through innovation-based concept design? By internal and external analysis, search areas, or innovation themes, were concluded. From analyzing the company, consumer and collaborators internally and the competitors and context externally, four search areas were defined: transparency, ‘doing good’, engagement and personalization. These trends could be interesting for Crisp for the development of a new innovation for their application. The search areas were used as a basis for the qualitative consumer research. Interviews were held with the goal to validate which search area would be most interesting for product development. Thirteen consumer interviews were conducted, testing four hypotheses matching the search areas. By coding the interviews, categorizing and defining the relationships between the code groups, a grounded theory was developed. The qualitative research resulted in the development of a general model for online shopping, describing the process a Crisp consumer goes through while buying groceries. From this model, the design brief was formulated describing five focus points: creative, personal, transparent, convenient and informative. Afterwards, through a brainstorming session, many selection rounds, critical discussions and design iterations, a concept design was developed for the application. The ‘weekly planning’ is an integration of customers weekly planning of recipes in the Crisp app. It offers more personal convenience, it unburdens customers in a smart way and it is an easier guidance trough shopping. As this concept is designed from direct consumer needs following from extensive consumer research, it could contribute to an increase of retention. Also, a first concept validation round is held amongst online shoppers where retention is positively validated. Lastly, conducting an A/B experiment is recommended for Crisp to measure retention after the ‘weekly planning’ is launched. Acquisition and churn rates should be measured and compared, so the retention rate can be calculated. Also, consumer satisfaction, habit and experience and service quality can be measured to quantify the increase of retention in the real app context.","consumer retention; startup growth; qualitative research; product innovation process; digital application design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The quality of the images depends on the strength of the magnetic field. An MRI scanner with a magnetic field strength of 3 Tesla(T) is pre-dominantly used for clinical purposes. However, with the advancement in technology, and the need to image finer image finer structures, we are gradually shifting to higher magnetic field strengths like 7T and above. One of the major bottlenecks in these systems is the bias induced in the images due to field inhomogeneities of higher field strengths. Yet another drawback of these systems is the increase in power dissipation in the tissues. This is measured by a quantity called Specific Absorption Rate(SAR). The goal of this thesis is to accurately predict SAR values for various volunteers as they may differ from subject to subject. Many homogeneous models have been created earlier to estimate the value of SAR, however, these estimates are often over-conservative and safe which compromises with image quality. A personalised numerical body model is created for all volunteers using relevant information derived from simulations performed on generalized models. Various tissues have to be segmented to create these 3D numerical body models. However, there has to be a trade-off between ease of segmentation and SAR accuracy. Keeping that in mind, it was found that the optimum number of tissues to get reliable SAR estimates is six. A deep learning method was then used for segmentation. A numerical body model was derived for all the volunteers using the deep learning segmentation. An adapted ForkNet, which is similar to U-net in architecture is used to segment these images. The SAR values derived from the predicted numerical body model and the original body model are similar, hence speeding up the process for SAR prediction. However, there are certain limitations of the thesis that can be addressed in the future. Inadequate data remains a major bottleneck for the project, increasing the data should result in improved segmentation, this can be addressed by acquiring more data. Another major drawback of the thesis is the segmentation accuracy, the ground truth segmentation is performed to the best of our knowledge, however, some errors are still present in the ground truth segmentation. The next steps for this project would be to acquire more data, train the data on multiple input sequences, use a 3D network and using localizer images that are acquired at the start of the MRI scan. Nonetheless, the principles established in this thesis confirm that a deep learning approach can be used to create numerical body models for SAR estimates. It also establishes the fact that these SAR estimates are comparable to the SAR estimates generated from the ground truth numerical body models.","MRI; UHF; Image processing; Deep Learning; Numerical Body Models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scope of these studies has remained limited to laboratory size specimens with known crack location and the energy release being investigated on a global scale. The objective of this research is to track the local energy release due to cracking in concrete using AE monitoring and understand the relationship between AE energy and crack energy estimated using nonlinear FE model. This will allow to keep the track of energy release due to cracking and use AE energy as a measure for the structural health condition. The study involves challenges with respect to AE source identification, estimating AE energy at source location accounting for attenuation losses and estimating local energy in the numerical model. These issues are discussed in detail in this thesis and the use of AE in crack monitoring is critically examined. In the first part of the thesis, AE source classification methods including signal-based approach and parameter-based approach are reviewed. The classification methods help distinguish the AE activities due to crack opening from ones related to friction. An approach for signal-based AE classification using the AE signal in the frequency domain is proposed. This approach is then compared to existing bivariate and multivariate parameter-based classification methods. In addition to this, a novel partial power-based method for AE source classification is also proposed. The existing parameter-based classification methods are found to have a similarity of less than 50% in case of bivariate methods and a little over 50 % in the case of the multivariate method when compared to the signal-based method. This is because these methods are unable to notice small differences in AE signals. On the other hand, the partial power-based method has a similarity of about 75 % to the signal-based method. In addition to this, the partial power-based method is much faster than the signal-based approach, thus providing a good alternative to the existing AE classification methods. In the second part, attenuation in AE signals is studied. Experiments on sound concrete and cracked concrete have been performed to study the attenuation in concrete media and through a crack, respectively. AE attenuation due to elastic wave propagation is made under the assumption of a Rayleigh wave and the material attenuation factor (α) is estimated to be 2.473 m-1. Crack attenuation factor (C.A.F.) is introduced to determine the energy loss through a crack. Auto Sensor Test (AST) measurements made during the experiment were used to estimate C.A.F. AST measurements are found to be sensitive to the strain changes within the concrete and are thus able to predict the occurrence of the crack in advance. In the last part, a methodology to estimate the local energy release in the numerical model is proposed and then verified using a notched beam as a test model. A rotating crack approach for modelling is adopted with tension behaviour defined using the Hordijk curve. The proposed methodology is applied to the girder model to estimate the energy released locally. The numerical energy trend thus calculated is compared to the AE energy trend at the crack location. The AE energy predicts the occurrence of the first flexure crack at 90% of the cracking load as per numerical energy. A possible explanation for this is that AE can also detect the presence of the microcracks, which the current numerical model cannot. On comparing the estimated energies released due to AE and numerical model in the flexure zone it can be concluded that the relationship between the AE energy and numerical energy is non-linear. Local energy release trend for AE and the numerical model with increasing load is similar when the flexure cracks are generated, although slight deviations start to occur when the shear crack is created.","Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Acoustic Emision; Finite Element Modeling; Fracture energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most conventional energy recovery method is incineration, which takes place at a waste-to-energy plant. The incoming waste is collected in a bunker, where an overhead crane stacks and mixes the material before feeding it to the furnaces. The more homogeneous the waste reaches the furnaces, the more stable the incineration process. In automated mode, crane movements are controlled by the generation and execution of crane orders. <br/><br/>The waste crane scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program, describing the scheduling of crane orders based on order characteristics such as type, origin and destination. The objective of the problem is to optimise the crane performance, which is interpreted as the minimisation of the total crane driving time while performing as many mixing orders as possible. <br/><br/>In the base model, simulated order schedules are resequenced. Given the type, origin and destination of the orders, the starting times are reconsidered. The obtained reductions in total driving time compared to the simulation model vary from 2% to 7%, depending on the crane strategy, whether stacking or mixing is allowed, and the maximum time between the generation and completion of feeding orders.

Under aerobic conditions, the bacteria present degrade the organic matter, whereby the concentration of dissolved oxygen may be lowered. Thus, issues experienced in the investigation area (the Port of Hamburg) are hindered construction operations, increased greenhouse gas emissions and the echo-sounding equipment used for sonic-depth finding for ships possibly showing an erroneous depth. The purpose of this investigation was to find out how gas generation and respiration relate to the basic sediment properties and what mathematical model with the highest accuracy can predict gas generation and respiration (separately), while maintaining within a given (precision) error (1%). Gas pressure was measured at the TU Delft for an incubation period of 100 days, which was later used to calculate the gas generation (mg C/g DW) with the use of the ideal gas law. Statistical methods used to analyze the data were: Pearson’s correlation coefficient, multiple regression analysis, adjusted coefficient of determination and error analysis. The results show that both gas generation and respiration have the highest Pearson’s correlation coefficient with TOC. Furthermore, in the multiple linear regression, gas generation had the highest coefficient of determination in a regression between TOC as the primary parameter and iron content (in solids) as the secondary parameter (푅2=0.91495). For respiration, it was displayed in a regression between TOC (as the primary parameter) and copper content in the solids (as the secondary parameter) (푅2=0.881). This concludes that organic matter degradation is driven by the quantity of organic matter. The residual sum of squares showed a decrease from the linear (and non-linear) model to the multiple linear regression model. The prob&gt;|t| value (which determines the probability of error for the multiple linear regression) was much lower than 1% for all parameters in both the gas generation and respiration model, so it can be deduced that the variables are contributing to the model in a statistically significant way. Together with the previously mentioned highest coefficient of determination, the most accurate model for both gas generation and respiration found in this investigation was the multiple linear regression model, although the model for gas generation presented little difference to that of the simpler non-linear model. The exponential nature of the optimal fit for the data suggests that there is a threshold. In areas with low organic matter content, the organic matter present is much less degradable, falling into the “slow” pool category. It is recommended to investigate other mathematical models further. There is a possibility of a more accurate model (possibly a combination of a linear and non-linear model) for both gas generation and respiration which can model the parameters even better (higher coefficient of determination while still remaining within the permitted range of error). Furthermore, it is recommended to find out why the samples listed in tables 6 and 10 deviate more than accepted from the calculated value.","organic sediments; multiple linear regression analysis; total organic carbon","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","BIOMUD","53.5511, 9.9937, 51.9963, 4.3759"

Getting a well-working urban freight system is one of these underexposed challenges, where there is still a lack of knowledge and awareness among them. Current freight policies are insufficient to tackle the increasing negative externalities due to lack of knowledge and awareness on urban freight and measures. The problem of increasing urban freight activities in cities can be considered as a generic problem, however, it will need different solutions, dependent on the characteristics of each urban area. With the Rotterdam-The Hague Metropolitan Area (MRDH) as a case study, the project aims to develop a strategic framework for local authorities to accommodate the increasing logistic demand of retailers while reducing negative transport externalities. The research has proposed a two folded solution for the spatial organisation of urban freight: urban consolidation (bundling flows of freight) and urban multimodality (using multiple modes). Based on the strategic framework and design proposals, it can be concluded that changing the spatial organisation of urban freight could potentially reduce the number of freight kilometres in the MRDH and thus negative externalities. There is a huge potential for urban multimodality (especially on the water) when integrated into urban freight strategies. A well-considered allocation of urban consolidation centres and other proposed nodes can create several synergies and strengthen this potential. Proposed interventions contribute to the liveability of the city by reducing the number of trucks in ‘vulnerable’ urban areas. Ultimately, the strategic framework gives new perspectives of urban freight to local authorities and can be environmental, social en economical beneficial and improve liveability.","urban freight; urban consolidation; urban multimodality; strategic framework; urban consolidation centre; liveability; MRDH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.9244201, 4.4777325"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Paris Agreement, which calls for countries to channel their efforts to limit global warming would require the deployment of large scale offshore wind energy in the North Sea. This includes the possibility of developing offshore infrastructure for deploying offshore wind power generation with installed capacity ranging from 70 to 150 GW by 2040 and increasing up to 180 GW by 2045. Presently, the Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based - High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission is considered the most suitable for transfer of offshore wind power from distant offshore wind farms (OWFs) to the onshore system. Amidst the available VSC topologies, Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC) topology is the most appropriate solution for the transfer of offshore wind power to onshore systems due to their enhanced performance during offshore and onshore disturbances. However, the currently deployed state-of-the-art MMC-HVDC transmission has a maximum capacity of 1.2 GW. Compatibility of this available technology for complex systems, with the working of parallel units contributing to the increase in power transfer capacity is still unknown. Hence, this demands the development and analysis of a generic model with parallel operation of MMC-HVDC transmission systems to transfer the bulk amount of power from large scale OWFs. <br/><br/>Additionally, the implementation of large scale offshore networks leads to an increase in the penetration of power electronic (PE) converters in the electrical power system. The increase in PE converters causes technical challenges (e.g. due to unprecedented fast dynamic phenomena) related to voltage and frequency stability, and power flow coordination in the power system. In OWFs, the currently available current injection-based voltage control for PE converters are not suitable for voltage control in large scale PE dominated systems due to the absence of continuous voltage control and ineffectiveness during islanding. Moreover, in such power systems, the conventional controllers are not suitable for frequency control due to the absence of dynamic frequency control. Therefore, better control strategies are required in large scale offshore networks to enhance the dynamic characteristics of the power system. <br/><br/>Conventionally, the OWFs are coupled to an AC collector platform through 33 kV High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) cables. The voltage is stepped-up to 145 kV at the collector platform, and power is transferred to the offshore converter station using 145 kV HVAC cables. However, in the upcoming projects, the rated voltage levels are expected to increase from 33 kV to 66 kV to avoid the use of such a collector platform and directly transfer power from OWFs to the offshore converter station using 66 kV HVAC cables. Hence, it would be better to understand the performance of large scale offshore networks developed with 66 kV voltage rating. <br/><br/>This thesis proposes a digital twin model of a 2 GW offshore network with the parallel operation of two MMC-HVDC transmission links connecting four OWFs to two onshore systems representing a large scale power system. The MMCs are connected to a common bus on the AC side of the network, with one MMC creating the voltage reference for the common bus and the other MMC following this reference. Additionally, to mitigate the challenges corresponding to voltage and frequency stability in large scale offshore networks, a Direct Voltage Control (DVC) strategy is implemented in the Type-4 Wind Generators (WGs) representing the OWFs. After analyzing the need for 66 kV HVAC transmission from the OWFs to the offshore converter stations, a 66 kV offshore network is developed to achieve 2 GW offshore wind power transfer. The electrical power system is developed in the power system simulation software, RSCAD Version 5.011.1, in order to perform Electro-Magnetic Transient (EMT) based simulations. <br/><br/>Initially, a single OWF with DVC implemented in the WG connected to an AC equivalent system is modelled to test the performance of DVC in a digital twin of a 66 kV HVAC network. The DVC provides continuous voltage control that improves the dynamic performance of the power system. As mentioned in most of the grid codes, the important requirement of reactive power injection by the OWF during dynamic conditions is satisfied by the controller. DVC also avoids the need for an external controller to perform such an action. To validate the working of the implemented DVC in RSCAD, a similar 66 kV HVAC network with the benchmark DVC model is developed in DIgSILENT PowerFactory 2019 SP2 (x64), for EMT simulations and tested under severe dynamic conditions. Both the models provide similar results, confirming the validation of the RSCAD model. Moreover, the RSCAD model provides a better representation of the real-world operation. <br/><br/>To achieve the overall goal of developing a 2 GW offshore transmission network, a hybrid system with the hub-and-spoke principle is utilized in this thesis. The 2 GW offshore network is achieved by a modular approach, connecting four OWFs to a common bus, to which two MMCs are connected in parallel. The coordination between the implemented DVC in WGs and the control structures in MMCs is evaluated for different scenarios in the network. The performance of the 2 GW network in terms of short-term voltage stability and power flow during severe dynamic conditions in the grid is analyzed. The two most severe dynamic conditions chosen for assessment are; the disconnection of one OWF, and a three-phase fault in the middle of an HVAC cable. In the analysis, it is observed that even after the loss of generation from one OWF, the voltage at Point of Common Coupling (PCC) of other OWFs remains stable within the tolerance limit of $\pm$ 10 \%. Additionally, the loss of generation decreases the active power flow in MMC-1 since it is the one that creates the voltage reference. The power flow in MMC-2 is maintained with the corresponding active power reference. For the event of a three-phase fault, the OWF is islanded by the operation of a circuit breaker. During this event, with implemented DVC, the important requirement of reactive power injection from the islanded OWF as stated in most of the grid codes is achieved. This leads to the conclusion that the voltage control in MMC-1 provides the voltage reference in the network during the pre-fault and post fault conditions. However, DVC implemented in the WGs of OWFs take up the role of providing the voltage reference at corresponding PCCs when the OWFs are islanded from the network during the time of the fault.","Offshore Wind Farm; Direct Voltage Control; EMT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

It influences the way we live, love, and work. Offices are empty while people work from home. When, and if people are going to work in an office again like they were used to, is the question. The events of 2020 are an extra showcase that the way we use offices is subject to change. Therefore, offices should be designed in a way that they are adaptable, reusable, and can respond to changing needs. Circular design can help to make our offices future-proof. However, since the circular economy gained attention in the office building sector, only limited progress has been accomplished. A problem within the office building sector is that insight into the possibilities of circular design is lacking. Moreover, in literature there is no circular design model specific for the building industry. Therefore, this research aims to develop a decision support tool that stimulates the communication between client and designer and provides clarity about the possibilities of circular design. This resulted in three main insights. First, a building consists of different layers with different lifespans that should be able to be refurbished, replaced, and recycled without damaging other layers. Consequently leading to an extended lifespan of the complete building and increased adaptability and reusability. Second, practical circular interventions can be categorized into four themes which are based on circular theory. Those themes are adaptability, reusability, materials, and process. Third, decisions regarding circularity should be taken early in the design process. Especially when the lifespan of the building layer is long. Understanding which possible interventions could be taken in what stage of a design process helps prioritising them and thus creating windows for circularity.","Circular Economy; office building sector; Design for Circularity; Decision Support Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-22","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The hydraulic performance of the CB walls depends on the flow rate (discharge) through the wall. Therefore, the walls must achieve very low hydraulic conductivity. Poor in-situ hydraulic performance of these walls due to construction and post-construction defects may lead to surface settlements, groundwater contamination, and instability of the construction. This thesis investigates the range of in-situ hydraulic conductivity values of CB walls installed within the Netherlands. To achieve this, pump data for the various projects (Westerschelde Tunnel, A2 Motorway at Best, Motorway A4 Delft-Schiedam, Griftpark Utrecht, and Richard Hageman Akwadukt) were analyzed to determine the discharge through the walls. The in-situ hydraulic conductivity of the walls was calculated by Darcy’s law using groundwater level data and dimensions of the walls. The CB walls must be ""keyed"" into an underlying low permeable layer (aquitard), so that seepage of water through the aquitard is prevented. It was difficult to compute the in-situ hydraulic conductivity of the CB walls for Motorway A4 Delft-Schiedam and Griftpark Utrecht. The reason was that the walls in these projects were embedded in a permeable aquitard, which affected the total discharge value. The calculated in-situ hydraulic conductivity values were compared with the required hydraulic conductivity values and laboratory test results. In most of the cases, the in-situ hydraulic conductivity values of the walls were larger than the values acquired from the laboratory samples. The reason is that the estimation of the hydraulic conductivity of the CB walls from laboratory tests was based on small sample areas. This remains unreliable to evaluate the field performance of the CB walls. The average hydraulic conductivity of the CB walls at Richard Hageman Akwadukt was required to be less than or equal to 1·10-9 m/s. The calculated hydraulic conductivity values of the CB walls for the northern and southern polders were approximately 2.5·10-9 m/s and 2·10-8 m/s, respectively. This study also shows that the hydraulic performance of the CB walls is mainly affected by insufficient connections between the panels. Also, the impact of the defects on the discharge through the wall has been investigated by developing a threedimensional numerical groundwater flow model using MODFLOW. Simulations were performed for different types of defects, such as fully and partially penetrating windows, insufficient embedment, and connection between the panels of the CB walls. The results of the simulations indicated that fully penetrating windows have more impact on the discharge through the wall compared to partially penetrating windows. Partially penetrating windows with a hydraulic conductivity lower than 1·10-6 m/s are often insignificant. The size of a fully penetrating window also plays an important role. The difference in discharge (ΔQ) was calculated by subtracting the discharge through a perfect wall and imperfect wall (Qimperfect - Qperfect). The (ΔQ) through a CB wall with a window whose area is equal to 1 m2 can increase by a factor of 10 compared to a window whose area is equal to 0.1 m2. The location of the defects has no impact on the discharge through the wall. The simulations also show that the flow rate is unaffected by the embedment depth of the wall, but it must be ensured that the wall is in direct contact with the aquitard (low permeability soil layer). The vertical deviation of panels also affects the discharge through the wall. The MODFLOW results can be used to get an indication of the increase in discharge caused by various types of defects. From this, the possible defects for a particular project can be determined.","Cement-Benonite; Hydraulic Conductivity; MODFLOW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-29","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van Schijndel, Jielis (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Objective: Static long-term decision-making processes for road assets adaptation on the dynamic effects of climate change seem to be ineffective because the proposed proactive measures might not address the actual climate at the fixed date the decision-maker imposes them to be implemented but by giving a time range of expected implementation in the future by following the actual evolvement of climate seems to be much more beneficial. This research recognizes that a methodology for dynamic planning is needed and a study of the climate variables that are correlated with and affect the road tunnel systems in the Netherlands is carried out. Research's main goal is to develop a structured methodology for long-term road tunnel adaptation on the effects of climate change in a dynamic rather than a static way, proposing multiple adaptation actions of increasing robustness and time range of expected implementation in the future, avoiding fixed date ones. Method: The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach was chosen because it is the model that realizes dynamic long-term decision-making by proposing strategic pathways of actions. This research investigated the 6 out of 10 DAPP steps and executed them through known methods and tools in three phases. Firstly, the identification and analysis of the climate variables that were correlated to road tunnels are conducted. Phase I started with the Function Breakdown Structure analysis of a road tunnel system defining functional requirements, the Hamburger model for functional decomposition, and Fault Tree Analysis for function failure modes identification was conducting. Additionally, quantification of the failures in unavailability rate terms and qualitative analysis of the corresponding impact on six organization values were executed. Then, in Phase II, the definition of adaptation measures for road tunnel unavailability prevention and consequences mitigation was carrying out and visualized through BowTie analysis diagrams. Finally, in Phase III, the modeling of the adaptation strategy for cause prevention and impact mitigation was presented in DAPP maps. Result: The ongoing climate change in the Netherlands showed that changes in several climate variables affect some primary road tunnel infrastructure functions in an analysis until 2100. By implementing DAPP, I was able to define and conclude to simpler and more compact decision-making plans dealing with deep uncertainty over longer timeframes. These adaptation plans for cause prevention and impact mitigation can be applied regardless the actual climate conditions. In the DAPP methodology, the actual climate conditions indicate the moment the proposed adaptation actions are taken and consequently time flexibility is achieved. The research results seem more effective than the ones of the currently applied decision-making practices. The added value of the DAPP approach lies in its flexible character compared to the to date practices, which mainly define robust adaptation actions that deal with any extreme future and propose strict implementation times. With DAPP, a decision-maker can propose actions of different robustness, that can tackle the same issue by allowing him to select the desired robustness considering the implementation timeframe. As far as the impact mitigation is concerned, the DAPP approach helps a decision-maker to define multiple mitigation actions, which deal with the same function impact and to select the most appropriate. This selection depends on the scoring of the mitigation actions regarding their individual contribution on impact mitigation. Therefore, a useful decision-making methodology for long-term road tunnel assets adaptation, led by environmental changes, was established.","Dynamic Adaptation Policy Pathways; Road Tunnel; Long-term Planning; Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty; Climate Change Adaptation; Stretegic Maps","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Among more than 1000 available wood species which could be potentially applied as engineered wood, tropical hardwood takes up a significant portion and has advantages of high mechanical resistance and remarkable biological durability against micro-organisms compared to coniferous species and European grown hardwood. Okan has been part of this development, as a hardwood species mostly from the West African regions.The objective of this thesis is to investigate the strength influencing features, calculate corresponding characteristic values and establish the correlation between the influencing factors and the bending strength with the least deviation and create a representative Okan strength predicting model. Abstracted from literature and dataset, geographically speaking, climate, precipitation, soil quality, water sources are expected to have varying degrees of impacts on mechanical properties. From the material perspective, knot ratio, fiber orientation (slope of grain &amp; ring angle), moisture content, density, Modulus of elasticity (dynamic, static) are important factors. Several experiments about hardwood bending strength have been conducted. However, none of those focus on the growth ring angle and the 3D effect of the fiber orientation. To dive deep into Okan, a series of laboratory tests are conducted, including non-destructive inspection, a four-point bending test on 20 beams (10 stored in the dry condition, 10 stored in the wet condition) with the assistance of digital image correlation technology [DIC]). Except for the regulated experimental procedure, two innovative visual inspection methods based on image processing via Matlab were conducted and verified, which turns out the automation method has preferable efficiency and precision. However, this method could hardly identify compression failure. To avoid the compression failure, beams with the dynamic modulus of elasticity less than 18500 N/mm^2 are supposed to be checked again by the inspector. All possible influencing factors are well determined by the above-mentioned testing.Influencing factors of the fracture section form could be concluded from the observation of damaged samples. The slope of grain and growth ring work together to determine the form of the governing crack section. From the experimental outcome, it is clear to observe the linear correlation between mechanical properties and moisture content grouped by the slope of grain. Constant k= 0.13 for bending strength is found, k = 0.05 is found for dynamic modulus of elasticity. The experimental results yield the following adjusted characteristic values: bending strength 63.56 N/mm^2, dynamic modulus of elasticity 21134.55 N/mm^2, density 866.58 kg/mm^3. Based on 20 beams, this batch of Okan could be graded to D55 which is higher than D30-D35 yielded from the dataset. Besides, Okan beams from Gabon could also be graded into D55. Current European standards advise that the reasonable slope of grain range for tropical hardwood is 0 to 0.1. Through the calculation of the theoretical slope of grain of the dataset and experimental samples, increasing the threshold of the slope of grain to 0.3 should be considered in the testing program. Further promotion to 0.2 doesn’t improve the grading outcome and even worsen it.The linear regression result of modulus of elasticity and bending strength is more preferable than density and bending strength in literature and experimental results, which proves the modulus of elasticity is a good indicator of bending strength. Large scatter happens in the regression of the Hankinson formula. In the combination of two basic models, the new proposed model has an optimized coefficient of determination (R^2 = 0.685). The distribution function of the bending strength of the dataset has preferrable overlapping with the theoretical bending strength calculated from the new strength model. To keep the model on the safe side, a safety factor y = 0.9 is applied.It is still unclear if the growth ring angle has a clear numerical relationship with mechanical properties. However, the growth ring angle does bring apparent influences on the form of the fracture section. The 3D effect of fiber orientation needs further investigation.","Tropical hardwood; Grading; Visual and machine grading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polymersomes could be useful in the treatment of cancer as carrier to deliver and release drugs or radionuclides to tumours locally to reduce them without damaging healthy tissue. For this purpose, it could rely on the Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect to accumulate in tumours, which requires a long blood circulation time. Reports have shown that while the circulation half-life in healthy mice is in the order of hours, it decreases to the order of minutes in diseased mice, preventing any uptake of polymersomes in tumours. So, more research needs to be done on the in vivo biodistribution for each type of polymersome to assess whether it is suitable for radiotherapy. Thus far, imaging for polymersome in vivo biodistribution mostly relies on the use of In-111 and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) as imaging technique. In this report it is researched whether it is possible to load gallium-68 (positron emitter, half-life 67.71 min) into poly(1,2-butadiene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) {PBd(1800 g mol<sup>-1</sup>)-b-PEO(600 g mol<sup>-1</sup>)} polymersomes using an active loading method, which has not been done so far. This would allow short-term imaging using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as an alternative imaging technique. PET has a much higher sensitivity than SPECT, which allows better image quality or shorter scan times. These advantages make PET better than SPECT for clinical use.Using Ga-68 as the positron emitting source has the advantage on being able to rely on a germanium-68/gallium-68 generator to produce Ga-68 on-site and being independent of external radionuclide suppliers.In this report the pH dependency of the formation of complex of Ga-68 with a lipophilic ligand was researched, the transfer of Ga-68 from the lipophilic ligand to a hydrophilic chelator was optimised, and loading experiments of Ga-68 into polymersomes were conducted. It was demonstrated that it is indeed possible to load Ga-68 into polymersomes, and maximum loading efficiencies of up to 36% were found. It is argued that the low loading efficiency could be caused by an unexpectedly thick hydrophobic bilayer of the prepared polymersomes, and possibly by a low amount of encapsulated hydrophilic chelator compared to the applied amount of lipophilic ligand. But more research needs to be done to confirm these observations.","polymersome; gallium-68; loading; PET","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

More specifically, the communication between the human driver and automation during the automated driving modes (Long Out of the Loop and Standby modes) has been investigated to answer the knowledge gaps of mode confusion, transparency, and information load. The project was supervised by SWOV, the Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research.<br/>The project approach refers to a double-diamond structure which includes firstly, context research as background knowledge about autonomous driving and HMI. Secondly, an extensive user research involved experts, drivers, and human factors as the core of the study. Thirdly, an Experience Journey Map was developed to set bases for the design definition and Functional requirements, and HMI qualities. The design goal for the project has been based on the research results, aiming to unobtrusively inform drivers about automation status, driving mode and their responsibilities during autonomous driving mode through the HMI, while the driver is performing non-driving related activities. The HMI concepts have been developed according to iterative conceptualization and evaluation phases to conduct experiments with participants evaluating lo-fi prototypes about singular interactions and design elements, collecting conclusions, and highlighting strengths for each concept. Those helped to put together a final concept that includes the best elements of previous phases.<br/>The final design proposal is a holistic experience that incorporates together different HMI options such as ambient lighting, central display, variable windshield dimming, the windshield visual effects and haptic feedback in order to create a complete experience to test with a sample of participants. <br/>The final user tests have been conducted digitally with participants who evaluated the interface of automated driving modes while participants were asked to focus on secondary tasks. The tests showed that the ambient lighting (together with adjustable windshield dimming) of the vehicle certainly helps to set the driver’s mindset and support secondary tasks. The messages on the windshield and 3D glow effects obtained good results in terms of transparency. Drivers, indeed, understood more information about road situations and automation behavior. This encouraging results open horizons to new applications about ambience and visual information. Globally, the new information presented to participants was perceived as pleasant, informative and unobtrusive. Participants accepted the new HMI options with confidence and enthusiasm, although, some aspects of the central display were not fully understood in terms of usability. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the design research conducted in the first part of the project brought a fresh view of the user’s perspective. The insights from the human-centered design approach are extremely useful to investigate the communication to establish between humans and automation.

The commercially available image-guided FUS device for neuromodulation setups are normally bulky, by employing an 1-D array transducer element to produce the FUS and a separate ultrasonic scanning device for B-Mode imaging purpose. Aiming to design a wearable neural stimulating device for human's vagus nerve, a miniature device with 2-D array transducers is proposed to replace the conventional setup as it can statically generate FUS. The device is capable of locating the vagus nerve and non-invasively stimulating the nerve by integrating the imaging system and the neural modulation system together. In typical neuroFUS applications, an ultrasound image is obtained prior to neuromodulation, to obtain the precise coordinates of the nerve. This project presents a front-end CMOS circuit for the 2-D array ultrasound-based system for imaging the vagus nerve, as a part of the full system for the neuromodulation capabilities. The imaging signal chain enables the local digitization, allowing a robust digital beamforming and readout signal.<br/>The front-end CMOS circuit mainly contains three functions: the low-noise amplifier (LNA), time-gain-compensation (TGC) function block and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The front-end received chain employs the power- and area-efficient design consideration, interfacing the 12 MHz piezoelectric signal from the PMN-PT transducer element. The mixed signal system is implemented in 0.18 micrometer TSMC CMOS technology and operating under the 1.8 V voltage for both analog and digital supply. The analog front end (AFE) has the variable voltage gains up to 62 dB to interface the 1 V full scale range of the ADC. For ultra low power and chip area considerations, the ADC topology is a 6-bit single-ended common-voltage based successive-approximation (SAR) ADC with the typical sample rate 50 MS/s. The SAR ADC consumes 415.8 microW and achieves dynamic performances of 37 dB SNDR and 49.4 dB SFDR. The total power consumption of the signal chain is 1.3 mW and the layout chip area consumes 150 micrometer square.","ultrasound neuromodulation; receive digitization; SAR ADC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Tan, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Miniature ultrasound probes increasingly employ ASIC that drive the transducer elements with HV pulses and process the received echo signals. Due to size constraints, the HV pulsers tend to be relatively simple circuits, in which HV MOS transistors pull the transducer element to a HV supply and back to ground. An important disadvantage of existing designs is that the rising and falling edges of the generated pulses are not well matched, which leads to second-harmonic components in the generated pulse. This makes these design unsuited for harmonic imaging. Moreover, the pulse amplitude typically cannot be controlled, making it difficult to apply apodization techniques that are often desired to reduce sidelobes. This work presents an ASIC design that addresses these disadvantages. The content discussed in this thesis includes the circuit architecture, circuit implementation and analysis of simulation results for an integrated HV pulser with improved HD2 and programmable amplitude enabling apodization. The design consists of two parts: a transmit driver and the HV pulser. The transmit driver, composed of a negative feedback loop with a replica pulser, a level shifter and other components, can generate a lower HD2 by auto-calibrating the pull-up and pull-down time. It can be shared by multiple HV pulsers that drive the transducer elements. A combination of duty-cycle modulation and slew-rate modulation is proposed for pulse-amplitude control. Finally, an experiment aimed to explore the effective acoustic power of transducer under high and low impedance drive modes is proposed. These drive modes are first investigate by simulating the transducer driven by an ideal current and an ideal voltage source. Then, an experimental circuit is proposed in which the transducer is connected to an OpAmp in different ways to achieve similar impedance conditions as in the ideal situation to verify whether there is a large gap in the acoustic power.","harmonic imaging; HD2; apodization; HV pulser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Most of this research has been done on uniaxially loaded specimens, such as single edge notched bend specimens. From these experiments, the maximum principal stress criterion is used in the Weibull distribution method as proposed by Beremin, and is observed to accurately predict the fracture toughness distribution. However, when multiaxial specimens are considered, the maximum principal stress criterion no longer accurately predicts the fracture toughness distribution. In this thesis, other failure criteria than the standard maximum principal stress are considered as a solution to this problem. Using the data provided in the 2006 paper ""An Experimental Investigation of the Effect of Biaxial Loading on the Master Curve Transition Temperature in RPV Steels"" by R. Link, A Joyce and C. Roe, the properties of Shoreham pressure vessel steel are obtained. Furthermore, the fracture toughness from the tested cruciform specimens allows for the reconstruction of the stress state around the crack tip during fracture. This is done by creating various cruciform specimens in the Abaqus finite element analysis program, which are loaded in accordance with the paper. The resulting stress state is used in the calibration of the Weibull parameters in the Weibull distribution. It was found that uniaxially loaded specimens show good agreement with the predicted failure probabilities. Additionally, it was confirmed that the biaxially loaded specimens do not show good agreement when the maximum principal stress is the failure criterion. When the failure criterion is altered so that only microcracks that do not experience large triaxiality contribute to fracture, good agreement is obtained for both the uniaxially and biaxially loaded specimens. Hence, it is found that triaxiality is very important for cleavage fracture, with high levels of triaxiality preventing microcracks from propagating. This leads to a proposed failure criterion where the maximum principal stress criterion is applied, and only elements that do not experience high levels of triaxiality contribute.<br/>It is suggested to further test these conclusions under a variety of loading conditions, for which an alternate specimen is proposed.","Fracture mechanics; Multiaxiality; Cleavage fracture; Cruciform specimen; Constraint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings show that the middledisk shift mechanism can achieve a maximum permeability variation of DeltaK_max&gt;4.5x10^-9 m2 at a net effective porosity change of epsilon_Eff &gt;72%, for the current set of perforated inserts. The results also suggest that the mechanism is most potent in the range of 50%closed hole (half shut)- to 100% closed hole (completely shut)- orientations. The flow parameter variations for the static configuration are fairly replicated by the dynamic configuration, thereby, establishing repeatability of the actuation device. Therefore, the dynamic configuration set-up holds good promise for up-scaling to real structures, that is, trailing edge of an airfoil with relevant optimization.","Permeability; Porosity; Actuation; trailing edge noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Wet deck slamming is a phenomenon known to cause passenger discomfort and seasickness, often a source of delay in the ferry's schedule and can even cause irreversible damages and endanger the crew. The research is carried out with numerical methods, where two main programs are used, namely the strip theory-based program for non-linear motions of high speed crafts FASTSHIP, and the design optimisation, parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis software, DAKOTA. To set up the experimental analysis, design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE) methods are used. The use of DACE involved the application of an in-house built parametric design tool for mass generation of hulls, coupled with a sampling-based method for the exploration of the design space. Because DACE methods require a large amount of data points (of the order of tens of thousands), it is deemed unfeasible to perform all the analysis with FASTSHIP. Therefore, a surrogate model is built instead, with the global approximation-based method known as Kriging. By considering the surrogate model in the study, mass production and evaluation of different hull forms were achieved, which led towards a brute force surrogate-based optimisation approach. Such approach enabled an in-depth exploration of both sub-optimal and Pareto-optimal regions of the multi-objective domain, thus not only showing the hull characteristics of the best hulls but also their trend of change from the sub-optimal to the Pareto-optimal region. Additionally, an alternative approach based on evolutionary algorithm is coupled to the surrogate model for a more direct and straightforward optimisation process, namely the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Both approaches converged towards the same region, thus reinforcing the reached solution. The outcome of the research established a valid framework for performing hull design explorations on catamarans while addressing wet deck slamming. Furthermore, it showed that the demihulls should adopt bulkier forms. However, a trade-off existed between the various considered objective functions, hence the final decision should be based upon the user's criteria.","Slamming; Optimisation; Genetic Algorithm; wet deck; Catamaran; Ferry; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a relatively young and increasingly popular field that is concerned with automatically optimizing the architecture of neural networks. Previously known work shows that even though a recent trend has been to develop increasingly complex search strategies for NAS, several search strategies do not significantly outperform simple approaches like randomly sampling from the search space on single-objective NAS tasks. Additionally, proper ablation studies are often missing. Therefore, it is currently uncertain at best which mechanisms are key for an algorithm to have to achieve excellent NAS performance. In the first part of this thesis, Local Search (LS) and a differently biased form of random search, are proposed for multi-objective (MO) NAS. The multi-objective version of NAS is studied less and understanding the trade-off between between multiple objectives for architectures is arguably more interesting. We find that very simple algorithms can achieve search performance close to that of state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while outperforming plain random search. Additionally, we find that the quality of the set of architectures found by LS is similar to the those found by the EAs, if compared with respect to test accuracy. Nevertheless, from the compared search strategies the Multi-Objective Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (MO-GOMEA), a state-of-the-art model-based EA, achieves the best performance. In the second part of this thesis, it is explored which mechanisms are essential for MO-GOMEA to achieve an excellent search performance for NAS spaces. We find that the automatic population-sizing scheme of MO-GOMEA offers a welcome anytime-performance, but objective space clustering has only a small beneficial impact. The number of clusters can be set arbitrarily. Special (extreme) clusters that optimize for one objective only can be enabled to the practitioner’s preference, resulting in different search behaviors. The improvement in performance gained by automatically detecting and exploiting dependencies within architectures is limited: this model-based aspect of MO-GOMEA seems only helpful for finding highly accurate networks.","NAS; Neural Architecture Search; Local Search; Baseline; Optimization; Convolutional Neural Network; MO-GOMEA; AutoML","en","master thesis","","","","","","I have worked on this project also as a trainee at the Center for Mathematics & Computer Science (Amsterdam).","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science","",""

The direct current (DC) microgrid is an emerging grid infrastructure that meshes efficiently with DC based technology such as photovoltaics, batteries, consumer electronics, and electric vehicles. This characteristic of DC microgrids designates them as a preferred solution for new grid infrastructures in rural electrification applications. In order to establish a DC microgrid, power electronic interfaces (PEI) are required for regulating power flow and interconnecting different grid components of the microgrid. In this thesis, the PEI (operating at 200-900 W) connecting a 350 V DC-microgrid to a solar home system (compatible with USB-C) is investigated. A unidirectional half-bridge LLC converter and a bidirectional dual active half-bridge (DAHB) converter (both utilizing gallium-nitride (GaN) transistors and planar transformers (PT)) are designed and tested. A working prototype of the half-bridge LLC converter with a center-tapped secondary is presented and the waveforms at maximum load and no-load conditions are analyzed. A complete design and efficiency approximation for a DAHB converter with a center-tapped secondary and active snubber circuits is included. In addition, simulations (in PLECS) of the designed DAHB converter provide waveform results for both the forward and reverse power flow direction. The results of the work discuss how high frequency operated, half-bridge isolated DC/DC topologies with GaN transistors and planar transformers are an excellent composition of technology for these rural electrification applications. The GaN transistor is most effective in a low voltage (up to 650 V), high performance scheme, and offers inherent benefits which allow for high frequency operation and thus, smaller passive components. Moreover, the effect of current collapse (an adverse effect in GaN transistors) is discussed and analyzed from a design standpoint. The benefits of planar transformers in low-medium power (up to 900 W) rural electrification applications and an in-depth PT design process are presented. Additionally, rural electrification safe extra-low voltage (SELV) standards require that PT designs must have reinforced (or double) isolation between primary and secondary windings. Taking this into consideration, two proposed PT configurations using a U-core and planar E-core, respectively, are compared. The main conclusions of this work aim to bridge the gap for the design and implementation of efficient DC microgrid variable power output converters for use in rural electrification applications.","Rural Electrification; DC Microgrid; Half-bridge LLC; Dual Active Half-bridge (DAHB); GaN Switching; Current Collapse; Planar Transformers; Safe Extra-low Voltage (SELV)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Hoogvliet, Marco (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Due to climate change, extreme phenomena like droughts are going to be intensified. Even though droughts in agriculture have been studied, regarding urban environment their consequences are rather unexplored. Cities are susceptible to droughts and the estimation of their vulnerability is the first step for their protection. The objective of this thesis is to determine vulnerability of cities to groundwater and soil moisture droughts. Since drought is a complex phenomenon which is difficult to define, its analysis is not straightforward especially in cities. For that reason, an urban drought categorization framework is created. In the current research, two of the four drought categories were studied (groundwater and soil moisture droughts). A case study for the vulnerability calculation was chosen for Leiden, the Netherlands. Before determining its vulnerability, different techniques to identify drought exposure characteristics were investigated. More specifically, regarding deficit and duration, the following methods were used: (i) fixed, (ii) variable, (iii) moving window method, and (iv) median groundwater level as threshold for the case of groundwater droughts. Spatial analysis was performed to estimate the areal extent of droughts whereas frequency distribution analysis is assessed of the minima of monthly blocks. A similar approach was applied for soil moisture droughts. Soil moisture is modeled via the lumped Urban Water Balance Model. Vulnerability was estimated as the aggregation of exposure and sensitivity (physical and social). For both components of vulnerability, their indicators were normalized. Out of the four drought characteristics (deficit, duration, spatial extent, and frequency), only the two first were included as exposure indicators for the vulnerability estimation. The indicators' weights were computed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Vulnerability estimation was applied for both groundwater and soil moisture droughts separately. One of the main results is that variable threshold performance is higher than fixed threshold and moving window for deficit and duration estimation regarding groundwater droughts. However, a combination of fixed and variable threshold can provide a profound insight into drought exposure. That applies to soil moisture droughts too. To increase performance of deficit and duration identification, pooling can be applied. An inter-event time of around 10 days for the case of variable threshold and 30th percentile is suggested regarding groundwater droughts. The analysis on soil moisture droughts was not sufficient to draw conclusions regarding inter-event time. Vulnerability follows sensitivity patterns - rather than exposure pattern - for both groundwater and soil moisture droughts at both fine and coarse space resolution. Besides, out of all indicators used, those which contribute to vulnerability variation the most were determined for both studied types of droughts. Those indicators are: `land use' and `percentage of households belonging to the lowest 40% income nationwide' for groundwater droughts whereas for soil moisture ones, it is `green areas'. Another result is that the differences in vulnerability vary marginally using different techniques to identify drought events for both studied types of droughts. Therefore, even applying a sophisticated technique to identify drought events, will not lead to significant improvement regarding vulnerability estimation. All aforementioned conclusions regarding vulnerability are highly uncertain since drought experts assigned different indicators' weights; the convergence of opinions was low. Based on the proposed methodology, water managers would be able to determine vulnerability of cities to droughts and policy makers would be able to protect the regions which are highly vulnerable. Consequently, the adverse impacts of droughts on cities could be mitigated, reducing residents' hardship.","Vulnerability; Urban areas; Soil Moisture; Groundwater; Drought; sensitivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis investigates if GANs can be used to provide a strong approximation to the solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of the Ito type. Standard GANs are only able to approximate processes in conditional distribution, yielding a weak approximation to the SDE. <br/>A novel GAN architecture is proposed that enables strong approximation, called the constrained GAN. The discriminator of this GAN is informed with the random sample that corresponds to the Brownian motion increment between two time steps. This way, the constrained GAN does not only learn the conditional distribution, but the unique map from a random increment to the next asset value along the path, conditional on the previous value. The architecture was tested on geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) process in one dimension, where it was conditioned on a range of time steps and previous values of the asset process. The constrained GAN was shown to outperform discrete-time schemes in strong error on a discretisation with large time steps. It also outperformed the standard conditional GAN when approximating the conditional distribution. A method is proposed to extend the constrained GAN to general one-dimensional Ito SDEs, beyond the SDEs tested in this work. In future work, the constrained GAN should be conditioned on the SDE parameters as well, allowing it to learn an entire family of solutions at once. Furthermore, the architecture could be extended to higher dimensions, including systems of SDEs, such as the Heston model.","Generative Adversarial Networks; Stochastic Differential Equations; Neural Networks; Numerical Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Financial Engineering","",""

On the other hand, designing a container terminal is a very complex process, and on a concept design phase, a quick assessment for the design alternatives should be done in a limited time, cost, and effort. Therefore, an automated tool is developed by (Koster, 2019) to ease and accelerate the work of the engineers. However, further development is required for the automated tool, especially for the layout generation tool to also consider area limitations. This research aims to answer the research question: ‘How can a container terminal be designed in the concept design phase while taking into account area limitations?’. The premise is answered by developing an automated tool (i.e. design tool) for container terminal design that consider not only terminal throughput and design rules for the main input but also terminal shape and dimensions. The algorithms implemented within the design tool will correspond for at least four tasks: recognizing the terminal shape and dimension as the boundary condition, modifying container block configuration (either by enlarging/reducing its size), generating the container blocks, and determining the desired output. After the design tool is developed, it will be validated using case studies from existing terminals by comparing several validation parameters: terminal layout, terminal capacity, the number of blocks, blocks configuration, stacking density and stacking orientation. Other than that, the design tool is also reviewed by using three types of applicability: design alternatives for all types of equipment, element calculation &amp; cost estimation from all design alternatives, and changing throughput demand. In this thesis, we can find the development and validation of the design tool that will give us the answer to the main deliverables of a concept design phase. The design tool is capable of presenting container terminal design alternatives and comparing the layout, elements, land use, cost, and capacity for 4 main types of stacking equipment: RTG, RMG, SC, and RS. This would be very beneficial for container terminal stakeholders, not only for determining which one is the most effective and efficient stacking equipment (which depends on the main objective of the terminal; e.g., lower land use, higher throughput, least labour cost, more sustainable, etc.), but also for getting information of main deliverables at the concept design phase: land use and cost. Other than that, this thesis will also show the design tool’s capability of generating different container terminal design for varying throughput demand and providing information on whether the container terminal has reached its area capacity or not. All of these are resulted from the process of an automated tool, making the design process faster and better, which will be very meaningful in this era of continuous uncertainty. All in all, area limitations have a significant influence in the container terminal design process since it is closely related to container block configuration, which also related to the terminal capacity, land use, and costs. Area limitations will also make the design process even more complicated; and thus, the design tool that has been developed in this thesis for generating container terminal design alternatives is one of the answers in solving the problem.","Container terminals; Design algorithm; Concept design; Design tool; Design automation; Terminal layout","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

For the vertical design of navigation channels, the goal is to make routes equally accessible and not have bottlenecks; to have an optimal maintenance program and not incur unnecessary costs. Ultimately, the vertical design of channels entails a trade-off between the Maintained Bed Level (MBL), vessel draughts and the percentage of accessibility. The objective of this research is to assess available and required water depths in ports, and to identify opportunities for the vertical design of channels. To reach this objective, a literature study has been carried out. Vertical design approaches, vessel characteristics, local conditions and admission policies are considered. Also, since this topic is strongly related to practice, a relatively large number of interviews were conducted. In this study, a new, more detailed vertical design approach has been framed. The vertical design of channels revolves around available and required water depths. Since parameters to determine these depths vary in time and space, a systemic-view is required to design for the same accessibility percentage along a route. In this research, a general method to quantify accessibility percentages as a function of the MBL in a port-network has been framed. By looping over the MBL, corresponding accessibility percentages can be calculated. As a result, it becomes possible to maintain bed levels for neither too little (bottlenecks) nor too much (unnecessary dredging costs) available water depth. Also, assessing the actual draught of vessels for vertical channel design purposes appears relatively new. A Port of Rotterdam case study is performed to analyse the traffic data and to validate the results of the computer model. Four terminals, with different business-dynamics, handling the largest-draughted vessels, were selected. The results of this study are presented and supported by relevant actors in the port: shipping line, terminal, port authority and pilot. From the traffic study, it was concluded that there can be a significant discrepancy between actual and design vessel draughts. For example, only &lt;0.1% of the largest container vessels (16-17m vessel design draught) handled in the Prinses Amaliahaven (almost) reach the draught for which channels has been designed (17m). Moreover, the MBL model allows a port authority to be more rational about where to maintain for which bed level. By removing structural over-depths, dredging costs can be saved. By removing bottlenecks, entire routes can become more accessible with relatively little dredging work. It would be recommended to review the actual use and accessibility of channels in ports on a regular basis (with the MBL model). The MBL model has a general set up; it can be applied to ports all over the world. Overall, it would be expected that something as fundamental as the MBL would be fully thought out in ports. It is compelling that by combining different data-sets (water levels, actual vessel draughts, and currents in case of a tidal window), room for improvement can be found.","Maintained bed level; Actual vessel draught; Port accessibility; Available water depth; Required water depth; Underkeel Clearance; Vertical channel design; Port of Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

While urban infrastructure is mostly safeguarded from differential settlement by deep pile foundations, the same cannot be said about greenhouses. The greenhouses of the Netherlands has enabled the country to become the largest exporter of vegetables, second only to the United States of America. It is imperative that these greenhouses which form the backbone of the agriculture infrastructure of the country, are monitored continuously to minimize unprecedented damage. <br/><br/>This thesis aims to study the feasibility of using time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) as a means to monitor differential settlement in greenhouse structures. The analysis was primarily done using RADARSAT-2 data. In case of translucent surfaces of greenhouses, it was important to firstly identify the physical targets that are associated to scattering centres. This was done by analysing the statistics of the heights of the scatterers which helps in ascertaining where the radar signal is getting back-scattered from. It was inferred that the persistent and distributed scatterers are primarily identified from objects on the roof and outer walls of the greenhouses. <br/><br/>Moreover, the magnitude of deformation estimated from the scatterers have been corroborated with geotechnical data. It was seen that higher magnitudes of deformation was seen in locations with compressible soil types such as clay and peat close to the ground surface. It was also seen that greenhouse structures are prone to differential settlement when the depths of the piles are insufficient in areas with varying soil types. The effect of thermal contributions has also been studied and it was found that the estimation of thermal expansion does not significantly affect the estimated deformations. <br/><br/>From the study, it is evident that time series InSAR offers an effective means to monitor differential settlements in greenhouses. In order to check for differential settlement in individual greenhouses, it is proposed that a persistent scatter interferometric analysis be done initially and if it is seen that the density of these scatterers is insufficient, the analysis can be followed up with time series interferometry of distributed scatterers. Incorporating multiple track directions of radar data increases the number of greenhouses that can be monitored.

Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of using active problem solving during training on subsequent performance while dealing with automation surprises. We simulated a glass cockpit of a general aviation aircraft in a full motion flight simulator. An experimental group of private pilots (n = 10) was trained to actively diagnose and solve problems related to the autopilot, without foreknowledge of the training scenario. A control group (n = 10) received the same training scenarios with foreknowledge. The effectiveness of these pilots in dealing with both new and trained automation surprises was compared between groups. It was expected that the experimental group would be more effective in dealing with the new automation surprises, whereas the control group would be more effective in dealing with the repeated automation surprises. The experimental group indeed responded somewhat faster to the new automation surprises and were on average able to maintain the highest level of automation for a longer time than the control group. The opposite is true for the repeated automation surprises, where the control group was somewhat more effective in dealing with the automation surprises. Although these differences were of medium effect sizes (Cohens d = 0.5), they were not significant. Thus, the training approach taken in this study may need to be further enhanced and tested with more participants in order to have a significant effect.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","There have been huge investments being made in direction of citizen science projects to enhance the engagement between science and society. To achieve goals and for the success of citizen science projects, a crucial element is getting more researchers to participate in citizens science projects. Besides harmoniously sustaining the participation of existing researchers who are already engaged in citizen science. While doing this, we identified two primary knowledge gaps: one, there is limited and insufficient research that articulates the perspectives of researchers to understand what motivates them to participate in citizen science. Two, even the limited available literature, is published by the researchers who are involved in citizen science projects themselves. That has more chance of publication bias and lacks critical scrutiny. For instance, these literatures give the impression that participation from researchers is because of their enthusiasm to enhance scientific awareness in society and to drive citizen’s positive attitudes towards science. Despite there have been projects where the participation from the researchers have not been particularly great.Q-method was identified as the suitable method to identify the perspective of the researchers, as it has been successfully applied in a range of disciplines from political science to environmental science. This method uses Q-factors analysis, that makes the researchers the variables of analysis. Stephenson (1953) argued, if there existed significant clusters of correlations in the participant’s profile, these clusters could be factorised and described as shared perspective and individuals could be measured in relevance to them. Overall, seven distinct perspectives of the researchers related to participation in citizen science are identified. These perspectives are divided into three broad groups based on their inclination to participate in citizen science projects. It is interesting that these groups exactly correlate with the experience of the researchers, that shows that perspectives are in association with on-ground thoughts. Group 1: represents the perspective of researchers who have intrinsic motivation to participate in citizen science and these researchers are experienced in citizens science. These perspectives are revealed by perspective 1 &amp; perspective 2. These researchers are expected to participate on their own. Group 2: represents perspective of researchers who have no interested or inclination to participate in citizen science projects, as they consider it not suitable method answer their research question. These researchers have no experience in citizen science. These perspectives are revealed by perspective 4 &amp; perspective 5. Group 3: these researchers are inclined to participate in citizen science, but some inhibitors in citizen science practise are preventing them to participate in citizen science. Perspectives of this group are revealed by perspective 3, perspective 6 &amp; perspective 7. The policy recommendation is suggested to citizen science association, institutions framing ethical policy and to researchers. This research contributes in three different ways, one it provides critical scrutiny of the literature published on perspectives of researchers, by comparing with what is discussed in the literature with on-ground thoughts of researchers. Two, this research identifies latent perspectives that have not been disused in the field of citizen science. Three, the research identifies controversies in the perspectives of researchers. However, research has limitations due to choices made during the research. One, no concrete conclusions, could be made specific to any scientific discipline or level of engagement between high-level involvement actors, due to the broad scope of the research. Two, research focuses on participation between high-level involvement actors. Three, the use of free sorting of statements to reduce the time for answering the survey. For future research, two controversies in the perspectives of researchers are identified that can be scope for entire new research in the field of citizen science. One, compensation of citizens in citizen science projects. Two, different model to increase scientific literacy are identified between perspective 6, perspective 7 and perspective 1.","Citizen Science; Researchers; perspectives; Q-methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

At the beginning of research, primary research about weight stigma and social media was conducted to collect background knowledge and form an initial scope for further exploration. Explorative research was conducted to map out the situation and problems of weight stigmatisation on social media. Then the project scope was refined as weight stigma internalisation in the context of fast fashion, and focuses on the problem that female social media users internalise weight stigma when shopping for fast fashion products. In the next step, I did user research to better understand how do social media influence people in their daily life, and how do people cope with stigmatising information. Then I did context research to understand the collaboration of social media and fast fashion (social shopping), and the internalising circle of weight stigma was concluded from the research. Based on the research findings about social media and fast fashion, this design should enable young social media female users to be aware of the subtle but prevalent stigmatising contents, and therefore avoid internalising stigma, in which way a more supportive environment could be built for more people.<br/>With clear design goal and qualities defined, the design starts with making use of the relevant elements in the whole shopping experience, including online interactions and in-store experience. The concept is developed through user- participatory iterations and evaluations. The final concept is a trans-media experience aiming to make the user encourage them to embrace the body shape diversity actively, and aware of the stigmatising environment on social media.<br/>Finally the evaluation was conducted to validate if the concept fulfilled the design goal and reach the interaction qualities. A workable prototype and video were used to facilitate the evaluation online and offline.","Weight Stigma; Social Media; Fast Fashion; Stigma Internalisation; Social Shopping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The flow development over an aero-engine spinner will affect the velocity distribution over the fan of the engine and this affects the estimation of the losses generated in the fan and consequently the performance of the engine itself. Previous experimental studies have shown the existence of spiral vortices formed due to boundary layer instabilities over a rotating cone under axial and non-axial inflow. To study the effects of hub-corner separation in detail, it is first important to check the efficacy of existing commercial numerical simulation tools in the prediction of this boundary layer transition development of flow over a rotating nose-cone.<br/>The objective of the thesis was thus to simulate using URANS and LES, the formation of the counter-rotating vortices over a rotating cone. To this end. ANSYS DesignModeler and ICEM CFD were used to generate a meshed computational domain and ANSYS CFX was used as the solver.<br/>With axis-symmetric cones considered as an idealised geometry for the spinner of an aircraft engine, a 15° half-angle cone with a diameter of 47 mm was chosen. The tip of this cone was blunted by a factor of 1/100<sup>th</sup> of the cone-diameter. The domain diameter was set to 10 times the cone diameter to reduce the impact of the flow over the side walls. Two structured hexahedral meshes were generated.<br/>The BSL EARSM was chosen for the URANS simulation and the WALE Model for the LES run. To check if the simulations were able to capture the vortices, the footprint left behind by them were visualised using the non-dimensionalised instantaneous wall shear values. <br/>The magnitude of the inlet flow velocity given was 2.46 m/s. A 2° incidence is given to the flow for the non-axial case. The effect of mesh refinement was studied for the axial case using both meshes and the finer mesh was used for the non-axial case. The axial case was studied using both the URANS and LES runs, while the non-axial case was studied using only the LES run.<br/>The variation of local Reynolds number (defined using boundary layer edge velocity) with local rotation ratio (defined using local radius, boundary layer edge velocity, and rotation velocity of the cone) was also studied and compared with available experimental data. The wall parallel velocity profiles over the length of the cone were also studied. Using the contours of the wall parallel velocity, the momentum mixing in the boundary layer due to the vortices was visualised and compared with the results from the experiments.<br/>To characterise the spatial development of the spiral vortices, a critical point was defined using the wall friction coefficient. This critical point was then compared to the one obtained through the experiments. The number of counter-rotating vortices formed over the length of the cone was also checked and the trend between the simulations and experiments were compared.","CFD; LES; Boundary layer ingestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

On top of that, vast amounts of goods are transported into and within these cities. The extensive transportation of people and goods causes a negative influence on the environment and a transition to sustainable mobility is therefore required.<br/>Many niche-level sustainable mobility initiatives are started with the goal to support this transition. However, several of these initiatives get stranded in their process of being implemented in the mobility regime. Numerous studies have established on which aspects of mobility the most can be achieved regarding sustainability, but there is limited research performed into the inhibiting factors for sustainable mobility initiatives. This study aims at identifying the factors that negatively affect the potential influence of sustainable mobility initiatives on a regime-level transition to sustainable mobility in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Region, as well as identifying the inhibiting factors that are the probable cause of the stranding of these initiatives. In this context, niche initiatives are defined as actors (or groups of actors) aiming to implement a small-scale innovation or service, intended for a specific purpose, into the mobility regime. The regime in this research is the current market field and operation of mobility in Amsterdam.<br/>Case studies of initiatives implemented in Amsterdam and interviews with persons connected to these cases were performed to discover inhibiting factors. The interviews were semi-structured by six categories of aspects based on academic literature. The results showed recurring patterns of the need for financial, governmental and societal support by the initiatives. These results indicate that the three dominant aspects of support required by these initiatives are: sufficient financial capacity to develop and sustain the initiative with its required complementary technologies and infrastructure, governmental support and institutional embedding and societal support caused by sustainability awareness.<br/>On this basis, future initiative starters must inform and prepare themselves for these aspects to support the implementation of their initiative and governmental parties must participate in supporting these initiatives in order to support the sustainable mobility transition.","Sustainable mobility; Urban areas; Regime transitions; Stranded initiatives; Amsterdam; Case studies","en","master thesis","","","","","","Joint Master of Science in Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering at Delft University of Technology and Wageningen University & Research.","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

While seasonal changes have been studied extensively, studies on changes in the timing and magnitude of annual extremes remain rare. This study investigates the effects of climate change on runoff patterns in six alpine catchments in Austria by using a topography-driven semi-distributed hydrological model and 14 climate projections for both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The study catchments represent a range of alpine catchments, from pluvial-nival to nivo-glacial, as the study focuses on exploring the effects of climate change on catchments of different altitudes. <br/>Simulations of 1981-2010 were compared to projections of 2071-2100 and changes in timing and magnitude of annual maximum and minimum flows as well as monthly discharges and melt were examined. Our results indicate a substantial shift to earlier occurrences in annual maximum flows by 9 to 31 days and an extension of the potential flood season by 1 to 3 months for high elevation catchments. For lower elevation catchments, changes in timing of annual maximum flows are less pronounced. Magnitudes of annual maximum flows are likely to increase, with four catchments exhibiting larger increases under RCP 4.5 than RCP 8.5. The timing of minimum annual discharges shifts to earlier in the winter months for high elevation catchments, whereas for lower elevation catchments a shift from winter to autumn is observed. While all catchments show an increase in mean magnitude of minimum flows under RCP 4.5, this is only the case for four catchments under RCP 8.5. Our results suggest a relationship between the altitude of catchments and changes in timing of annual maximum and minimum flows and magnitude of low flows, whereas no relationship between altitude and magnitude of annual maximum flows could be distinguished. The degree of future change in timing and monthly discharges is larger under RCP 8.5, a change of up to twice as large in monthly discharges is found for RCP 8.5 compared to RCP 4.5.","Hydrology; Hydrological Modelling; Climate change impact; Austria; runoff dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","","","","Water Management","",""

Time series data with high temporal and spatial dimensions encapsulates with itself numerous factors essential for coming up with robust decisions. In this thesis, we assess one such big data source for efficient water management in the Oum Er Rbia basin, Morocco. The surface water detection technique furnished used in this thesis is found to be accurate in detecting the surface water sources and its temporal and spatial dynamics.<br/>The remotely sensed time-series data of reservoir area was used to come up with Level-Area-Storage(LAS) relationships for the five main reservoirs in the Oum Er Rbia basin. These curves were able to approximate the present set of LAS curves well. Hence, were used in place of the local LAS curves in a water allocation decision model called RIBASIM. Thus, we had two scenarios one where the local LAS curves were used to optimize reservoir operations and the other where remotely sensed LAS curves were used instead of the local LAS curves.<br/>The operating rule curves in the water allocation decision model were then optimized for the two scenarios. The optimization was done to maximize the performance of the system across three objectives: a)public water supply, b)irrigation and c)hydroelectricity generation. A trade-off between the three objective functions was then shown using parallel and scatter plots. It was observed that for the same set of LAS curves the performance across all three objectives improved post-optimization of the operating rule curves. This showed that there were rooms for improvement in the existing reservoir operating rule curves. The operating rule curves for the water allocation decision model with remotely sensed LAS curves were then optimized. The best set of operating rule curves that we got from the second optimization were then used with the local LAS curves to see how the system would perform with these operating rule curves. This gave us an idea of the feasibility of using remotely sensed data to come up with water management decisions and also to assess the benefits of using remotely sensed time-series data. Though the performance over the three objectives was not as good as the results we got by optimizing the system with local LAS curves, it was better than the system performance across the three objectives with the existing set of operating rules and local LAS curves. Thus, it can be used when there is a dearth of proper LAS curves.<br/>Besides, optimizing operating rule curves, the remotely sensed time-series data of reservoir surface area was used to assess the effects of sedimentation in the reservoir storage. It was observed that for larger reservoirs the percentage change is not much as compared to the smaller reservoirs. Apart from the size of the reservoir, more study is required to make a detailed analysis of how factors like topography and soil texture influence the rate of sedimentation. Despite its limitations, the remotely sensed time-series data of reservoir surface area can be used to perform a qualitative analysis of the rate of sedimentation and can give reservoir authorities an idea of the need for bathymetry. This can help in avoiding unnecessary bathymetries which are infeasible both economically and physically.","Reservoir; Optimization; Water Resources Management; Public water supply; Irrigation; Hydropower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-27","","","","","",""

Cultured cells can be studied by means of two fundamental recording techniques that are intracellular and extracellular recordings. Patch-clamp technique is the gold standard of high-fidelity action potentials (APs) and synaptic potentials of an individual cell. However, patch-clamp method suffers from very poor scalability. Approximately only 10 cells can be studied per day by experienced personnel working on a bulky and expensive setup. Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have been proposed to perform multi-site and high-throughput extracellular recordings. Although MEA technology is utilized to understand network dynamics of large population of cells, MEA electrodes lack intracellular access to cell membrane which results in highly-attenuated potentials. Thus, MEA electrodes are only capable of recording action potentials (APs), and they are completely blind to synaptic events. Recent studies report that APs and synaptic potentials of an individual cell play a role in an increase in network activities as well as extracellular field potentials can induce a single-cell activity. Concurrent high throughput patch-clamp and MEA measurements are needed to gain insight into correlation between single-cell and network dynamics. The thesis project presents the design of 16-channel dual-mode recording unit for simultaneous measurements of intracellular and extracellular activities. The recording channel consists of capacitively-coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) to reject DC offset of electrodes and unary-weighted current-steering DAC for stimulation of cells. The ratio of CCIA capacitors defines the gain of the amplifier, and the capacitors with MOS-based pseudo-resistors determine the low-frequency cut-off frequency. Single-stage single-ended 5T operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is implemented in the core of CCIA. The unit current source of 4-bit thermometer-coded DAC copies 100 pA current from the reference and is localized in each channel. The injected current is increased by activating the adjacent unit current sources, and total current can reach to 1.6 nA. The reconfigurable recording channel has been designed in standard 0.18 $\mu$m CMOS technology. By post-layout simulations, the gain of the amplifier equals to 23.5 dB. The input-referred noise of the channel is 8.1 $\mu$V$_{rms}$ in the frequency band ranging from 1.05 Hz to 10 kHz with NEF of 6.2. The power consumption of each individual recording unit is 7.18 $\mu$W. Each reconfigurable channel occupies 0.021 mm$^{2}$ area on a die. This thesis projects integrates dual-mode functionality which opens a door to high-throughput multi-site intracellular and extracellular recordings for further understanding of correlation between single-cell activity and network dynamics of cells.","intracellular recordings; extracellular recordings; dual-mode recording channel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","","",""

The intentions and signals are identified by looking at the cues originating from vulnerable road users or their surroundings (hand signals, head orientation, posture, traffic signals, distance to curb, etc.). Taking all these cues into account by creating a separate detector for each is an extremely difficult task. Instead, this MSc Thesis will explore the possibility of using a generic contextual cue in optical flow originating from a pedestrian with deep learning methods to improve the path prediction in a naturalistic driving scenario. The contribution of this work is to examine multiple ways to extract relevant information from the optical flow and also explore the possibility of using the entire the high-dimensional optical flow using convolutions and soft-attention to help identify relevant pixels for the prediction task. This work elaborates on the extraction and processing of optical flow features. It proposes 2 Recurrent neural networks (RNN) based model: one to work with the histogram of optical flow features and the other one to take in the dense optical flow directly. Also, visualization of the soft-attention weights is done to add a step that helps in the interpretability of the RNN model incorporating dense optical flow. From the experimental results, optical flow features have shown significant improvements in terms of predicting probabilistic confidence for tracks with some changes in their motion mode. It was seen that the convolution-attention RNN model was able to work with dense optical flow features and position of pedestrians as input to obtain better results among all the combinations of features and models compared in this work.","path prediction; Pedestrian; Pedestrian Crossing Behaviour; Recurrent Neural Network; Attention Mechanism; Optical flow; Vulnerable Road User; deep learning; Intelligent Vehicles; autonomous driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Quantum computers hold a promise to solve intractable problems that can not be solved with classical computers. In quantum computers, information is processed in qubits as opposed to bits. The proper operation of qubits requires them to be operated in a quantum state; hence they need to be cooled down to temperatures well below &lt;1K. Using qubits and their quantum mechanical property, quantum computers can achieve exponential speedup in solving certain computing problems compared to classical computers. However, this can only be achieved by employing thousands of qubits. At the current state of play, quantum computers are still far from practical. The current state-of-the-art solution dictates that each qubit needs multiple interconnects towards room temperature and requires bulky room temperature instruments for qubit readout and control. Clearly, this current solution will not scale well for a quantum computer with many qubits. In an effort to solve this issue, it has been proposed to realize dedicated integrated circuits for control and readout of the qubits and operate them closer to the qubits' operating temperature to enable scalability.<br/>The thesis presents the implementation of an integrated RF receiver for spin and superconducting qubit readout applications. The work aims to replace the bulky room temperature electronics with an integrated solution that operates at 4K to enable scalability and simplification of the quantum computing architecture. The receiver has been designed in the TSMC 40nm CMOS technology and has been characterized in room temperature and 4K. The measured performance shows that the receiver features a gain of 58 dB and a minimum double-sideband noise figure of 0.6 dB at 4K with an operating frequency of 6-8 GHz; a comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art room temperature electronics used for qubit readout. Moreover, this work demonstrates a qubit readout experiment with the integrated receiver in both room temperature and 4K. The qubit readout experiment shows a comparable qubit readout performance with the integrated receiver at room temperature. However, due to oscillation problems, a degradation in qubit readout performance with the chip operating at 4K is observed.","Quantum; Computer; readout; Spin; Qubits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-26","","","","","",""

(mentor); De Schutter, B.H.K. (mentor); Mohajerin Esfahani, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Drinking Water Distribution Network (DWDN) vulnerability to disasters yields ever threatening consequences to society. Earthquakes are shown to have devastating effects on these networks, causing multiple pipe breaks and leaks to occur simultaneously. This results in a lack of pressure and unavailability of water for extended time periods. Increasing the resilience of a DWDN by efficient restoration is therefore desired. To restore broken pipes, isolation is required, where isolation valves are installed in the network to allow for this. Closing the valves and replacing the pipes are physical tasks to be executed by workforces. Moreover, as not every pipe has isolation valves on both sides, isolating a single pipe often results in the isolation of a large segment of the network. The locations of these valves and the scheduling of the restoration tasks are therefore crucial for the restoration process. This thesis aims to enhance DWDN resilience by considering the combined optimization of Restoration Task Scheduling (RTS) and Isolation Valve Placement (IVP). Four hydraulic objectives are proposed to quantify resilience. The objective values corresponding to restoration schedules are obtained by simulation of the restoration process using Pressure-Driven Modeling (PDM). From three candidate methods, the priority rule-based scheduling heuristic is identified to be most suited for combined optimization. A novel Genetic Algorithm (GA) application is proposed to optimize IVP while including the priority rule-based heuristic for RTS. The genetic information of the individual used in the GA represents a valve layout. The valve layout is applied to a DWDN model, which in turn is subdued to five disaster scenarios. The heuristic provides restoration schedules for all scenarios, where the resulting objective values are averaged to compute the fitness of the individual. The method is shown to be able to generate valve layouts for any number of valves. Comparing these layouts to known strategic IVP methods leads to significant improvement in resilience, or can alternatively be used to decrease the number of valves while maintaining performance. Moreover, the method allows for analysis of critical valves coupled to the network properties, pipe failure probability, and pipe diameters. Lastly, by applying single-objective optimization, it elucidates the trade-offs between the objectives.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This normally negated deformation of the cross section can be used to create an inverse transmission mechanism, used to create a monolithic and simple alternative to a classic differential mechanism. This warping beam differential mechanism can be used to add walking functionality to a back support passive exoskeleton. These exoskeletons are optimized to reduce muscle stress during lifting, but this comes with the downside of an increase in muscle activity during walking. To counter this increase in muscle activity, the use of a differential mechanism is suggested. To show the feasibility of the proposed solution, a characterization of the warping beam differential mechanism is made for different geometric properties. This characterization is done with respect to two functionalities, to determine the geometric advantage of the inverse transmission and the rotational compliance under torque of the beam. The warping constant and torsion constant are determined to be the geometric properties of most influence on the behaviour of the warping beam. It is also shown that within the proposed boundary conditions, different beam cross sections with the same geometric properties show the same behaviour. An increase in warping constant results in an increase in geometric advantage and a reduction of the rotational compliance. The torsion constant has a linear correlation to the stored energy for the inverse transmission functionality, having less influence on the geometric advantage and rotational compliance compared to the warping constant. This thesis shows that this new kind of differential mechanism can be used to replace the classical mechanism and the potential can be seen with an achieved theoretical geometric advantage of almost 1. A systematic overestimation of the geometric advantage and an underestimation of the compliance is made by the model with respect to the experiments, but with some improvements this theoretical goal is not far away.","Warping; Differential mechanism; Shell mechanism; Compliant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

By charging them with renewable sources, electric vehicles present a route to zero or low emission mobility. This is a significant reason for their recent popularity given the climate crisis. However, the integration of electric vehicles comes with a unique set of problems, such as over-loading of grid elements and under-voltages of nodes. The integration of photovoltaic generation is also another source of complexity. The focus of this thesis is to investigate the influence of electric vehicles and solar generation in low voltage power grids. <br/>Different charging algorithms are analysed and compared to the uncontrolled charging scenario. The price based charging algorithm is a centralised control strategy. The other three algorithms - average rate charging, nodal voltage charging, and smart charging - are decentralised strategies. Each of these algorithms manipulate the charging power at different chargers in the grid according to their specific conditions. <br/>The aforementioned algorithms are tested by performing simulations in three types of German distribution grids: rural, urban, and sub-urban. These simulations are carried out for High PV, Low PV, and No PV scenarios. In all three grids, there is neither over-loading of equipment nor under-voltage of nodes in the No PV case. The under-voltages are improved due to photo-voltaic generation. In the High PV case, excessive generation causes over-loading and over-voltages in the sub-urban grid. The possibility of using electric vehicles as dynamic storage elements has been explored. Based on the insights obtained from the grid simulations, the performance of different charging algorithms is analysed and compared in this thesis.","electric vehicle; excess pv; controlled charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This agreement is constructed by all nations to fight together against a common enemy, namely climate change. Over the past few years it has become more difficult then ever before to ignore the effects of global warming. While species which have lived on the face of earth for over a thousand years are dying out, while natural disasters such as typhoons, tsunamis, extreme droughts and floods are drastically increasing in occurrence and while we measure new record years of climate change perceiving every year over the past decade it finally becomes inevitable to start taking measures to fight against climate change in order to allow humans and all other species living on this planet to survive. The Paris Agreement is one of the leading most respected agreement combating this cause, it bring together all the nations to sum up their efforts in order to try and mitigate and adapt the effects of climate change. The main goal of this act is to enforce the global response to the danger coming from the change in climate. To achieve this goal a target has been placed which states, the global temperature rise this century should stay well below 2 degrees Celsius. Every country has made its own individual pledge to help achieve the goal set by the Paris Agreement. Indonesia the 4th most populated country in the world is one of them. Indonesia is not only one of the most populous countries, but also one of the most polluting countries, with emissions coming from deforestation and enormous coal-fired power generation pipelines. Next to this, Indonesia’s location makes it highly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. Therefore, Indonesia pledged to reduce it’s greenhouse gases, however up until now their targets have been rated as “Highly Insufficient”, meaning that they only show modest signs of improvement. The cause of this, is their development of coal fired plants, as they plan to build further 6 GW of such power plants by 2022 and around 27 GW by 2028. Therefore, it becomes inevitable to star moving the investments in coal for the next years towards renewable energy sources, such zero-carbon methods are for Indonesia to start the right pathway to attain the Paris Agreement and sustainable development. This is the reasoning behind the development of this research. However, since entire Indonesia seems like a too big of a challenge for one research. Therefore, this research aims at picking one of it’s islands and hoping that by designing an effective road map for the energy transition on this island will lead for others to follow. The island of choice has been Bali, a well knows and highly visited island in the archipelago. The target set by Indonesia are taken over for the case of the energy sector in Bali. These targets are the following, first a foremost a total greenhouse gas reduction of 11% by the energy sector compared to the reference scenario should be achieved by 2030. Second, to help meeting the first target a 23% penetration of renewable energy in the total electricity mix should be achieved by 2025. Last, these two targets should not hinder the expansion of the total capacity to satisfy the growing electricity demand at all time. From these targets and a literature review about energy transition on islands and renewable energy technology on islands the following main research question as been constructed: What plausible road map can ESDM follow, in order to accelerate the energy transition in Bali, while assuring that the demand is covered, to help Indonesia achieve their targets? In order to find the solution to this question four sub research question have been set up. These require the implementation of a system dynamics model. From the literature study and research done on similar islands which have already achieved a successful transition towards renewable energy, a total of 15 different scenarios have been constructed. These scenarios are possible outcomes of particular applications of 8 different policies, which the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MERM) or in Indonesian Energi dan Sumber Daya Minera (ESDM) has the power off to apply. First, a system analysis is given, which introduces all of the information required of the system, which is in this case the island of Bali and its electricity network. This analysis also demonstrates the current structure of the electricity network and explains why the transition of renewable energy is happening at such a slow pace. There are multiple reasons for this, ranging from cultural barriers to overcome as also geographical difficulties for the construction of renewable energy sources. In addition, there is also the issue that the balinese people are used to coal and oil powered electricity and see renewable technologies as methods coming along with a high risk. After the system analysis setting the boundaries of the complex system a road map development is introduced. In this chapter, it is explained how the different policies have to be applied, in order to construct the 15 different simulations of the future. This is followed by a chapter describing the model setup. First a conceptual model is designed including all of the mechanisms in work at the electricity network transition. The implementation of these feedback loops and of the policies into the system dynamics model is explained in great detail. Next to this, a table can be found in this chapter including all of the main input variables with the sources and assumption taken to determine their values. Before running the simulation with the final input variables, a verification and validation of the system dynamics model is demonstrated. This chapter verifies that the computerised model represents the conceptual model introduced before. Next, a validation testing if the simulation can support what it stands for is carried out. This has been done by investigating whether the main theories and assumptions elemental for the conceptual model are valid. In addition to this, the model is checked on errors and whether all of the units included in all of the equations are valid. At the end of this chapter a sensitivity analysis is executed. In this sensitivity analysis the different input variables are modified, in order to see the response on the output variables. This ensures that the system dynamics model representing the electricity network of Bali is indeed valid and can be use for further analysis. In the follow up chapter, the results of the different simulations are given and they are being compared to the main targets introduced at the beginning. From the total of 15 scenarios there are only 5 which meet the most important requirements. Therefore only these 5 scenarios are deployed into a trade-off table. The conclusion of this chapter is that the scenario S12+TE is the best choice for ESDM. This scenario represents a 24% growth rate of the solar PV sector stimulated by ESDM. Next to this, it requires a modification of the onsite oil fired power plants, so that they can run on cleaner fuel, namely liquefied natural gas. In addition to this, this scenario also requires to raise the taxes on fossil fuels, give out subsidies for solar PV projects, fix the land cost of farmland which has potential for solar farms and it includes an evolution of efficiency of photo voltaic cells from 17% to 30% within the next 10 years. This scenario would have a total cost of 2,050 million US dollars, to ensure them that they would achieve all of their targets by 2030. This result is then being reflected on in the final chapter, where some concluding remarks are given on the different results and methods. Next to this, several ideas are given to help improve any future follow up work on this research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

With the signing of the Paris Agreement, implementation of IMO 2020 and expansion of ECAs, the external pressures for the reduction of different emissions(CO2, SO<sub>x</sub>, PM, and/or NO<sub>x</sub>) in dredging are rising. Additional motivating factors are the rise in the fuel expenses which form a major component of dredging project costs and the incentives from regulatory authorities to reduce the carbon intensity in dredging operations. Often, the achievement of one objective leads to deterioration of another, for example, the use of IMO-compliant fuel can increase the overall carbon emissions. In recent years, alternative fuels like LNG and biofuels have been explored. However, they suffer from their own set of issues and with the predicted trends, the usage of these alternative fuels would imply lower production and earnings, especially in large dredging projects. In this work, a marine power plant concept that has been rarely discussed in the context of dredging is explored and forwarded: a nuclear-based system. Fundamentally, such a power plant addresses the issues related to the emissions and essentially eliminates bunkering stops. This was the first study focused on nuclear-powered Trailing Suction Hopper Dredgers (TSHD), the most common type of dredging vessel. In this work, a system-level study was carried out to ascertain the retrofittability of a nuclear-based system on four existing TSHDs. The feasibility of retrofitting the nuclear-based system has been studied by comparison of mass and volume requirements of the nuclear power plant, with the mass and volume of the engine and fuel storage system of current dredging vessels. No re-design of the vessel was considered here.The ”inherently safe” High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) with Nuclear Air-Brayton Cycle (NABC) was determined as the nuclear power system of choice. It appeared that for such a system,the TSHD sizes that are interesting for the deployment starts around 12000 m<sup>3</sup> hopper capacities.The bigger the hopper capacities than this baseline, the better the nuclear system performed. It was found that despite the satisfaction of the mass and volume constraints, a redesign of the TSHD is required for the placement of the reactor and for the compliance with the nuclear related regulations.In addition to the nuclear power plant, the retrofitting of the TSHDs with Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) in combination with solid, compressed and liquid H<sub>2 </sub>storage and batteries was considered. With the current commercially available offerings, PEMFC with liquid or 500 bar compressed H<sub>2 </sub>storage were found to be suitable for maintenance dredging or capital dredging for a short duration(couple of days). However, it was established that the realisation of endurance level of current dredgers is not possible without a reduction of hopper capacities or factorial increase in energy density of storage. Further, the smaller TSHDs were found to be better suited to use PEMFC or battery-based systems.A part of this work also tried to answer the pertinent question of the third party liability insurance premiums for a nuclear-powered vessel and the regulations such a ship would be subjected to. Further, a preliminary business case was developed and the sustainability of the concept was evaluated. It was realised that the technological forces and trends like the development of Small Modular Reactors, deep-sea mining and autonomous ships, could favour the development of a fleet of nuclear-powered dredging vessels in the future. However, the regulations and the support for these vessels would be highly dependent on the flag country and operational location.","Dredging; Trailing suction hopper dredge; Nuclear; High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor; Nuclear Air-Brayton Cycle; PEMFC; Hydrogen storage; Battery; Nuclear third-party liability insurance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Stougie, L. (graduation committee); Harmens, Rosan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2020","As of 2016, governments globally adopted the task to achieve social, economic and environmental sustainability by committing to the targets from the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs incorporate a set of 17 goals and 169 targets accompanied with more than 200 indicators that can guide towards achieving sustainable development by 2030. Sustainable development and human wellbeing fundamentally rest on the capacity of the biosphere to sustain us. In other words, the economy or society related SDGs can only be reached if the biosphere related SDGs, in which they are embedded, are respected. To ensure the achievement of all SDGs, the environmental impact as a result of human activity needs to be reduced to safe levels. Doing so requires quantification of both impacts and safe operating spaces in the environmental domain. However, from the SDG framework it does not become clear what safe operating spaces are because for many of the environmental issues addressed, quantitative targets based on ecological boundaries are lacking. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method that enables holistic analysis of the environmental impact of product-systems by analyzing the impacts over the complete life cycle. Yet, as a comparative method it can only identify the most sustainable product system relative other alternative product-systems. In contrast, there have been developments to develop Absolute Life Cycle Assessment (ALCA), in which the environmental impact of a product-system is compared against a benchmark based on the earth’s ecological carrying capacity, in order to define if the system is absolutely sustainable. Such a benchmark is obtained by allocating a share of the environmental carrying capacity to the product system, using a specific allocation principle. The most recognized expression of environmental carrying capacity has been provided by the planetary boundary (PB) framework, offering a set of quantitative biophysical limits for nine critical earth system processes (ESP). The functioning of these ESPs is critical to keep the earth in its stable Holocene state, which is required for anthropogenic prosperity. Using the LCA method to quantify impacts, and the PB framework to provide quantitative ecological boundaries, ALCA could be useful to identify absolutely sustainable product-systems and support contributions from product-systems towards environmental SDG targets. Yet, an overview showing the availability of different ALCA methods and their applicability at the product level is lacking. Therefore, this master thesis provides a systematic literature review of ALCA methods and applications, that use the planetary boundary (PB) framework as an implementation of carrying capacity. The main research question is formulated as: To what extent is absolute life cycle assessment possible and does it enable a comparison of environmental impact against product-level benchmarks based on the PB-framework, to support the identification of absolute sustainable products contributing to the UN SDGs? With a database search on Web of Science (WoS) and a snowballing approach, possibly relevant publications were identified. Afterwards, 14 key publications were selected that entail either an ALCA method or application. The review was conducted with criteria primarily based on an absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) framework identified from literature. The criteria cover aspects related to LCA, the PB framework and allocation approaches needed to obtain benchmarks at the product-level. The results showed that there are 5 dominant methods, and 9 applications of these methods. Only one of these methods includes a direct comparison of impact against a benchmark specifically allocated to the assessed product-system. Therefore, we concluded that only one method can truly be considered as an ALCA method that is also potentially usable in the context of SDGs. However, even claims of absolute sustainability that are made using this method are not fully conceptually consistent because a comparison is made between an annual benchmark (derived from the PB framework) and LCA impacts that are in reality exerted over many years. Other methods were considered usable for different purposes. Some methods only facilitate a comparison of impact against a per-capita benchmark, representing the occupation of an individual’s environmental budget by the product-system. These methods are rather usable for identifying sustainable consumption patterns. Some methods only enable the determination of impact reduction targets against which future impact reductions might be compared. Others do not involve any form of absolute sustainability comparison and are rather usable in conventional comparative LCA. We provided a terminology proposition for PB related concepts because there seemed to be inconsistencies across publications regarding the use of PB-related concepts and their terminology. Also, there were inconsistencies in the terminology for different allocation principles. We stated that all allocation principles could be classified in three main categories. Yet, further research is recommended to find common ground on the choice for specific allocation principles to obtain benchmarks for product-systems. Also, we recommend further research to focus on getting insights in linkages between LCA impact categories, PB’s and SDGs and combining these insights with the knowledge on ALCA methods that has been provided in this thesis. Such a combination would be the next step to find the potential of ALCA methods for supporting contributions from product-systems towards environmental SDG(-target)s.","LCA; Life Cycle Assessment; Absolute sustainability; Planetary Boundaries; Sustainable Development Goals; benchmarking; Systematic Literature Review; Life Cycle Analysis; Absolute environmental sustainability assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Therefore, it is a principal sector that requires sustainable change. Agroforestry, described as the deliberate planting of trees on farm land or integrating farmers into forests, is one of the proposed solutions and has gained a lot of (renewed) attention in the Netherlands and elsewhere. A food forest, one of the subcategories, is defined as a human designed system with a variety of edible species grown in vertical layers based on the example of a natural forest. The aim of this research was to provide a more solid basis for the quantification of yields for temperate food forests together with describing advantages regarding nutrients (N, P) and water. To this end, a focal study plot of food forest Schijndel was analysed in which future yields and nutritional carrying capacities (NCCs) were modelled for 2020-2049 with an extrapolation to 2067. Results were compared with conventional fruit-, carbohydrate cropping-, nutand meat systems. The results for this focal study plot showed a slow but steady yield increase towards a fresh weight yield of 7.1 t/ha in 2049 together with a balanced nutritional supply in terms of NCC for kcal (11.0 persons/ha), carbohydrates (13.1 persons/ha), proteins (11.6 persons/ha), fats (13.1 persons/ha) and fibres (23.0 persons/ha) in 2049. Nutritional results were in general significantly higher than few previous studies. The comparison between cultivation systems showed that the food forest plot had the highest overall NCC. Furthermore, the study plot scored high in the category of fats, modest for proteins and was not competitive with the best performing systems among carbohydrates, fibres and kcal. It is hypothesized that a food forest scores high in micronutrient provision as well, although this could not be substantiated in this study. Additionally, several environmental advantages such as reduced nutrient leaching, self-sufficiency and improved on-farm water cycling were indicated. Although, effects such as high annual nutrient removal and high N deposition on those parameters are yet insufficiently understood. In conclusion, a food forest is a more balanced system which takes more time to develop itself than most conventional systems, but offers continuous and (probably) durable yields. The main limitations in this research were the fact that applicable yield data was not readily available together with a premature literature body on effects such as shading on yields. Further research should be redirected towards measuring actual yields, nutrient- and water characteristics and compare those to systems with comparable soil and climate conditions such as adjacent fields together with a further economic assessment for which this study can provide a basis","Food forest; Agriculture; Sustainabilty; agroforestry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Today, it is one of the essential clinical imaging modalities. One of the major challenges involved with this imaging modality is its long scanning time. Parallel imaging in combination with compressed sensing has overcome this challenge to a great extent. As a quid pro quo for this reduced scan time is the increase in image reconstruction time. An extensive research is focused to develop algorithms to make the image reconstruction faster. Fast Iterative Shrinkage Threshold algorithm is one of these algorithms (which is clinically viable) that speeds up the image reconstruction process. The present project focuses to speed up the particular algorithm, fast iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm, by preconditioning the convex optimization problem. This work proposes two new preconditioners, specifically in the context of the given algorithm, but otherwise can be used with different frameworks solving similar problems. The first preconditioner is a degree one polynomial of the system matrix and the second preconditioner is a block diagonal matrix where each block is a circulant matrix. The preconditioners are evaluated using two stopping criteria: residual error and relative error. The computation complexity of both the preconditioners are evaluated by measuring the floating point operations and total time consumption. Additionally, the simulations are performed by undersampling the data at two factors r=2 and r=4. The results indicate that the polynomial preconditioner reduces the overall time by a factor of 0.25 however is computationally expensive to construct. On the other side, block diagonal circulant preconditioner is extremely cheap to construct and evaluate on a vector but does not provide the desired results within the current framework. The study concludes that a suitable preconditioner for FISTA is the one that without affecting the largest eigenvalue of the system matrix improves the condition number and simultaneously is cheap to construct and evaluate.","MRI; compressed sensing; Parallel Imaging; Preconditioning; FISTA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

However, the current situation in the Netherlands presents a major challenge to build more to reduce the housing shortage, while at the same time reducing its environmental footprint. Therefore, alternative solutions to the status quo should be considered, which can reduce the environmental impact of buildings. The goal of this thesis is to determine the environmental impact of multi-storey timber residential buildings and to make a comparison with a concrete building. Furthermore, the effect of cascading strategies on the environmental impact is analysed and the carbon sequestration potential by timber residential buildings estimated. Firstly, reference projects are studied to determine the trends in the timber construction sector. Based on these results, the main timber typologies and available design choices are mapped as well as the available (engineered) timber products available on the market. Secondly, the sustainability of timber structures is assessed by performing a literature study on three different scales: the macro-, meso- and micro-scale. The macro-scale represents the global forestry level in which the carbon cycle, carbon sequestration (i.e. capture and storage) and forest certification are discussed; the meso-scale represents the building level in which the durability and cascading strategies (i.e. strategies to elongate the lifespan) are discussed; the micro-scale represent the environmental impact of the material itself. Thirdly, the environmental impact is quantified using the fast-track life cycle assessment methodology. Two data sources are evaluated by performing a data analysis. The first being the ‘Nationale Milieu Database’ which is prescribed by the Dutch ‘Milieuprestatie Gebouw’, the second being Environmental Product Declarations according to the European EN15804 standard. For the two main timber typologies (mass timber and post&amp;beam) a variant study is set-up using a parametric environment. The variant study analyses the environmental impact of main load bearing structures, the relative contribution of structural components and the effect of cascading strategies. The research is concluded by a case study in which the environmental impact of a timber alternative is compared with an equivalent concrete benchmark. Based on these results the global warming reduction potential of timber residential buildings is determined. From this research, it was shown that the environmental impact of timber buildings is lower than a concrete equivalent. However, it was found that the production capacity of engineered timber proved to be currently insufficient to reach the market potential, resulting in upscaling challenges for the engineered timber manufacturers when the demand will increase. From the data analysis, it was found that the selection of timber environmental data sources is highly sensitive. Furthermore, it was found that the choice for structural typology does not lead to significant differences for a default design lifespan. Though, the choice for a certain floor system does result in large differences. Overall, it can be concluded that a difference can be made to the environmental impact of the built environment by cascading scenarios, regardless of the choice of construction material. In case of timber structures, additional benefits occur due to the lower relative environmental impact and carbon sequestration.","Life Cycle Assessment; Timber; Environmental Impact; Carbon Sequestration; Sustainable Structural Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Fracture has been extensively researched for solid elements for finite element analysis in Bai &amp; Wierzbicki [2009], among others. Shells have also been investigated as a special case of the findings of solid elements. These elements are mostly used in large, thin-walled structures such as ships, as they reduce the minimum required elements in a model, which reduces computation time. Dunand &amp; Mohr [2010] reported that these elements are unable to capture through-thickness necking. This necking localizes strain and creates stress concentrations that decrease the validity of plane stress assumption of shells. In contrast to prior research, this thesis focuses on shell elements that are in the range of 0.5 to 5 times the material thickness by proposing a phenomenological correction method. This method estimates the effective strain perpendicular to the neck at the instance of fracture based on the assumption that the stress state does not change at the onset of necking and a simplified analytical model of the neck itself. The preference for a correction method is validated from a numerical plate model based on analysis proposed by Marciniak et al. [1973]. From comparison with the numerical results, it can be concluded that the proposed method performed better than existing methods for smaller shell elements lengths and similar for larger shell elements. The improvement is most dependent on the accuracy of the necking strain. A complete simplified approach for testing and effective fracture strain prediction is proposed and validated with calibration and raking experiments from Haag et al.

One of those applications is the storage of heat which are of great importance in the renewable energy transition. Most literature reported limit itself only to one single thermal conductivity for the porous media. In reality however, the porous media often consist of multiple materials with different conductivities. This thesis researches numerically natural convective heat transfer in a porous media with both conductive and insulating objects.<br/>The porous medium is simplified to a side heated cavity filled with water as fluid (Pr = 7), 32 aluminum objects with a thermal conductivity ratio of λ* = λ<sub>al</sub>/λ<sub>f</sub> = 337.33 and 32 wooden objects at thermal conductivity ratio λ* = λ<sub>w</sub>/λ<sub>f</sub> = 0.29. 4 cases, each with the aluminum and wooden cubes differently configured are simulated at a Rayleigh number(Ra) of 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>. Conjugate heat transfer (the fluid fase and solid fase are modelled as separate regions) simulations are done with direct Navier-Stokes where Ra<i> </i>= 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> are run steady and Ra = 10<sup>7</sup> is run transient. There are two different geometries simulated. One when the objects are unattached (heat cannot directly conduct into the objects from the walls) to the wall and when they are attached (heat can directly conduct into the objects) to the wall. From these simulations the temperature profile, the velocity field and the Nu profile is obtained. Also the average Nu at the hot wall and the U<sub>rms</sub> are calculated and compared between the different cases. Lastly the thermal disequilibrium %|<i>DT</i>| between the solid temperature and fluid temperature is calculated and compared between place of the object in the cavity and between the cases. The simulations show that conductive objects increased heat transfer at Ra = 10<sup>5</sup> when they are close to the wall. This is because they decrease the thermal resistance heat travels in the thermal boundary layer. Insulating objects on the other hand show decreased heat transfer as they increase the thermal resistance in the thermal boundary layer. At Ra = 10<sup>6</sup> and at Ra = 10<sup>7</sup> the circulation is to strong and the thermal boundary layer is mostly in between the wall and the objects so there is little difference seen in the flow and heat transfer. When the objects are attached to the wall the simulations show very different results for the flow and heat transfer and is very dependent on the conductivity and position of the object. Conductive objects attached at the wall, especially at the bottom of the wall where the temperature-gradient is the biggest, greatly improve the flow and heat transfer. They improve the area heat is transported from the wall to the fluid and thus increase the buoyancy force significantly. Insulting objects attached to the wall on the other hand prevent heat from flowing through the object and also prevents flow from reaching the wall. A big decrease in velocity and heat transfer is seen for all Ra values. For a case where conductive objects are placed against the wall and there are insulating objects in the middle, heat transfer can be improved compared to a fluid-only cavity for Ra ≥10<sup>6</sup>.","Natural convection; CFD; Conjugate Heat Transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although it happens across theentire Food Supply Chain, 53% of all food waste in Europe takes place withinconsumers’ households (Stenmarck et al., 2016). All this waste has seriousconsequences for the environment and if we want to achieve our ‘food waste reductionof 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030’ (UN, 2020) more needs to be done. An assignmentwas formulated together, with the Delft based organization I Change, to developa product/service that facilitates consumer food waste prevention by addressingthe household routines. By reviewing consumers’ existing household routines andthe motives of their food-wasting behavior, it has been discovered thatconflicting goals are the main reason consumers are wasting food. On the onehand consumers are willing to reduce their food waste because it is a purewaste of money, ethically wrong and because they feel ashamed or guilty whendoing it (van Dooren &amp; Mensink, 2018). On the other hand, consumers wastefood because they strive for convenience, want to be good providers by makingsure there is enough to eat and want to be prepared for uncertainties (e.g.:working overtime, unexpected guests) (Graham-Rowe, Jessop &amp; Sparks, 2014).  These food wasting motives have led to manyconsumers lacking the ‘good food habits’ needed to make both convenient andgood choices.  These good food habitsinclude making shopping lists, setting up meals plans and checking stock beforegoing shopping. According to Ooijendijk et al. (2019) having and sticking to theseroutines can prevent up to 50% of the total amount of food consumers waste.  Through an iterative design and test processEetkaartjes was developed. Essentially this product is a set of product categorylabels that consumers use in their fridge, freezer and/ or cupboards whichenables them to become better organized. Based on results from the testingphase it was concluded that through better organization, several of the previouslydiscussed lacking ‘good food habits’ improved. This ultimately resulted in lessfood being wasted.  I Change has beenprovided with several implementation options for the product. A productionproposal was made which enables them to continue with a detailed physical versionof the product. The affordable cost estimation and interest from theNetherlands Nutrition Centre, makes this an interesting direction to furtherlook into.  A second proposal was madefor a simplified flyer version of the product. This version is cheap to produceand easy to distribute but requires additional effort from the consumer toimplement it.  A third proposal was madein the direction of education. Samen Tegen Voedselverspilling expressedinterest into this direction and collaborative next steps are being discussed.  I Change is advised to continue theconversation with external parties and look into the different implementation possibilitiesof the product, conducting additional small scale tests to validate remaininguncertainties and determine which strategy has the most potential.","Strategic Design; Design Intervention; Food Waste Reduction; Behavior Change; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Additionally, they are placed in deeper waters. This results in the industry being at the limit of underwater noise levels generated by impact piling during the installation phase of monopiles. The most common installation method for monopiles is impact piling. This installation method comes with high impulse noise emissions which can be harmful for the aquatic environment. Larger piles require more energetic hammer impacts which, in turn, generate more noise. Given the size of the monopiles installed nowadays, noise limits imposed by governmental organisations are exceeded in all cases. The noise due to impact piling can be reduced by applying noise mitigation measures. Several systems have been developed, the most common of which is the Big Bubble Curtain (BBC). Although the working principle of the BBC has been proven in practice, the most effective deployment configuration, i.e. distance from the pile, air-flow volume and pressure, etc., has not been thoroughly investigated. In current projects, the BBC is typically placed at twice the water depth. This study aims to identify the parameters that determine the optimum position of the BBC to achieve maximum noise reduction. First, free-field predictions (without the BBC) using the TU Delft software SILENCE have been carried out for model validation purposes. The accuracy of the noise predictions were found to be within 2 dB (re 1µ Pa) both for the SEL and the Lp,pk. Second, the BBC was implemented by assuming a depth and frequency-dependent transmission loss (TL) factor at the position of the BBC. Noise predictions including the modelling of the BBC were validated against measured data. The key findings in this research are that the location of the bubble curtain is determined by the energy leakage from the soil into the water column. Depending on the damping characteristics of the BBC, this leakage is significant up to a point where the energy does not leak back to the water column anymore. In the examined case, and for blocking the waterborne path, this optimal position is found to be around 70m. The figure below shows the trend of the energy leakage in a schematic way. It shows that if the bubble curtain is placed too close to the pile, noise leaks back into the water column behind the bubble curtain. Thus, depending on the specific geometrical configuration, water depth and soil conditions, it is argued that an optimum position can always be found using the analysis presented in this work.","Under water noise; Noise; Bubblecurtain; Noise mitigation; Offshore wind; AdBm; HSD; Soil; SILENCE; Model; Acoustics; Ocean Acoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/gjwglasbergen/Bubblecurtain Repository link A Bubblecurtain package for developed for use in combination with SILENCE","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The increase in availability and affordability of lower-grade IMUs over the last few years has provided an alternate solution: combine multiple lower-grade IMUs to increase sensor accuracy at low cost. Existing literature has already shown the advantages of multiple IMUs. One advantage is a better estimation of linear and rotational motion. Another advantage is Fault Detection and Isolation from component redundancy. However, existing literature is confined to a set of configurations that are impractical (platonic solids) or small (arrays). In this thesis, we focus on combining FDI with estimation of linear and rotational motion and further improve FDI by changing the IMU configuration from an array to scattered placement of IMUs. First, we show in a Monte Carlo simulation that because of the array configuration, the angular velocity and angular acceleration covariance decrease proportionally with the number of accelerometers used rather than quadratically, which is theoretically possible. We also reveal that for human motion capture, the angular velocity and the specific covariance cannot practically compete with a higher-grade IMU. Second, we propose a novel FDI method, based on the parity space method, to reject disturbances which can be applied to bigger configurations and high rotational motion. As a proof of concept for real-life implementation, we tested FDI on a simulated human arm with three configurations. The first with lower-grade IMUs placed evenly around the arm. The second and third are placed in the middle of the arm where the second is a lower-grade array and the third is a single higher-grade IMU. A disturbance was applied, which resulted in a 4 degree, 21 degree and 13 degree maximum yaw angle error respectively, illustrating the superior disturbance rejection capability of the larger configuration. In conclusion, we show that combining multiple IMUs improves accuracy and when used in a larger configuration, may be beneficial over a higher-grade IMU.

Tidal dissipation within the moon’s core generates a substantial amount of heat which leads to ocean convection. Observations of the moon indicate ocean thickness variations of up to 20 km from equator to pole and heterogeneous heat generation within the core likely results in latitude-dependent temperature gradients. The effects of meridional thickness variations and heterogeneous temperature gradients on rotating thermal convection have not been simulated in previous studies. Here we simulate a non-uniform spherical shell employing a degree-2 zonal thickness profile. Using direct numerical simulations, we analysed various properties associated with heat transfer behaviour for flows in a uniform and non- uniform spherical shell domain driven by thermal convection with the Rayleigh number in the range 1.6×10<sup>5</sup> ≤ Ra ≤ 5.0×10<sup>6</sup> and constant Ekman number of Ek = 3×10<sup>-4</sup> and Prandtl number of Pr = 1. Our results demonstrate that different regimes of convection exist, which depend on the relative influence of rotation. With increasing thermal forcing, convection moves from being restricted to equatorial regions to filling the whole fluid domain. Global scaling behaviour for both domains was found to be consistent with literature, although weaker polar convection in non-uniform shells caused a decrease in heat transfer efficiency and thus a diminished heat transfer scaling behaviour. The diminishing transport of heat at the poles in the non-uniform shell deviates from the predicted heat flux profile at Enceladus, suggesting that stronger thermal heterogeneities are required to enhance polar heat transfer.","Bénard convection; Rotating flows; Geophysical flows","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.989907, 4.375362"

Controlled (’smart’) charging of EVs offers a solution to this problem by shifting the charging of vehicles to the most optimal moments in time. Smart charging is not a completely new research topic; it has a high Technology Readiness Level and some commercial implementations already exist. There is a large amount of literature available that compares the effect of controlled and uncontrolled EV charging on the distribution grid. However, most of this literature is based on pure software simulations using power flow analysis and mathematical models of EV charging behaviour. Experimentally validating these results would require a large number of EVs and a controllable distribution grid, which is costly and unpractical. Therefore, this thesis presents a compromise; a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed in which the distribution grid is software-based but the EV and EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) is hardware-based. In this report, the design and implementation of the testbed is discussed, as well as results from HIL simulations that compare the effect of controlled and uncontrolled EV charging in a distribution grid. The low-cost HIL testbed presented in this thesis is based upon an OPAL-RT OP5700 Digital Real-Time Simulator (DRTS) which runs a Newton-Raphson power flow analysis of a Dutch distribution grid. The DRTS also interfaces with all other hardware in the testbed. This includes a power amplifier which generates a three-phase grid at the voltage calculated by the power flow analysis. A commercially available EVSE is connected to this power amplifier and supplies power to an emulated EV which consists of communication hardware and two bidirectional back-to-back DC power supplies. These power supplies act as an AC load. Various communication protocols were implemented to exchange information between the different systems in a manner that closely represents commercial EVs. A smart charging algorithm which determines the optimal charging current setpoints in real-time, based on external factors like local load power consumption, solar irradiance and energy prices, was implemented into the testbed. The testbed has subsequently been used to study the effect of uncontrolled and controlled charging on the simulated distribution grid for a total of eight different scenarios. Of these scenarios, one consists of traditional uncontrolled charging and the other seven are with the smart charging algorithm activated. These include firstly a base case, then two scenarios with an inaccurate solar irradiance and local load forecast, a further two scenarios with non-ideal EV charging behaviour, and lastly two scenarios with respectively centralized and decentralized curtailment implemented. In all scenarios, one EV was implemented as hardware and three others as software, so that a comparison could be made. Even under non-ideal conditions, smart charging is found to reduce costs, grid overloads, and voltage deviations with respect to uncontrolled charging.

Due to digitalisation a new type of user has arisen. This user is characterised by always being connected while operating on multiple devices. This segment likes to be informed and expects answers, immediacy and transparency. They compare options before making important decisions and they are demanding with the companies they interact with (Rowe, 2019). To operate in this environment, where customers demand proximity, quality and transparency, Banc Sabadell has summarised its strengths in the following strategy “Estar donde estés” (To be where you are). This strategy aims to create a user-centered mindset, creating excellent services that show social responsibility and transparency. All of that will result in a long-term relationship with its customers (Quienes Somos, 2015). Banc Sabadell, with 135 years of history, is one of the largest banking groups in Spain, with international presence (Quienes Somos, 2015). For Banc Sabadell, mortgage loans are one of the products that generate the greatest customer loyalty and commercial margin. And for its customers, buying a house is one of the biggest milestones in their lives. This project is born from the gap identified in which the strategy of Banc Sabadell is not sufficiently perceived in the home buying process. In general, the process of buying a house or getting information about the different steps is most of the time a hassle for the users (Parrin, 2019). This project aims to provide a tangible strategy for Banc Sabadell to increase customer engagement while offering a smooth and remarkable home buying process. Through user research, this project explores the user needs, behaviours and expectations throughout the home buying process. A need is identified to offer a smooth and socially engaging home buying process to young adults which allows them and their relatives to feel reassured and experience the process together. As a result, Doyle is borned. Doyle is a mobile service application that offers adults independence in the purchasing process through providing the tools and information that users need. As part of this strategy, other three elements that play an important role are also proposed.","Service design; Home buying process; Tangible strategy; Banc Sabadell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Sonneveld, M.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Female sexuality remains a taboo in our modern society. Women feel shame and social pressure when vocalising their sexual needs and are judged when they express themselves too freely sexually. As our societal view is influenced by the visual design of products and the underlying message they uphold, appropriate visual design can positively influence the public attitude towards female sexual pleasure. Currently, in products and services for female sexual pleasure and sexual wellbeing, there is a persistent attempt to distance sexual products from the representation of sex as ‘dirty’. Sexual expressions are submerged in a posh/designer style, a feminine/innocent look or a clinical appearance. Thereby, an opportunity is missed to visually communicate female sexual pleasure to the consumer and to normalise the subject. When female sexual pleasure is visualised, it lacks a sense of nuance, diversity and inclusiveness. This results in a lack of resonance between product and consumer and creates a unilateral perception of female sexual pleasure. This thesis investigates how women would visually express their personal feelings of sexual pleasure. We propose a new visual language that portrays a variety of personal visual expressions of female sexual pleasure. This visual language is developed into a visual guide, ‘The Pleasure Gallery’, which inspires and guides graphic and product designers through the design process of visually communicating a realistic message from the perspective of women regarding their sexual pleasure. The Pleasure Gallery provides the user with visual stimuli that evoke a new way of looking and thereby create a ‘change in perception’ in the current visual communication design. When The Pleasure Gallery is spread among brands in the field of products for female sexual pleasure and sexual wellbeing, the aim is to trigger a discussion concerning the current visual communication design, leading to innovative designs that communicate a message that enhances female sexual pleasure. When designers start to work from the perspective of women regarding their sexual pleasure, firstly the sense of relatedness and attraction between product and consumer will be increased. Secondly, if female sexual pleasure is more frequently and positively portrayed, women will be positively addressed on their feelings of sexual pleasure and society as a whole will obtain a more open and inclusive view on female sexual pleasure. Eventually, this will contribute to the normalisation of female sexual pleasure and thereby create more freedom for women to express themselves sexually.","Visual communication design; Female sexual pleasure; Visual perception; Advertisement media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The pellets were scanned by LIBS and the data then compared to the known data. LIBS showed strong correlations (&gt;0.75) with ICP-AES data for As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and S, poor correlations were seen for Pb and Co, however these can be explained by issues related to ICP-AES. LIBS pellet data proved strongly competitive as 5/9 elements displayed stronger correlations between LIBS and ICP-AES than TXRF.

These aspects have led the policy makers in the Netherlands to gradually adopt a transition approach. Over the past few years there is an increase in the electricity production from renewable sources with wind turbines being the largest contributors. Currently there are six offshore wind farms off the coast in the Netherlands and three more are expected to up by 2023. At the end of 2015 there were roughly at least 2525 onshore wind turbines generating 3000 megawatts (MW) of electricity. By 2020, Netherlands intended to have an onshore wind capacity of 6000 MW. While a lot is already being done towards renewable energy transition, there still lacks focus on several aspects. Currently, in most of the sectors that are focusing on renewable energy transition particularly the wind energy systems, the focus is mostly on cost efficiency or conversion efficiency and there has been less attention to environmental impact due to extraction of resources. Thus, it is crucial to change the nature of these renewable energy transitions and resource consumption so that it becomes circular. Recycling of renewable energy systems like wind turbines is rising up the agendas of policymakers, researchers and industrialists. However, circular economy is more than just recycling, this raises a question: What is hindering the transition towards a circular economy for the wind energy sector? Thus, the main objective of the research was to identify major challenges and obstacles hindering circular transition alongside the ongoing energy transition for the wind energy sector. Firstly, an elaborate literature review was conducted to understand the growth of the wind energy sector and the current state of energy transition, followed by the possibility of a circular transition for the wind energy as well. For the circular transition to befall, an elaborate literature review was conducted on transition studies, with a major focus on sustainable transitions. Considering there does not exist a transition framework for a circular transition, the comprehensive ‘failures framework’ was considered the most feasible method to capture the challenges and obstacles hindering circular transition for the wind energy sector. Three cases, an onshore, an offshore and near the shore were selected from various parts of the Netherlands. Data was collected from each case on various challenges and obstacles for the circular transition for the wind energy sector. Data collection for these cases was primarily done by interviews. Several challenges and obstacles were identified in each phase of wind farm development from design to decommissioning phase for both onshore and offshore wind farms, which were categorized under twelve failures mentioned in the failure’s framework. Eleven out of twelve types of failures were identified in the design and development phase and ten out of twelve types of failures were identified in the construction phase. And of all the challenges and obstacles identified majority of them were categorized under directionality failure followed by institutional failure. However, no challenges and obstacles have been categorized under these two failures in operation &amp; maintenance phase and decommissioning phase only because the cases taken into consideration have not reached these phases of development yet. But these failures can be speculated to occur in both operation phase and decommissioning phase.Although, all the identified challenges and obstacles may not be applicable to every case but, the framework of failures obtained from this research definitely serves as a foundation or the starting point to understand why there is reluctance to adopt circular transition for the wind energy sector and what challenges are hindering this transition.On the whole, this research gives an overview of challenges and obstacles hindering circular transition for each phase of wind farm development and for the wind energy sector in general. The research also highlights different circular aspects and their level of consideration during the construction of wind farms. Although the research does not focus on providing solutions to the identified challenges and obstacles hindering circular transition and focuses on just the wind energy sector, it definitely takes one step towards the nexus of energy transition and circular transition.","Circular Economy; Circular Transition; Circular Construction; Energy Transition; Renewable Energy; Wind Energy; Failures Framework; Challenges & Obstacles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-23","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The design is made for two types of electrolysers, being an alkaline electrolyser and a PEM electrolyser. System configurations are modelled for operations on a minimum load utilizing all available wind energy, and for operations on nominal load continuously. It was found that the alkaline electrolyser is more energy-efficient and cost-efficient than the PEM electrolyser in this system. Including options for transport, it was found that the 10 MW hydrogen production system has the lowest levelized cost of hydrogen and is the most cost-efficient option. When operating on nominal load, the cost of hydrogen was slightly lower than when operating on minimum load using all available wind energy and restricting the use of grid electricity to a minimum. The cost of hydrogen was found to be sensitive to changes in the electricity price as well as changes in capital cost of the electrolyser.

However, the process induces excess pore pressure in saturated conditions leading to subsidence. This research focuses on the development of a tool-based solution to predict the excess pore pressure due to vibratory installation, which shall be veriﬁed by the postdiction of Kademuur Damrak measurements. This tool will help engineers quantify the impact of generated excess pore pressure on adjacent structures. The proposed work attempted to achieve its objective by answering the following main and sub research questions. How can the existing knowledge on generation and evolution of porewater pressure during vibratory installation be effectively integrated into a model/tool, which veriﬁed by the postdiction of Kademuur Damrak measurements, can practically estimate the porewater over-pressure during vibratory installations? • What are the parameters that inﬂuence the dissipation of the excess pore pressure? • How does the generation and dissipation of excess pore pressure vary in the liqueﬁed zone from non-liqueﬁed? • How can the vibration attenuation affect the generation of excess pore pressure in the sand? • What are the limitations and controlling parameters of this model or tool? The proposed work combines dynamic soil response and transient groundwater ﬂow model to simulate the evolution of pore pressure due to vibratory loading. Based on the degree of modulus degradation due to the vibratory loading the soil, it is zoned into three. This is also termed as a multiscale computational framework. This allows for the formations liqueﬁed and non-liqueﬁed zone. The threshold acceleration of 0.1g - 0.3g must be available for the soil to liquefy [66]. The non- liqueﬁed zone is fed by the groundwater ﬂow from the liqueﬁed zone. According to the Theis equation, head response due to constant pumping in an aquifer is inﬂuenced by the rate of discharge (V), storativity(S) and transmissivity(T), distance from the source. This inspired to model the driving of sheet pile with an analogous to the pumping of well. During the constant head loading due to the pumping, there is an increase in the head radially outward from the source. This resembles the phenomenon of pre-shearing in the ﬁeld. The driving of the sheet pile was stimulated by the constant head loading. The application of time series analysis (PRIFICT method) [8] provides the ﬁrst estimation of the pore pressure response from the ﬁrst of three days of ﬁeld piezometric data of Kademmur damrak. The semi-empirical model was formulated inﬂuenced by the head response of the slug test. The response of the time series analysis helped to calibrate the semi-empirical model. The relationship evolved between the physical and modelling parameters established that the hydraulic conductivity is the key parameter in both the generation and the dissipation of the excess pore pressure. The analysis of the ﬁeld data establishes the conservative assumption of 1m for the width of the liquefaction zone. The analysis of accelerometer data from the Amsterdam noord zuid metro line tunnel helps to establish the dependency of liquefaction on acceleration amplitude. This bolstered the threshold acceleration for liquefaction to be 0.1 - 0.3g. The simple ﬂow only Plaxis model helped to validate the proposed hypothesis. The hydraulic conductivity was established as the key parameter of the model. The integration of dynamic generation and transient groundwater ﬂow model helped to analyse the evolution of excess pore pressure.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","","","","","",""

(mentor); van der Heiden, Kasper (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A QUAD lift is a new lifting method in which dual crane vessels combine their vessel capability to increase their offshore lift performance. The use of the Jumbo J-Class vessels in a QUAD lift creates the opportunity to increase the offshore lift capacity and to install structures with larger dimensions. When floating vessels are close to each other in an offshore environment, their motion will be different than in the freely-floating situation because of hydrodynamic coupling and wave diffraction forces. The main objective of this thesis is to create a model of the QUAD Lift method which predicts the vessel and load motions and evaluate the workability such a lift. Both potential solvers AQWA and OrcaWave are used to assess the hydrodynamic parameters of the interacting vessels. The gap between the vessels is 40 m and the vessel configuration is such that the cranes are parallel to each other. In between the vessels, transversal wave resonance induces peaks in the frequency dependent radiation forces of the vessels. An additional damping lid in between the vessels effectively reduces the resonance behaviour, which is overestimated by potential solvers. The damping lid has an negligible effect on the final workability of the QUAD lift. A 18-DoF linear Matlab model is created which includes the mechanical connection between the vessels and the load. The cranes and the cables are modelled as linear springs. The natural frequencies and eigenvectors show large coupling between the vessel roll and the load sway motion. Tugger lines between the vessel and load are added to shift the natural frequencies of the system and to decrease the large horizontal responses of the load. A parametric study is done on the effect of the load mass, cable lengths and wave directions on the system motion in the most probable wave condition in the Central North Sea. An increase of the mass of the load leads to larger vessel and load motions. The shorter the cable length, the larger the vessel and load motions. The motions are most severe in beam and quarter waves. Depending on the stiffness of the tugger lines the workability can be improved up to 85, 55 and 24 % in respectively head, quarter and beam waves. The limiting factor for the workability is the off-lead angle of the cranes. Broadening of the off-lead angle limit of the crane shows great potential to further increase the workability.","Diffraction/radiation model; Coupled Multibody and Hydrodynamics; Vessel motions; Frequency Domain; Offshore Installation; Offshore Heavy Lifting; workability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-22","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","For expensive computational simulations, such as the finite element method (FEM) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD), whose evaluation can take even tens of hours or more, the use of direct optimization is often not feasible in practice. If simplifying the model is not an acceptable option, an alternative is to train a cheaper surrogate model on a limited amount of samples. This is called the surrogate-based optimization (SBO) approach. It consists of four main steps: 1) sampling , 2) computational analyses, 3) surrogate’s training, 4) optimization. Due to the repetitiveness, the evaluation of the samples is the primary bottleneck, therefore the smart selection of the training samples is of primary importance. The design of experiments (DoE) is a systematic approach of determining the samples. Static DoEs have been used and studied extensively. However, they are designed to covert only the input space uniformly, which means that only a half of the available information is used. Therefore, adaptive DoE methods that consider also the response in the determination of new samples have been proposed as an improvement. In the last 10 years, their research has gained momentum and numerous adaptive DoE methods have been proposed. The identified scientific gap is the lack of their overview as well as numerical benchmarking. Within this master thesis project, a modular SBO framework, suitable for such benchmarking, was developed, and the proposed adaptive DoE methods reviewed in more detail. With this at hand, a follow-up work can smoothly proceed into the actual benchmarking, which is estimated a task of itself for a project of similar master thesis scale. The results presented within this master thesis include the validation of the framework on the MATLAB peaks, Binh and Tanaka benchmark problems and the proof-of-concept evaluation of adaptive DoE on the MATLAB peaks, Judge, McCormick and Michalewicz problems against static DoE. It is demonstrated that using an adaptive DoE, the amount of required training samples is lower, or the same at worst, as with the static DoE. Additionally, thanks to the cooperation with Škoda Transportation, the practical use of the framework is presented on a structural FEM optimization of a novel tram car body, the SegTram. The developed framework is suitable both for research purposes as well as practical, industrial applications, and it is openly available at github.com/apanzo/optimization.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Nuttall, A (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Current dynamical models of the slewing motion of offshore cranes cannot predict the occurring vibrations during the design phase that arise during slewing. The relatively small pedestal crane on the Sleipnir experienced severe vibrations during the slewing motion in both the crane house and the boom, which were in the order of 1 and 5 Hz. As a result, the crane operator almost shook out of his chair. This research aims to create a dynamical model of a crane from controller to suspended load to predict the occurring vibrations during slewing during the design phase. The type of crane studied is an electrically driven pedestal mounted offshore crane with a lattice boom structure. A system analysis of the crane regarding the dynamics results in a list of dynamic effects. These are compared to obtain which dynamic effects are significant and which are negligible to include in the dynamical model. The equations of motion are derived to create the dynamical model, which consists of the controller, the slew drive system, the boom and the suspended load. The controller includes a PI-controller, a ramp function and play compensation. The ramp function creates a s-curve as speed input for the PI-controller. Play compensation brings the gears under tension to press out the play, which prevents backlash. A comparison between a model with and without backlash shows that the model with backlash results in vibrations consisting of two frequencies, which are in the same order of magnitude as the vibrations observed in the pedestal crane on the Sleipnir. While the model without backlash is not able to predict these vibrations. In addition, the frequencies of vibration correspond to the natural frequencies of the first two lateral bending modes of the boom. The results show that backlash in the system excites the natural frequencies of the boom. This means that the cause of the vibrations is the combination of backlash and the flexibility of the boom. The dynamical model calculates the same vibrations as were found in the pedestal crane on the Sleipnir. Thus, the proposed dynamical model can predict the occurring vibrations during slewing during the design phase. Experimental data should be obtained in the future to validate the model.","Vibrations; Modelling; Slewing; Cranes; Offshore; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-22","","","","","",""

New types of gate drivers need to be developed due to the need for creating two voltage levels for driving the SiC based power switches efficiently; one positive and one negative bias voltage. Besides this requirement, extra measures need to be taken for the proper operation of the driver and its sufficient protection. The electromagnetic interference is increased compared with the conventional silicon based applications, which potentially can cause malfunction or disruption at the operation of the gate driver. Furthermore, ultra-fast response in case of faults must be designed, because of the lower fault capability of the new devices. Sophisticated methods are employed with the measurement of di/dt being one of them. This work focuses on proposing, designing, and testing of a robust gate driver capable of detecting and isolating in less than 1 μs a short-circuit of a power module. It uses the PCB principle embedded Rogowski coil so that the gate driver control can re-build a voltage signal, which is an image of the current flowing through the upper and bottom active switches. Finally, a comparison band logic interrupts the gate ON signal when the current reaches a prohibitive level.

Despite the resilient character of tidal basin systems \parencite{Wang2009}, the evaluation of the intervention's effects, in terms of the initial response and the variations in the mechanisms driving morphological changes is compulsory. Assessing the bed level changes is especially important, considering the valuable intertidal and subtidal ecosystems present in the Haringvliet mouth. It is essential to guarantee their preservation despite the large disturbances. The evaluation of the Haringvliet mouth response is performed employing a long-term morphodynamic 2DH computational simulation to forecast the response of the system. The models implemented for the simulation are the Delft3D-FLOW and Delft3D-WAVE. To reduce computational times, the modeling approach applies input reduction and acceleration techniques. The hydraulic forcing is schematized (morphological tide, waves, and discharges) while maintaining the seasonal character of the input. A variable morphological acceleration factor (MF), depending on the wave condition is applied. The variable MF allows us to employ low values during strong-episodic conditions and larger during more regular conditions. The approach is especially beneficial in the presence of oscillating forcings that are also enhanced by the MF. Finally, the impact of the D21 plan on the Haringvliet mouth is assessed by studying the alterations to the hydrodynamic regime, the related net sediment transport pathways, and the observed bed level changes. The analysis of the resulting morphological evolution focuses on the variations of the intertidal and subtidal zones and the mechanisms behind them. We showed that the tidal regime shifts again towards a long-basin regime once the D21 is implemented. The intervention also causes the emergence of new subtidal and intertidal areas, mostly within the Tidal Lake, resulting from the redistribution of the material from the main channel. The original intertidal and subtidal areas, formed by the Hinderplaat and Slikken van Voorne, are almost undisturbed. This behavior guarantees the preservation of the intertidal and subtidal ecosystems. The results also show that despite the initial dredging activity necessary for the D21 plan implementation, which decreases the extent of shallow areas, the emergence of intertidal and subtidal features balances the negative effect as long as no further dredging is performed. The TL shows a net sediment export of material at both control cross-sections (the Haringvliet Dam and the new TL inlet). The findings of the morphological development agree with the known morphology and processes of mixed-energy tidal inlet systems, despite the large-scale intervention. This study provided the opportunity to evaluate the emergence of typical tidal features in a highly disturbed system, where the tidal inlet is shifted further offshore. To achieve an accurate forecast, anthropogenic forcing signals also had to be considered and extrapolated to long-term morphodynamic simulations. The forecasting of large-scale anthropogenic interventions in sensible systems, such as tidal estuaries, is performed successfully by adapting an existing model. The development of this type of study will be increasingly relevant in the future for the evaluation of measures against SLR during conceptual project stages.","Tidal basin; Intertidal areas; Delft 3D; Morphodynamic equilibrium; sediment transport pathways; Morphodynamic modeling; subtidal areas; ebb-tidal delta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","DELTA21",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the residential sector, natural gas has been the main consumed energy resource for surface heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) during cold seasons, and substituting this energy carrier with electricity from renewable resources imposes challenges not only in economic but also technical terms. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable sources, the electricity production will fluctuate causing a mismatch between the electricity supply and demand. Therefore, this fluctuation in the electricity supply must be mitigated to prevent instability in the transmission and distribution grids. In this context, the integration of flexible energy devices such as heat pumps (HP), electric vehicles (EV), and batteries (BES) within demand response programs present as a promising option to reduce the effects of intermittent electricity production from renewable resources for the residential and transportation sectors. In this thesis, an integrated energy system formed by PV panels, EV, BES, and a HP coupled with thermal storage tanks (TES) has been studied. The research aimed to minimize the total energy costs by scheduling the optimal power consumption of each device using a demand response program based on electricity price signals. This control scheme allowed to determine the optimal energy consumption of the HP and its flexibility potential. This has been achieved by developing a HP-TES model to satisfy the SH and DHW demands of a typical Dutch household. Then, the HP-TES model was implemented into a second model developed by Wiljan Vermeer and Gautham Ram which described the functioning of the PV-BES-EV systems. With this, an NLP optimization problem to minimize the total energy costs of the all-electric system was formulated and solved in GAMS. Three different scenarios were studied: a base case where no demand response program is used, a demand response case with a high feed-in tariff (FIT), and a demand response case with a reduced FIT. The HP coupled to a TES produced a load shifting potential, where its power consumption was optimally scheduled to happen at times of low electricity prices to charge the storage tanks. Thus, at times of high electricity prices, the HP remained OFF and the thermal demand of the building was entirely met by the storage system. It was calculated that the HP did not operate for 9.45 h/per day during 5 days in winter season, shifting in total 56 kWh of energy towards low demand times. Finally, it was found that in the high FIT scenario, the system’s strategy to minimize the energy costs consisted of purchasing and injecting energy at low and high prices, respectively. It was calculated that a 49% in cost savings could be achieved in this scenario compared to the base case. On the other hand, in the reduced FIT case, the system’s energy intake was reduced, and no energy was injected to the grid, resulting in 44% in cost reduction.","Heat pumps; Demand Response; Thermal energy storage; Renewable Energy Integration; Cost minimisation; V2G","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Homem de Almeida Correia, G. (mentor); Liao, F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Cities of the Netherlands are the driving forces to develop and encompass a cluster of markets that boost productivity. In recent times, cities have tended to demonstrate the rapid transformation, more spatially dispersed and growing in demand for transportation. Reasonably, all the trips done intra-city are short-distance trips (i.e. trips less than 10km) accounting for approximately 30% of a person’s total trips per month.To make these short-distance trips for various trip purposes, the majority of the Dutch people prefer using their private cars or private bike. Thus, over the years, the usage of private transportation in the Netherlands has increased leading to an upsurge in roadway congestion and lack of parking space. The observations from the literature suggest that more than 50% of car usage for different trip purposes are non-essential and could be shifted to ‘other modes’. Further, short-distance mobility poses as a core challenge for sustainable mobility, accounting for 60% of emissions in the city.Therefore, there is a need for sustainable transportation and this could be achieved by providing Mobility as a Service (in short MaaS) which could be defined as “A service attributed to integrate various forms of transport services into a solo mobility service, accessible on demand”It is a novel approach to service bundling enabled technology that facilitates the usage of multiple means for travel. It has recently attracted more interest and it is observed that the notion of MaaS tends to be linked to the context of multi-modal transportation. However, it is still unknown regarding the true influence of MaaS for unimodal (i.e. short-distance) trips, spurring a clear gap in the available literature on MaaS. Hence, the main research question for the study is formulated as follows“What is the preference of Dutch people, regarding MaaS mobility package as a transportation alternative (to status-quo mobility pattern), for carrying out short-distance trips?”To achieve the goal, a web-based survey is carried out and there were 3 choice experiments. The survey had two parts. The first part consisted a stated preference (SP) experiment, while the second part collected information for a wide range of socio-economic variables and attitudinal questions. The survey was sent out to Dutch people via email (in the Netherlands) and about 555 respondents filled out the survey substantially. The data of respondents who spent 15 minutes to complete the survey were considered (remaining were considered as outliers) for further analysis because the survey was lengthy.To deepen the knowledge, the final dataset is then used for estimating consumer utility by applying a multinomial logit model, nested logit, and mixed logit model. The knowledge from the final mixed logit model is further applied to get insight into different latent classes and the probable share of MaaS class by applying the latent class model. The results on the attributes’ influence on the choice were mostly consistent and of the expected sign. In all the three models, the subscription pricing, as well as time parameters (i.e. access/waiting time), have a negative coefficient indicating dislike towards higher mobility expenses or access/waiting time in the process of carrying out a short trip. Regarding socio-demographics, it is observed that younger and mid-age people have a significant inclination towards using the MaaS mobility package. Alternatively, older people have shown a higher preference for using private transportation to carry out short-distance trips. Highly educated people are more inclined to use the MaaS package though being aware of the environment and traffic-related problems.People having a higher car trip usage for short-distance trips are more inclined to subscribe MaaS package. Similarly, in the scenario of the bike, people with high bike trip usage per month tend to find it convenient to use a private bike. However, for person with fewer number of bike trips (like less than 20 trips per month), tends to be preferring MaaS subscription package.For MaaS package with car included, higher-income group tend to have an inclination towards it whereas lower-income group are inclined towards integrated package with only bike as mode of transportation. Furthermore, regarding the attitudinal factors, people who are open-minded, tech-loving, always compare products, enthusiastic, and love traveling have a positive contribution to the choice for MaaS mobility package. The study also, reveals that people are highly sensitive towards the subscription price and are willingness to pay more towards reducing waiting or access time of shared vehicles in MaaS package.There is noticeable preference heterogeneity regarding preference for the MaaS subscription package. The same has been identified with the application of the LC model. The results from the LC model suggest a lower share of the MaaS alternative in comparison to the status-quo mobility pattern (like use of private car, private bike, etc.) for short-distance trips. Regarding the probable discrete preference profiles: people who are young and mid-aged people (&lt;60 years), earning mid-level income (between 20,000 to 60,000 euros per year), residing with one or two family members, and have a high educational background (WO or HBO) possess a high likelihood to be a MaaS subscriber. In comparison between single-mode shared mobility package and MaaS integrated package, the study reveals a higher preference of Dutch people towards later. Nonetheless, the aggregate preference remains high for the private mode of transportation (for both primary/secondary choice). The estimated results from models reveal lower share of MaaS class for which it is currently realized that for the MaaS service to become popular, it shall take further time and familiarity to build upon the trust of people and bring about change in individual mobility preferences. There is a need for greater subsidy to MaaS initiatives (at the initial stage) to gain popularity. This has been the contribution of the study to the literature.","MaaS; Latent Class Cluster Analysis; Mixed Logit Model; MNL model; NL model; short-distance; Mobility; Transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-25","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The majority of the emissions from geothermal energy are related to formation gas, for the majority consisting of CO2 and methane (CH4). The amount of (resulting) CO2 emissions due to formation gas is determined by the composition and quantity of the gas, which depends on the location of the well. Ten technologies for dealing with formation gas are identiﬁed. A multi-criteria analysis is executed to determine the preferred solution. The analysis compares the solutions on two quantitative criteria, ﬁnances and CO2 emissions, and three qualitative criteria, robustness, degree of required technological developments and difﬁculty of operating. The CO2 emissions in this study are allocated based on the polluter pays principle, where the polluter is responsible for the emitted CO2 and the costs to prevent it. A base case in the Netherlands is assessed to compare the technologies on these ﬁve criteria. All technologies considered were able to substantially reduce CO2 emissions. Depending on the ratio of CO2 to methane, either re-injecting gases while kept in solution (under pressure technology) or any of the gas use with CO2 injection technologies are preferred. The more expensive solutions (i.e. combined heat and power plant with CO2 injection) also yield more income, making the assessment strongly inﬂuenced by changes to price and subsidies. The analysis showed that the results could be strongly inﬂuenced by uncertainties in the future, mainly uncertainties regarding subsidies, sale of gas, CO2 transport, and future technological developments.","Geothermal heat; Formation gas; Multi-criteria analysis; Techno-economic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This decision poses a challenge for local governments (municipalities) which have to organize a heat supply that is natural gas-free. Energy models can decrease the complexity of this challenge, but some challenges hinder the effective use of energy models for heat transition decision-making. The present study aims to bridge current knowledge gaps by providing insight into the advantages and limitations of using energy models in the heating transition and by providing recommendations for more effective use. To this end, literature on energy models, data-driven policy design and good modelling practices is reviewed, and case studies are conducted, including ten Dutch municipalities and 23 (expert) interviews. According to interviewees data, advantages of using energy models in heating transition projects are that the modelling process provides perspective for action, financial and socio-economic insights, transparency and legitimacy and means to start useful discussions. Perceived limitations include that models and modelling results are considered too abstract for local analysis, not user-friendly and complex. The present study concludes that the use of energy models in heating transition projects can become more effective by developing and preserving knowledge regarding energy modelling at municipalities, by providing more user-friendly models and/or model interfaces, by developing more efficient data collection processes at municipalities, by improving heat source, energy use and thermal insulation level data sets, by offering comparative modelling studies and by ensuring model developers collaborate and specialize more.","Energy Modelling; Municipality; Multi-model Ecologies; Heating transition; Modelling practice; Data-Driven Policy Design; Local Policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Without treatment, the heart rhythm usually becomes permanently disrupted and can lead to various heart related complications as stroke or heart failure. Cardiac phantoms are needed for the development of electrophysiological instruments and for training and education of electrophysiologist. A tissue mimicking phantom is an accurate model of organs or tissues mimicking the real life like scenario for a desired goal. Currently, no cardiac phantoms are available containing all requirements needed. Therefore, as a first step towards an applicable cardiac phantom for development of electrophysiology studies, this Master Thesis focused on the design of an anatomically anthropomorphic left atrium (LA) phantom mimicking the dielectric properties of human heart tissue in the frequency range of 10 kHz – 20 kHz. To assess this research goal, the objective was divided into 3 subgoals: 1. Evaluate different tissue mimicking materials with additives to meet the main phantom requirements. Three promising types of phantoms were examined: agar-, gellan gum- and polyvinyl alcohol-cryogel-based (PVA-C) phantoms. The dielectric properties and stiffness of the phantoms were manipulated by varying the concentrations of materials and by using additives. Graphite powder, charcoal powder, salt and sodium acetate were examined for increasing the electrical conductivity and oil, sugar and PVC for decreasing its relative permittivity.2. Extensively evaluate the most promising cardiac phantom materials. The most promising hantom tissue materials, based on the main phantom requirements, was used for the final design of a LA phantom. The cardiac phantom was prepared four times for extensive examination based on all phantom requirements.3. Develop a phantom design with comparable anatomy. <br/>As a last step, the phantom was fabricated with comparable anatomy. In this part, a suitable mould was prepared in order to get a hollow shaped phantom. <br/><br/>Results<br/>A 13,0wt% PVA, 0,15wt% salt and 0,05wt% sodium acetate and tap water solution was used for the final LA phantom design. The flexible cardiac phantom is easily made, affordable and has a shelf life of at least 1 month. The average difference between the target values and the mean of all four prepared cardiac phantom samples is 21.9% and 15.0% for permittivity and conductivity, respectively. Storing the phantoms in an aqueous liquid results in diffusion of salt and sodium acetate and water absorption of the phantom material. Stability is reached after 1 week. Finally, a cylinder-shaped hollow cardiac phantom is produced, with the use of a 3D printed mould, as comparable shape of the LA. <br/>Producing a cardiac phantom of PVA is proved to be a good model. This research shows the design of a low cost, easily produced hollow shaped cardiac phantom consisting of 13.0wt% PVA, 0.15wt% salt and tap water. Even though more future work needs to be done for the development of a cardiac phantom, this research functions as a proof of concept for the development of a flexible phantom with possibilities to manipulate the dielectric properties and to create a hollow shaped phantom. The use of PVA as tissue mimicking material (TMM) and the use of 3D printed PVA for creation of the hollow shapes shows promising results for future development.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A large number of these correlations can be found across the literature, each of them yielding a different outcome for the parameter value. This results in a high variability of the potential results, which is not necessarily properly accounted for in the current geotechnical engineering practice. A new approach using graphs has recently been proposed by van Berkom [1] to automatically generate multiple parameter values based on a given set of correlations and equations. The present thesis assesses the quality of the estimates obtained from this new graph system and investigates how multiples outcomes can be combined into a unique result. The quality of the parameter’s estimates is appraised both in terms of accuracy or uncertainty, and in terms of validity. The combination of results from multiple methods showed that it is possible to either build confidence or distrust in the combined outcome depending of the consistency of the contributing results. As a result, this framework enabled a quantitative description of the inter-correlations variability. The conceptual framework has been then applied to geotechnical parameters and CPT-based correlations for coarse-grained soils. The range of applicability of the correlations (e.g. soil type, state of consolidation) is a critical factor that actively influences the final outcome of the system. This automatic system demonstrated its ability to produce parameter values relatively close to<br/>the values obtained with the current practices. Further validation is required to assess the overall performance of the system on a broader scale.","parameter determination; Graphs; Combination of forecasts; Model averaging; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-21","","","","","Automatic Parameter Determination",""

Over the last years low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) equipment has faced rapid and important development opening a new door to reliable and high accuracy positioning applications such as structural health monitoring (SHM). This study focuses on assessing, from a geodetic perspective, the capabilities of a pair of low-cost dual frequency GNSS receivers for capturing the kinematic response of structures to wind. An experiment has been carried out with a stainless steel cantilever beam, aiming to highlight the advantages of employing a differential GNSS system for monitoring low frequency changes in the structure’s body. Hence, in this context the nominal precision of the GNSS system in East, North and Up direction of 4, 5 and 10 millimeter (1σ), was further improved to 3, 4 and 8 miilimeters in the presence of a Global Positioning System (GPS) based multipath (MP) correction. However, it is safer to consider that the true displacement retention potential of the low-cost GNSS receivers corresponds to 3 times (3σ) the aforementioned standard deviation values, resulting in slightly larger than 1 centimeter detectable horizontal displacements, and up to 2.4 centimeters vertical displacements. To support this, wind-induced beam displacements of up to 1.9 centimeters were identified and attested based on a cross correlation analysis with meteorological information. Next, the architecture of a GNSS based SHM system is proposed that can detect structural displacements in real time and rise safety alarms. Therefore, with real time kinematic (RTK) differential positioning and a position outlier and slip statistical testing procedure, a clear strategy for the estimation and identification of uni- or tri-dimensional displacement quantities in real time is proposed, to rise alarms about the magnitude and the direction of identified displacements. Hence, there is no doubt that newly released low-cost dual frequency GNSS receivers represent an alternative to high-end geodetic equipment for SHM, by offering an optimal balance between precision and cost efficiency.","GNSS Positioning; low cost; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); geodesy; Damage detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The impacts of this are seen within our environment and felt by many. It can be said that the need to achieve circularity within the built environment is at its peak right now. Within the construction industry, the initiation and the pre-preparation phase for a circular building allow for greater flexibility for thinking and re-thinking the entire process of a circular building from the beginning to the end of life phase (re-use of components to identifying methods of disassembly). The addition of circular ambitions will escalate the trade-offs which have to be made between quality, price, sustainability and durability. Along with this the team is riled with a plethora of opportunities (re-use of components to methods of disassembly) to lead to different final outcomes, unlike a regular project where the project team can choose between well-understood options. In addition to the crucial trade-offs, the term circularity is perceived subjectively by stakeholders. Developing a consensus on the meaning of circularity and further operationalizing the ambitions can be remarked to be a daunting task. Further, the topic of circularity is still a novice in the construction industry and has the potential for high levels of innovation. To summarize, the addition of circular ambitions within the projects demands an environment of learning, exploration, ideation and experimentation. Implementation of a Stage gate or Waterfall approaches as a solution might not be an optimal solution. The lack of a commonly accepted strategy has resorted both clients and practitioners to try various methods thereby creating ambiguity regarding the process in the initiation. This could result in increasing the time spent upfront in trying to create a process for each project individually. Witnessing these problems, the research focuses on addressing the gap that there lacks a commonly accepted strategy to realize shared understanding and ambitions which are vital to incorporate circular principles within the built environment. The gap is explored within the solution space of design thinking. Within the scope of the research, a strategy is developed in which it becomes clear how the various design thinking methods available in theory can be implemented in the initiation phase. Through the developed strategy, a shared sense of understanding of the goals and ambitions will be created. Such an approach can be said to aid in realizing the circular ambitions of the commissioner. Using this strategy will also result in an exploration of other potential possibilities that are present within the project environment. Additionally, it serves as a structure that can be used by consultants for solving the client’s dilemma in the process of realizing circular ambitions. The strategy attempts at bringing order to the chaos by creating clarity within the initiation phase by prescribing design thinking attributes as a way to realize circular ambitions. The potential of this strategy lies within the initiation phase wherein extensive exploration and problem analysis through different perspectives or lenses are facilitated to achieve the highest level of circularity.","Circularity; Built Environment; Circular building projects; Initiation Phase; Design Thinking; Strategy; Consultant-Client; Project Management; Circular ambitions; Design based research; Double Diamond method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The variations in the scenarios such as camera viewpoints, resolution, occlusion, and illumination make the problem non-trivial. Manually annotating bounding boxes in such large-scale datasets is cost-inefficient. Additionally, due to crowdedness and occlusion in the videos, aligning the identity of runners across multiple disjoint cameras is a challenge. We collected a novel large-scale in-the-wild video dataset of marathon runners. The dataset consists of hours of recording of thousands of runners captured using 42 hand-held smartphone cameras and covering real-world scenarios. Due to the presence of crowdedness and occlusion in the videos, the annotation of runners becomes a challenging task. We propose a new scheme for tackling the challenges in the annotation of such large dataset. Our technique reduces the overall cost of annotation in terms of time as well as budget. We demonstrate performing fps analysis to reduce the effort and time of annotation. We investigate several annotation methods for efficiently generating tight bounding boxes. Our results prove that interpolating bounding boxes between keyframes is the most efficient method of bounding box generation amongst several other methods and is 3x times faster than the naive baseline method. We introduce a novel way of aligning the identity of runners in disjoint cameras. Our inter-camera alignment tool integrated with the state-of-the-art person re-id system proves to be sufficient and effective in the alignment of the runners across multiple cameras with non-overlapping views. Our proposed framework of annotation reduces the annotation cost of the dataset by a factor of 16x, also effectively aligning 93.64\% of the runners in the cross-camera setting.","dataset; annotation; marathon; cameras; object detection; bib detection; interpolation; cross-camera alignment; person re-identification; computer vision; object tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), users are able to observe a virtual world that is rendered based on their physical movement and actions. A common solution for capturing the visual and geometric information needed for the construction of virtual environments is the use of RGB-D sensors. These sensors not only capture a collection of RGB data like conventional cameras do, but additionally record a depth value for each pixel. Thus, RGB-D sensors are able to capture both the visual and geometric properties of a space, including any objects or people. This makes immersive social VR experiences possible, where people in different physical locations can be placed in the same virtual environment. However, HMDs obstruct the RGB-D sensor from capturing the wearer's upper face, which severely impacts the social aspects of VR applications. To address this, we proposed a framework that is capable of the virtual removal of head-mounted displays in RGB-D images, which is referred to as the task of HMD removal. Due to its novelty, we took an exploratory approach to this task. We formulated this problem as a joint RGB-D face image inpainting task and proposed a GAN-based coarse-to-fine architecture that is capable of simultaneously filling in the missing color and depth information of face images occluded by an HMD. To preserve the identity features of the inpainted faces, we proposed an RGB-based identity loss function. Leveraging the knowledge of a pretrained identity embedding model, this perceptual loss function stimulates the preservation of identity-specific facial features. Furthermore, we proposed several architectural structures to explore multimodal feature fusion of the color and depth information contained in RGB-D images. To this end, we introduced data-level fusion, which naively combines the color and depth information at network input. In addition, we introduced hybrid fusion, which involves feature-level fusion in the coarse stage of the architecture and data-level fusion in the refinement stage of the architecture. Within the concept of hybrid fusion, we investigated several fusion strategies, including residual fusion. Our findings suggest that data-level fusion achieves similar performance to hybrid fusion.<br/><br/>Moreover, to improve surface reproduction in the depth channel, we introduced the employment of a surface normal loss function and contextual surface attention module, which both rely on surface normals that are estimated based on the depth channel of the RGB-D image. We also considered the addition of surface normal information to the discriminator input, which we found to have an adverse effect on the visual quality of the results.<br/><br/>In absence of a large scale RGB-D face dataset, we devised a pipeline for the creation of a synthetic RGB-D face dataset for the evaluation of our network. Despite its exploratory nature, our research provides unique insights into the design and behavior of a multimodal image inpainting architecture that can be of interest to future research.","Virtual reality; Generative adversarial networks; Social VR; Image inpainting; Image completion; Multimodal representation learning; RGB-D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These structures contain material interfaces, and at these interfaces, the structure exhibits non-smooth field behavior which is known as weak discontinuity. It is essential to study the effects of such discontinuities on the performance of the structure. These structures are usually modeled with standard finite element method (FEM) with fitted or geometry conforming meshes to the discontinuities. Shear locking is a key hurdle to overcome in FEM when using first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for thin structures. Classical beam (Euler-Bernoulli) or plate (Kirchhoff-Love) theories do not face such issues but ignore shear deformation and set the requirement of shape functions that are C1 continuous. The popular mesh independent method, eXtended/Generalized finite element method (X/GFEM) has also been used to capture the kinematics of discontinuous thin structures that are also devoid of locking. The presented work introduces a high-order discontinuity-enriched finite element formulation for linear and nonlinear (large deformations) discontinuous FSDT beam and plate elements. High-order interpolations are used to mitigate shear locking. The high-order enrichment functions are constructed by using hierarchical shape functions of the p-version of FEM (p-FEM), where the linear enrichment function is obtained from the interface enriched generalized finite element method (IGFEM) is combined with hierarchical shape functions of p-FEM. Convergence study shows that the proposed method accurately captures the discontinuity kinematics leading to an exact solution when compared with the analytical solution. A high condition number of the stiffness matrix is observed in the stability study which leads to loss of stability. A Jacobi like diagonal preconditioner is used to reduce the condition number but does not work well for high-order interpolations.","p-IGFEM; p-FEM; Timoshenko beam theory; Mindlin-Reissner Plate; FSDT; enriched FEM; thin-walled structures; Shear locking; Non-Linear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The latter might result in disengagement and decreased productivity and thus in illness-related absenteeism. The people pillar of sustainability aims to create a healthy workplace and thus to manage illness-related absenteeism. The objective of this research was to optimise the responsibilities of the surgical team members in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in order to achieve a balanced and sustainable employability of the surgical team to counteract waste of talent and skills. Empirical data was collected in two different steps. In the first place, an overview of the surgical phases during the MIS procedure and an overview of the tasks performed by the perioperative nurses were made. In the second place, two different methods were used to obtain data. First, seven video recordings of a laparoscopic gynaecological procedure were analysed to obtain the distribution of the responsibilities and the percentage of (technical) tasks for each phase and the entire MIS procedure. Second, interviews with fourteen perioperative nurses were conducted to map the peak moments of a MIS procedure and to evaluate the impact of the technological developments on the nurse's workload. As a result, a fluctuation of the total duration of all tasks during the procedure was shown. A percentage higher than 70% was measured in the start phase. The perioperative nurses experienced low peak moments during 66% of the entire surgical procedure. A high impact of the technological developments was experienced by the nurses. The physical activity for MIS and robot-assisted surgery (RAS) was lower than a conventional open procedure (OS). The total duration of the technical tasks was highest in the second phase of the MIS procedure. The nurses indicated that this phase took longer compared to the same phase in OS procedures because of the amount of equipment that has to be connected. In conclusion, an unbalanced employability was recognised during MIS and technological developments had a high impact on the activities of the perioperative nurses. This research has several recommendations. First, a more sustainable employability will be achieved when two perioperative nurses will be scheduled for three surgical procedures during 66% of the MIS procedure. Second, deployment of a technical perioperative nurse will decrease the amount of workload. Last, by giving the perioperative nurses more responsibilities in MIS, the talent and skills will not be wasted leading to a more balanced employability of the surgical team members.","Sustainability; Employability; Workload; Operating room; Surgical team members","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(Simplified) approaches are available within professional practice to analyse the risk of liquefaction, but are considered to be conservative. In this thesis, a methodology is formulated to model the key aspects of liquefaction of a soil layer underneath a dike system subjected to cyclic loading by an onshore wind turbine. The key aspects are defined as: cyclic loading, soil-structure interaction and consolidation behaviour. A modification to the model of Seed and Rahman (1978) is implemented in this thesis.<br/>The applicable modelling conditions (quasi-static or dynamic) are investigated for the current situation. The analysis is performed using analytic and numerical models (Plaxis 2D). Both models conclude that the loads induced by the wind turbine can be modelled as quasi-static as the loads are sufficiently slow to neglect inertia effects. The influence of the cyclic loads by the wind turbine on the liquefiable soil layer is determined by the Cyclic Stress Ratio (CSR). The influence due to the soil-structure interaction is determined using a Finite Element Analysis (Plaxis 2D). The Hardening Soil small strain model gives a more accurate prediction of the CSR in the soil, as the soil response is stiffer during un/re-loading. The presence of the embankment results in various modes of shearing in the soil, e.g. triaxial compression, triaxial extension and direct simple shear. The CSR does not include the effect of static shear stresses and various modes of shearing in the soil. This effect should rather be accounted by the Cyclic Resistance Ratio (CRR). The consolidation behaviour modelled using the model of Seed and Rahman (1978) which applies the consolidation equation with generation term. The model is able to model partial consolidation, which is defined as a state where excess pore pressures can be generated and dissipate simultaneously. The generation term is based on an empirical relationship of the development of pore pressures. The model is implemented using a Finite Difference Method in a cylindrical coordinate system to represent the dissipation behaviour of a granular soil. The method allows to model the consolidation characteristics in radial and vertical direction, a layered soil, the load intensity and the loading frequency. As a result, the maximum pore pressure ratio in the soil reduces. A limitation of the model is its uncoupled nature. Therefore, no strains are determined. The constitutive behaviour inherent to the liquefaction phenomena, such as plastic deformations, is lacking. Oostpolderdijk is used as a case study to compare the modified method of Seed and Rahman (1978) to the reference engineering method and the method of Boulanger and Idriss (2014). The comparison with Boulanger and Idriss (2014) suggests that the modified model gives reasonable results. The application of the modified method results in a more favourable result compared to the reference engineering method. However, a sensitivity analysis shows that liquefaction can’t be ruled out because the sensitivity to permeability is high.","Liquefaction; Onshore wind; Embankment; Dike; Cyclic loading; pore pressure; Numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

They would like to see a change, but they do not know how to obtain it. On the other hand, politicians promise changes that are hardly or too slow implemented, reinforcing the perception that the political system is an immutable static entity despite democracy is a dynamic process. Despite numerous initiatives undertaken by organisations and private citizens, aim to turn the tide, they fail to trigger significant changes.In this scenario, where citizens are questioning the current quality of democracy, while some are discouraged in manifesting their concerns, others are pushed to ask for participation extension and shared governance firmly. However, they perceive how they currently lack adequate instruments capable of bridging the noisy flows of information and enabling their request to shared governance come across.From here the relevance of this thesis which aims to apply a conjoint combination of strategic mid-set, interaction practices and design for democracy purposes to investigate how to bridge the current gap in the relationship between citizens and the political system and design a solution (desirable, feasible and viable) to enable society in achieving the democratic future they aim for. Thanks to the insights obtained from the extensive multidisciplinary research have been possible to harvest evidence concerning how the current gap is nurtured by the lack of reciprocal information, communication and education which affects citizens and politicians alike. Therefore the importance of realising an intervention at the interaction level capable of providing citizens and governmental institutions with the adequate instruments to establish anongoing bi-directional interaction which will enable to bridge public opinion and share governance representing an extension in participation beyond the moment of voting.Upon this goal, ideation and further data collection led to the realization of DEMO as final design articulated on three concepts: DEMO App for citizens, DEMOs Software for institutions and DEMOc Community, a “sub-partes” guarantor for adequate technical functioning and ethical usage of all the parts.Validation shade light about the authentic potential that an instrument like DEMO would have in improving the dynamics (in terms of information, communication and collaboration) and so the overall relationship between citizens and the political system across societal segments and institutional levels. Although several limitations have been identified regarding the ethical sustainability of the concept (which have been addressed in the dedicate reflection section) results remarked the capability of DEMO in activating the participatory spirit in respondents which declared to have lost it.In light of the positive reactions harvested along with its development, DEMO, as an overall concept, aspires to bring further the discussion about how to enable society to achieve a democratic future in which public opinion is bridged, and governance is incrementally shared between institutions and citizens at local, regional, national &amp; international level.In the end, everything starts with an attempt; everything starts with a DEMO.","democracy; socio-politics; strategic-interaction design; shared governance; public opinion; information; communication; collaboration; App","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Replacing the superconducting magnets of conventional scanners with standard ones can significantly reduce the costs, but it also has a negative impact on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). In order to circumvent this problem, Super Resolution (SR) techniques may be used. In this thesis, standard and Deep Learning (DL) SR techniques are presented. For standard SR, two types of regularization are considered: Tikhonov and Total Variation (TV). Then, the problemis solved using CGLS and ADMM algorithms respectively. From our analysis, we could conclude that TV outperforms Tikhonov regularization, yielding promising results. Then, two 2D DL models, SRCNN and ReCNN, were implemented and trained on two commonly used SR datasets: T91 and Kirby21. Both networks managed to reconstruct the LR scans surprisingly well, with ReCNN yielding the best results when trained on both datasets. DL methods evidently outperform standard SR and can achieve a visual quality comparable to the one of a scan directly acquired in higher resolution. A 3D extension of these networks was also considered, but, although it led to an improvement, it did not perform as well as the 2D models.

There are periods where there is excess energy production than needed and periods of energy shortage where not enough energy is produced to meet the demand. To mitigate this mismatch, a short term solution is to use batteries in order to store energy at times where energy production is more than the energy demand. This stored energy would be later used at times where energy production is low and meet the energy demand. However, the current battery technology is still novel for this application making it uneconomical when compared to current energy infrastructure of using power plants. The current battery market is held by Li-ion batteries which uses lithium as a raw material which is a rare earth material. In 2009, a battery cell utilizing Si as its anode and air as its cathode was discovered. As this system relies on two of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust which is silicon and oxygen and has much higher theoretical energy density than Li-ion batteries, it has become a growing area of research and development. Battery models are created to simulate battery operations based on empirical formulas and electrochemical reactions taking place in the battery. Development of these models are very critical as they provide results and optimum condition evaluations much faster than physical testing with minimal resources. A battery model for the alkaline Si-air battery which utilizes KOH as the cell electrolyte is developed in Simscape (MATLAB) as part of this thesis. The modelling parameters are also subjected various physical conditions such as varying electrolyte concentration and change in electrode materials and the variation is investigated for model validation to study whether changing physical conditions of the Si-air cell has an effect on the modelling cell parameters. It is supported with experimental results obtained from discharging a fabricated Si-air cell. It was concluded that there are cell parameters which are dependent only on the state of charge (SOC) of the cell and one cell parameter that is a function of both the SOC as well as the discharge profile of the cell. The fabricated Si-air cell gives higher open-circuit potential (OCP) values than what was reported constant 1.4 V in literature which is speculated to be due to the usage of a 99% Aluminum and 1% Silicon (Al:Si) back contact layer. Average OCPs ranging from 1.5 V to 1.45 V which varies due to change in electrolyte (KOH) concentration is achieved. The MATLAB battery block is calibrated to be integrated with energy system models as a Si-air battery.","Battery; Battery technology; Si-air; Metal-air; Alkaline battery; Simulink; Simscape; MATLAB; Battery management system; Silicon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Si-air Battery",""

To allow these models to be realistic it is commonly fitted using a dataset containing labeled samples. When obtaining a label for a sample from the environment is expensive, it is key that the dataset contains only those samples that aid in providing a realistic model the most. Active Learning (AL) provides searching strategies for selecting these samples based on different heuristics: diversity, informativeness, and representativeness. This thesis focuses specifically on population-based AL for regression, where both sample and output space are infinite. Its goal is to create a performant, efficient, extensible, and generally applicable selection strategy for this setting. To allow for the latter a black-box model, through which its strategy can be used with virtually any model. The strategy itself is modular, allowing for extensions. This strategy iteratively concentrates on an interesting subregion within the sampling space through three modular steps: discretizing the sample space, providing fitness scores to this discretization, and restricting the sample space based on these fitness scores further. This strategy is applied to both a scientific polynomial setting, as well as a car-following setting. Experiments show that this approach outperforms randomly selecting a sample in both cases, especially when a long labeling time is considered.","Active Learning; Population-based; Black-Box regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Promising variables like Range of Motion, Muscle Force, Ball Speed and Training Time were included for use in a supervised classification problem. Prediction accuracy performance was then measured for different algorithms in the form of F1 and F2 scores. Results showed deficient performance for injury prediction using single-point-in-time measurements for all examined algorithms, with scores of both F1 and F2 reaching maximums of 0.5. The results, however, revealed the importance of measuring variables like hip force and hip range of motion for shoulder injury prediction, and force in the hip and shoulder together with the total rotational motion (TRM) of the shoulder for elbow injury prediction. Ball speed and training time contributed less for the tested models. Higher frequency data is needed for better injury prediction performance. Future studies are recommended to measure data with a time between measurements of one to two weeks. This high frequency makes it possible to use time-series analysis to detect slight asymptomatic pathology developments progressing over time, to help youth baseball pitchers avoid injuries and keep their performance ready for top-level play.","shoulder injury; elbow injury; range of motion; maximum contraction force; ball speed; training time; decision tree; logistic regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Model Predictive Control (MPC) has shown promising results in the control of urban traffic networks, but has one major drawback. The, often nonlinear, optimization that has to be performed at every control time step is computationally too complex to use MPC controllers for real-time implementations (i.e. when the online optimization is performed within the control time interval of the controlled system). This thesis proposes a parametrized MPC control approach to lower the computational complexity of the MPC controllers and to strive for real-time implementability. In parametrized MPC, the original decision variables (i.e. the inputs of the system) become a function of a parametrized control law and the parameters of this control law become the new decision variables of the optimization problem. The goal is to lower the computational complexity by reducing the number of decision variables with limited performance decrease. In this thesis, three parametrized control laws are proposed that can be used in the parametrized MPC approach for urban traffic networks. These three control laws are constructed based on the prediction model of the (parametrized) MPC controller, on ART-UTC, an existing control method, and by using supervised learning. The system performance and computational complexity of the different parametrized MPC controllers are compared to that of a conventional MPC controller by performing an extensive simulation-based case study in which different optimization algorithms, emissions, and parameter update time steps are considered. The simulation results show that the control law based on the prediction model results in a parametrized MPC controller which is real-time implementable, uses 2 parameters that are constant over the control horizon per intersection, and has a system performance decrease of less than 3%.","Model Predictive Control; Urban Traffic Control; Parametrized Controller; Parametrized Model Predictive Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This presents a mild to severe discomfort in babies, resulting in inconsolable crying for an unusually long period of time. Such crying impacts negatively not only the baby (disturbing the sleeping pattern) but also the parents (sleep deprivation, depression). The current solutions usually require medication or an invasive approach with alternative treatments lacking objective evidence in solving this problem. Time and again, science has demonstrated the potential benefits of Kangaroo care (KC), also called parental skin-to-skin care, for relieving infantile colic. KC is known to calm the infants by stabilizing their heart and breathing rate when in distress. Nevertheless, KC can be a hindrance to many parents and extremely time consuming with hours of sessions needed. Past research on the possibility to artificially mimic breathing, warmth &amp; skin-like feel and the users’ perceptions towards these human-likeness experiences indicate there is a potential to implement such KC elements successfully onto a device. This could drastically ease the burden on the parents. The aim of this thesis is, therefore, to design and develop a device that is able to mimic the parental skin-to-skin Kangaroo Care (KC) elements such as the breathing, skin-like feel and the warmth of a parent for inconsolable-crying babies. In order to develop the device, four conceptual designs were first formulated and evaluated based on morphological analysis. Out of these designs, the most affordable and safest design was selected to prototype based on Harris profile. Two iterations of the prototype were created by means of 3D printing. The first prototype was an experimental setup constituting only the main inner breathing and warmth mechanism. All technical validations such as delivery of the breathing movement and load bearing measurements, were performed on this setup. This prototype was further assessed for any risks. Accordingly, risk mitigation and hazard control measures were implemented in the design of the second prototype. In order to complete the device, the second prototype constituted the improved version of the inner mechanism, skin-like layer as well as the cosmetic components. This prototype was then used for validation with parents and babies. The validation study was to understand how babies interacted and accepted a prototype with features such as breathing, warmth and skin as compared to being placed on a normal pillow and on their own parent performing Kangaroo Care. An assessment was conducted by both the parent and the researcher using visual indicators to analyse the baby’s emotions and behaviour in each case. The results demonstrated a successful scenario where the babies displayed positive emotions on the prototype and negative emotions on the pillow and/or on the parent. It is imperative to mention that this project entails a grey zone where it is difficult to accurately understand what the baby is experiencing on the prototype. Nevertheless, this prototype was a good proof-of-concept revealing many insights in an optimistic direction. Further investigations in consultation with more parents as well as clinicians should form a pattern to establish stronger conclusions.","Kangaroo Care; Infantile colic; Babies; Smart pillow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-11","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

It is driven by an increasing demand of metals that are critical for the digital economy and modern technologies such as batteries. Methods for resource estimation of PN are known and commercially available. There is however no standard method of a planning a deep-sea mining operation. This is an essential step to define mineable reserves. To address this problem, an existing concept has been applied in this thesis. This planning concept was inspired by agriculture and subdivides a mining license area into large scale mining sites, which are in turn subdivided into smaller, continuouslymineable areas calledmining fields. The subdivision is illustrated in figure 1. The contribution of this thesis is the development of a methodology for this concept. The concept was applied to a framework based upon a license area in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean. The mining will be done using a Nodule Collector (NC), which is a self-propelled machine that continuously gathers PN on the ocean floor and transports them upwards to a vessel at the ocean surface. Certain areas are deemed constrained by slopes or nodule types. Mining sites wherein the NC will operate were outlined within the license area using those constraints and Nodule Abundance (NA).Within the mining sites, a new metric was introduced for assessing the mineability for the NC: the Straight-Line Distance (SLD). The next step down from mining sites are the mining fields. The operation of the NC within them is approximated by two different driving patterns. Different field shapes are also analyzed, along with the impact of obstacles inside the field. Different methods of creating fields inside the mining sites were considered. The procedure relied upon the SLD to define the boundaries between fields. Two sets of field are created: with elongated shape and compact shape. The best set of fields was selected using the approximation of NC operation. Lastly, a method for determining the sequence of fields is developed that uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as optimization method. It takes into account constraints for mining rate, operational hours, nodule targets and travelling time. The methods outlined in this thesis are flexible and can be applied in a variety of circumstances. The selection of mineable areas turns out to be the must crucial step. The subsequent delineation of mining fields and sequencing does not make or break the profitability of the operation, although they are essential steps for the definition of mineable reserves.","Deep-Sea Mining; Mining; Polymetallic Nodules; Mine Planning; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The growing population is accompanied by an increase in the global energy and resource demand. Biorefining can be considered a means to help meet these growing demands through a range of bio-based materials. A biorefinery approach for developing an upstream process for the production of valuable products from macroalgae would be essential to realize a feasible valorisation chain downstream, wherein these products can be tailored to various applications. On a global scale, the biorefinery concept incorporates mainly, terrestrial first and second-generation biomass which compete with food and other energy applications, as well as involving sustainability issues such as land use change. Third generation macroalgae or seaweed thus has tremendous scope within the biorefinery concept. Seaweed has rapid reproduction rates and can be cultivated with minimal resource inputs thereby offering the attractiveness of high biomass yields. This study deals with the sustainable fractionation of two seaweeds, namely, <i>Ulva lactuca </i>(green seaweed) and <i>Palmaria palmata </i>(red seaweed) for the extraction of rhamnose and xylose, respectively. These sugars are of interest as they can be used to produce 5-methylfurfural and furfural serving as platform chemicals for various applications, including fuel production. Focus is laid on alternative hydrolysis methods of low severity for the extraction of the targeted sugars including enzymatic hydrolysis, hot water treatment and hydrolysis with organic acids and chelating salts. The characterization of the seaweeds and determination of their biochemical compositions are performed by acid hydrolysis, after the application of pre-treatment steps like washing with water and soxhlet extractions in order to maximize the sugars recovered. These compositions then form a basis for the study of low severity and more sustainable hydrolysis methods.A series of low temperature enzymatic hydrolysis experiments are conducted in order to screen a number of potential enzymes for the two seaweed types, which led to enzyme selection for further investigation. It is followed by a study of the effect of operating conditions and parameters namely, the reaction temperature, the pH and enzyme dosage. Hydrolysis treatments with hot water, organic acids (acetic, formic, oxalic, citric) and chelating salts (sodium acetate, sodium citrate) are also conducted at different temperatures and for a selected range of reaction times. These are carried out in a multiclave, enabling the running of a large number of screening tests to determine the best combination of the hydrolysing agent, temperature and reaction time. The results from these low severity treatments and enzymatic hydrolysis tests are applied onto a larger reaction scale in order to implement a cascade biorefinery approach for the extraction of rhamnose and xylose. Hot water treatments at 120℃ and 140℃for the <i>Ulva lactuca</i> and <i>Palmaria palmata</i>, respectively are chosen as the feasible routes. As for the enzymatic hydrolysis studies, hydrolysis with<i> ‘X’</i> enzyme cocktail and <i>‘Y’ </i>at 50℃ are selected. Enzyme dosages of ‘a’ % and ‘b’%, respectively are deemed suitable for the release of the targeted sugars after 72 hours of hydrolysis.Ultimately, the cascading approach is applied to a larger amount of seaweed (1.5 kg) where the biomass is washed followed by subsequent centrifugation in a decanter-centrifuge to separate the washed seaweed. The washing liquid fraction is further fractionated through membrane filtration to recover MW fractions of &gt;100kDa, 100-1kDa and &lt;1kDa. The separated solids are thereafter subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis in the bioreactor as well as autoclave treatments at a 2-3L scale, in accordance with the conclusions from the screening treatments in order to further evaluate the scalability of the process. In this cascading approach, a complete mass balance of the seaweed biomass components of interest (sugars, inorganics, protein) is carried out in order to evaluate the efficiency of the cascade approach and maximize the same by realizing the potential of the by-product and residual streams.","macroalgae; biorefinery; seaweed; fractionation; hydrolysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-14","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

The low friction losses of the hydraulics make it an attractive alternative to a classical mechanic transmission using rigid linkages and Bowden cables. There are benefits and trade-offs associated with BP and myoelectric prostheses. For example, improved sensory feedback is a benefit of BP prostheses. In this paper we set out to design a hybrid hydraulic actuation system for the body-powered DCH by extending the BP system with electro-hydraulic assistance, attempting to combine benefits of both BP and electrically actuated prostheses. We designed the hydraulic circuit, using a miniature external gear pump driven by a brushless DC (BLDC) motor in combination with solenoid valves to control the hydraulic flow. Furthermore, we designed a custom circuit board with a microcontroller, connected to pressure sensors and tactile sensors on the fingertips, to control the valves and the pump by a PD controller. Finally, we designed a 3D printed forearm structure, supporting the components, that connects to the hand through a wrist mechanism, allowing a pronation angle of 90°. We developed the hybrid prototype and verified its functioning by conducting several experiments. The prototype required an activation force of 53.5 N and 280 N mm of work done, at the input cylinder, to achieve a pinch force of 15 N, which is an improvement compared to commercial BP prostheses. Furthermore, the prototype was able to exert a pinch force of 22.5 N at an activation force of 100 N, at limited motor power, which is not as high as some commercial BP prostheses. Finally, the closing time of the prototype is 233 ms for a full close and 165 ms for the fingers to touch the thumb. The mass of the full prosthesis system is 901 g, including the battery pack, and could be reduced to an estimated 650 g. Future steps include optimization and miniaturization of hydraulic and electronic components, and mechanical structure of the prototype, reducing its mass to an acceptable level. Finally, extensive user testing is required to further validate the design direction.","prosthesis; Hand; Hybrid; Hydraulic Actuation; body-powered prosthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

When a structure is forced at one of its eigenfrequencies it deforms into a corresponding shape leading to major deformations, which, in the worst-case scenario, can lead to collapse of the structure, as happened to the Tacoma Narrows bridge in 1940. It is thus very important to know the dynamic characteristics of a structure. For glass structures no specific limit values are defined, this is why it is interesting to investigate the dynamic behaviour of a glass bridge This thesis aims to predict the structural response of TU Delft’s Glass Truss Bridge when subjected to static and dynamic loads. The studied bridge is a footbridge, connecting the TU Delft campus to the Green Village, and is unique in the aspect that glass diagonals have been used in its construction. Through an iterative procedure of modeling, virtual testing and updating the model of the bridge, the dynamic response of the bridge is predicted. The study shows that the response of the bridge is between the European Guidelines’ limits for (steel) footbridges. Maximum acceleration of the bridge is found at 500mm/s and the lowest eigenfrequency is out of range of that of joggers. The sensitivity analysis shows that the parameters having the most influence on the bridge’s response are the diameter of the glass diagonals and the soil density. Using the outcome of the sensitivity analysis a dynamic testing protocol is recommended that outlines the optimal test setup for modal testing of the bridge. Through the simulated dynamic tests ten of the twenty eigenfrequencies of the bridge are found. For each of these frequencies, the damping is approach and modeshapes are reconstructed based on the imaginary plots of the Frequency Response Functions. The latter show a good correlation with the modeshapes obtained from the model.","Glass Bridge; Dynamics; Glass; hammer test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van Gelder, KB (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In current offshore wind turbine (WTG) tower installations, bolted flange connections are common. These connections are however reaching their limit due to the maximized size of the bolts. Also, bolted connections require the motions between the tower and foundation to be limited during installation, suggesting their workability of installation is low. The Double Slip Joint is a promising and innovative connection between a WTG tower and the support structure, which may remove or reduce these limitations. This research explores the motion and collision limits for WTG tower installation on a monopile (MP) foundation and focuses on the lowering and mating using two types guiding structures, or catchers: the vertical asymmetric catcher and the conical catcher. A first exploration of installation workability is provided as well. A model is developed that simulates the lowering and catcher mating of a WTG tower with a MP. This model includes physical phenomena that affect the motion and collision behavior of the WTG tower. Specific attention is paid to collisions between the catcher and the MP. With the use of finite element analysis, a stiffening non-linearity is observed in the lumped contact element to describe collisions. It is found to be caused by the local deformation of the mating elements. Furthermore, the simulation model calculates 3 degree of freedom in-plane motions numerically of the WTG tower in the time domain using Euler integration. Besides the aforementioned stiffening non-linearity in collisions, other important model features are a time and spatially variable wind load, aerodynamic damping, harmonic horizontal and vertical crane tip motions, crane operator induced crane tip motions and lifting line stiffness and damping characteristics. The model simulates the WTG tower lowering and catcher mating and to determine the installation limits, installation requirements have been defined, aimed at preventing critical events. To be specific, installation requirements aim to prevent slack wires, axial impact, and plastic deformation of the catcher due to contact with the MP. It is also required that the side-lead angle (i.e. the lifting line angle with respect to the vertical) remains below a maximum allowable value. Model simulations are performed for both jack-up and floating installation vessel crane tip excitation characteristics. This research indicates that in both cases, the conical catcher yields higher allowable wind velocities than the vertical asymmetric catcher during installation. This is supported by the findings that the conical catcher has higher allowable contact forces, requires less or no crane operator action during catcher mating and the side-lead angle varies less than with the vertical asymmetric catcher. Another important observation is that the installation limits are often reached through installation requirements related to the motions and collisions of the mating elements. This study shows that applying linear damping to the horizontal WTG tower bottom motions, achievable by (active) tugger winches, the allowable mean wind velocity in installation is increased and this research suggests that the workability of installation increases consequently. The focus in this study is on motion and collision limits in installation as well as on installation requirements. It is recommended for future research to focus on workability and to analyze the entire system consisting of vessel, load, and foundation. As such, wind and waves are considered separately as a source of excitation and vessel-load interaction is incorporated. For 3D analyses, it is recommended to study the control of out-of-plane WTG tower bottom motions and potential inclined collision responses between the catcher and foundation.","offshore installation; installation workability; Double Slip Joint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-16","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Wind power forecasting is a valuable resource for these power operators: a tool that aids the decision-making process and facilitates risk management. On the other hand, the progress of machine learning and their success in different fields attracted research into wind power probabilistic forecasting. The objective of the research was to enhance wind power forecasting through data-driven or machine learning models, proposing a new framework as an alternative to the existing ones, validated in different climate regions using grid-like topology data (weather images). The project focused on the European Energy Markets 2020 Conference (EEM20) Forecasting Competition. The setting emulates the day-ahead electricity market and the location consisted of all four electricity price regions in Sweden, where three main sets of data were provided. Three main challenges are present in this competition, namely the large volume of data (the curse of dimensionality), the lack of information regarding wind turbine availability, and the growing evolution of wind installed capacity between data sets. The methodology to create a framework consisted of evaluating different machine learning approaches, feature engineering, and tuning the final model for every region. The final framework is called the Smooth Pinball Hybrid Neural Network (SPinHy-NN). The results showcased a suitable CNN architecture, providing more accurate forecasts compared to MLP and k-means clustering. The quantile cross-over problem has been evaluated through the crossing loss and the number of crossings metrics. The analysis shows that a margin parameter can correct this undesired behavior. The conclusions validate the SPinHy-NN as a generalized framework for different climates through the final score achieved post-competition, managing to capture the spatial patterns in most cases. Moreover, the framework can be adapted to reach a desirable trade-off between accuracy, sharpness, and consistency. Recommendations aim to extend this research by employing satellite imaging, further feature engineering, novel neural networks, and exploring spatiotemporal models to capture atmospheric dynamics.","Wind Power Forecasting; Convolutional Neural Network; Multilayer Perceptron; machine learning; Numerical weather forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","60.1282, 18.6435"

Rotterdam’s main climate adaptation goal with regard to water resilience is to make the water-storing capacity of public space sufficient to prevent damage in the event of heavy rainfall (70 mm of rainfall within one hour). In order to find an answer to the question of what the energy transition entails for this goal, five pilot areas in Rotterdam that switch to a gas-free network in the coming years were taken as study sites and were thoroughly analysed to select cases. Cases have been selected based on their criticality: locations that are prone to urban flooding, in addition to the implementation of energy measures. For each of the five selected cases, cross-sectional designs were created for three situations: the existing situation, the situation with energy measures (and sewer replacement, if applicable) and the situation with climate adaptation measures. These designs formed the basis to empirically gather information on the different types of systems integration (project-based, geographical, physical and informational) between the energy transition and climate adaptation. By analysing five different cases in Rotterdam, concrete examples have been collected of how the implementation and planning of energy measures affect climate adaptation and of what the energy transition ultimately entails for Rotterdam’s climate adaptation goals. In addition, policy dilemmas have been formulated for the municipality with regard to the rainwater storage to be achieved and the extra costs associated with measures. This research indicates the difficulties associated with implementing both the energy transition and climate adaptation in densely built areas and tries to provide suggestions for exploiting potential opportunities that the energy transition can create for climate adaptation.","Climate adaptation; Energy transition; Systems integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The phones that are being sold, often replace a phone that is still working fine and we only use our phones on average for 2.7 years. This creates an enormous amount of e-waste. Fairphone believes in a fairer electronics industry by making a change from the inside. They aim to make an impact by creating products that last, reducing e-waste, choosing fairer materials and putting people first. However, Fairphone is still a small player in the smartphone industry. The number of phones sold by Fairphone in 2019 is sold by Apple every 3 hours (Chau &amp; Ryan, 2020). Fairphone wants to grow their market share and wants to appeal to light green consumers. Light green consumers try to find a balance between sustainability, quality and price while purchasing new products. Apparently these consumers live sustainably and consume consciously nowadays, but they do not purchase a Fairphone at the moment. The first part of this thesis aims to get a better understanding of the reasons of these consumers for not purchasing a Fairphone. Secondly, the insights gained from this part are used to develop a design solution that triggers these consumers to consider purchasing a Fairphone when they are in need of a new smartphone. Through a survey (n=255), semi-structured interviews (n=30) and an exploration of the literature, 73 reasons for not purchasing a Fairphone were identified. These reasons are clustered and summarised in fifteen barrier cards. By facilitating creative problem solving sessions with Fairphone employees, many ideas are developed which are summarised in a strategic roadmap. The most promising ideas are translated into con-cepts. These concepts are presented to potential customers and their feedback is used to select the most feasible, viable and desirable concept. A group of consumers appreciates the Fairphone concept, but they are not in need of a new smartphone at the moment. Through the Friends of Fairphone program, Fairphone encourages these consumers to keep their current phone in use for as long as possible. After all, the most sustainable phone is the one in your pocket. For every month they keep using their phone, Fairphone will reward them with a 1% discount on Fairphone products. Today, these consumers forget that buying a Fairphone is an option while looking for a new smartphone. Through monthly updates, the Friends of Fairphone program makes sure that they will consider a Fairphone while they are looking for a new smartphone. A working web application prototype is developed which is validated with the Fairphone user group. 86.1% of this group (n=417) would have signed up to become a Friend of Fairphone. An implementation plan is presented which contains the required next steps for launching the Friends of Fairphone program. The Friends of Fairphone program requires low investment costs, totally aligns with Fairphone’s mission and has much potential of attracting a new group of consumers.The most sustainable phone is the one in your pocket.  ","Sustainability; Circular Economy; Smartphones; Barriers; Triggers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Following Moore’s Law the miniaturisation of transistors has helped improve performance. However, this has led to a ”Power Wall”. The clock frequency of processors have not been making the leaps predicted by Moore’s law. This is simply because the power dissipation becomes too high after a certain frequency. This, along with a few other factors, led the industry to move to multi-core processors and continue to homogeneous multi-core systems, multiple cores that are identical to each other, and heterogeneous, multiple cores that are not identical to each other. To further improve performance of computing systems, hardware accelerators were introduced. The one we are all familiar with is the GPU (graphics processing unit). As the name suggests it is an accelerator to process graphics. It is used extensively for image processing and is much faster at doing this than a CPU. There are many more types of hardware accelerators that offers high speedups for certain applications. Quantum accelerators are one such example. There are a certain class of problems that cannot be solved, or rather will take too long to solve on a classical computer, such that it is practically infeasible. One such problem is prime-factorisation problem.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Modern material systems with properly designed microstructures offer new avenues for engineering materials with advantageous mechanical properties and functionalities in various applications. With the increasing desire to design structures that have complex shapes or that are simply cheaper and more efficient, the demand for complex numerical simulations intensifies. Capturing the behaviour of composites relies on the interaction between the macroscopic and microscopic components, which can make direct numerical simulation too computationally expensive. Concurrent finite element analysis (FE<sup>2</sup>) links the different length scales in a multiscale approach. In each integration point of the macroscale a representative volume element (RVE) is embedded to address the microscopic heterogeneity. However, the need to evaluate the micromodel many times will come with the drawback of high computational costs. Various surrogate models have been proposed to accelerate computational models. One possible approach is employing machine learning techniques to substitute the evaluation of the RVE. Currently, artificial neural networks are being used in a wide variety of fields, due to their exceptional ability to recognize patterns. Although these techniques are able to construct models for complex input–output relations, their applications to mechanics of materials are still limited. These techniques are usually problem-dependent and may suffer from the danger of extrapolation beyond the original sampling space, e.g. different loading paths. This is not naturally resolved, mainly due to the loss of physics in the current machine learning models. The newly proposed Deep Material Network (DMN) by Liu et al. is a data-driven multiscale material modelling method that aims to resolve this issue by composing a network constructed from an assembly of mechanistic building blocks, where each building block resembles an analytical homogenization. Because the fitting parameters of this network are interpretable with physical meaning and because sampling the DMN still involves evaluation of classical constitutive relations, the loss of essential physics in minimized. The material network can effectively be trained using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation, based on linear elastic data of an RVE. The extrapolation capabilities to unknown loading paths are investigated with a matrix-inclusion composite, with the focus on the accuracy of the model for loading-unloading scenarios, and an extension to the training process is proposed where the fidelity of a trained DMN is assessed by generating and grading a yield stress envelope. The results show that a well trained DMN is capable of predicting the response for unseen loading paths involving unloading exceptionally well. The complete learning and extrapolation procedures of the DMN establish a reliable data-driven framework for concurrent multiscale material modelling and design.<br","Machine learning; Deep Material Network; FE2; Surrogate modelling; Physics informed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in this study, construction logistics structures are designed for residential and non-residential development that should reduce the negative effects of construction-related transport in cities. These structures were made for the urban development project IJburg II in Amsterdam and were designed on the stricter requirements for construction logistics and construction activities drawn up by the Municipality of Amsterdam. To design these new construction logistics structures, the engineering design process was used. The requirements of the new structure were identified by means of a case study to the development project IJburg II. The new designs of subsystems were generated with applicable construction logistics centres and new types of transport derived from literature. This led to several new designs for subsystems. Out of these subsystem designs, three new construction logistics structures for IJburg II were developed. The three structures were tested both quantitatively and qualitatively on the new requirements which showed that two of the three structures fulfill the new standards. For the quantitative test, a calculation model was developed that calculates the vehicle movements and vehicle emissions for each design. The results of this calculation model indicated that all three designs significantly decrease the CO2-, PMx- and NOx-emissions and vehicle movements to and from IJburg II. The last-mile deliveries, however, remain unchanged or even slightly increase due to the deployment of light electric vehicles. The research proved that by changing the construction logistics structure, significant vehicle emission reductions can be achieved. In addition, a reduction of vehicle movements to and from construction sites can be established but will in most cases lead to slightly more last-mile deliveries. However, stakeholders need to be specifically engaged to enable implementation of these new structures. Last, this study demonstrated that the engineering design method is a suitable approach to design new construction logistics structures.","Construction logistics; Construction logistics structures; urban development projects; Construction logistics centres; Design approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); la Rocca, G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Unconventional aircraft designs have the potential to lower the impact of aviation on emissions and climate as compared to conventional aircraft designs. However, the flight dynamics behaviour of such unconventional configurations must be carefully evaluated by studying Stability and Control (S&amp;C) characteristics to design safe aircraft and mitigate risks in flight. Various methods, that are a combination of numerical and experimental methods, have been used in the literature to predict the Stability and Control (S&amp;C) characteristics. Sub-scale Flight Testing (SFT) is one such method that can predict aircraft flight behaviour, especially in the case of unconventional designs for which legacy information is unavailable and wind tunnel tests can partially predict aircraft dynamics. In order to successfully use SFT, the Sub-scale Model (SM) used in SFT must be carefully designed such that the results of SFT can be scaled-up to predict full-scale flight behavior. Furthermore, the SM should be able to complete the required SFT mission safely (the model is trimmable, statically stable and dynamically stable throughout the flight envelope). Finally, the SM must be designed with a short leadtime, as the time available for SFT in the overall design cycle is limited. Thus, the design of sub-scale models is a multidisciplinary task. In this thesis, an appropriate methodology is identified and developed to design the structural components of SM, position Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components and estimate the mass, inertia and the associated Center of Gravity (CG) of the SM. These are important inputs to determine the flight dynamics behaviour of the SM. Secondly, the structural analysis capabilities are automated to ensure that the structure does not fail in flight under critical load conditions. To shorten the design lead-time, methodologies developed in this thesis are formalized using a Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) system. This KBE application automates the estimation of the weight &amp; balance of a SM, which includes software modules for structure generation, flight equipment selection and positioning and the automated pre/post-processing task for Finite-Element (FE) analysis. Such a KBE application enables structural studies for different SM scale sizes, design variables such as rib pitch or frame pitch, and load cases. This KBE application to estimate the weight &amp; balance properties of the SM can be coupled with other disciplines such as aerodynamic analysis, flight dynamics toolbox, etc. as part of a Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) workflow to quickly design sub-scale models that can be used to predict full-scale flight behaviour. <br/>Three different case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness ofthe methodology and the KBE application. Each case study predicts the different aircraft configuration namely, a conventional Citation II and two unconventional models being the Prandtl-Plane and the Flying V. The methodologies can therefore be used for future SFT activities and can help in successfully comparing the subscale aircraft model behavior to the full-scale aircraft behavior, thereby making Subscale Flight Testing a step closer to reality.","Subscale Flight Testing; KBE; Sub-scale Model; Flying V; MDAO; Sub-scale Aircraft Model Design; Weight Estimation; Inertia Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van Huijstee, Stijn (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The aim of this graduation project is to increase physical exercise of employees with low socio economic status (SES) by engaging them in a health intervention. Individuals with low SES often negatively influence their health by having an unhealthy lifestyle. This lifestyle causes the individual problems and non-communicable diseases (NCD), which causes a shorter life expectancy and being ill makes it harder to participate in work activity. The client for this project is DZB Leiden, a re-integration company of the municipality of Leiden. DZB is there for everyone who wants to work but has difficulty keeping up with the current work practice. The people turning to DZB often experience a work disability and have a low socio-economic status. DZB also recognizes an unhealthy lifestyle among their employees. A healthier life will contribute to the well-being of the employee and will decrease employee absenteeism. Thus, not only looking from an employment perspective, but considering improvement of quality of life of their employees, DZB is determined to give a contribution to their employees’ health. To increase the physical activity of the employees, a persuasive game was designed to be played at DZB. Persuasive game design is a tool to motivate people to perform certain behaviours in a game experienced world, which can be beneficial to them in the real world. The physical activity experienced during the game can motivate people to perform the desired behaviour in the real life. In order to design a game based health intervention that will be accepted by the employees, an extensive field study was conducted. By taking a human-centered approach and co-designing with the employees a deeper understanding of the target group was created, including their view on health, motivations, barriers and needs. The findings from the field study were translated to 10 points of attention to be considered for creating the health intervention. Also, a framework for design was developed, including three motivational elements: humour, fellowship and discovery. By applying the 10 attention points and design framework, the final game ‘Sailors in Motion’ was developed. Sailors in Motion is a game where boats are hidden and searched for throughout the building of DZB in a scavenger hunt with treasure maps. Making and following these maps stimulates the player to walk around at DZB. The game is all about discovering new places in the building, which is done together with colleagues. Additionally, the game includes joyful elements. During the journey, health messages can be found, meant to educate the player about the benefits of physical activity. Finally the game was evaluated with the employees. The aim of this evaluation was to figure out whether the game stimulated to walk and triggered to increase physical activity in the employees’ daily life. The evaluation showed that the game does put people in motion and creates a immersive experience for the player. However, since the game was evaluated in a short time, the effect of the game on someone’s health awareness was difficult to measure. It is recommended to play the game more often and spread the activities over multiple weeks to provoke behaviour change. Also, the game could be part of a larger health program where employees set goals and get support to reach them. The game serves as a starting point where people can easily engage in to experience the benefits of physical activity on their mood and body. This experience can motivate them with setting personal health goals and eventually changing their behaviour. The deliverable of this project is not only the tangible game, but also a variety of insights about the employees of DZB. The company could use the framework for design as well as the 10 point of attention during future development of health related initiatives at DZB.","Persuasive Game Design; Human-centered design; contextmapping; Lifestyle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This report begins with an introduction to the project, including the background of self-tracking, assignment and approach. The design will focus on young adults who live alone and work full time. Next, from the literature research and user research, insights were drawn on the current experience of using food-tracking tools. Self-Determination Theory and Gamification Theory were applied to help with analyzing the user characteristics and contextual factors. Based on research, the design goal was formed: Engaging young adults who live alone and work full time to record and better understand their eating behaviour. Users should feel supported and competent when interacting with the design, reporting the food-related data without pressure and unpleasant feeling, and at the same, keep engaged through using. Based on this goal, I next explored the solution space, narrowing it down to three possible concept directions that would take the redesign in three different extreme directions. Evaluations for all three tests were conducted with seven participants. The results showed that a combination of various elements from the three concepts should be used for the redesign in order to optimize the user experience. Next, after a redesign workshop and a cognitive walkthrough, the final concept was detailed and a high-fidelity prototype was created. This prototype was evaluated in a user test with six participants. The results demonstrated the strength of many of the design decisions, while also showing areas of improvement; such as the need to better guide the user when choosing their weekly goal. The recommendations and limitations were discussed as well in the end.","Young adults; Food diary app; Engaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Steel trusses are the preferred structures when large distances are required to span due to its lightweight, the reduced deﬂection and its load bearing capacity. Although nowadays with the help of computational tools more efﬁcient designs can be achieved, the geometrical shape of trusses has barely changed. This is mainly due to the ease of the required structural calculations and due to the available standard manufacturing and assembly procedures. Although a standard shape could be seen as an advantage, studies suggest that the relationship between the efﬁcient use of material and design rationalization is not balanced, leading to design-overcapacity of the structure. The use of optimization procedures provides new opportunities to engineers. New design solutions and near-optimal structures can be achieved when implementing optimization processes. Optimization processes could generate economical alternatives in terms of weight reduction. Despite optimization techniques are becoming increasingly available, optimized structures are not commonly used in real practice due to the complex conﬁguration an optimized structure might have, especially when using layout optimization. Due to the non-conventional node-members conﬁguration, realizing these optimized trusses in real practice with conventional joining mechanisms, such as bolted and welded connections, will probably lead to complex designs and higher costs. Therefore, innovative joining technologies are required to be implemented. Snap-ﬁt connections are widely used connecting mechanism for joining plastic components. Due to its simplicity and efﬁciency while connecting two or more elements together are suitable for different applications. Despite it is not commonly used in the building industry and it is frequently used on small scale applications, the principle based on snap-ﬁt connections could be used to connect the structural members of optimized trusses. First, a literature study provides a clear understanding of truss structures, focusing mainly on the importance of their joints. Structural optimization is also discussed, paying special attention on a new layout-optimization approach, which is based on two steps: ﬁrst, the less-weight possible layout is obtained (the benchmark) without taking into account any buildable considerations. The second step consists on rationalizing the benchmark contemplating practical and buildable restrictions. Finally, a representative case-study steel truss is presented. The second part of this research explores the structural design and the optimization procedure applied on the case-study truss. Here the layout optimization approach is applied using Peregrine (plugin for Grasshopper). After an optimized layout is generated, it is design structurally using Karamba3D. Finally, the case-study truss and the optimized truss are compared. To explore the opportunity of implementing optimized trusses in practice, the conceptual design of an innovative joint based on snap-ﬁt connections is developed. A representative internal node from the optimized truss is chosen and based on a general concept, three design concepts are created. Extensive Finite Element (FE) analyses are carried out to study the structural behavior of the innovative joint during three main phases. All FE analysis were performed using the FE software Abaqus. To conclude, this research project is an exploratory feasibility study of the use of steel snap-ﬁt joints as internal nodes for optimized steel trusses.","Structural Optimization; Innovative joints; optimized truss; Abaqus; innovative connections; steel structures; Steel Joints; snap-fit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-10","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Even though these products seem rather simple at first glance, demand deposits are without a fixed maturity, generating uncertainties in the model. A significant amount of academic literature on this subject is available. However, we are experiencing negative interest rates for a few years now, that may have affected customer behavior and have led to an excess in deposits-taking for a large majority of bank. In addition to the low-rate environment, this small European bank has been growing rapidly in recent years and new customers have different characteristics from the old ones. Demand deposits modeling is therefore a major challenge for the bank. It can be divided in three steps, respectively the market rates, the deposit volumes and the deposit rates, however, only the market rates and the deposit volumes will be considered in this thesis. The dynamics of market rate follow a single factor Hull-White model. The mean-reverting parameter and the volatility are calibrated on historical data of the one-month Euribor rates, and then simulated using an exact Monte-Carlo approach. The deposit volume model is based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, where the constant drift term μ is replaced by a trend that depends on the rates' level. The trend has a different slope whether we are in a normal-rate environment or in a low-rate environment, and the probability of being in either state depends on the market rates. We create age and wealth categories for customer segmentation purpose. We then perform a cluster analysis, either using a k-means method or a hierarchical clustering algorithm, that will be included in the deposit volume model. The clustering forms similar groups of customers, reflecting better customers' diversity. Lastly, we compare two output variables, the average life and the optionality, for different simulations, one without the clustering, and two with the clustering. The best-case scenario for any bank being a high average life associated with a low optionality with regards to demand deposits modeling, the clustering integration in the model leads to more optimal results.","Demand deposits; Market rates; Deposit volumes; ALM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Small scale resonators are commonly used as sensors by relating changes in the dynamic behaviour to a sensed quantity. Conventionally, the dynamics used for sensing are in the linear regime. But at smaller scales the dynamic range of the linear regime decreases. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the dynamic behaviour in the nonlinear regime, as with the decreasing scale of the resonators this becomes inevitable. Especially, little is known about the frequency stability in this region. The frequency stability is an indication for the potential sensitivity that the resonator can have as sensor. By using phase locked loop (PLL) the frequency stability around the resonance frequency of nonlinear resonators can be obtained. This research contains attempts to control multilayer graphene drums around its fundamental resonance frequency with PLL. In addition, the frequency stability at these points are presented by measure of the Allan deviation. There are roughly two different distributions of the frequency stability over the frequency response obtained. One resonator shows behaviour attributed to internal resonance. This internal resonance is linked to an increase of nonlinear damping. Combining that with a simple simulation model, a relation was found between increased nonlinear damping and an improvement of frequency stability.","Frequency stability; Graphene; Nonlinear resonator; Allan deviation; Phase-locked loop; Nonlinear damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-16","","","","","",""

Only 5% of the potential intraventricular neuroendoscopy (INE) cases are currently treated with endoscopy. For the other 95%, an endoscopic approach is impossible, due to the risk of damaging the surrounding tissue by movement of the endoscopic system, needed to reach the affected areas inside the ventricles. A hand-held SNI is theorised to overcome these problems. Methods: A human-centered design (HCD) approach was taken to come to engineering solutions. Expert interviews, surveys and secondary research were performed to acquire the design input. Intermediary prototypes were developed and tested. For the final experiment, 10 participants, of which one neurosurgeon, performed a task in a box trainer. The endoscope was equipped with markers, used to evaluate the movement of the endoscope during the test by means of video analysis, comparing a rigid instrument and the new prototype in a two-tailed paired T-test. Usability was measured through a questionnaire. The spans between digit 1-2, 2-5 and 1-5 of the dominant hand of the participants was measured. Results: A biopsy forceps with a shaft length of 290mm, with a laser-cut articulating portion of 14mm and maximum bending of 40° was developed. Handle dimensions were based on a grip between the distal phalanges and the thenar area of the palm of 10th percentile hand measurements to enforce a stable grip. Significantly less non-angular movement than in the old instrument(p=0.009) was observed. Angular movement reduction was significant in one direction (p=0.032) but not in both (p=0.063). The handle prototype is slightly too large. The forces on the controls were comfortable. No relationship was detected between the finger span measurements and the usability score per participant. Conclusion: The prototype consists of a handle design based on human factor guidelines and multiple user evaluations, and an articulate tip based on DEAM’s technology, now with dimensions optimised for INE biopsy and ETV. Safety is improved by significantly limiting movement in the system during use.","surgical instrument; steerable; ergonomics; neuroendoscopy; minimally invasive surgery; safety; design engineering; Human Centered Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double Degree Master Thesis in Integrated Product Design and BioMedical Engineering","","2022-10-16","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Improved sensor performance and greater computing power steers the future of the shipping industry in the same direction. Avoiding obstacles in close proximity is one of the current challenges. This research provides a generic and open- source design guideline for mapping, path planning and control for autonomous sailing in an environment with obstacles in close proximity. For each of the three modules, several options are discussed and the best one is chosen. Mapping is applied in the form of mapping with positioning sensors in an occupancy grid map. The original map is devided into cells containing information about the probability that they represent an obstacle. The mapping algorithm is applied in several maps and with noise and compared with a simultanously localization and mapping (SLAM) method. The resulting maps are created within the path planning requirements. Path planning is performed by inflating the occupancy grid map from the mapping algorithm. The inflated map is sampled into an 8-connected grid matching the grid cell size. A Dijkstra algorithm is applied combined with an quadratic approximation in the costmap. A steepest descent method will return a continous and shortest path which is suitable for control and does not collide with the obstacles in the map. Proportional and integral is applied to steer the vessel along the path. The proportional controller is tuned based upon the look ahead distance and its maximum error with the original path. The controller is tuned using a block shaped path as a reference and evaluated in a path from the path planner. Both static errors like wind or current and Gaussian noise on the position estimation are included for validation. Finally the controller is able to maneuver the vessel safely from its starting point to its final destination The functionalities of the modules are indivividually demonstrated, and eventually interconnected into one system. Autonomous maneuvering of the complete system is then demonstrated in various simulated environ- ments and settings, including unknown areas and global planning challenges. The vessel is able to maneuver autonomously from the start to its goal given only the sensor data, its location and its goal position.","Autonomous; mapping; path planning; path following; waterborne","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, for this thesis the research objective was to what degree of accurateness is the VM6_C model estimating the relative sea-level during the late Holocene of Sardinia and Crete? To support this question, the following three sub-questions were formulated: 1. What is the influence of components of the simplified sea-level equation in Sardinia and Crete? 2. What are the current tectonic trends for these locations? 3. To what extend can the archaeological sites at these locations be used for validating the model? The analysis for answering these questions, were divided into two case studies with three different acquisition methods: paleo data (1), GPS stations (2) and the VM6_C current rate of change (3). The accurateness was reviewed by comparing the computed trends and relative sea level heights of both these methods and case studies. This resulted in a rate of change of RSL by paleo data by Crete of 0.6173 mm/yr, whilst Sardinia had 1.297 [mm/yr]. In comparison the difference between the paleo and model data was respectively 0.45 [mm/yr] for Crete and for Sardinia is 1.03 [mm/yr]. The tectonic movement of both islands was concluded to be both subsiding at a millimetre magnitude. Therefore, the conclusion was drawn that the sea level was rising relative to the structures, yet the island was subsiding over time. Finally, the accurateness was reviewed by comparing the average difference between the historic sea level of the paleo data and the VM6_C model. Henceforth the variation was respectively -0.4302 [m] for Sardinia and -1.550 [m]. Thus, according to the results, the model has a higher accurateness relative to the paleo data when measuring at tectonic stable locations, however the trend can be better estimated at tectonic active locations. Which can be caused by the temporal resolution of paleo sites.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This protocol has several security flaws however, and exploitation of them has lead to parts of the Internet being temporarily unreachable. In order to combat these flaws, several security solutions have been developed already. However, none of these have been deployed on a wide scale yet.

It also includes a comparison of solutions on different practical security aspects. From this comparison, I found that no solution is able to prevent attacks if only one autonomous system deploys it. Due to this, I suggest to shift attention to detective security. This thesis also includes an analysis of some detective security schemes, to see which properties of these schemes can be used for a new scheme. This new scheme is designed to comply with a list of requirements, and it uses properties from three other schemes. Development of this scheme is left as future work.

(TU Delft Aerospace Engineering)","Pini, M. (mentor); Anand, N. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","As aircraft manufacturers push for better fuel economy, novel aircraft concepts, like the propulsive fuselage concept have emerged. One of the prime component of such concepts is the boundary layer ingestion (BLI) engine. Such engine operates by ingesting the low-momentum fluid emerging from the surface of the aircraft fuselage which enables to enhance its propulsive efficiency. The design of a BLI engine is fundamentally different than that of a conventional aircraft engine as the BLI fan experiences distorted airflow at every revolution. Therefore, when its performance are analyzed by means of CFD, single passage simulations become insufficient to represent the flow characteristics. and extremely expensive simulation of the entire annulus become necessary for analysis and design purposes. Especially during conceptual design, where several BLI engine configurations must be investigated in combination with their airframe integration, new reduced-order methods are required to alleviate the computational burden while retaining a sufficient level of accuracy.<br/><br/>An alternative, computationally efficient approach capable of coping with the full-annulus simulation is the well-established body-force modelling (BFM). BFM is a technique through which the physical blade rows are replaced by a volumetric force field which mimics the flow turning imparted by the physical blade rows. Thanks to this simplification, BFM does not require the physical blades to be accurately reproduced in the mesh, thus offering substantial computational cost reduction. Due to the associated gains in computational efficiency, this method is commonly used for the analysis and off-design performance prediction of full-annulus geometries, which are computationally demanding through conventional methods. Although the method has been established for analysis purposes, its capability as a design tool was never assessed.<br/><br/>Implementation of BFM in a CFD code that can be automatically differentiated to attain design sensitivities via the adjoint method may enable efficient BFM-based design of complex engine configurations. <br/><br/>In this research, the BFM model originally developed by Ref. \cite{Hall2015AnalysisIngestion} and improved by Ref. \cite{Thollet2017BodyInteractions} was implemented into open-source CFD software SU2, which is equipped with a discrete adjoint solver based on operator overloading. In addition, parallel force and a metal blockage source term were added to the existing formulation to increase the fidelity of the BFM. The implementation was validated by comparing the results obtained from the BFM and the physical blade computation on an exemplary axial turbine test case.<br/><br/>The results show that the BFM was capable of providing static and stagnation pressure and temperature trends with an accuracy of approximately 94\%. Furthermore, the absolute flow deflection by the stator and rotor rows were found to deviate by $\SI{5}{\degree}$ and $\SI{17}{\degree}$. The BFM was found to be 3 orders of magnitude faster than the equivalent physical blade computation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Since these bridges have opened, the traffic intensity has increased yearly and environmental effects had the opportunity to deteriorate the bridges slowly. Inspections revealed that the main load-carrying elements are generally in adequate conditions while the deck structure is deteriorated. In an effort to extend the bridge's lifetime, fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) decks can be used to replace deteriorated members. These decks have gained popularity over the past years due to their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratio’s which enables fast installation. Furthermore, their freedom in design, the ability to be prefabricated and good durability are all characteristics that make FRP bridge decks a worthy competitor for the refurbishment of movable bridge decks. The main challenge of applying FRP bridge decks is connecting it with the underlying steel girders. Fortunately, recent developments of deck-to-girder connections have suggested a slip-resistant demountable shear connection, namely, the injected Steel Reinforced Resin (iSRR) connection. Initial experiments of the iSRR connection concluded that the connection provides excellent fatigue behaviour which is favourable in hybrid FRP-steel bridges. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the behaviour of bolted deck-to-girder connections in FRP-steel composite bridges with the application of renovating movable highway bridges with timber decks. Using a series of finite element models, the application of a bolted FRP deck is investigated on an existing movable highway bridge, namely, the Beneden Merwede bridge. In order to achieve interaction between the existing steel structure and FRP panels, the slip-resistant iSRR connections are considered. Starting from a small-scale finite element model of the iSRR connection, a process of simplifications and upscaling of the models will lead to a large-scale bridge model. Firstly, a highly detailed model of a push-out test is developed to assess the static performance of the iSRR connector with embedded nuts and a coupler system. Secondly, the mechanical performance of an FRP-steel composite system is investigated in a composite beam model. Using the latter model, different modelling techniques of the deck-to-girder connections are compared in order to propose an efficient technique to determine the forces in the deck-to-girder connections. Finally, a large-scale bridge model is used to determine the forces in the deck-to-girder connections under a number of load cases and to provide a recommendation for the distribution of the connections. The analyses of the iSRR connection with the embedded nuts and coupler show that both configurations have a similar static behaviour characterised by the shear rupture of the connection and limited damage to the FRP. Based on the known long-term behaviour of the iSRR connection with the embedded nuts, it is advised to use this type of configuration as deck-to-girder joint. Applying the connection on the composite beam model every 600 mm, the iSRR connections provide full composite action between the FRP deck and the steel girder and preserves the interaction between the two components until yielding of the steel beam is initiated. The composite beam analysis also concludes that connection forces may be reduced when friction is not considered during the analysis, e.g. during engineering analysis with linear springs (212 kN/mm) in GSA. Investigating the deck-to-girder connections on the bridge level, it is advised to install iSRR connections on the cross- and main-girders to connect the FRP deck. In such manner, the deck is well supported in longitudinal and transverse direction of the bridge and local force concentrations near the cross- to main-girder connection are prevented. When connecting the FRP panel to the cross- and main-girders, the bending moments in the cross- to main-girder connections are significantly reduced compared to the original design of the bridge with a timber deck.","Fibre Reinforced Polymers; FRP-steel bridges; bridge renovation; deck-to-girder connections; iSRR connection; finite element modelling & techniques","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

For a large part, the industry is responsible for worldwide energy consumption. In the Netherlands, this share amounts to 41% of total energy production (Compendium voor de Leefomgeving, 2019). The industry is looking into different methods to lower their energy consumption to reduce carbon emissions. This is generally done by improved technologies, and by reusing existing energy flows. This study is focused on how industrial zones can optimally utilize their available waste heat (WH) in such a way that carbon emissions are minimized. By creating an optimal dispatch for waste heat in an industrial zone, insights into how the network should be operationalized are gained. It can also lead to industrial synergies due to cooperation between companies in the industrial zone. The research has been performed in four phases. (1) An orienting and descriptive phase, (2) a scenario creation and modeling phase, (3) verification, analyzing, and evaluation of the gained insights, and (4) the discussion and conclusion of the research. Sectors with both large scale demand and supply of WH are likely to be interested in participating in an integrated WH market. As a result, establishing large scale connections prevents large amounts of carbon emissions. Additionally, the financial incentive to invest in these solutions increases due to increasing carbon taxation. Key drivers for carbon reduction are the large scale connections, with a demand profile that exceeds the supply pattern by much. Determining the optimal dispatch of an industrial zone will offer a method to account for the volatility of supply and demand. It was expected that flexibility options in the WH market would be interesting, however with the current supply and demand patterns, WH can be utilized almost fully. That means that in the current system flexibility options do not add value. Several considerations remain for the implementation of integrated WH networks. Such as the power-to-heat technology that will likely increase the share of WH supply in industrial zones. Furthermore, a market mechanism has to be established when multiple parties (&gt;2) get involved in the network to increase the feasibility of the deployment of the network.","Waste Heat Network; Industrial Symbiosis; Energy Efficiency; Energy Storage; on Emission Reduction; Thermochemical Material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The flow induces time varying forces on the structure which leads to dynamic behaviour of the valve. Whether the structure is in the range of resonance and what the amplitude of the vibrations will be depends on the mass, damping, stiffness and forcing quantities of the system. This thesis focussed on gaining insight in the behaviour of such a cylinder and its various components in terms of stiffness and damping of the total system including the vertical sliding valve. The research questions focussed on whether it is possible to influence the dynamic characteristics of a system (natural frequency and dynamic amplification) by adjusting the geometry of the hydraulic cylinder. Furthermore it is investigated which components are influencing the dynamic characteristics of the system and which damping and stiffness components are found to be subordinate to the dominant sources. Results were based on a Python script that included all relevant sources of damping and stiffness of a hydraulic cylinder, as well as the fluid structure interaction components such as added mass, damping and stiffness. The added damping components included the self-excitation suction damping. The sensitivity of different components to the natural frequency and dynamic amplification was explored. This was done for different cases, where in each case one variable varied while the others were kept constant. The results from the sensitivity analysis were used to find an optimal parameter that would lead to an optimal design in terms of natural frequency increase or decrease, reduction of the dynamic amplification and a minimal influence on the mass of the system. Besides these two studies, a third study was adopted to find the relative influence of different damping and stiffness components of the hydraulic cylinder for varying boundary conditions such as water level difference and gate opening. The study showed four components of a hydraulic cylinder that influenced the dynamic characteristics the most when varying their dimensions in a realistic range. These where the diameter of the hydraulic cylinder, the cylinder length, the thickness of the rod and the length of the tube that transport fluid into the cylinder. From these, the tube length and the cylinder diameters turned out to be the most effective design variables for tuning the stiffness, damping and correspondingly the natural frequency and the dynamic amplification of the system. Furthermore it was found that under all conditions (varying water level, gate opening height, pressure and stiffness), the stiffness was mostly determined by the axial stiffness of the rod and piston as well as the stiffness due to compaction of the cylinder fluid. For damping it was found that the cylinder only had limited influence and that most damping resulted from friction between the valve and the guiding rails.","Fluid Structure Interaction; Underflow; Valves; Vibrations; Hydraulic cylinder","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

However, current centralized logistics planning systems are unable to cope with the complexity that these solutions pose. For this reason, Thymo Vlot developed a Self-Organizing Logistics algorithm that leverages decentralization to enable multimodal transport and collaborative delivery. However, the logistics planning system that would utilize this algorithm was left undeveloped, which motivates this thesis project. The first step to develop a software project is to define its architecture. In this thesis project, I analyze Thymo Vlot’s algorithm and develop the software architecture of a logistics planning system that would use it. The main design tool consisted of the selection and application of architectural patterns, which are documented solutions to commonplace problems in software development, drawn from the literature and modern distributed systems. The result of this project is an event-driven microservices architecture, which is highly granular, modifiable, and scalable. These characteristics give the project significant commercial value, as the architecture can be applied to different use cases with different algorithms. The project also leaves behind an architecture with small components, which eases the development cycle of the logistics planning system, thus addressing important managerial challenges.

AAC has demonstrated some remarkable mechanical properties and long-term performance (e.g., high strength, chemical durability, and fire resistance). However, high drying shrinkage in AAC, causing cracks degrading the long-term durability of AAC, is one of the obstacles that must be overcome before it can be widely applied in the construction field. <br/>This study investigates the mechanisms of drying shrinkage, provides a survey and evaluation of the influencing factors, and accordingly proposes an integral solution to mitigate drying shrinkage in AAC. This was done through a qualitative approach based on literary research.<br/>The investigation showed that the main driving forces of drying shrinkage are surface, disjoining, and capillary tension forces, and they are related to relative humidity (RH) and meniscus radius. Further, different reaction products' characteristics can be attributed to different drying shrinkage mechanisms, as they have a critical role in determining AAC properties. Furthermore, poor mechanical properties of AAC often lead to a higher drying shrinkage rate.

(graduation committee); Barendregt, Isaac (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) seeks to eliminate net green house gasses and other harmful- emissions. In this search, the operability of her vessels need to be secured. One of the options for eliminating net carbon emissions is Power to Liquid (PtL) conversion to Methanol. Fuel cells, and in particular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) may be useful tools to power naval vessels efficiently and without the production of pollutants. The dynamic behaviour of these systems however is where a challenge is found. Contrary to methane fuelled SOFCs, little research has been done on the behaviour of methanol fuelled SOFCs in the higher temperature range. It was decided that for this thesis the SOFC system would be pressurised to 20 bar to increase power density, a pre-reformer would be incorporated to improve dynamic behaviour, a Plate Heat Exchanger (PHE) would be used to re-integrate heat from the cathodic outflow to the cathodic inflow, and Anode Off Gas Re-Cycling (AOGRC) would be used to provide steam and heat to the pre-reformer. A model was built that incorporates the following sub models: a pre-reformer that includes reaction kinetics, a dynamic SOFC stack model which incorporates heat losses normal to the cell orientation, and a \textcolor{cyan}{PHE} which includes its dynamic behaviours. These models are interconnected and controlled such, AOGRC is mimicked. These models were verified by checking energy- and mass-balances. The eventual chemical equilibrium of the (kinetics based) model of the pre-reformer was used to validate the pre-reformer model. The leading research by (Aguiar et al.) was used to validate the SOFC model. Typical thermal behaviours of PHEs were used to validate the PHE model. Simulation results show that the pre-reformer could improve the system dynamics by providing a pre heated, hydrogen rich gas mixture to the SOFC. Running it at a temperature of higher than 530 K can pose danger due to more prominent exothermic, methane producing, reactions in the reactor vessel. Results from testing the SOFC show that the SOFC is best operated at an inflow temperature of around 800K for maximum efficiency (including outflow enthalpy). It shows that the SOFC is barely influenced by higher partial pressures of the reactants, and has slow load following characteristic, especially for low terminal current densities. The testing results for the PHE show that the this subsystem achieves higher heater effectiveness when more conductor plate area is used, but at the cost of dynamic response. It also shows that the PHE is the most important factor in the poor load following capabilities of the entire system. This is largly due to the limited convective heat coefficient. AOGRC has been shown to be an effective method to control the temperature of the pre-reformer, low AOGRC ratios make for large preventable energy losses. The interconnected methanol fuelled SOFC system simulation shows that external heating of the ingoing anode flow is detrimental to the efficiency of the system, but it could be instrumental in preventing thermal stresses on the Positive-Electrolyte-Negative (PEN) structure of the cell. Increasing the fuel and airflow excess is also detrimental to the system efficiency. These values are best kept at 1.1 due to uncertainty around for the models` accuracy for very low fuel- and air- flow excess. The settling time for the power output is in the order of several hundreds of seconds, and is largest for large sudden changes in power demands, and low terminal power demands. It was concluded from these results that the here proposed system is not suitable to power a naval vessel of the Snellius class in a satisfying way. The investigation however, has produced valuable tools for future work. Recommendations for future work are to implement condenser/heat exchanger for the anode anode off gas, implement a burner to make use of the remaining chemical energy in the anode off gas and install a turbine to make use of potential energy in the outflowing gasses.","SOFC; Pre-reformer; Naval ships; Dynamic behaviour; Plate Heat Exchanger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","","52.080509, 5.148086"

(mentor); Paus-Buzink, S.N. (graduation committee); Robertson, Daniel (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Access to safe and affordable surgery is nothing short of a basic human right and people from all walks of life are entitled to it. But, five people from resource-constrained low and middle-income countries are vulnerable and left to fend for themselves when the need for surgery is a life governing event. Inhabitants of these regions are scourged by high mortality and morbidity due to surgical infection caused by the use of unclean and unsterile surgical instruments. Reduction in infections can be achieved by using clean and sterile surgical instruments. Laparoscopy, is a promising technique of surgery developed to efficiently perform complex abdominal surgeries with the use of small and minimum incisions on the patient. Laparoscopy’s minimally invasive nature allows complex surgeries to take place without the need of an absolutely sterile operating room, although the sterility of the surgical instruments cannot be compromised. The added benefit of faster recovery from smaller wounds makes it even more desirable for this context. The Minimally Invasive Surgery and Interventional Techniques Lab of the TU Delft has initiated projects addressing the health and well-being of resource-constrained, underdeveloped communities like rural India through frugal innovation. Rural Indian hospitals are grossly underfunded, under-maintained, and understaffed. Sterile processing practices in rural India are rudimentary compared to high-income hospitals like the ones in the Netherlands. In high-income hospitals, all used surgical instruments are cleaned and sterilized in dedicated central sterile processing departments (CSSD) by highly trained and well protected sterile processing technicians. However, rural India usually employs small teams of local undertrained and semi-literate nurses to carry out every primary and ancillary duty in the hospital. The lack of dedicated CSSDs exacerbates the nurse’s workload and exposure to harmful pathogenic surgical instruments. Laparoscopic instruments developed in high-income nations are seldom designed keeping low resource contexts in mind. The geometrical complexity of instruments keeps increasing but cleaning methods in rural India have stagnated. Resource constraints are a major reason as to why proper international and national guidelines for reprocessing cannot be followed. Hence hospitals cannot guarantee 100% safe and sterile instruments as compared so standardized outcomes in high-income hospitals. In this graduation project, the distinct reprocessing journey of surgical instruments for the two diverse economic contexts were studied. A comparative analysis of both reprocessing journeys uncovered severe unsafe and unfavorable practices in rural India. Significant data and insights from the research have hence paved the way for focusing on the “Cleaning” stage of the laparoscopic instrument reprocessing journey in rural India. This MSc graduation project aims at designing a frugal solution for cleaning and repurposing laparoscopic instruments, dedicated to hospitals in rural India where the demand for laparoscopy is high but surgeries are less due to resource constraints like lack of laparoscopic instruments and repurposing devices. The involvement of an Indian nurse and laparoscopic surgeon provided first-hand information about the problems and requirements in the rural Indian context. Prototyping and testing of various cleaning setups were conducted to extract the most viable design solution. Insights from the research and testing were combined into the concept design of a frugal mechanical washer and subsequently an “Envisioned Reprocessing Journey” for rural Indian hospitals to suggest a standard protocol for keeping most of their existing infrastructure in mind. Evaluations with the Indian nurse revealed that this device could indeed be a game-changer to the existing practices of reprocessing laparoscopic instruments in rural India.","Laparoscopy; Cleaning; LMICs; Surgical instruments; Rural India; Hospital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Air transport is facing an important challenge when it comes to the reduction of its environmental footprint. Hybrid electric aircraft offer a potential solution to reduce in-flight emissions. The essence of hybrid electric aircraft is to combine multiple energy sources and energy conversion systems, in order to improve the overall energy efficiency and synergies, which could result in reduced emissions. Conventional design methods for aircraft are based on a single energy source and gas turbines, at which power production and propulsion are combined. However, hybrid electric aircraft allow for multiple energy sources and a decoupling of the propulsive device from the power producing device. These two fundamental differences open a new design space for future aircraft. As conventional design methods are not able to cope with the extended design space of hybrid electric aircraft, the necessity arises for novel conceptual design methods. In the context of hybrid electric aircraft, the energy sources are considered to be a combination of electrochemical batteries and conventional<br/>jet fuel in this thesis. One of the effects of increased electrification is the generation of heat, due to inefficiencies. As hybrid electric aircraft further increase the electric power demand, even more heat will be generated. It is expected that the emitted heat will affect the weight, drag, and performance of hybrid electric aircraft, due to additional systems to control and dissipate excessive heat. As high-power systems require cooling to prevent performance degradation and battery thermal runaways, an adequate thermal management system is needed to control the thermal behaviour of hybrid electric powertrain components. For this reason, a coupled design approach between the hybrid electric powertrain and the thermal management system should be applied. Moreover, the sizing of thermal management system components is based on the thermal behaviour of these powertrain components. Therefore, modelling of the thermal effects is needed to acquire improved insights in the performance characteristics of hybrid electric aircraft during the conceptual design phase. The objective of this thesis is to identify the impact of including a thermal management system on the power, weight, and volume usage for a parallel-hybrid electric ATR72-600 regional aircraft reference design case, that excluded the sizing of a cooling system. A sizing methodology was developed for this case study. The sizing includes only the electric part of the powertrain with a coupled thermal management system. The latter is a combination of a closed-loop liquid cooling system and an air cycle system to pre-cool ambient air. The combination of all components that are sized are described by the term ""system"". Furthermore, the same battery is used to power both the powertrain and the thermal management system. The validation of the defined system is performed at individual system component level, as no similar adequate reference data could be found in literature for this thermally-controlled electric propulsion system. The validation of the battery, electric motor, heat exchanger, and air cycle system is emphasised by comparing their performance behaviour to reference data. The system is used to assess its impact with near-term and mid-term component technology levels, at which it is sized for hot day conditions. Flight missions characteristics are taken from the reference design case and<br/>used as input to capture the main sizing characteristics. The results indicate a low feasibility potential if near-term technology levels are used. A higher feasibility is obtained with mid-term technology levels. The battery is identified to be the most critical component in terms of power, weight, and volume usage, which are driven by three interacting mechanisms. These are the electric propulsion power, the required cooling power, and the thermal capacity as a function of the battery weight. Concluding, the significant impact of a thermal management system can not be neglected in conceptual design studies for hybrid electric regional aircraft.","hybrid electric propulsion; Battery electric aircraft; conceptual aircraft design; HEP; System Design; Thermal management; Cooling system; Aircraft; Future scenarios","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For this, first seven distinct ways to adapt holonomic<br/>(omnidirectional) formation control algorithms to be used on skid-steer drive, differential drive or unicycle model mobile robots are presented.

Recently, the AGS studies mostly focus on the formation of granules, and the factors that influence the AGS morphology, like temperature and substrate type. In domestic wastewater, 85 % of total chemical oxygen demand (COD) are particulate COD (PCOD), which are likely to be mostly captured in anaerobic phase in AGS systems. These particles can have a negative impact on granules’ morphology. However, there are few studies about the AGS performance on particle capture in anaerobic phase. Hence, the major research objective was to investigate to what extent can particles in the influent be captured by the AGS bed in the anaerobic feeding period. There were three possible mechanisms attributing to particle capture in the anaerobic phase, which were filtering effect, adsorption, and protozoa consumption. The contribution of protozoa was investigated with a theoretical approach. Furthermore, A model was built up for studying the influence of particle transport mechanism on particle capture. A lab-scale plug-flow experiment in a column was conducted for investigation of AGS bed performance on particles in different size ranges, and the influence of duration on particle capture. The result of the laboratory work found that the particle capture efficiency was 95 %, 84 %, and 23 % for particles in the range of 45-100 μm, 10-45 μm, and 0.45-10 μm, respectively. The 1-10 μm particles were hard to be captured. Besides, the particle capture efficiency was constant with the duration of 2 hours. Anaerobic feeding duration will have limited influence on particle capture without negatively affecting the phosphorus and nitrogen removal. Towards to the role of protozoa, they are unlikely to contribute to wastewater particle capture and removal in anaerobic period. Additionally, the AGS system in anaerobic phase can act as granular filtration system and the filtration model can be applicable in AGS research. Overall, anaerobic phase most likely contributes little on particle removal for whole AGS system.","Aerobic granular sludge; Participate COD capture; Anaerobic phase","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Sanitary Engineering","",""

The use of visual data to reconstruct such 3D models is still a challenging topic. To obtain the accurate dimensions, additional metadata is required such as a GPS which is not always available. Besides this, dealing with challenging visual situations such as bad-lightening conditions or motion blur remains a difficult subject. Furthermore, since visual data is highly dimensional, most algorithms lack scalability, meaning that they fail to reconstruct 3D models in acceptable time limits and are incapable of handling large data sets. In this thesis, the objective is to mitigate these typical issues whilst preserving the quality of the dense 3D models. To this end, visual-inertial SLAM and MVS techniques are combined to form a dense 3D modeling architecture that is capable of mitigating the typical challenges of classical dense 3D modeling approaches. Besides this, the architecture is extended with additional improvements in the MVS system. These improvements further increase the scalability by abstracting the input data in a highly compact representation by leveraging image segmentation techniques. The result is a novel, visual-inertial dense 3D modeling system. The novel system is tested on benchmark data sets and within a lab setting, where a remote-inspection case-study is performed. The presented system is compared against the industrial and academic state-of-the-art systems. A thorough comparison is made by evaluating the pose accuracy, computation time, and reconstruction quality. It is shown that the presented system improves the state-of-the art systems by a significant margin in terms of computation-time. Furthermore, the presented system is capable of computing 3D models with accurate geometric scale without relying on external metadata, showcasing the effectiveness of the presented system.

As repurpose is a strategy to retain value, the process is applied after the product has been used. This can make repurpose a challenge strategy as products are not created with repurpose in mind. Circular product design could be an answer to use repurpose more effectively as products could be designed at forehand to be repurposed. Within this thesis, the aim was to create a set of guidelines for repurpose design, so designers and companies can get guidance in how to circularly design products for repurpose, to optimally reuse and retain material value. Literature research was done regarding the circular economy, the value hill and the topic of repurpose. Next to that, an explorative study was performed to gain insights in the practical approach of design and repurpose. This was done by investigating repurpose examples and conducting semi-structured interviews with (repurpose design) companies, on the topic of repurpose and design for repurpose. After that, the theoretical and practical insights on the topic of design for repurpose were gathered and formed into the first set of design for repurpose guidelines. Hereby two different tactics for design for repurpose were identified. One open ended approach repurpose approach (embracing uncertainty) and one close ended repurpose approach (embracing certainty). In the design phase, these new guidelines in design for repurpose were tested, by applying them in a design for repurpose case study. In cooperation with Springtime Design, a shared electrical step was chosen as the initial product. By applying the guidelines, the e-step was analyzed and the focus was given on repurposing the battery and motor components. By following the guidelines, a new suitable product was found in the form of a battery and motor module for an e-bike. By applying the guidelines of embodiment design, the concept TURN was developed. The potential of the design for repurpose guidelines was captured in the concept TURN, a repurposable motor and battery module for a shared electrical step. By three distinguishable functional modules, TURN is designed to be easily reconfigured from an e-step motor and battery into an e-bike motor and battery. By evaluating the design process of TURN, a revised set of the guidelines was created. Based on the design process of TURN, it could be concluded that the guidelines for design for repurpose could serve as a base set of guidelines to provide guidance for designers and companies in how to circularly design for repurpose. However, more case studies should be done, to test the overall understandability and the usability of these guidelines. Although it is expected that these guidelines will contribute in a positive way of optimally reusing and retaining material value, real cases need to be executed in order to validate its real impact, towards a circular economy.","Circular Product Design; Repurpose; Guidelines; Design for Repurpose; Circular Economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Deciding in the most optimal way what financial en- tities to investigate and when is not a trivial problem. However, optimizing this sequential decision making problem could significantly decrease the time-scale in which fraudulent actors are caught.

In particular, several Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning based methods are proposed that exploit the combinatorial structure of the actions to overcome the challenges associated with a large action space. The methods are empirically evaluated on the AML problem and compared to a baseline solution. The results indicate that exploiting the combinatorial structure increases the performance in this problem scenario. However, it seems that exploiting the structure to the highest degree does not always lead to the best performance.

With the use of heatpipes, placed into the aquifers, heat may be passively extracted. Vertical two-phase thermosiphons are considered in this study. As a result of a local increase in the saturation temperature in liquid pools, heat can only be transferred in the falling liquid film. The aim of this work is to investigate film heat transfer and its limitations at varying boundary conditions in the evaporator of a vertical experimental setup. An initially homogenized film is studied in a separate film heating section, in which a specific distribution of controlled band heaters and temperature transmitters enables the sensing of local film heat removal behaviour in the heatpipe. With increasing degrees of wall superheating, the mean film heat removal rate has been found to increase. Locally, beyond some degree of superheating, the heat transfer rate stagnates with increasing Jakob numbers, possibly as a result of film dry-out. As a result of such local behaviour, the slope of the mean heat transfer rate curve decreases with increasing Jakob numbers. The onset of dry-out, characterized by an increase in the intermittency of the results, has been studied by varying the initial liquid flow rate to the heated section. Both the initial film flow rate and the degree of superheating have been found to be of significance for the onset of film dry-out. Film dry-out takes place at flow rates less than some critical flow rate. The local heat removal rate decreases significantly if the initial film flow rate is decreased beyond the critical flow rate. The critical flow rate has been found to increase with increasing rates of superheating. The significance of the saturation temperature on the film heat transfer rate has also been studied in this work. The film heat transfer rate has been found to decrease with decreasing saturation temperature, for all in this study considered degrees of superheating. The steepest decline in heat transfer rates with decreasing saturation temperature is found for the smallest degree of superheating in the analysis. At last, the possibility of film re-distribution following dry-out has been considered. Melamine foam homogenizer rings, inserted in the film flow path, have been found to decrease the degree of film thickness variation in initially inhomogeneous films to some extent. Homogenized films were found to be able to transfer a greater amount of heat than films that had not been re-distributed. <br","film dry-out; film heat transfer; film homogenization; annular films; geothermal heat extraction; heat pipe limits; experimental thesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Adequately and regularly reconsidering the project portfolio, with interdependencies towards the internal and external complex and rapidly changing environment, has shown to be a determinant for being successful in creating competitive advantage and securing the future of organisations that are project-based. Especially in the information technology (IT) field, rapid technological changes aim for dynamic organisational capabilities. This is reflected by the demand for digitized project portfolio management (PPM) using Data &amp; Analytics. Although literature in the academic research field of project and project portfolio management describe different frameworks for PPM, there is a lack of context and practice. Information regarding comprehensive PPM frameworks that incorporate organisational, technological, and environmental factors found through empirical research are missing. Moreover, industry specific factors are missing as frameworks are generic and standardized, existing PPM practices miss adequacy and regularity and are often based on intuition, power, opinion, and leadership. To enhance competitive advantage within the AEC industry, a comprehensive approach in PPM is investigated with a focus on digitization and Data &amp; Analytics. The conceptual framework that is developed is built on the three pillars, people, processes, and technology. Adherent to the conceptual framework, key success factors (KSFs) for portfolio performance and project success in the AEC industry are found that in the end drive business success. Findings indicate that the whole range from descriptive analytics to prescriptive analytics apply to PPM practices. Most value can be derived through starting with improved descriptive analytics through visualization and dashboarding. The developed conceptual framework is theoretic and implementation of the framework in practice is subject to influencing factors. Findings indicate different categories of influencing factors, under which digitalization in the AEC industry, general barriers to PPM, project management and data management maturity, and barriers to Data &amp; Analytics. Some factors are covered through the framework, other factors are refuted with resolutions.","Project Management; Portfolio Management; AEC industry; Data; Analytics; Digitizing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To reduce the GHG-emissions more renewable energy is needed instead of electricity and energy production by fossil fuels, which are high in GHG-emissions. The electricity production by renewable sources has increased in the last couple of years in the Netherlands. However, renewable energy production via wind and solar energy is supply based, i.e. can only be supplied when wind and sun is available. Energy storage is needed to overcome the energy needs during low or no renewable energy in sustainable way. However, there barely seems to be any storage in the Netherlands. The market does currently not value all the services that storage can provide. Research into the value of storage is needed to understand the lack of energy storage and the current valuation of energy. Energy storage can have different levels and services that it can provide. In this thesis the focus will be on grid-scale energy storage. In the Netherlands there are no grid-scale energy storages. In other countries there are grid-scale energy storages, often in the form of Pumped Hydro Storage. In the Netherlands there is a plan, called Delta21, that wants to expand the Delta Works and improve water safety by using pumps. In the plan the pumps can also be used for a Pumped Hydro Storage to store energy. It is important to understand the value of storages like Delta21 in the Dutch electricity system.","Energy storage; Valuation; Arbitrage; Distribution Deferral; Carbon Abatement; Energy Transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Traffic congestion on highways is a multi-sectoral phenomenon affecting society, the economy and the environment. It often takes place at specific locations such as on and off-ramps, weaving segments and intersections. The on-ramp merging procedure is considered as one of the main factors that causes traffic congestion on highways. The studies in literature show that the merging procedure can result in adverse traffic scenarios such as the buildup of the vehicles on the ramp which causes a downstream drop in capacity and subsequent blockage of upstream off-ramp traffic flow. Moreover, the on-ramp vehicles need to take the actions of leading and following mainlane vehicles into account during the merging process. On highly congested roads, this merging process becomes even more tedious and undesirable stop-and-go traffic behavior becomes unavoidable. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) that can provide safe gaps between vehicles along with identifying appropriate merging speed profiles have the potential to reduce traffic accidents and improve traffic efficiency. This thesis introduces a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy for autonomous merging control based on a cost function that tracks the desired inter-vehicular gaps for on-ramp and mainlane vehicles, and thus intends to fully exploit the capacity of the road in order to maximize the traffic throughput. The proposed controller aims to optimize both acceleration and steering rate profiles of vehicles, and to guide on-ramp vehicles to merge efficiently, without frequent slowdown or wait for merging gaps at the end of the ramp along with minimal disruption to the mainlane traffic flow. The controller is evaluated under different initial conditions, ranging from low to high traffic conditions. The performance of the controller is compared to that of a baseline scenario, and the results show that the proposed controller increases travel times in the range of 2.46% and 4.17% for different traffic conditions, without disrupting the mainline traffic operation. Additionally, average speed of vehicles is improved in the range of 8.2% and 4.5% under different traffic conditions.","Model Predictive Control; Ramp Merging; Traffic Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

UAVs are used increasingly to assist rangers in patrol tasks. Effectively patrolling wildlife parks requires detailed knowledge of the environment and its threats, which is not always available. Previous work in Green Security Games (GSGs) that aims to develop defensive strategies to deter adversaries relies on historical poaching data to train machine learning models. Recent advancements in the field have led to the development of an online learning framework that does not require prior data. However, the defensive strategies resulting from this approach are focused on foot patrols by rangers, which do not have the same mobility as UAVs, or do not take into account spatio-temporal constraints associated with patrolling in a real-world situation at all. To address the desire of using UAVs for wildlife surveillance, this paper proposes MEOMAPP, a model that extends on the online learning approach by incorporating a patrol planning algorithm more suitable for aerial patrol. It also includes an evaluative algorithm that considers a human expert next to the online learning expert and balances the application of their strategies based on the observed performance of each expert. By simulating MEOMAPP in a realistic environment, the research demonstrates that the model is suitable to determine aerial surveillance strategies for wildlife conservation.","Green Security Games; Game Theory; Online Learning; Adversarial Bandits; Agent-Based Modelling; Aerial Surveillance; Wildlife Conservation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Consequently, previous research simulated the surface charge distribution of oxide surfaces as being static and assumed the effect of local protonation and deprotonation to be negligible. This work shows that varying the (de)protonation event period τ significantly influences the characteristics of the electric double layer (EDL). Continuous protonation and deprotonation changes the diffusion coefficient and subsequently alters the structure of the Stern layer, screening function, and preferential adsorption type. As a whole, dynamic surface charge distribution has a considerable impact on the characteristics of the electric double layer depending on τ and should be considered in future MD simulations.","Silica-electrolyte interface; Molecular Dynamics; Interfacial interactions; Protonation; Deprotonation; Silica; Adsoprtion; Diffusion; Surface charge distribution; Electric double layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Faber, J.S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The aim of this graduation project is to increase the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions, focused on vitality, for employees with a low socioeconomic status (SES). This project explores and maps out the organizational ecosystem of municipal reintegration company DZB Leiden to determine areas for improvement. These improvements should in-turn increase the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions at DZB Leiden. There are large differences in personal health as a consequence of different lifestyles between people with low or high socioeconomic status. By increasing the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions we might be able to decrease these differences. Low SES is often related to a poor lifestyle through poorer food choices, reduced physical activity, drinking and smoking habits. These habits have negative implications for the people with low SES as well as for the company they work for. Increased absenteeism, increased chance for non-communicable diseases, reduced productivity and a shorter life expectancy are some of the consequences that people with low SES have to cope with. DZB Leiden is a municipal reintegration company of the municipality of Leiden. DZB works with employees with a low SES in their sheltered workshops on a daily basis. They are there for anyone who has difficulty with keeping up with the daily work practices and offer them a safe environment to grow and thrive. People working in the sheltered workshops often cope with multiple disabilities. A healthy lifestyle can contribute on dealing with these disabilities and improve their way of life. Thus, increasing the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions should provide an improved quality of life as well as increasing the desirability of these employees. Multiple lifestyle interventions have been introduced at DZB Leiden, however these interventions have not always been successful. The interventions are often poorly executed, or simply forgotten, and dilute quickly due to daily issues that receive priority. Exploratory research has been performed to define two research scopes, which have the potential to contribute to increasing the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. These research scopes reside within the interpersonal and organizational ecosystems introduced by Bronfenbrenner in 1977. This graduation thesis explores the organizational ecosystem of DZB in-depth through semi-structured interviews and a stakeholder analysis. A strategy has been devised to improve different areas of the organizational system of DZB uncovered by the performed in-depth research. The performed research resulted in multiple findings for improving the effectiveness of the lifestyle interventions. These findings have been translated into design criteria for the devised strategy. One of these findings is the potential Team Fit has within DZB to increase awareness for vitality and introduce lifestyle interventions successfully. Therefore, Team Fit is used central in the devised strategy. This strategy is substantiated by the development of a future vision for DZB to strive towards. A strategic and tactical roadmap are introduced to guide DZB towards this future vision. These roadmaps show the goals that should be worked towards, the strategy necessary to achieve these goals, the tactics on how to achieve the strategy and the operationalization of the tasks that need to be performed. The devised strategy aims to set up a vitality network with municipal reintegration companies and healthcare providers via the collaboration of DZB and SPARK. Finally, the proposed strategy was evaluated with the current interim director of DZB and Team Fit. The aim of the evaluation was to determine if the proposed strategy meets all three key attributes of feasibility, desirability and viability towards valuable design. The evaluation shows that the proposed strategy in its current state is both feasible and desirable. However, further research is needed to determine if the strategy is viable and can survive in the long run. For the strategy to be viable it is recommended that a learning cycle for the interventions is implemented and research is conducted on the interpersonal ecosystem and incorporated into the proposed strategy. The graduation project consists of a total of four deliverables. Through a stakeholder analysis a power-interest matrix and stakeholder maps have been created which shows the involved parties, their interest in vitality as well as how much power they have to help realize this. Two roadmaps have been created via design roadmapping which allows us to strategically and tactically map out what is necessary to increase the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. Finally, recommendations for DZB are made on how to improve the strategy.","interventions; low socioeconomic status; Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The result is a large variety of algorithms to solve this sub-problem, which are often developed and optimized for a specific scenario of environment. This gives the robots a large set of different possible system configurations. Traditionally, the engineer makes the choice at design-time about which system configuration to use.

This knowledge will help the self-adaptive system to make a better informed decision about adaptation. The contribution of this research is an approach to construct this knowledge for the system. First, metrics for navigation quality in terms of safety and performance and relevant environment characteristics in relation to the navigation quality are developed. Machine learning methods are used to train quality models that can be used to predict the safety level of a system configuration based on the measurements of the environment characteristics.

The ongoing energy transition leads to an increasing share of renewables in the electricity mix. Since technical and geographical characteristics of renewables differ significantly from those of fossil fuels, it is likely that renewables affect energy relations between countries in a different way. It is yet unknown how these deviating characteristics will exactly influence the international energy relations, and evidence from concrete cases is missing. This study therefore examines the geopolitical implications of wind power in the Danish electricity system. The aim is to assess how interstate energy relations shifted between 1990 and 2018, and whether these shifts can be attributed to the technical and geographical characteristics of wind power. A framework of analysis is constructed to outline the geopolitical implications in 1990 and 2018. Desk research and expert interviews are used to obtain the data. The research concludes that the implications of the transition have been rather positive for Denmark. While sometimes depending on its neighbours for electricity supply, Denmark is still able to safeguard energy security, generate revenues and gain global political influence by sharing knowledge. Further research should outline the implications for other types of renewable energy sources and focus on the geopolitical implications of wind power in other regions.","Geopolitics, wind energy, renewables, Denmark","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Mantovanelli, Alessandra (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Estuaries are dynamic partially enclosed water bodies that are constantly or periodically influenced by the ocean and at least occasionally impacted by river discharge. This creates unique but fragile ecosystems that have to be managed with care in order to be recreationally, economically and ecologically valuable. One of the management issues is water quality, which is mainly influenced by hydrodynamic processes and other processes affecting the transport of dissolved or suspended materials. The understanding of the hydrodynamic processes of an estuary and its physical drivers is crucial for management. One of these fragile ecosystems that have been prone to many human interventions in the past, is the Leschenault Estuary. In this thesis, a 3D-numerical model is developed in D-Flow FM to unravel the governing hydrodynamics of the Leschenault Estuary. Besides, field measurements provided data used as input for the numerical model and more information about the dynamics of the Leschenault Estuary. Most importantly, a methodology is proposed to improve the efficiency in drawing relevant conclusions from observed and modelled data. Efficient and easy-to-apply classification methods are therefore considered that could be powerful management tools. To validate this methodology, a scenario has been considered where the Preston River is aligned to the Bunbury Port. The governing hydrodynamic processes in the Leschenault Estuary are internal circulation, stratification and turbulence, which are predominantly driven by the freshwater discharge and the tides. However, the dominant physical processes are highly dependent on the seasonal conditions and the specific locations. In general, three different seasonal conditions were distinguished: normal summer, normal winter and peak river discharge conditions. In summer, freshwater discharge is reduced, which increased the impact of tidal stirring and vertical mixing. In winter, the high river flow generated more stratified flows and under peak discharge conditions some areas of the estuary presented salt-wedge regimes. The Leschenault Estuary can be spatially subdivided in four distinct regions (southern, central, northern and riverine basin), based on the governing hydrodynamic processes. The southern basin is the most dynamic and can not be specified by a single regime due to the influence of the ocean, the Preston River, the Collie River and the northern regions. The central and northern basins were classified as partially-mixed throughout the year and showed weakly to strongly stratified water bodies, depending on the seasonal conditions. Furthermore, a classical estuarine circulation develops under normal winter conditions. In summer, the northern regions become hypersaline, generating an inverse circulation in the central and northern basins. The Collie River is characterized by a partially-mixed water body, with high stratification. Under peak discharge conditions, the salt wedge can be temporally forced out of the river and partially out of the estuary. Winds, waves and Coriolis have a significant influence on the hydrodynamics of the central and northern basin, due to their shallow and stagnant waters. The driving forces of the salt transport were obtained by the decomposition of the salt flux. The main physical processes affecting the salt transport between the estuary and the ocean along the transect of the 'Cut' over the whole year and in winter were freshwater discharge, topographic trapping and Stokes drift. Stokes drift was dominant in summer, followed by freshwater discharge and topographic trapping. This indicates that regardless the season the advective terms were dominant drivers of the salt transport. It also indicates the seasonality of the salt flux at the 'Cut'. The dominant salt flux components at the central basin was the Stokes drift, followed by freshwater discharge and topographic trapping. The Preston River alignment was compared with its current location to provide useful information for management and to evaluate the efficacy of the adopted classification methods. The scenario results were significantly different than the initial model results and the Preston River alignment had a substantial impact on the hydrodynamics of the Bunbury Port and the southern basin. Bunbury Port circulation became more stratified and its seasonal variation was increased, while the southern basin became less dynamic and partially-mixed, with low to high stratification. The Collie River and central and northern basins however remained almost unaffected. Further, the physical drivers of the salt transport did not vary much but the role of the Stokes drift became relatively more pronounced at the `Cut', due to the decreased influence of freshwater discharge and topographic trapping. At the central basin, the Preston River alignment had a negligible effect on the physical drivers of the salt transport. However, larger spatial and temporal variability of salinity and temperature distributions were observed. It is therefore recommended to conduct an additional ecological valuation of this intervention. Valuable insights were presented in this thesis that have been critically validated. The used methods have proven to be efficient and valuable tools for management.","salinity; estuary; temperature; leschenault; perth; swan estuary; bunbury; circulation patterns; hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-33.3210, 115.6383"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the report that is before you, a method has been investigated to increase the capacity of domestic hot water tanks. To do so without having to increase the volume of the tank, a phase change material has been included in an annular space around the tank. To test the performance of such a system, three main topics are dealt with in this report. First of all, the most suitable phase change material was selected. There exist many types of phase change materials, all having completely different properties, advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, weak spots were indicated during melting of the phase change material. These spots indicate the locations of the worst heat transfer rate, and to improve the performance of the system, these spots can be treated separately in future experiments or models, for example by placing fins at those locations. Finally, the response time of the phase change material was investigated during a typical discharge cycle to investigate the amount of latent heat that was released to the water. To model the charging- and discharging cycle, the vorticity stream method was used to create a two dimensional axisymmetric model. This model was implemented into MATLAB. The Boussinesque approximation was assumed to take into account buoyancy effects. Furthermore, only diffusive heat transfer was assumed to take place throughout the PCM and the effect of convection was neglected. Results showed that paraffin based PCMs are most suitable for applications in domestic hot water tanks. They are inert and stable, and their thermal properties do not degrade in time. They have suitable melting temperatures and high latent heat. To increase the thermal conductivity, dispersion of high density alumina particles was applied. Although the charging model did not reach the asymptotic range of convergence, it was shown that melting 5.0 cm PCM required long periods of time. After 9 hours, part of the PCM was still in its solid phase. Due to thermal stratification in the tank, the slowest melting rate was seen at the lower outer edges of the tank. During the discharge cycle, it was shown that not all PCM was able to release its latent heat to the water: 16.9% did not solidify. This occurred at an adapted flow rate to match the discharge time for both tanks. For higher flow rates, used in domestic hot water tanks, the amount of liquid PCM would even be greater, resulting in less latent energy release to the water. Based on the fact that 5.0 cm PCM did not increase the heat capacity of the tank, and all the previously mentioned factors, it is concluded that the performance of a hot water tank enhanced with PCM in an annular space does not increase the performance of a domestic hot water tank. Some suggestions were made regarding the possibilities of increasing the performance of the tank in future models and experiments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Faludi, J.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Additive Manufacturing (AM) is undergoing a radical evolution. AM businesses such as Ultimaker (UM) are speeding up industrial production through digital design and local manufacturing to enable industries to produce “what they need, where they need it, and when they need it” (“Ultimaker”, 2019), while also being cost-effective. AM is perceived as a key sustainable technology as it enables efficient design and is believed to make less waste (“AMFG”, 2020), thus putting Ultimaker in a position to offer sustainability enhancements for their clients’ manufacturing processes. One topic of debate for AM sustainability, and the topic of investigation for this thesis, is whether bioplastics are more sustainable than fossil-based plastics for Fused Depositon Modeling (FDM) 3D Printing. Although PLA, a commonly used FDM material, is bio-based, it was hitherto unclear how much using this material and other BBPs can reduce the ecological impact of the 3D printing (3DP) process. This investigation was conducted in three phases- First, gaining an understanding of the context through literature review, market analysis and expert interviews. Second, material tests conducted to compare energy use and material properties of 3DP filaments. Third, a synthesis of findings from the first two phases into a material guide and recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of 3DPrinting. Whereas polymers are classified as bio-based/fossil-based and biodegradable/non-biodegradable, the 3DP filament materials available in the market often contain additives, fillers, or other polymers which make them difficult to categorize in a single type (Rohringer, 2020). Hence, a variety of polymers were selected for conducting material studies- including 3 UM-standard filaments, and 5 new filaments. Both environmental and functional properties were studied. For environmental impacts, literature showed that across the different parts of the 3DP filament life cycle, electricity use of the printer is the biggest contributor to ecological impact (Faludi et al., 2015). This motivated the investigation of energy use of a UM printer while printing selected materials. For functionality, expert interviews highlighted tensile properties, dimensional accuracy, and ease of printing as the most important criteria in the material selection process- thus motivating comparison tests for the same. An energy use comparison test revealed that electricity use is mainly influenced by build plate heating. More research is recommended to minimize build-plate heating for UM printers through solutions such as insulating the build chamber, or localized heating of build plate. The print quality and tensile tests affirm BIOPETG as a potential drop in replacement for UM-CPE. For both tests, new materials performed slightly worse, albeit often at acceptable levels, as compared to UM-standard materials. However, this can be attributed to the rudimentary level of print process optimization conducted for the new materials. Thus, it is recommended that these materials go through an elaborate optimization process in order to gain a more accurate impression of functional performance. As the final outcome of this investigation, the data collected was compiled into a material guide containing material properties and sustainability indicators. This visual can be referred by end-users like engineers, designers and production professionals to make appropriate material choices for their applications.","3D Printing; Bioplastics; Sustainability; Materials; FDM printing; Ultimaker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Riva, R.E.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In Southeast Alaska extreme uplift rates are primarily caused by Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), as a result of ice load changes from the Little Ice Age to the present combined with a low viscosity asthenosphere. Current GIA models adopt a one-dimensional (1D) stratified Earth structure. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Earth is complex in this region due to the proximity of a subduction zone and the transition from a continental to oceanic plate. A simplified 1D Earth model may not be an accurate representation in this region and therefore affect the GIA predictions. In this study a numerical model for 3D GIA is constructed for Southeast Alaska. We present an assessment on the impact of lateral variations in the upper mantle rheology on the vertical GIA component. We test two different approaches to obtain a 3D viscosity structure in the upper mantle. For the first approach, viscosities are inferred from lateral variations in temperature through flow laws for olivine. The water and grain size are varied to find a viscosity structure that best fits the GPS data. We find a best-fit viscosity structure with wet rheology (400 wt ppm H<sub>2</sub>O) and grain size 8 mm. However, this model does not perform better (in terms of Χ<sup>2</sup>) than a radially symmetric model, because predicted uplift rates are much lower than the observed values. For the second approach, we infer a viscosity distribution obtained directly from shear wave anomalies through scaling relationships. Our 3D model reduces the residuals between 1.0-2.7 mm/yr. We find that the effects of lateral variations in viscosity (up to 0.4 log units or, equivalently, a factor of 2.5) are in principle detectable by the GPS network and provide a better overall fit than a radially symmetric 1D viscosity model.","glacial isostatic adjustment; alaska; little ice age; numerical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The last mile delivery of these parcels into an urban area create big problems such as congestion and pollution. In order to tackle these problems new solutions have been found by either changing the operations of the system or using different vehicles. It is difficult to predict what will happen when these solutions are implemented in an urban area. Thus freight models are required to evaluate these last-mile solutions. This research used Agent-based modeling (ABM) to evaluate last-mile solutions for the delivery of parcels in a zero-emission urban area. The four last-mile solutions that were evaluated are vehicle type, collaboration levels, varying number of UCCs and varying parcel acceptance rates. The results show that electric delivery vans perform better than cargo bikes based on distance traveled, cost and number of vehicles required. On collaboration levels it shows that full collaboration can have a positive impact on distance travel traveled and cost. It is suggested to use two UCCs instead of five since having more UCCs does not decrease distance traveled and costs. The results also showed that when all parcels are accepted in the system on their first try it reduces cost, distance traveled by all vehicles and the total number of vehicles required. Local administrators can use these results when tackling the impact ever increasing growth of e-commerce and the parcels that need to be delivered.","Zero emission zone; Microsimulation; Agent-Based Modeling; Last mile delivery; Parcel Delivery; Scenarios; Rotterdam; Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(graduation committee); Heijhoff, Michael (graduation committee); Blok, Laurens (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Van Gils is, or at least known as, a traditional menswear brand that focuses on formal wear. Due to changes in the fashion industry and an on-going casualization trend, the brand is in need of a change.The developments in the industry consist of, among others, organisations and brands adopting purpose-driven mindsets, dress code changes in workplaces, and the increased awareness arisen due to fast fashion. ‘Purpose’ has become the lens and language used to work on this change in business. Purpose is the reason for a brand’s existence. Currently, consumers are making carefully considered choices regarding their purchasing decisions. They are choosing brands and organisations that they personally identify with and reflect their values and beliefs. Increasingly more companies are changing their dress codes and changing nature of workplaces generally in favour of a more casual environment, and, therefore, an explicit need for formal wear is becoming less existent.Retailers like H&amp;M and Zara introduced fast fashion by making it possible for everyone to shop for on-trend clothes whenever they wanted. However, an increased consumer awareness has arisen of the environmental impact of fast fashion due to the quick turnaround process to get these products into the market. Conducted analyses propose an opportunity for Van Gils to introduce another brand. For instance, the company wants to stay true to loyal customers while also reaching out to a new and, most importantly, younger audience. Additionally, based on the consumer research an explicit need has been found that fits the need of the company. It has been found that participants have two ways of expressing oneself. Either having the need to express oneself as ambitious and professional by wearing formal attire when, for instance, having an important business meeting or expressing oneself as easy-going and approachable, and therefore, wearing smart casual attire, when for example enjoying recreational time. This thesis has several outcomes: 1. A theoretical framework providing a thorough understanding of brand revitalization and related subject matter. 2. A strategic direction introducing a two-brand strategy for Van Gils. 3. a brand book showcasing the new brand, SATURDAY and 4. several brand touchpoint designs visualizing the translation from brand book to design examples.In conclusion, a two-brand strategy has been introduced. This ensures that Van Gils as a brand stays true to loyal customers by providing what the brand is known for, its formal attire, and additionally, reaching out to another target audience by introducing smart casual attire.","Brand Revitalization; Brand Strategy; Menswear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Netherlands will need to transform her traditionally fossil fueled energy system in the coming decades to achieve the goal of reducing CO2 emissions to net-zero in 2050. Therefore, an increase in renewable energy sources as solar and wind energy in the overall energy mix will be essential. However, due to the highly variable energy production patterns of these renewable energy sources, a primary need for energy storage is created. Since electricity can not be stored on a large enough scale to balance significant energy fluctuations, the need for a gaseous CO2 neutral energy carrier is created. In The Netherlands, this role could potentially be fulfilled by green hydrogen gas. Green hydrogen can be stored in geological formations such as depleted gas reservoirs. Due to the immense storage volumes and frequent occurrence in the Dutch subsurface, depleted gas reservoirs could be an excellent opportunity to serve as large scale energy storage sites. Moreover, underground natural gas storage in gas reservoirs is a proven and used technique in The Netherlands. Utilizing a natural gas reservoir as a hydrogen storage site comes with several challenges. This report provides a full overview of all the challenges with underground hydrogen storage in geological formations as aquifers, depleted gas reservoirs and salt caverns based on literature. In this way, the full potential and risks of using depleted gas reservoirs for this technique is clearly highlighted. Using this overview, a priority scheme for the usage of different geological formations as storage facilities for hydrogen is proposed. In combination with possible meteorological conditions combined with different Dutch policy scenarios, a minimum seasonal storage need of 16 TWh through the use of hydrogen is identified. Using the priority scheme, rock salt caverns are used as much as possible to fulfill the minimal need for seasonal hydrogen storage. By performing an analysis on the potential subsurface storage capacity in The Netherlands, it becomes clear that the Dutch subsurface can not realize more than 12.1 TWh of potential hydrogen storage capacity by only utilizing salt caverns. Since depleted gas reservoirs are identified as the best alternative for underground hydrogen storage, a minimum need for hydrogen storage from Dutch depleted gas reservoirs is estimated at 3.9 TWh in 2050. In this thesis, all physical and chemical aspects that are important during the subsurface storage of hydrogen in porous media are addressed. This leads to the identification of potential losses of hydrogen during the storage of the gas in the depleted gas reservoir. Analyzing all the possible methods leading to potential hydrogen loss shows that on the long term, bacterial conversion seems to be the biggest challenge if no measures against this conversion are taken. Using numerical reservoir simulation as a quantification and sensitivity analysis tool, the hydrodynamic behaviour of hydrogen in contact with other gasses is described. This is done by introducing a dimensionless gravity number. The interpretation of this number shows if the displacement process is either dominated by viscous or gravitational forces. Furthermore, the displacement efficiency of hydrogen towards other gasses is analyzed. Displacement of hydrogen towards residual gasses in porous media dominated by viscous forces proves to be more efficient than the displacement dominated by gravitational forces. By performing cyclic storage simulations, the overall efficiency of injecting and reproducing hydrogen from a depleted gas reservoir is examined. This is done for both homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs. By performing a sensitivity analysis on the input parameters of the simulator, an overview is given of the parameters that will have the most positive or negative impact on the cycle efficiency. The results of the simulation show a regular cycle efficiency that is estimated at roughly 70%. Applying a higher difference in injection and production pressure leads to a lower cycle efficiency whereas using a more elongate reservoir as storage site shows to have a positive effect on the overall cyclic efficiency.","Hydrogen; Storage; Depleted gas reservoir; Gravity Number; Reservoir Simulation; The Netherlands; Seasonal storage; Feasibility Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

By conducting a discourse analysis of annual reports of three IOCs (Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and Equinor), in combination with several interviews. The results reveal that the energy transition is a topic of debate for IOCs. Several factors have known fluctuations in importance over the years due to the energy transition. However, not all these fluctuations in factors are explained by the influence of the energy transition. Also, six new energy transition-related factors are proposed and found to impact the IOCs' strategy. Furthermore, although IOCs are an indispensable part of the puzzle to the energy transition's success, collaboration is vital. The IOC’s renewable investments lag, but the newly presented strategies could move the energy transition from being a topic of debate to a shift of substance.

(graduation committee); Pavlic, V. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The construction and logistics sectors in the Netherlands are rapidly increasing in size, but unfortunately are also part of the most hazardous industries. One part of safety which needs to be addressed is manual handling related incidents. The moving of objects around a worksite through utilization of an employee’s body increases the exposure of the employees to hazards, especially if done incorrectly, and will increase costs for both employee and employer. This thesis explores the possibility of transforming the passive and reactive role of safety shoes into safety shoes that are capable of proactive (manual handling related) incident prevention, through utilization of smart technology. To gain insight into the problem, its context and the possibilities for the implementation of smart technology, an extensive literature review was conducted. In addition, practical field knowledge was gained through multiple series of semi-structured interviews and analysis of relevant cases. Research results show that the human factor plays a major role in the causation of occupational incidents and can be divided into three categories: the individual, the task and the organisation. As this human factor is either the leading cause or part of the cause for around 80% of all incidents, it is vital for incident prevention. Furthermore, current methods for detection and prevention (e.g. manual handling training and safety programs) have serious shortcomings which make them less effective tools for the reduction or elimination of manual handling related incidents. In addition to this, studies indicate the opportunity for (smart) technology to aid in overcoming these shortcomings. The above mentioned insights served as input for the synthesis of a concept design (smart safety shoes), which uses sensors and data analysis tools (e.g. machine learning) to identify and detect leading and lagging indicators for manual handling related incidents and subsequently is able to effectively communicate those insights to different parties: employees, employers, supervisors and training providers. The smart safety shoes can, in this manner, support current detection and prevention methods in their shortcomings. The before mentioned parties deploy the insights through a hybrid system: reactive incident prevention (improve the individual) and proactive prevention (improve task design and organization), which both, increase incident prevention. The concept design is accompanied by a roadmap outlining the general steps for the development of the concept. To conclude, smart safety shoes are the next step towards occupational incident prevention and potentially the first step towards smart, ubiquitous, occupational safety. However, further research is needed for the development of the smart safety shoes and the exploration of further possibilities. In addition to this, the principles behind the smart safety shoes could serve as a basis for further design research, to address other occupational safety issues and other industries.","Smart technology; Protective footwear; Incident prevention; Leading indicator; Lagging indicator; Occupational safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-09","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (graduation committee); Ortt, J.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The research is set out in context of the global effort to provide electricity access to millions of people in Africa. A part of the effort also emphasizes on the empowerment of people to earn a means of living for themselves. In the this backdrop, the efforts for electrification are two-fold; large centralized power plants on one hand, while distributed generation from technologies like diesel, solar, hydro and wind on the other. The former strategy seems to be aimed at places with adequate grid access, such as cities and developed towns. However, the demographics in Africa are such that there are densely populated rural settlements, where the main grid has not reached yet. For such places or communities, the grid based energy could be expensive, and therefore distributed generation is being held as a viable solution. Through several research studies in the past it has been established that for such densely populated remotes, distributed generation (through mini-grids or solar home systems) is indeed a financially sustainable alternative. This alternative has been emphasized time and again by organisations such as the United Nations and the World Bank, who have actively been working of universal electricity access for a long time. Despite this international impetus, distributed generation from mainly solar PV mini-grids and home systems continue to face challenges in deployment. The research here in sets out to attempt to understand the effort and the challenges, and constitutes the main societal problem driving our research. In order to understand these issues, different perspectives are explored. Technology and policy lenses have already been applied to understand the effort, and it is for long understood that technology isn't a problem anymore. In contrast, the idiosyncrasies of business models and associated frameworks, is found to provide a unique perspective to look at these issues. Since businesses are the ones actively involved in the electrification effort, it can be argued that businesses can shed more light on the matter. Within business model frameworks, the dynamic perspective to look at businesses has been gaining momentum although a lot seems left to be explored. The dynamic perspective, as the name suggests considers a business as constantly changing entity, rather than conventional static representations. Given the rapidly evolving markets for electrification in Africa, the business model dynamics methodologies are interesting to explore. Additionally there are gaps in literature about the frameworks applicability to bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) markets, which is an aspect that the analysis herein can help develop. Frugal innovations and associated idiosyncrasies have a lot of potential and application to BOP markets, and can be used to fill such gaps. Therefore the main research question question that this thesis wishes to address emerges as: ""How can we develop a Business Model Dynamics framework with the help of Bottom-of-Pyramid Frugal innovations and business models perspective, and understand the electrification effort in Africa?” To start with, a detailed literature study is conducted on researches about the electricity market situation in Africa, business model dynamics and frugal innovation. The former is carried out to give us an understanding of the value chains of the approaches to electrification (mini-grids and solar-storage solutions), and set a baseline for our analysis. Next, Business models and business model dynamics idiosyncrasies are understood, and frameworks developed in the past are studied. In the third past of the literature study, frugal innovations theory is examined to understand how can we identify steps that firms take to fit-in the BOP markets. With this knowledge gathered, in the next step this research proceeds to develop its own unique framework. A conceptual framework is developed using a pre-established methodology, which captures dynamics of the business models of firms in the market. In addition to that, it captures the frugal aspects or strategies employed by businesses. Then the framework was applied to the firms in two different markets for electrification- the solar hybrid mini-grids and individual solar home systems. The designed framework is novel and its reflected upon with the applications. Through this research the business model dynamics theory and its intersection with frugal innovations theory, is understood and demonstrated. The framework's overall performance is tested through the applications, and we learnt that it is indeed possible to create a framework that can capture both perspectives together. This research contributes to the advancement of business model dynamics theory and frameworks, which are useful tools to analyze businesses particularly in bottom of the pyramid markets. It is established that frugal innovations indeed take shape due to constantly changing business models, and therefore there is synergy in both topics. This is the academic contribution that the research makes. Besides that, the framework's application to firms in different markets, regions and circumstances is discussed. Furthermore, the framework's results are analyzed to understand generalizations for the market of electrification. Understanding the micro-challenges within the market, some possible strategies are developed and applied to a few companies. The practical contributions of this research therefore include a few strategies to increase the deployment of electrification technologies in Africa. Finally, the research concludes with recommendations on directions for further exploration.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Their loss of development time in the womb disrupts their growth, and the neonatal intensive care unit environment can add multiple stresses that hinder their development. This can partly be attributed to the intrusive environment of a neonatal intensive care unit incubator. Neonatal development cannot be monitored without multiple wires and sensors, such as pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram (ECG). The strong adhesives of these sensors can hurt the delicate skin of the neonates and the sensors make bonding with parents difficult. The issue of the intrusive nature of current neonatal healthcare has led this thesis towards something not normally associated with healthcare: radar. Millimeter wave radar with frequency modulation of the continuous wave transmission has been shown to measure adult’s heart and respiration rate without contact with the patient. Using the small wavelength and high configurability of frequency modulated millimeter wave radar, the goal will be to scale down this technology from adults to neonates that can be as small as 500 grams. This thesis provides a look into the application investigation of frequency modulated millimeter wave radar in monitoring neonates. It dives into the environment of the neonatal intensive care unit incubator and the radar monitoring system operation. The environment is modelled with a thermal focus to avoid high temperature increases caused by the radar module. The system operation is described and the most influential component simulated and characterized. Lastly, the thermal model of the neonatal intensive care unit incubator is validated to understand how the system operation influences the environment. And the radar system operation will be characterized for measuring the smallest amplitude changes of a chest to understand how the environment influences the system performance. The conclusion of this thesis will provide reasoning for why or why not the application of frequency modulated millimeter wave radar has the capability to be safely implemented in the neonatal intensive care unit.","Neonatology; Millimeter-wave; Vital signs; Frequency Modulation; Monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","","",""

(mentor); Casalino, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Over the past decades, numerous methods have been used to study acoustic liners through their impedance, of which numerical methods are of particular interest. Despite their advantages, numerical methods are bounded by certain drawbacks. One such drawback stems from the need to accurately discretize the liner geometry, which can lead to large simulation wall-clock time. Another limitation is caused by the absence of a stable and robust impedance boundary condition to account for the liner effects. With such limitations, there is a need to develop new methodologies which can effectively mimic the effects of an acoustic liner. A possible approach could be to model them as equivalent fluids. Thus, the primary objective of this project is to investigate the efficacy of the equivalent fluid approach to reproduce the liner effects. To satisfy this objective, the Acoustic Porous Medium (APM), which is an equivalent fluid formulation available in the flow-solver PowerFLOW® is employed in the current thesis. For reproducing the liner effects with an APM, two different methodologies are explored. In the first approach, the APM model parameters are derived through an inverse algorithm which uses a priori known impedance as an input and gives the corresponding model parameters as an output. In the second approach, the APM parameters are derived through the pressure drop values, measured across the liner facesheet under a steady laminar flow. With both these approaches, APM faces some limitations when compared with the reference results. The shortcoming is primarily cause by the inability of the APM formulation to correctly account for the mass reactance effects of the reference liner. Moreover, the results have also raised doubts over the use of the APM formulation for low input porosity values. Thus, some improvements are required in the current implementation of APM to improve its efficacy for reproducing the acoustic effects of liner used in this thesis.","Aeroacoustics; CFD; lattice boltzmann method; Honeycomb liner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In particular, visibility downward and to the far side of the cockpit is limited, reducing the field of view of the outside environment available to the pilot. This can be potentially corrected by means of AR goggles adding virtual chin and side windows, supplementing those present in the simulator’s cabin. The visual system of the SIMONA Research Simulator (SRS) was complemented with AR goggles generating additional outside visuals, and this prototype was tested in a human-inthe-loop experiment where flight performance, workload and motion sickness parameters were evaluated in a precision piloting task, with and without the AR visuals. Results confirmed that the prototype was functionally working, with the selected piloting task having been completed both with and without the added AR visuals. However, further analysis found no significant effects of the AR visuals’ presence on flight performance, workload and motion sickness. It was concluded that the high levels of noise found in the data were caused by a mismatch between the piloting task and the participants population.","Augmented Reality; helicopter; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, A. (graduation committee); van Zuthem, Hester (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The aim of this thesis was to enable people in the last stage of dementia, that are confined to their bed or room, and the people around them with shared positive moments. In order to design an experimental concept proposal that could accomplish that aim, the emotional needs of people living with dementia and the people around them were explored. Research activities consisting of a literature review, documentaries review and conducting interviews were conducted to generate understanding of the context. Analysing the findings from these activities resulted in identifying the emotional needs and an overview was presented in a stakeholder journey map. It was discovered that due to dementia, people start to live in another ‘inner past world’ that looks a lot like the past. This causes a lot of anxiety to people living with dementia. It was revealed that by bringing back their personal memories from the past, people living with dementia are able to get out of their “inner past world’ and get back to the actual world. This causes them to feel at ease and happy. These personal memories are part of their identity, so focussing on their identity is very crucial in reducing their anxiety. However, bringing back memory events is not easy for people living with dementia. In the last phase, people living with dementia are only able to communicate when their senses are activated. Stimulating their senses is essential for them to connect with their identity and thus to get that at ease and happy feeling. From these insights the following design goal was formulated: “Making the Person living with Dementia to feel at ease by giving them the ability to reconnect with their identity and interests.” From this design goal and the findings in the analysis, a concept direction was driven. The concept direction describes that the concept consists of three parts: an input, an internal part and an output. The different parts are connected to each other over time. The concept starts with an input where the identity of the person living with dementia is explored with a tool, specifically focussing on personal experiences. The information gained during the input will be internally turned into sensory elements that are placed in the output’s part of the concept. When people living with dementia are in the last stage of dementia the concept’s output can stimulate them with the identity events gathered during the input. By presenting this output with sensory stimulation, people living with dementia are able to connect with the event. The concept direction was the foundation of the exploration during ideation. By combining findings from different ideation activities, ideas on how the input and the output of the concept could possibly look like were generated. The input of the concept should be in the shape of an interview with assignments. The person living with dementia should be supported during this interview by a family member/ the informal caregiver. The interview focuses on gaining information about the background and general likes, but goes deeper into activities that they enjoyed while aged 15 to 25 years old. The output of the concept should focus on stimulating as many senses as possible. Therefore the output consists of a digital element for visual and auditory stimulation and of a physical element for tactile and olfactory stimulation. These decisions were summarized in the concept’s scenario. The scenario was used to evaluate the feasibility of the concept. According to the addressed experts, the concept is very feasible. This is due to the fact that the concept stimulates the senses of people living with dementia to reconnect them with their most memorable memories. In order to clarify what the presented output could look like, examples from multi sensory environments were presented. The elements used in multi sensory environments can be used in the output of the concept, but in a personalised way. Also in comparison to the multi sensory environment, the concept’s output should be an experience brought to the person, instead of bringing the person to the experience. Based on the validation, it could be concluded that the proposed concept could serve as a base to further develop, test and research the possibilities of personalised multi sensory stimulation within the private room environment.","Dementia; Quality of Life; Personalisation; Multi Sensory Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The sensor-based nature of the method brings attractive properties which has made it popular in the last decade. INDI globally linearizes the system by making use of control input and state derivative feedback. The time lag between control input and state derivative is seen as one of the main challenges of the method. This has been partially solved by synchronization of actuator outputs with measurement, although the method is still vulnerable to unexpected measurement delays. This paper proposes Hybrid INDI approach to alleviate measurement delays and to reduce sensor dependence of INDI. The approach fuses the system model and sensor measurement via a complementary filter that produces angular acceleration estimation. The estimation responds fast to the system input thanks to the on-board model. It has also a low-frequency accuracy because of the sensor measurement. The method is found to retain good performance in case of model mismatches and measurement delays.

Strong institutions are necessary to find solutions to these water challenges. To improve the understanding on institutions, development of knowledge and skills on institutions could be strengthened among local stakeholders. This process can be referred to as institutional focussed capacity development. In this study, it is explored how institutional focussed capacity development activities among local professionals in the water sector can be evaluated. An analytical evaluation framework for assessing capacity development initiatives from an institutional perspective is proposed. The framework is complemented by a step-by-step approach in which different elements necessary to identify change such as input of an intervention, the output, outcome and impact are specified. These elements are nested on an individual, organizational, and environmental level. The framework allows one to capture the relations between the elements and the interaction with the context through causal relations. To evaluate the development of institutional capacity, the framework is applied to a participatory institutional analysis project in Khulna through an illustrative case study. Moreover, the framework was validated with help of four experts. The study demonstrates that the framework and the step-by-step approach serve as an explorative analysis tool which supports in identifying the crucial elements and the relations of institutional capacity development. The framework allows us to identify different mechanisms of change caused by the process of capacity development and influenced by the contextual factors. The framework contributes to existing work by using causal relations and feedback loops to capture emergent behavior that underlies the process of capacity development. Based on the case study and expert sessions, the study proposes several recommendation to further develop the framework into a second version and to generalize the findings by application to additional cases both within and outside the water sector.","Capacity development; Institutional development; Monitoring and evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","CPIA",""

BIAZA is an association with 121 member zoos and aquariums in the UK and Ireland. It’s member zoos and aquariums receive a whopping audience of about 35 million visitors every year, which is more than half of the total populations of the UK and Ireland combined. The initial brief from BIAZA was ‘How can their member zoos and aquariums leverage the huge audience to drive a positive societal change?” To answer the question, the project begins to explore four main domains of research: Biodiversity, Behavioral change, The UK as a society, and Zoos and Aquariums. for its aesthetic value and has limited knowledge about his/her relationships with the animal world. This lack of recognition and acknowledgment of one’s relationships with the animal world weakens one’s environmental identity. Hence, ‘development of an identity that recognizes and acknowledges one’s relationships with the natural world’ is defined as the ‘change to aim for’. lives as they leave the zoo. Hence the app takes the visitors Beyond the zoo and also remains with the visitor beyond the zoo. Following the design, the concept is prototyped and tested with the users and validates by a zoo educator. The concept received extremely positive feedback from both of them establishing its desirability, feasibility, and viability. From the research about Biodiversity, it is derived that Biodiversity is crucial for the maintenance of Ecosystems. Human life in many ways depend on the ecosystem services. However, biodiversity is declining globally at an alarmingly fast pace due to human activities such as intensified agricultural, overexploitation, and pollution. At the core of such systemic activities, lies an individual’s everyday behaviors. This project aims to influence these individual behaviors. The insights from the behavioral change literature suggest that many factors influence one’s behaviors including environmental identity, which is the best predictor of one’s pro-environmental behaviors. Through this lens of behavioral change, the UK society’s engagement with the problem of loss of biodiversity is explored via interviews and literature research. It is concluded that overall a typical UK citizen loves nature and wildlife Based on the change to aim for, the context of Zoos is explored to recognize the efforts of zoos to educate people about conservation and the effects these efforts have on the visitors. It is concluded that zoos show great potential for the development of identity because of the presence of a live animal’s ability to generate an emotional connection with the animal. Based on the capacity of zoos to connect people with the animals, the role of zoos in moving forward towards the systemic direction is “To strengthen people’s relationships with biodiversity”. With the goal for the zoos defined, a three phased approach of Show, Sensitize and Inspire is proposed to the zoos to move forward towards achieving this goal.. Based on the proposed approach, the concept of “Beyond the Zoo” is designed. The major part of the concept is an app supported by minor physical infrastructures at the zoo. The app can be downloaded by the visitors and is designed to work in tandem with a zoo visit. The concept is designed to motivate visitors to learn more about the interspecific relationships between animals in an engaging and exciting ‘treasure hunt’s fashion. The app is also designed to engage people in recognizing the contributions of biodiversity to their everyday life and subsequently inspire and support them to take positive actions in their own The project ends with providing implementation guidelines and other recommendations to BIAZA for moving forward with this particular concept and towards the systemic direction defined for zoos.","Behavioral change; societal change; relationships; Environmental Identity; Zoos and Aquariums; Biodiversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Poorte, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Renewable energy sources like wind and solar, are intermittent, which means demand will not always match supply causing volatile and sometimes even negative electricity prices. For power companies it will be valuable to invest in technologies that can respond to those prices, which will result in an increasing flexibility of demand. However, to which electricity price and in what capacity these flexible technologies respond, and thus price elasticity occurs, is uncertain. The uncertainty regarding the future development of flexibility complicates the prediction of future electricity prices and therefore, the current investment decisions of power companies. Furthermore, when more investments are made in flexible demand-side energy technologies, it can be expected that the effective moments with negative or low prices will be low, because the price elasticity of electricity demand increases due to the extra installed flexible capacity. This would then negatively affect the business cases of these technologies. So, more detailed insight on the potential price-driven flexible demand in the Netherlands and the effect of this flexibility on the electricity prices is needed so that accurate investment decisions can be made. Electricity price modelling and scenario analysis was done in order to assess the effect of demand response, storage and flexible demand-side technologies, such as power-to-heat or power-to-gas, on the electricity price. The results show that flexible demand increases the electricity price during low-priced hours and decreases the electricity price during peak hours, having a flattening effect on the price duration curves. Moreover, the scenario shows that given the electricity prices there is at least room for 6000 MW upward flexible demand and 1700 MW downward flexible demand in an energy system with 50% VRE, and 11000 MW upward flexible demand and 5200 MW downward flexible demand in an energy system with 70% VRE. Nonetheless, a small case study on the potential of a power-to-heat technology points out the most progressive flexible demand scenarios might not be realistic because there are other limitations to the potential of flexible demand than the availability of electricity prices to which the technologies can respond. Lastly, it was concluded price-driven flexible demand improves the integration of VRE into the energy system.","Flexible electricity demand; Electricity Prices; Demand Response; Storage; Price elasticity; Power-to-heat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The port of Rotterdam is located within the Rhine-Meuse estuary where a substantial amount of fine sediment transport takes place. Therefore, the port of Rotterdam is subject to significant siltation, requiring maintenance dredging to guarantee a sufficient nautical depth of fairways and harbour basins. To optimise the dredging strategy in the port of Rotterdam, a pilot study has been carried out wherein sediment is reallocated in the Rotterdam Waterway, during ebb, instead of offshore in the North Sea. Between May and November 2019, 210,000 tons of sediment has been reallocated. This pilot study has been carried out in the context of the larger EU-Interreg Sediment Uses as Resources in Circular and Territorial Economies (SURICATES) project. The main goals are to re-use the sediment as a resource and to reduce the sailing time of the dredging vessels. Both ideas comply with the Building with Nature philosophy; a concept gaining popularity over recent years in The Netherlands focusing on, amongst others the optimisation of dredging strategies. It is expected that the reallocated sediment is mainly transported offshore, while at the same time some of the sediment will nourish the river banks of the Rotterdam Waterway enhancing its flood resilience. This thesis focuses on understanding the fine sediment behaviour of the SURICATES pilot project on two different scales. This is done by analysing measurements and model hindcasts. The measurement campaign is set-up by Deltares and the Port of Rotterdam. For the model hindcasts an operational hydrodynamic and sediment model is used. On the small scale this is done by focusing on the behaviour of a single disposal over a tidal cycle. The large scale focuses on the cumulative long term behaviour of all sediment reallocations. For the small scale two measurement surveys are analysed. In both surveys it is found that a sediment reallocation executed by bow coupling is subject to mixing up to halfway the water column. Subsequently, the sediment plume is advected around and below the pycnocline. Further measurements in the mid field are lacking, but it is hypothesised that the majority of the sediment settles during subsequent low water slack. For the other execution method, drawing the bottom doors, which is used to reallocate the majority of the sediment, useful measurements are absent. It is hypothesised that the majority of this reallocated sediment is confined in the salt wedge and therefore mainly transported upstream over time. To assess the long term behaviour of the cumulative behaviour of all sediment reallocations, a different measurement campaign is set-up. In this measurement campaign, bed samples are collected prior to and during the pilot study to determine the change of the bed composition. In this campaign an indication for increased sedimentation related to the pilot study is found for nearly all the sample locations. The short term model study is set-up to enhance the understanding of the short term behaviour of a sediment plume, to derive an accurate source term for the sediment disposals and to carry out a sensitivity analysis. This sensitivity analysis is executed to derive the influence of differences in disposal method, timing of disposal, and uncertainties in the model. It is found that the execution method has the largest influence on the critical sediment fluxes on the short term, followed by the timing of disposal. From the long term model hindcast, in which the entire pilot study is hindcasted, it is found that 27% of the total amount of reallocated sediment flows downstream from the location of disposal and 73% upstream. These estimations are in line with the hypothesis and long term measurement results, but a thorough calibration of the results is lacking. To conclude, in this thesis a pilot study utilising a different sediment reallocation strategy in the port of Rotterdam has been investigated. This study shows that majority of the sediment disposed, in the current set-up of the pilot study, is estimated to flow upstream. In the sensitivity analysis, it is predicted that this might be caused by the timing of disposal or method of execution. It is also found that the initial behaviour of the sediment plume and the long term measurement contain a large amount of uncertainties. As most important recommendation for future work an expansion of the current measurement survey is proposed with at least two fixed locations: one downstream and one upstream of the location of disposal. In this way sediment fluxes can be established, which can also be used to verify and calibrate the sediment model.","SPM; Pilot; Salt wedge; Modelling; Port of Rotterdam; dredging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","SURICATES","51.929148, 4.222053"

(mentor); Kim, E.Y. (graduation committee); Spaargaren, C.

The Ombudsman has identified that in the past couple of years public transport (PT) operators are replacing fixed transit lines (FLT) by Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services in low demand areas (OV-loket, 2017). DRT is more efficient, because it is on demand and therefore runs only when and where needed. However, the Ombudsman also identified that users experience many issues. This project started in october 2019 with an analysis of DRT transport and relevant aspects. This led to the insight that the implementation of DRT services are often experienced as a deterioration of existing PT lines because of several reasons. People are not familiar with DRT and therefore, the fact that a reservation is required remains unnoticed. It requires more actions to initiate the journey and therefore, more effort. The minimum reservation time in advance limits the spontaneity. Departure and arrival times are often inconsistent. Insufficient feedback decreases the certainty of travelling. Nevertheless, with the digital possibilities that are provided in smartphone apps, these issues are acceptable. It seems that DRT services are often designed with the digital users in mind. However, lacking these digital possibilities makes the user experience even worse, which is the case for some ‘forgotten’ 20% of Dutch people above 16+. This was the starting point of the project. A double diamond approach is taken. In the first diamond he objective was to identify the ‘forgotten’ group and get insights about their needs and requirements. Literature is explored to identify these users and determine the population share in order to substantiate the relevance of the project. Literature has provided a list of demographic characteristics that are often related to low digital literacy. This list was used to recruit participants for in-depth user interviews, to learn more about their (non) digital behaviour and planning and travelling behaviour. The insights were translated to a workable format: personas and critical usage scenarios. These tools were used to inspire during the ideation phase and evaluating the effect of ideas. During the design phase, several prototyping sessions have led to a concept proposition, which consists of several elements. First of all, the user is approached with advertisements that appeal to them and explains the functionality. Secondly, the bus platforms are equipped with Dynamic Responsive Information Panels (DRIPs) that display the actual departure times of the DRT bus. In this case, the user has a confirmation of the bus. Also, as a reservation pole is added that if the traveller missed the bus, she/he could notify the service operator that she/he is waiting at the bus station, which both enhances the user’s perceived certainty while travelling. Finally, a device is provided that allows the user to make a reservation with two simple interactions and consulting actual departure times at one glance allowing the traveller to book and cancel at the last moment which enhances the perceived travel spontaneity.","DRT; Demand Responsive Transport; Inclusive design; Public Transport; Digitisation; Low digital literacy; Low literacy; Personal mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Like Industrial Ecology research makes use of the analogy between closed-loop systems in nature and material flows in the economy, business ecosystem literature uses the analogy of ecosystems to explain cross-industry cooperative behavior. Regarding the Circular Economy transition, a circular business ecosystem can be defined as ‘a set of actors that jointly work towards achieving the collective outcome of closing, narrowing, slowing or generating the loop on resources establish a circular innovation (e.g. product or service), initiative or project’. The creation of a circular business ecosystem involves new configurations of value chains, actor roles and the application of new circular economy business models. However, there is a lack of understanding of networks and cooperation required to operate circular strategies in the Dutch built environment. Using an ecosystem lens for analyzing circular operations can aid to close this gap. Therefore, the main question of this research is: How can high value reuse and recycling of salvaged building materials and components be achieved in the Dutch C&amp;D environment, following a circular business ecosystem perspective? To apply a circular business ecosystem perspective, an established 6C-framework for analyzing IoT-business ecosystems is extended to a framework to analyze circular business ecosystems. This was done by an extensive literature review on circular (business) ecosystems. Subsequently, the circular business ecosystem lens was used to identify the ecosystemic collaborations of demolition companies that are present to achieve high value reuse and recycling of salvaged building materials. This was done by a case study analysis of four demolition contractors to provide an final overview. A hybrid coding strategy was used to retrieve meaningful information from the data. From the data results that the demolition contractors have constituted several circular value chains and engaged in several circular demolition (and construction) projects. The projects can be categorized as temporary business ecosystems, while the circular value chains are characterized as enduring circular business ecosystems. Regarding the main research question there are several insights. First, high value direct application and processing of salvaged materials is most preferable achieved locally from both an environmental and cost perspective. Second, achieving this involves early-contractor collaboration in circular projects (e.g. of construction and demolition contractors, architects and clients in the design phase) to discuss the technical and financial feasibility of applying salvaged materials from old to new constructions. In these collaborations and open, transparent and cooperative attitude is required. Last, achieving (local) high value direct application of salvaged materials requires matchmaking, preferable before dismantling. If no early matchmaking takes place, architects can create flexible designs with respect to material choice, leaving space to exploit future opportunities of salvaged material release. Besides, there are options to further handle and process salvaged materials in (local) circular value chains.","Circular business ecosystems; Circular economy; Circular building; Demolition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Currently, Tetrahedron B.V. assumes an effective length factor of one for determining the cross-section profiles of the Tetrahedron Crane. In this thesis, Euler-Bernoulli beams are used to model every member of this crane, where each element’s compressive force is related to the applied cargo load of the crane. The crane has various aspects to it that are assumed as ideal boundary conditions or partial restraints, some of these assumed boundary conditions are then modelled by partial restraints to see its effect on the critical buckling load. The critical buckling load of Euler-Bernoulli beams, also known as the linear bifurcation point, is found by solving the eigenvalue problem, which results in the load under which the system fails from buckling instability. The current crane, the version zero design, was assessed. The buckling model created in this thesis is verified through limit cases of simplified models and the results from a FEM software, whilst always remaining critical to all comparisons. This crane design is deemed to be stable from buckling failure within the intended safe working load of the crane. With this crane design, using an effective length factor of one in the conceptual design phase is suitable. However, the Tetrahedron crane design has changed quite dramatically since this thesis began, so the thesis also adapted to understand and analyse the general trends that appear when key structural or geometrical inputs change. This is done through a sensitivity analysis where the critical buckling load is determined for a variety of geometrical and section properties to see at how the critical load changes given input changes. This uncovered some changes in the critical buckling load and eigenmode of the crane given certain conditions. Most significantly, a sharp decrease in critical buckling load when the crane heel girder’s (which is one of the members) is greater than eleven meters. This decrease in critical buckling load would in fact mean that the crane would fail from buckling instability within its safe working load and means that the effective length factor is not related to the shape of the crane itself. As there are so many geometrical and structural parameters in the crane, not all of them could be assessed in the sensitivity analysis. But ultimately, the model in this thesis, programmed in MATLAB, can be used by Tetrahedron B.V. for future iterations to the crane in the conceptual design phase.","Buckling; Global; stability; Crane; Euler-Bernoulli; Linear bifurcation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","","","","","",""

In this thesis it was investigated whether it would be possible to identify the activities performed by free-living children and what type of data from which body placement should be obtained in order to do so. Due to restrictions resulting from COVID-19, triaxial accelerometer- and gyroscope measurements of typical child play activities were carried out on various body parts of eight adults. A Long-Short Term Memory algorithm was applied to short sequential sections of summarized accelerometer data. This algorithm gives a prediction of the activity executed by the wearer of a triaxial accelerometer for every 10 seconds in time. The effects of the wear-site (left wrist, right wrist, right hip, left ankle or right ankle), type of accelerometer (low noise or wide range) and epoch length (0.25, 0.33, 0.5 or 1 second) were studied. The shortest epoch length was found to result in the most precise predictions per activity and the highest overall accuracy for classifying the activities. The hip and right wrist placement perform better than the other locations. A wrist placement is favored over the hip because a heart rate sensor can be added to the former. Measuring the heart rate in combination with classifying the activities performed gives insight in both intensity and variety of movements made by children. To further increase the performance of these classifications, predictions made with a score below a certain threshold, 0.775 in this thesis, can be excluded. This will decrease the amount of classifications made but it improves the accuracy as well as causing the precision with which each activity is recognized to rise. Without excluding results with a score below this threshold value, classifications of low noise 0.25 second epoch data from the right wrists have an accuracy of 74.8% and a precision per activity of 54.5% - 82.1%. Removing the more uncertain predictions yields an accuracy of 84.0% and a precision between 57.8% - 91.5%. Clustering specific activities, such as sitting and lying down, increases the precision considerably. The accuracy and precisions when applying sitting and lying down as one cluster in combination with removing the uncertain predictions for the low noise sensor become 85.4% and 70.1% - 92.2%. Before this algorithm can be successfully implemented in combination with the intended wearable, the precision with which each individual activity is identified should be &lt;90%. To transfer the collected accelerometer- and heart rate data to a smartphone, it is recommended to use NFC technology. Through a smartphone application it can then be made available for research purposes and the children can get feedback on the variety and quantity of their physical activity of the past two days. A battery that is appropriately sized for a child's wrist wearable will only be able to power the wearable for a few days. This is an insufficient battery life for the intended use, so the battery has to be charged. NFC technology additionally offers energy harvesting capabilities, making it possible to wirelessly charge the wearable via a smartphone. From this exploratory research it can be concluded that it will be challenging to develop a low-cost wearable that can identify activities and measure how frequently free-living children are physically active. This is the case for both software, the algorithm that predicts which activities were performed, and hardware, where the most pressing challenge is the battery life. However, it is believed that with more extensive research it is possible to create a fully operational wearable.","Activity recognition; Children; Free-living; Wearable; Physical Activity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Sports Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Hertz, Jens (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The next decade will see an unprecedented growth in space activity and usher in a new era in space. Together commercial parties, the so-called NewSpace operators, have announced large constellations that will increase the number of satellites in Low Earth Orbit from almost 2,000 satellites to 20,000. Simultaneously, enhanced space object tracking capabilities are expected to increase the number of tracked objects from 23,000 to 100,000. These developments will lead to a strong increase in dangerous conjunction events and the required number of collision avoidance maneuvers as well as more complex conjunction geometries for satellites in Low Earth Orbit. This research proposes a new approach to collision avoidance maneuver planning that produces a set of maneuvers to reduce the collision probability to an acceptable level for complex conjunction geometries without requiring human interpretation beforehand. The approach combines an accurate numerical propagation procedure to take advantage of the small position uncertainties of the Conjunction Data Messages published by the Combined Space Operations Center with a multi-objective optimisation procedure to avoid having to assign relative importance to optimisation objectives beforehand. The approach is tested against four different conjunction scenarios ranging from two objects to involving four objects proving that it efficiently finds solutions for future complex conjunction geometries. It is shown that the new approach finds the global optima in the objective space spawned by collision probability. Applying an intrack maneuver is the most propellant-efficient method for reducing collision probability. In contrast to most contemporary research, this research finds that additional radial and crosstrack maneuver components can offer a significant decrease in collision probability. The quality of the product of many NewSpace operators depends on the service level that is offered: the maximum interval between two satellite visits. Intrack maneuvers significantly change the orbital period and negatively impact the service level. This research investigates extending the problem definition by introducing constellation performance loss as a third optimisation objective. Extending the objective space by an additional dimension increases the required computational effort, but provides an interesting new perspective on the true optimality of maneuvers. The approach uncovers the three-dimensional Pareto front at the expense of 7,875 function evaluations showing both a set of solutions that are propellant-efficient, which were mentioned earlier, as well as a set of solutions that inflict little constellation performance loss. The latter set of solutions has a large radial or crosstrack component and almost no intrack component. It affirms the finding that large radial and crosstrack maneuver components can offer promising solutions for collision avoidance maneuvers. As an alternative for reducing constellation performance loss, this work investigated the application of a second maneuver after the dangerous conjunction situation had passed to restore the original orbit. This concept can offer benefits for simple conjunction geometries, but is infeasible for complex geometries where a large amount of propellant is required to reduce the collision probability. It was also proven that errors in the actuators can cause significant deterioration in the resulting collision probability and constellation performance loss.","Collision avoidance maneuver; NewSpace; Satellite collisions; Active collision avoidance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This thesis outlines the use of measured data collected using the bGrid system to estimate the number of people in two rooms in the Microsoft office at Schiphol. The main objective is to derive a correlation that transforms the data into a specific number of people. The bGrid system consists of a network of sensor nodes that measure CO2 concentration, movement intensity, relative humidity, ambient temperature, infrared object temperature and sound intensity. These nodes are strategically placed throughout the building and are interconnected through a gateway that is also part of the bGrid system. The specific offices used had an equal area of roughly 16 m², a capacity for eight people and contained two bGrid sensor nodes each. Data was collected on two days, separated by one day, yielding 1396 minutes of data. Ground truth data was collected using direct observation from outside the offices as to not interfere with the measurements. Since the offices were of equal area and capacity, were both used for the same purpose and each contained two sensor nodes, the rooms were deemed equivalent and could therefore be combined. On the first day of observation, only room 1 could be observed but on the second day both rooms could be observed. The data from room 1 was used to synthesise occupancy models while the data from room 2 was used for validation. Two methods were used to model the occupancy. An approach based on Multiple Linear Regression used a combination of the movement intensity and CO2 concentration to achieve a performance of 93.49%, with performance being defined as the times the model returns a number of people that is within one person of the observed occupancy expressed as a percentage of the total number of iterations. This was achieved by first splitting the data based on the observed occupancy to derive specific regression coefficients for those levels of occupancy. These were used in a Simulink model that actively chose which regression coefficient to use based on the input. Secondly a method using a three-layer, fully connected neural network with a combination of hyperbolic tangent and leaky ReLu activations functions used the ambient temperature, relative humidity, movement intensity and CO2 data to achieve a performance of 93.86%. This was achieved using a network structure with three hidden layers with 19, 21 and 39 neurons respectively. These numbers were derived using the genetic algorithm to optimise for 43 iterations with the number of neurons per hidden layer and the learning rate as optimisation variables. The final result yielded two models that were able to estimate the number of people in room 2 within one person of the observed number of people, respectively 93.49% and 93.86% of the time. The resulting models could, when verified further with additional data, be used to aid HVAC systems with ambient temperature control; having a reliable metric for occupancy allows people to be added to the energy balance of a room, which in turn allows for the creation of more accurate models of the indoor thermal climate. These models would allow for model based temperature controllers as opposed to PID type controllers that are currently used in most office thermostats.","Office; Occupancy estimation; Linear Regression; Artificial Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models demand devices with high computational power to be deployed for real-world applications. Even though a lot of research has been focused on estimating the human pose from monocular images taken from cameras, the complexity of the models makes them impossible to be implemented on edge devices and embedded devices like mobile phones that have built-in cameras. This reduces the scope of applications where human pose estimation can be used. To address the issue, the research focuses on improving the performance of a baseline human pose estimation architecture by reducing the model size(number of parameters) and thereby its inference time without a significant loss in the accuracy. To improve the performance of the model, a structured Bayesian compression algorithm is used and the network is compressed by engineering the model based on the uncertainty of the parameters. The results show that the Bayesian compression method reduces the model size by around 65 percent with only a very little drop in the model accuracy. Also, the comparison of the inference time of the original baseline and the compressed model in an android device shows that the inference time is reduced by around 50 percent because of the reduction in the number of operations in the compressed model architecture.","Human Pose Estimation; Bayesian learning; Mobile application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

The aim of this research was to find out how the implementation of hydrogen in the Netherlands has taken place and how this can be facilitated in the future. As an important aspect of hydrogen is cluster formation, this has also been taken into account in the research. Hydrogen cluster delineation is challenging, since they should have a focus not only on incremental innovations but also on radical innovations toward sustainability and often contain a mix of niche players and established regime actors. Additionally hydrogen has a plethora of end-uses, in a multitude of sectors/industries and on different scales. Therefore the clusters were delineated with the use of the proposed merged Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) and Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework from Markard and Truffer (2009). Once all niches that originate from the clusters were identified, these were analysed using the MLP and Strategic Niche Management (SNM), adapted to have more specific criteria. This research utilized a process perspective, which views reality in terms of a stream of events. More specifically the methodology of Event Sequence Analysis (ESA) was used, which provided specific tools for systematically identifying and comparing specific sequences of events. Primary data (from web pages, documents and news messages) was gathered through a specific data gathering process, defined by the ESA methodology, which was visualized as an event map. Secondary data from interviews were used as validation for the regular ESA. From the ESA spanning from the introduction of hydrogen as a sustainable energy carrier around 2001 until 2020, it has become clear that hydrogen implementation in the Netherlands has performed quite well from an internal niche perspective. Despite the high-quality internal niche processes across the board, implementation has been moderate due to the financial barriers that come with hydrogen, which can be attributed to the sheer expense of projects due to the niches’ infancy, the large-scale nature of the transition, with the infrastructural overhaul that needs to take place and some current legislative limitations, such as sub-optimal directives towards hydrogen-grid mixing. Next to this, there are three apparent patterns that can be identified. (1) Firstly, there is a clear succession of niches, meaning that there is a clear link between successive events which influence each other. (2) Secondly, there is a dependence on international collaboration, with most niche implementations being embedded within international (mostly European) initiatives and projects or have been subsidized by them. (3) A final pattern is the regional embedding of the implementation of most of the niches. This can be attributed to the large-scale nature of the transition and the dependence on synergistic implementations with dependence on supply to multiple sectors. To conclude, from the ESA it has become clear that the hydrogen transition is complex and needs active stimulation to become adopted more widely. This thesis suggests that the upscaling should be pursued with three main aspects in mind: (1) Firstly, it should be done within embedded regions, which are mainly formed in (harbor) clusters. (2) Secondly, the ESA proved that international collaboration is of essence in this transition. (3) Lastly, there should initially be a concrete focus on knowledge creation, due to the complexity of the transition, there is still a lack of knowledge with regard to the optimal implementation and a lack of educated personnel, which will all be pivotal for the success of this transition.","Hydrogen; energy transition; Event Sequence Analysis; strategic niche management; Transition Theory; Socio-technical transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The Control and Simulation group of TU Delft developed a quadcopter controller for the case of a single damaged rotor in an inside environment, where the attitude and position of the quadcopter are provided by an external system. In the present research, a novel attitude estimator called Adaptive Fuzzy Complementary Kalman Filter (AFCKF) has been developed and validated that works independently of any external systems. It is able to estimate the attitude of a quadcopter with one fully damaged rotor while only relying on the on-board sensors. The results show that the AFCKF is able to provide significantly better attitude estimates for flights with a damaged rotor than mainstream filters, estimating the roll and pitch of the quadcopter with an RMS error of less than 1.7 degrees and a variance of less than 2 degrees. It is the only filter that is able to track the quadcopter's yaw angle for the case of a damaged rotor, while showing only a comparatively small rise in the computational cost.","Attitude Estimation; Quadcopter; MARG sensor; Kalman filter; Complementary filter; Damaged rotor; fuzzy logic; State estimation; Filter comparison","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.989995, 4.375311"

Conventionally available three-phase PFC rectifiers are limited to output 1/3 of the rated power when connected to a single-phase mains. This work presents the research into the single-phase operation of the Belgian rectifier, a novel boost-type PFC rectifier which allows for full power operation in both single- and three-phase operation (relevant for the three-wire split-phase systems in the USA with a maximum power of 19.2 kW). The single-phase AC-to-DC power converter is operated by paralleling and interleaving the three-phase rectifier bridge legs. By using the analysed triangular current mode (TCM) modulation scheme complete zero-voltage switching is achieved over the entire mains period. The power converter is further analysed with respect to the steady-state operation and component-level modelling. The modelling techniques are used to generate the Pareto-front of efficiency versus power density. The optimal design is selected based on the multi-objective requirements, and is a design with 6x interleaving with a boost inductance of 30µH that results in complete soft-switching transitions and achieves an efficiency of 98.42% with a power density of 5.34kW/dm3. After that, the single-phase Belgian rectifier is compared to the conventional six-switch boost PFC rectifier to identify and quantify the benefits. Finally, a closed-loop control model is proposed and implemented on the 19.2 kW, 1.5kW/dm3 hardware demonstrator for the conversion of a 240 V AC input with a maximum rms current of 80 A into a 380 V DC output to verify the single-phase operation of the Belgian PFC rectifier.

The booming cruise ship industry is forced to reduce the emitted greenhouse gases and emission of carbon dioxide to be able to access remote areas with higher restrictions and to comply with upcoming regulations. Fuel cells are a promising alternative to conventional diesel-powered systems to reduce the emissions. Next to the physical implementation, fuel cells have additional operational limiting factors, which have to be matched with the power demand. Compared to conventional combustion engines, longer start-up times and a lower dynamic response ability can be expected. Typically, the energy demand is estimated for all electric power consumers with the load balance approach in the conceptual design phase. The actual power demand is calculated based on the absorbed power and additional predefined factors for specific conditions. This conflicts with the dynamic power demand of cruise ships in various operational conditions. This thesis discusses the used bottom-up approach for such an improved prediction of the total power and energy demand of an expedition cruise vessel for the early design stages. The focus is on identifying the peak loads and load changes under consideration of the passenger behaviour, environmental and operational conditions on the basis of predefined typical days of operations. The dynamic power demand is predicted for the different propulsion, auxiliary and hotel systems, as identified and grouped in the system breakdown. This is done by using separate prediction models for the defined groups of systems and electrical components. The required energy per day is calculated directly from a time-domain integration of the power prediction. The demand for a whole operational profile is obtained by adding different typical operational days. The highest power is required by the main propulsion in sailing mode. However, expedition cruise ships often operate at lower speeds below the design conditions resulting in a considerably lower load. The maximum load of the hotel systems always appears in the morning, when all passengers are on board and several components ramp up from the lower night mode. Comparing the total power demand shows that the load changes caused by the hotel systems gets smaller in relation to the changes within the propulsion system as soon as the speed varies. In port condition, the relatively constant auxiliary load, including the hotel systems, remains and describes the baseload throughout the day. Generally, the dynamic prediction clearly shows the potential to better estimate the required power and energy, if varying operational conditions are considered. The method supports a well-founded decision on the power supply configuration, if it comes to hybrid systems including different power supply components and their operational characteristics. A multi-criteria decision analysis on the power supply side can build up on the required energy and power demand of a certain part load. The required fuel cell size can be quantified based on the estimated maximal load and the fuel tanks by considering the predicted energy demand of the specific group of systems.","Dynamic energy modelling; Electric power demand; Load behavior; Fuel cells; Dynamic operational profile; Expedition cuise ship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

This thesis focuses on their health behaviors associated with the sound situation. Existing literature provides evidence that noise in some orthopedic surgeries can cause health issues ranging from increased stress levels to noise-induced hearing loss. Nevertheless, literature research also shows that the field of sound and health assessment has not been widely explored. Consequently, this thesis has two aims: Firstly, understanding the soundscape, its entailing health risks and the motivations of current health behaviors of the medical staff in relation to the soundscape. Secondly, contributing to an improved sound situation and reduced health risks for medical staff applying design.  Sound perception and health behavior Applying the user research method “context mapping” (design method making people reflect on personal experiences) current health behaviors of the medical staff (e.g.surgeons, anesthesiologists) were investigated. In particular psychological consequences of noise are often underestimated. Sound levels in seven orthopedic surgeries (with varying surgical approaches) were assessed. Although the evaluation showed differences in sound levels, average sound levels did not exceed current legislation. Further investigations on sound characteristics(through psycho acoustic analysis) show that sound perceptions (e.g. pleasant or unpleasant sound experiences), causing psychological health impacts, are not sufficiently explained by loudness (i.e. especially average decibel levels).   Based on the research findings, that some sound situations in operating theaters are in parts hazardous and that the behavior of the medical staff is often non-precautionary, a theoretical framework (based on Social-Ecological Model (SEM)) was developed. It showcases the stakeholders directly or indirectly involved in potential behavior change processes towards an improved sound and health situation in operating theaters.This framework formed the core guideline for the consecutive design process,aiming to explore how behavior concerning the soundscape can be improved. The key discovery: There is a lack of awareness and knowledge of health consequences posed by sound within medical staff, as well as on other social-ecological levels (e.g. hospital management).  Design towards sound and health awareness The final design outcome, a website, targets a wide healthcare audience. The website initiates greater engagement concerning sound improvements through increasing awareness of the current sound situation in operating theaters. It caters to varying awareness levels: General information on sound and health in operating theaters (to increase knowledge and initiate awareness) and concrete action advice to transform awareness into action for sound improvement and risk reduction.  Reflecting on the final outcome and future research This thesis showed that sound perception in operating theaters is still not sufficiently explored. The initial evaluation with medical and non-medical staff participants indicates that the website successfully improves knowledge, triggers reflection and thereby sparks awareness. By further extending the websites’ sphere of activities, it has the potential to contribute to the achievement of better sound quality in operating theaters. This thesis concludes with suggestions on future sound and health behavior research.</b","Design for healthcare; behavior change; awareness; sound; noise; Context mapping; health psychology; surgeries; operating theater; Design for Interaction; sound perception; medical staff; Critical Alarms Lab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In India, the construction sector is the second largest employer after agriculture. Around 50 million workers work in the construction sector to earn easy money at the end of the day. About 48,000 workers die in India due to occupational accidents every year, and around 38 construction accidents occur every day in India. This thesis analyses the social impacts of safety policies and their employers' financial implications. No such studies have been done previously for the Indian construction market. There have been studies regarding estimating the number of accidents in India, respective safety measures, etc. Implementation of safety policies can reduce the number of casualties up to 20%-30%. The performance of safety policies will benefit the workers, their families, friends, relatives, and society. It is common for Indian construction companies not to invest in construction health &amp; safety measures because it is cheaper for them to pay the costs of compensation for accidents than modernizing their facilities to make them safer. It seems essential to understand the need to invest in safety measures from a societal perspective. Thus, this research is a study about the impacts of safety policies with cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and how the CBA results can be utilized in the decision making for the policymakers, employers, and other stakeholders in the industry. First, a literature review was conducted to better understand the Indian construction industry's problems and probable solutions. Literature was also undertaken to understand the concepts regarding the cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, interviews were conducted to get the required data to perform the cost-benefit analysis and partly answer the research questions. For the research, eight interviews were conducted with people who closely work in the Indian construction industry. Based on the interviews, five significant safety policies were identified to be implemented at the construction sites in India to reduce accidents. These five safety policies were considered as a package to perform a societal cost-benefit analysis. The societal cost-benefit analysis was performed to find the impacts of safety measures only from the societal perspective. Next to this, a business financial impact analysis for the safety measures was conducted to see their effects only from the employer's perspective. In general, the interviewees believed that the number of accidents occurs in Indian construction sites due to the lack of safety measures provided by the companies and the illiteracy of most workers and their unorganized way of working. They also suggested that these accidents can be reduced by implementing safety policies, as shown in the table below. Most of them estimated that taking these safety measures could reduce the number of accidents by almost one-fourth.","Cost-Benefit Analysis; Indian Construction Industry; Construction Accidents; Safety Measures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Principal component analysis (PCA) is commonly used in the fields of computer graphics and geometry processing for constructing subspaces that represent the variability present in a dataset. Examples of such datasets are configurations of a non-rigid object, poses of a deformable character or snapshots from a simulation. By applying PCA to the dataset, one can generate a lower-dimensional space in which the data samples can be approximated well. Similar to PCA, one can also apply a sparse PCA technique to the geometric data. These methods aim to find components that do not only describe the deformations present in the data well, but are also sparse and localized.<br/><br/>One of the problems related to PCA and sparse PCA is that they do not take the correlation between the x, y and z coordinates of each vertex into account when constructing the subspace. Furthermore, the methods are not invariant to rigid motion (rotations and translations) of the data samples, which means that rigid registration has to often be applied to the samples as a preprocessing step. Ideally, we would like to construct a subspace that is invariant to these rigid motions.<br/><br/>This project investigates whether quaternions can be used to solve these problems. By describing each vertex as a pure quaternion, we show how quaternion PCA can be applied to geometric data and introduce a quaternion method of snapshots for improved computational efficiency. Additionally, we derive multiple quaternion sparse PCA techniques, which are inspired by the Sparse Localized Deformation Components (SPLOCS) method. Experimental results show that the quaternion PCA and sparse PCA methods are able to describe a richer space of deformations using fewer components. Furthermore, we show that quaternion PCA leads to improved rigid motion invariance.","Principal Component Analysis; Dimensionality reduction; Quaternions; Quaternion PCA; Sparse PCA; Quaternion sparse PCA; Geometry processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Calibration and model prediction is always affected by uncertainty in the forcing data, response data and structural error in the model. The storm-dependent parameters are believed to be able to capture these errors and improve model prediction. The goal of this research will be to further investigate and develop the storm-based approach and compare it to more traditional approaches, including the use of static (time- invariant) parameters and the use of GLUE to capture model errors. The hypothesis in this paper is the ran- dom variation of storm-dependent parameters can capture the model error and improve the prediction. The storm-based method will apply a sensitivity analysis to identify the storm-dependent parameters that are most likely to vary by storms. The variation of storm-dependent parameters will give large changes in model performance which is measured by Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency. In the storm-based method, parameters will be calibrated storm by storm in the calibration period. Then in the validation period, streamflow will still be predicted storm by storm through picking each parameter set from the calibrated parameter sets. Besides, the effect of dryness and the optimal threshold for identifying the storm epochs on the model performance will also be explored in the storm-based method. The results obtained by the storm-based method will be compared with the method using static parameters and GLUE method. Six case studies calibrating a con- ceptual rainfall-runoff model with for parameters with daily data illustrate the improvement of prediction obtained by the storm-based method for dry basins. The extent of variation of storm-dependent parameters is very random in each case which indicates there is error in the model. Moreover, the extent of variation of storm-dependent parameters has no relation with initial water storage, rainfall characteristic and basin characteristics. Although the parameters cannot be predicted deterministically, they can be predicted prob- abilistically with the histogram or fitted distribution for the calibrated parameter sets in the future work. By making storm-dependent parameters vary with storms and other parameters constant, the storm-based method performs better for drier basins while worse for wetter basins compared to GLUE method and tradi- tional method. The logscore value obtained in storm-based method(e.g. -0.68 for one of the dry basin A) is larger than those obtained in the traditional method (e.g. -1.23 for basin A) and GLUE method (e.g. -0.67 for basin A). Additionally, the RMSE values for total flow obtained in the storm-based method are all smaller than those obtained in the traditional method, and GLUE method for dry basins. This suggests the storm-based method is more applicable for dry basins and this method should be better developed for wet basins. What is more, the extent of variation of storm-dependent parameters has no relation with basin characteristics but the mean and variation of the storm-dependent parameters can be obtained. Hence the extent of variation of parameters can be described probabilistically.","storm-dependent parameter; CRR model; model uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Introduction: Smart Medics Company is a startup from the Delft University of Technology, looking to bring an affordable Video laryngoscope (VL) into hospitals in low-resource regions. This research aims to seek the best suitable transparent material to act as a lens, sealing off a compartment containing an endoscope, as well as, bring forth a design optimisation that will create a waterproof environment for the incorporated electronics and prepare the device for disinfection according to the used disinfection procedures in low-resource regions. Method: Two approaches have been used to investigate the opportunities. The first approach was by using quantitative research, where glass and polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) were subjected to the disinfection chemicals used in hospitals in low-resource regions. These chemicals included, CIDEX® OPA, Isopropanol and JIK (3.5% active chlorine). This was done in three different experiments, the first experiment was conducted to find the short-term effects of the used chemicals. The second experiment was conducted to see the effect of rinsing with water in between the cycles, and the third experiment revealed the long-term effects of the used chemicals on glass and pmma. Furthermore, prices per material were compared to find the material with the best price-durability ratio. The second approach was by means of qualitative research. To generate optimisations for the current design of the VL, three methods were used. The first method, a state-of-the-art research combined with a literature search to find solutions that could aid in the process of designing. The second method was the usage of a morphological overview, to generate concepts according to the necessary requirements. Thirdly a Harris profile was created to score the concepts conforming to the context in which the VL will be placed in. Additionally the option to creating a wireless design along with the best method to incorporate the lens into the design were investigated. Results: Regarding the chemical resistance of both glass and pmma, they both showed to be resistant to the used chemicals. Although pmma showed a form of solvent crazing in the first two experiments, it did not show this in the third experiment, therefore, it is thought that the samples of the first two experiments were contaminated causing this phenomenon. Regarding the price-durability ratio, pmma scores the best as, for the price of one glass lens, 590 pmma lenses could be fabricated. The qualitative research generated three feasible designs, all three with unique features, in terms of connectivity, power and the disinfection process. The state-of-the-art technology inquiry presented multiple innovative patents that aided during the conceptualisation. The scoring according to the Harris profile revealed the applicability to the desired context. One of the concepts included a wireless design which was evaluated to see how feasible a wireless design would be in this context. This showed that although it was feasible, it would also entail more costs for certification and multiple trade offs are to be made in terms of component selection and thermal management. Lastly, placement of the lens could be during the production phase, as well as, in the post-production phase. The first phase has three options in which the lens could be placed, which bring about multiple disadvantages, such as, higher costs due to more man hours, in addition to, higher costs for the need of multiple mould. The later phase includes the use of a method called ultrasonic welding. This type of fabrication would create a seamless joint between the lens and the VL, which would not only seal the electronics compartment, but it would also ensure that the lens can not come undone, preventing serious harm to the airway during intubation. Conclusion: In terms of material properties, both glass and pmma are suitable to act as a lens for the VL according to the context it is placed in. However, as glass lenses cost 590 times more than the pmma lenses, this would be the best choice to incorporate into the VL. From the three generated concept designs, the second design was the most desirable as it would not only generate a waterproof design, but it also has the ability to keep its modularity, for both future development as well as optional maintenance in the case that a part breaks down. Although the wireless design is feasible, it is advised to postpone this design. Regarding the insertion of the lens, the preferred choice would be to place it in combination with ultrasonic welding, to create a seamless and waterproof seal for the electronics compartment.","Medical device design; LMICs; Disinfection chemicals; Glass; Plexiglas; Transparency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-04","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In a world where companies rely increasingly on machines and automated production lines to deliver customer value, asset availability is a becoming a larger driver of companies’ productivity and thus performance. In effect, where maintenance was historically perceived as a cost-centre, it is generally treated as a value-adding business element that must be effectively managed today. However, the increased use of machines and automation has also resulted in an increasing portfolio of assets, often with a highly complex nature. Coupling the growing portfolio of complex assets with factors such as maintenance being a cross-functional activity, stricter HSE requirements, a stochastic maintenance demand, maintenance management complexity has also increased drastically. The result is a reality where maintenance is, on the one hand, becoming more critical to companies’ performance. Simultaneously, it is also a large and growing source of operational issues and costs that is highly challenging to improve. <br/><br/>This thesis project is conducted for a consulting firm specialised in helping customers realise benefits. Prior to this thesis, they had access to a highly successful way of managing maintenance developed and applied in the industry by a second company. This maintenance management approach is called The Maintenance Wheel. It has realised benefits in the magnitude of roughly 10 M EUR per year in combined savings from two large-scale facilities. Moreover, it contributed to a significant increase in maintenance quality. In effect, this maintenance management approach provides a way to cope with the increased maintenance complexity, with massive empirical benefits. <br/><br/>Seeing this, the consulting firm has attempted to help customers with ineffective and inefficient maintenance operations realise benefits through The Maintenance Wheel. However, they have struggled to convince their customers to implement it, seeing that the customers struggle to understand the management approach. As senior managers considering The Maintenance Wheel will perceive it as an innovation, Karabin is struggling with an innovation diffusion barrier, caused by a failure to transfer knowledge on how The Maintenance Wheel works effectively.<br/><br/>The management approach was developed internally by the second company, without considering diffusion. Consequently, there existed no conceptual description of the management approach prior to this thesis. Seeing this, the thesis project research objective was to design an MMF aimed communicating how The Maintenance Wheel works to help cope with the knowledge-based diffusion barrier. Note that an MMF is a theoretical framework explaining an approach to managing maintenance. This MMF effectively provides knowledge on how The Maintenance Wheel work, and was constructed with a design science research methodology.<br/><br/>The evaluation indicated that the constructed MMF sufficiently communicates how The Maintenance Wheel works. After a brief presentation for senior managers with no prior knowledge of how The Maintenance Wheel worked, it was possible to have in-depth discussions. Thus, the knowledge-based diffusion barrier caused by customers’ senior managers not understanding the management approach should be solved. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the evaluation also showed that one particular area of future development is required. The senior managers interviewed requested examples of how the framework work in practice. In effect, to help more effectively transfer knowledge on how The Maintenance Wheel works, the consulting firm should provide practical examples of the different elements of the framework.","Maintenance management; maintenance management frameworks; business process management; performance management; diffusion of innovations; design science research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This resulted in the development of Intelligent Decisions Support Systems (IDSSs). An IDSS is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that desires to enhance and support decision making by enabling tasks to be performed by a computer while mimicking human capabilities. The two most generally classified types of IDSSs are knowledge-based and non-knowledge based systems. A knowledge-based system, also called an Expert system, directly translates domain knowledge into a set of rules or cases to support human decisions. In contrast, non-knowledge based IDSSs apply the rapidly growing branch of AI known as machine learning (ML), that grounds its decision-support on feature extraction of labelled training data. Recently, a company called Councyl, in collaboration with the TU Delft, developed a new approach to AI that has the potential to constitute a novel type of IDSS for judgement purposes. The new approach to AI is called BAIT (Behavioural artificial intelligence technology). BAIT utilises discrete choice modelling (DCM) to codify the domain expertise of experts’ in order to provide introspection on their decisions and support future judgments.<br/>As BAIT is a new IDDS approach it requires testing in different settings to gain insight into the usefulness and effectiveness of this new method.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The model is innovative as it is capable of both creating and adjusting maintenance schedules continuously in a disruptive environment. By means of the model a decrease in required ground time and schedule changes can be achieved while the task utilization rate stays similar to manually created airline schedules.

This is a challenge urban design and planning field has only just started to undertake. Currently, the differentiation between the urban core as the front stage zone for human residence and entertainment versus the rural periphery as the backstage zone for production, logistics and energy harvesting is becoming more distinct. The restructuring of urban economies away from manufacturing and toward services has resulted in divided labour markets that generate few moderate income jobs and has generated new demand for urban living. This is putting pressure on the diversity and the social inclusiveness of cities. Even though industries have become cleaner and safer due to new technological developments, for many cities and planners adopting compact city strategies and urban revitalisation is associated with mixed-use of commercial and residential redevelopment only. By not including industries, current development is contributing to industrial suburban sprawl. Often, the housing demand is met by the transformation of former industrial land into residential areas or mixed-use environments. As increasing housing demands in cities drive up land prices, businesses have difficulty finding affordable work spaces. This way suitable industrial land in cities remains unaddressed and becomes increasingly scarce. Finding out what roles industries should have in the city is a new challenge relevant in many metropolitan areas. Manufacturing and services are interrelated and for each to thrive, both need to be present. At present, there is not enough knowledge on how to incorporate industries in dense urban environments in a socially acceptable, liveable and sustainable way. The perception of industry needs to change in the minds of people, especially of those involved in urban development, for it to regain its role as a good productive member of the city. As the Zaantreek is the oldest industrial region in the World, it has a long tradition of living in close proximity to industries. It has even become part of the identity of the region. As a result there is a strong cultural and societal acceptance of industries. At the same time the municipality of Zaanstad has no expansion options left because of the surrounding natural reserves and nuisance contours of Schiphol and the Western Harbour of Amsterdam. Therefore, it is an ideal location to investigate how urban industrial integration in cities can be combined with other functions to achieve densification and create qualitative live work environments. In this thesis, spatial qualities or patterns of live work environments are explored and developed. Scenarios are developed for Zaanstad in terms of future economic trends and densification possibilities to eventually assess the adaptive capacity of the design. The designs are developed by applying the patterns on location in the framework of the scenarios. In this way, patterns are developed that contribute to better spatial organisation and transitions of functions and create qualitative live work environments. All together, the use of patterns to steer urban design and as a strategic planning method is reflected upon.","Pattern language; Strategic planing; Densification; Mixed-use development; Live-work environments; Urban industrial integration; Compact City; Liveability; Metropolitan region of Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.450889, 4.819642"

In this code, structural safety is expressed through the reliability index 훽. For certain reference periods a threshold value for 훽 exists. When applying prescribed load models given in the Eurocode, the structure is guaranteed to at least fulfil to this threshold value. However, these prescribed load models are deterministic in nature and can be rather conservative for bridges in urban areas. This thesis focusses on creating a probabilistic load model based on actual traffic loading by making use of a camera system that registers license plates to check whether the vehicle is allowed to enter the inner city of Rotterdam due to environmental zones. From this camera system data, technical information such as wheelbase, legally allowed axle loads, gross vehicle weight and such can be extracted since they are coupled to license plates. This technical information is then used to create load models based on actual registered traffic. This load model represents trucks as point loads with interspatial axle distances. In total, one year of collected data by the camera system is stored, called the LP data. This load model is then used in a probabilistic reliability analysis as a load variable input. When comparing the LP data with available weigh-in-motion (WIM) data from two measurement locations in Rotterdam, it turned out that the LP data does not incorporate under- and overloaded axles and was overestimating the accompanying reliability index. Hence to account for this, an axle load factor 휂௜ is introduced to simulate under- and overloaded axles. This factor 휂௜ is based on the WIM data and is different for each vehicle type. With the use of this factor, a second, improved load model is constructed. This is referred to as the modified LP data. A third and final load model was constructed from the available WIM data, called the WIM model. For each of these three load models the load effects were calculated, and distributions were fitted accordingly for simulating several 25 year periods of traffic. The output of these load models is a loadeffect maxima distribution that can serve as a direct input in a probabilistic reliability analysis. With these three load models, a hypothetical slab with a span length of 10 m was probabilistically analysed where the LP model, the modified LP model and the WIM model resulted in reliability indexes of 4.8, 4.1 and 3.7 respectively. When compared to the requirement in the Eurocode, all load models comply. Concluding from this, the modified LP model suggested in this thesis can be used as a load input in a probabilistic verification for this very considered bridge location. For this load model to be applicable to multiple bridges, more research must be done since only one location was considered in this thesis. However, the suggested approach to construct load models based on license plates can be used verify the applicability to multiple bridges.","traffic loads; Probabilistic analysis; Monte Carlo Simulation; existing bridges; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

These are complex models that rely on many input parameters that have uncertainties. Nowadays, new quay walls are often equipped with sensors that collect information about the behaviour of the quay wall. These quay walls are known as \textbf{smart} quay walls. The measurement data of smart quay walls could be used to validate FE models and reduce parameter uncertainties. This could lead to an optimisation of the functionality of the quay walls. By means of a case study this thesis determines if measurement data obtained during the construction process has the potential to optimise the functionality of smart quay walls. The case used is the HES Hartel Tank Terminal (HHTT-quay), which is a smart quay wall in the port of Rotterdam. The HHTT-quay consists of sections with and without a relieving platform, both are considered in this thesis. In this thesis the functionality of a quay wall refers to the retaining or bearing functionality. Therefore, an optimisation of the functionality could consist of an optimisation in the retaining height or the surface loads. The case study used in this thesis shows that measurement data obtained during the construction process already provides important information that can be used to optimise the functionality of the quay wall. This indicates that for smart quay walls the construction process can act as a load test and this could reduce the necessity to perform a load test during the service life.","Quay walls; Measurement data; FEM; Updating; functionality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

VHEE pencil beams have a small penumbra and strong depth dependence for radiotherapy when compared to photons. This allows a lower dose to healthy tissue. Generating these high electron energy beams could be achieved by using laser accelerators. These accelerators allow the equipment to be smaller than currently possible and make it possible to fit them in a standard radiotherapy treatment bunker. This makes VHEE a potential middle ground between photon and proton therapy in relation to equipment costs and treatment quality. The purpose of this project is to compare photon based Intensity Modulated Ra­diation Therapy (IMRT) and VHEE treatment plans for treatment of prostate cancer.  For 10 prostate cancer patients IMRT treatment plans were generated with 23 beams. These plans were optimized using Erasmus MC in-house developed Erasmus-iCycle automated treatment plan optimization tool. The dependence of VHEE plan quality on beam energy (200, 300 and 400 MeV) and number of equi-angular beams (9, 18 and 36) was investigated. The treatment plans were optimized using the multi-criterial optimizer Erasmus-iCycle. For each patient VHEE pencil beam dose distributions were pre-calculated using TOPAS MC, a Monte Carlo simulation program based on Geant4.  Results: VHEE treatment plans show either a reduced or similar mean OAR dose when compared to IMRT treatment plans except for the 9 beam 200 MeV plan which was worse compared to IMRT. All treatment plans were normalized to a PTV coverage of 99 % V57Gy.  It is found that the mean rectum dose reduces from 13.5 Gy for IMRT to between 9.2 and 11.9 (p=0.002-0.004) for the VHEE plans. For the anus dose a reduction in mean dose was found for all VHEE treatment plans except for the 9 beam 200 MeV and the 18 beam 200 MeV VHEE treatment plans. The mean anus dose reduced from 12.4 Gy for IMRT to 7.0 - 10.6 Gy (p=0.002-0.014) for the VHEE treatment plans. The bladder dose reduced from 20.1 Gy to between 15.2 and 18.2 Gy (p=0.002).  Increasing the number of VHEE beams in a treatment plan reduces the OAR dose.

By increasing the number of beams and/or the electron beam energy we can further reduce doses to the healthy tissue.  ","Radiotherapy; Radiation therapy; VHEE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These species provide important ecosystem services to the human kind. Due to the development and operation of Maasvlakte 2, an increase of nitrogen emission is expected in the province Zuid-Holland of the Netherlands. When this is taken up by the vegetation and soil in the dunes, encroachment by shrubs will dominate. This will lead to a decrease in species diversity of dune habitats in protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, which is an unfavourable situation conforming to the Nature Protection Law (Wet Natuurbescherming). The main loss is expected to be in grey dunes and humid dune slacks of the Natura 2000 areas nearby Maasvlakte 2. This research focuses on the classification of grey dunes, white dunes, humid dune slacks, woody vegetation, water and their sub-classes in the Natura 2000 areas Solleveld &amp; Kapittelduinen, Voornes Duin and Goeree &amp; Kwade Hoek. Remote sensing in combination with machine learning have been proven to be useful in the monitoring of dune habitats. Open access satellite data provide high temporal and geographic coverage, but are often limited in their spatial resolution. Contrarily, high spatial resolution products are limited in their spectral resolution. In this thesis, the effects of spatial resolution, spectral features and feature combinations on the classification of dune habitats using aerial images and a Landsat-7 image (2012) are analysed. The classifications are performed with a Random Forest classifier, using both a pixel-based and region-based approach. In contrast to the traditional pixel-based method, the region-based method incorporates spectral and statistical information of neighbouring pixels. The best performance is achieved with the region-based approach on a 4m resolution aerial image with an accuracy of 87%. The 10m region-based classification is the second best with an accuracy of 83%. The misclassified pixels are mostly classified as the other sub-class of the same main-class. The region-based method should not be applied to satellite images with low spatial resolution as it causes more loss of detail. More spectral bands contribute to a better classification performance, but they contribute less than the spectral bands that were already used. Also, Landsat-7 images were used to create yearly habitat maps for 2012 and 2019 to subsequently analyse the habitat changes between those years, although the accuracies of the Landsat-7 maps are an issue. The main changes in habitat are found in the woody vegetation (shrubs, trees) and humid dune slacks. The woody vegetation decreased in area, causing an increase in grey dunes area in Voornes Duin and Goeree &amp; Kwade Hoek, whereas the opposite has happened in Solleveld &amp; Kapittelduinen. Loss of area in humid dune slacks is detected in all three regions of interest. The local dune manager confirmed that the detected changes in woody vegetation are mostly correct and caused by dune management activities. The perceived changes in humid dune slacks are less reliable. Finally, a modified training dataset is used to classify Sentinel-2 images in 2019. These results compared reasonably well with the few locations we visited during our fieldwork campaign.","airborne; spaceborne; optical remote sensing; coastal dune habitats; nitrogen emission; machine learning; Random Forest; region-based; multi-resolution; Landsat-7; Sentinel-2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","51.9595317, 3.985464"

These fall incidents can lead to various disabling conditions, and therefore have the ability to affect one’s quality of life and independence. Not only are falls potentially taxing to the individual, they are also responsible for a big portion of annual health care costs. Due to an ageing society, the number of falls and their consequences will grow in parallel with the expanding number of seniors, becoming an even greater concern for the health care system. Therefore, there is an ever-increasing need to develop (cost-)effective fall prediction systems to reduce these financial and physical burdens associated with the consequences of a fall. Introducing the design proposal of my graduation thesis: smart insoles with accessory mobile application, the ‘StApp’. The insoles with an integrated fall prediction smart system capture the physiological risk factor of an impaired minimum toe clearance (MTC) variable, signal the impending danger to the user, and hence, aid falls prevention in the elderly. The final product consists of three segments, detect - warn - and inform, represented in the two separate products. (Detect) Smart insoles that analyse and monitor the user’s gait in real-time, in particular the MTC parameter, through a sensing technology integrated in the sole. (Warn) When MTC values display an apparent risk, the user is alerted through a technological intervention. This presents itself in the form of vibrational stimulus, embedded in the support arch of the smart insole. Hereby, the whole smart system, including the intervention, is embedded in the smart insole, discreetly concealed. (Inform) For the sensor data to be meaningful to the user, an accessory mobile application monitoring the MTC- and multiple other gait parameters is suggested. The StApp presents concrete information and advice on sufficient and safe exercise to improve the user’s MTC and overall gait and balance. An experimental research study was conducted to preliminarily validate the viability of the main product-idea of the smart insoles, studying the effect of the product’s intervention. A minimum of 2 minutes of treadmill walking was analysed for two young adults (1 M, 1 F) using the Tracker motion analysis software. The effect of the intervention was clearly illustrated in the data gathered in this pilot test, as the effect of the intervention deemed to be statistically for all administered vibrational stimuli. It seems to be an appropriate tool to optimize the toe clearance parameters in the pursuit for strategies of falls prevention. However, further in-depth research is required to explore the intervention’s characteristics and study the effect of the intervention on the elderly’s gait. Finally, as the wearable technology depicted enables optimization of elderly care, healthcare professionals who might be interested in giving more personalized advice to their patients will benefit from the design of the smart insole and accessory StApp, presented in this project.","Elderly; Falls Prevention; Gait; Sensing Technology; Intervention; Risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Roasting – leaching – electro-winning method is well developed, accepting a large range of raw materials and also has economic advantages. However, the problem with this method is the generation of large amounts of leaching residues. Many researchers have been worked on this and proposed many solutions. It can be improved by increasing leaching efficiency and can better recover valuable metals from the leaching residues. As for environmental pollution in the zinc smelting industry, sulphur emissions have been under well control, and both waste water and solids can be partly recycled in the process.

TUSP is a problem where trains have to be routed on a shunting yard such that maintenance tasks can be performed and no collisions occur. Furthermore, incoming trains have to be matched to outgoing trains, since trains of the same type can be used interchangeably. Currently, the NS uses a local-search approach to solve TUSP; however, this approach is sometimes unable to find a simple detour route when the initial route of the train is blocked by another train. This research models the TUSP as a Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem to solve the routing issue. We solve this model of the TUSP using Conflict-Bases Search (CBS). To achieve this, CBS is altered to work with multiple trains on the same node, to work with directed edges, and to only allow wait-moves on certain nodes. In this work, we propose two ways of routing multiple trains on the same node; CBSL, where trains are given an exact location on the track; and CBSQ, where the order in which trains enter a track is recorded with a queue. Of these two methods, the queue model was deemed best. Finally, we propose a heuristic to prefer solutions where trains are more spread out on the shunting yard. This heuristic greatly improves the runtime at a loss of optimality. <br","TUSP; Shunting policy; MAPF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); van der Heiden, Kasper (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In order to meet the climate goals to minimize the global temperature rise, an accelerated growth of renewable energy sources is necessary. Within the renewables market, the offshore wind sector takes a big part and has experienced a rapid growth over the past years. Around 80% of offshore wind turbines have a monopile foundation, (a large diameter tubular support structure). In present time, monopiles are installed by using either a jack-up or a floating vessel. Due to the trend in the offshore industry that wind turbines increase in size and that wind locations move to deeper waters, an installation with floating vessels may become the most cost-effective option. Jumbo Maritime has designed a new vessel to expand its offshore fleet: HLCV Stella Synergy. This heavy lift crane vessel will be used to install monopiles. Multiple installation methods are under consideration and this thesis focuses on the method with mooring lines to provide station-keeping during the installation. Due to the footprint of the vessel relative to an earth-fixed position, a motion compensated pile gripper is used to maintain upright position of the monopile. During the early driving phase (see Figure 1.1) of the installation, the monopile has limited interaction with the soil and acts as an unstable inverted pendulum. The upright position of the monopile is maintained by the gripper frame. The forces applied by the gripper frame on the monopile are reaction forces on the vessel. These reaction forces on the vessel can cause an increased vessel footprint. A workability assessment is performed for a moored floating monopile installation, and the influence of the gripper frame reaction forces on this workability is analyzed. During the early driving phase (see Figure 1.1) of the installation, the monopile has limited interaction with the soil and acts as an unstable inverted pendulum. The upright position of the monopile is maintained by the gripper frame. The forces applied by the gripper frame on the monopile are reaction forces on the vessel. These reaction forces on the vessel can cause an increased vessel footprint. A workability assessment is performed for a moored floating monopile installation, and the influence of the gripper frame reaction forces on this workability is analyzed. Considering nonlinear phenomena in the installation system, such as a gripper frame control system and viscous drag forces, a time-domain simulation model is made in AnySim XMF for which a hydrodynamic database is used as input. The provided hydrodynamic database is based on the results of a scale model test in a water basin, for one specific loading condition. The provided hydrodynamic database is also compared with an AQWA calculation. The reaction forces from the gripper frame are determined with a MATLAB/Simulink model which generates a gripper force time series based on the behavior of the monopile and the gripper frame due to environmental loading. This gripper force time series is applied to the vessel as an external force during the time-domain simulations. During these 3 hour simulations, the vessel is subjected to co-linear environmental conditions from two different incoming directions, while the vessel is moored to the seabed. The workability is calculated for sea conditions in the North Sea. In a second simulation model, the same simulations are performed but without the gripper frame force time series applied to the vessel to determine its influence on the total workability of the installation. The gripper frame forces have no significant influence on the workability of a monopile installation. In beam waves, the workability is limited by excessive roll motions for longer waves and by insufficient station-keeping from the mooring lines for higher waves. The loading condition addressed in this research proves unfavorable due to its low roll natural frequency. Investigation is needed whether this loading condition is representative of a loading condition which is likely to occur during a monopile installation. In head waves, the system performs satisfactory and is mildly limited by excessive roll and pitch motions.","Monopile Installation; Floating installation; AQWA; Time-domain simulations; hydrodynamic diffraction analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-01","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Hydrogen is considered to be a promising replacement of fossil fuel-based energy for the future energy supply. The possibilities to use hydrogen are extensive; hydrogen can provide high temperatures for industrial processes, produce electricity, heat buildings and be a fuel for the mobility sector without releasing carbon. In order to implement hydrogen transition in the current economy, a hydrogen infrastructure needs to be established. Prior research has pointed out that after certain alterations, the current natural gas infrastructure can transport hydrogen. The natural gas infrastructure in the Netherlands is extensive, and the capacity is big enough to satisfy the Dutch hydrogen need. Additionally, considerable costs can be saved if the natural gas network is used. The costs to adapt natural gas pipelines to transport hydrogen is ten times lower than the costs of constructing new hydrogen pipelines. The common approach for the design of the new hydrogen infrastructure is optimisation. However, prior research in regard to network evolution has indicated that infrastructure evolution is characterised by path-dependency, lock-ins and network effects. These factors are neutralised in the current optimisation methods. It is reasonable to presume that these factors of network evolution will also have an impact on the network transition that is based on an existing network. The first reason to assume this is that the development of the hydrogen network is estimated to take 30 years, in which other developments are likely to occur. Second, investments that are made, are locked in the new infrastructures, as expenses made cannot be spent again in a different manner. Furthermore, the investments made determine future options for investment. Research into the transition of one network, which is based on an existing network, remains uncharted. This thesis will evaluate the effect of different tactics and strategies on the transition of a network from fulfilling one purpose, distributing natural gas, to another, distributing hydrogen while taking path dependency into account. An agent-based model that applies rule-based behaviour is constructed to answer the main research question, which reads as follows: How do different transition strategies for the transition of a natural gas infrastructure to a (partial) hydrogen infrastructure perform over time? To create this agent-based network, a representation of a network was made with several components, so-called nodes and edges. Nodes are the entry or exit points of the network, the production sites of gas (either natural gas or hydrogen), heavy industry, energy generators or the points where the gas is converted from the transmission network to the distribution network. All nodes have a utility score based on the type of node, and the distance of the node to the closest hydrogen point in the network. This allows for the calculation of the utility score of a specific edge. Edges are the connection between the nodes and represent existing pipelines, potential new pipelines or temporary connections in de form of tanks. The effect of four tactical choices on the transition behaviour of the network is tested in regard to the costs of the transition, the volume hydrogen that is delivered to the network and the volume hydrogen that is exported. The following tactical choices are evaluated: -Prioritise the network transition on local optimisation criteria, -Including new pipe to be constructed in the excising graph, -Prioritising the export of both hydrogen and natural gas, -Allocate the available budget over time in different patterns. Based on the results of experimenting with the tactics, the following four strategies are formed: - Minimise cost, prioritise the export of both hydrogen and natural gas, - Minimise cost, no prioritisation of the export of hydrogen and natural gas, - Maximise hydrogen delivery, prioritise the export of both hydrogen and natural gas, - Maximise hydrogen delivery, no prioritisation of the export of hydrogen and natural gas. These strategies are applied to the random network developed for this thesis, and on topologies based on the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. The results show that the strategies focusing on the minimisation of costs structurally have lower expenses than the strategies that maximise hydrogen delivery. However, in the case of the random starting topology and the topology based on Belgium, this is always at the expense of the hydrogen delivery as these strategies cause lock-ins. Prioritising the export of hydrogen and natural gas delays the developments of lock-ins and is therefore not only beneficial for the hydrogen export, but also for the volume of hydrogen delivered in the system. The topologies based on the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are less susceptible to lock-ins. There are situations in the topologies based on the Netherlands and the United Kingdom where the same volume of hydrogen is delivered in the strategies based on maximising hydrogen delivery. In these cases, minimising costs is the optimal strategy. In other situations, the hydrogen delivery in the strategies based on minimising costs is lower. In that case, a trade-off needs to be made between the hydrogen delivery and costs. \newline The experiments in this thesis have led to the seven insights that should be considered in the realisation of a hydrogen infrastructure. 1. The characteristics of a network are important. Best practices in one infrastructure should not be copied without any further consideration. 2. Purely adapting the excising network does not lead to the best outcome, and therefore the option for constructing new pipes on some critical points should be considered. The construction of new pipes helps to overcome lock-ins and therefore has a positive effect on the system outcome. 3. It is best to invest maximally according to the availed budget, the maximal capacity of the system and the foreseen future. With this, the system can benefit the longest from these investments and changes to the network. 4. Be reluctant about the network transition to certain geographic areas where the contribution is limited to only a small part of the network. 5. It is wise to determine minimal thresholds for the performance of the system to ensure that the system does not minimise costs at the expense of other key performance indicators. 6. Prioritise the flow of export and import of natural gas and hydrogen through the country. Not only does the country financially benefit from an export corridor, there are also positive effects for the network as this export corridor ensures an available hydrogen connection throughout the country. 7. Specific for the topology based on the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; there are situations where the strategy that minimises costs reaches the same hydrogen delivery as the strategy that maximises the hydrogen delivery. This reinforces the first insight. The specific situation and location of nodes should be reviewed in order to determine the optimal strategy. There are some limitations to the model created in this thesis. First, the local optimisation is done based on the utility of a pipe. This utility has a direct connection to the utility of the nodes it is connected to. Calculating the pipe utility as the added gain for the whole system would strengthen this model’s approach. Second, the average betweenness centrality and closeness centrality does not show a relation with the effectiveness of the tactics and strategies. This is probably because centrality measures are calculated for the whole system and not for the flows of hydrogen and/or natural gas. It is recommended to recalculate the two centrality measures, taking the gas flows into account, and observe whether there is a relation that can be used as a predictor for the effect of tactics and strategies. In this thesis, a system-level approach with a step for step transition is used. Network evolutionary elements liken path-dependency, lock-ins and network effects were taken into account. Including these elements of network transition, led to seven insights regarding the process of (network) evolution, compared to overall system optimisation. These seven insights should be considered when formulating an approach for the realisation of a hydrogen infrastructure.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Via illumination of the human skin with a light source and capturing the light, an estimate of important physiological properties such as the heart rate can be made. This is commonly done with dedicated medical equipment, but studies from the last decade have shown that the smartphone could also be an adequate sensor, using the flash light and camera as transmitter and receiver respectively. Small, mobile and off-the-shelf, the smartphone provides many advantages over the conventional sensor. However, the quality of the PPG signals measured is a point of concern, as these could lead to incorrect estimates and several challenges need to be addressed. Firstly, user movement disturbs the contact area between the skin and sensor, introducing distortions in the PPG signal. Especially subtle motion artifacts like finger contact pressure impact the PPG signal quality. Secondly, the smartphone camera has a wide range of settings that can be used, but a proper analysis was lacking in literature. Thirdly, recent research has shown that PPG signals from an individual are unique. There is no common morphology. This means that algorithms developed for PPG need to account for unknown characteristics of PPG signals. Fourthly, analysis on PPG signals from the smartphone is mainly done offline and as such, a real-time implementation is desired. This thesis introduces a smartphone application that tackles these challenges and provides PPG signals of high quality. A real-time multi-stage PPG qualification pipeline combined with a pulse segmentation algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, analysis of the camera settings and finger detection algorithm resulted in PPG signals with 12.63% higher quality than a dedicated PPG sensor.","Photoplethysmography; Smartphone; Real-time application; Signal processing; Embedded systems; Physiological Signals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

In 2018 extreme low river discharges in the river Rhine led to congestions in the main Dutch part, called the river Waal. The river Waal is an important river for inland navigation, but during low discharges the vessel draught reduces and consequently the transported cargo volume per shipment reduces. To compensate the loss of transport volume, the total number of shipments increases, leading to an increased traffic intensity on the river Waal.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of extreme low discharges on the traffic flow and traffic capacity in the river Waal. The study consisted of two elements: a study combining fleet data and hydraulic information and a traffic simulation study. During this research IVS90 data was used as the source for inland waterway transport data. Based on literature and previous river Waal studies the river section between the Pannerdensche Kop and the Maas-Waal canal was selected as the river section to investigate in more detail. Multi-beam measurements in combination with water level data were used to generate cross-sectional profiles in order to carry out the simulations. The cross-sectional profiles were highly variable. From these cross-sectional profiles the navigable river width was determined. It was found that a river depth of 2.80 m was no longer available at all cross-sections from a discharge of 900 m2/s and lower. Therefore, the navigable width was determined at a river depth of 2.0 m for the discharges 1020, 900, 800, 700 and 600 m2/s. Also, it was found that with reducing discharge the navigable width of the cross-sections reduced.   The fleet composition was determined in detail for four weeks representing the drought of 2018. These four weeks in 2018 represented weeks with average discharges around 1020(2x), 800 and 700 m2/s. The river Waal fleet composition was determined based on the Rijkswaterstaat vessel classification system (RWS-class) and categorised in three groups: coupled units (all RWS-classes with index C), push-tow units (all RWS-classes with index B) and motorised vessels (all RWS-classes with index M). It was found that the number of passages by coupled units and push-tow units was effected largely during the drought of 2018. The number of passages by push-tow units reduced significantly from October 2018 as the discharge dropped below 1500 m2/s and the number of passages remained low until the discharge raise above the 1020 m2/s at the end of 2018. The number of passages by coupled units increased already before the discharge reached the 1020 m2/s limit and continued to increase throughout the period of drought. The number of passages by coupled units started to decline only after the discharge rose above the 1020 m2/s again. Even though the daily average number of passages increased during the drought of 2018, the total transported cargo volume per day decreased. There was a strong relationship between discharges below 1200 m2/s and the transported cargo volume per day.  Within this study special attention was given to the occurrence of congestion in the river Waal. The occurrence of congestion was investigated using the traffic simulation model SIMDAS. As indicators for congestion a fluency and safety limit of 8% was used to evaluate the simulated traffic, as well as simulations of the traffic flow. As safety parameter the penetration of the safety margin of a vessel in percentage of the total number of vessel interactions was used. While the percentage of the number of vessels that need to reduce their speed fully during their passages was used as the fluency parameter. With SIMDAS also the impact of increased traffic intensity and reduced navigable width were analyzed. The simulation results showed that the reduced navigable width had more impact on the delay time, the fluency parameter and the safety parameter than the increase of the daily intensity. During the simulations large congestions occurred for discharges of 800 m2/s and lower, but small harmonically moving congestions already occurred for a discharge of 1020 m2/s. Harmonically moving congestions, meaning seven or more vessels traveling behind one larger or slower vessel while awaiting room to overtake, were observed in the traffic simulations. Permanent congestions with ten or more vessels were observed in the simulation of the river width with a 800 m2/s discharge. The data analysis and the traffic simulations clearly showed the effects of the extreme low discharges on the traffic flow and traffic capacity. The conclusion of this study is that the traffic capacity of the river Waal is at its limit at discharges of 800 m2/s and lower.  This study made also clear the need for correct fleet data and river bed levels. The limited available fleet data reduced the accuracy of the results. The river bed should be monitored regularly in order to know the actual water depth particularly during low discharges. Furthermore, it is recommended that highly variable river profiles are implemented in the traffic simulation model SIMDAS to improve the simulation of the vessel's sailing trajectories. Also, the validation of the vessel trajectories in SIMDAS with AIS data is recommended in order to evaluate the traffic intensity on the traffic lanes in the river.  ","Waal; Drought; Congestion; Traffic capacity; Traffic flow; Economical impact; IWT; Inland Waterway Transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""
