The biggest challenge is to mathematically describe this phenomenon in order to find<br/>an appropriate correction. Since there are a lot of influences in the process (friction, movement, impact, degrees<br/>of freedom) this is very difficult to describe. The main topic of this thesis is therefore the description<br/>and simulation of this problem. The research question defined is: what is causing the jumping of the polishing<br/>tool in specific situations on non-flat surfaces and how can this be prevented?<br/>The problem has multiple challenges due to combining a rotating movement with degrees of freedom in the<br/>lateral movement. The cause that has been found with the simulations is the flexibility in the spindle and<br/>the airbearing of the polishing robot. Together with resultant forces, caused by the rotation of the tool and a<br/>certain angle of elevation of the material, the flexibility causes the tool to jump in all directions. The goal of<br/>these simulations is to acquire data that describes the problem phenomenon. When the realistic data of the<br/>simulation is known a correction method is proposed and first simulated.<br/>The method tested to correct this is a static state feedback where the controller is found by minimizing the<br/>H-infinity norm. The results show that this type of controller and feedback can decrease the jumping to 0-10 %<br/>of the original displacements.

Sand closures are the construction of closure dams with sand as the main building material. The rising and falling tide generates a current through the closure gap, which increases in strength as the gap becomes smaller. This current is quite strong and transports a significant amount of sand from the gap to areas where the current is weaker. The sand that is transported away from the closure gap is called the sand loss. The changing tide and constantly moving sand grains result in a dynamic environment. This makes it difficult to estimate the total amount of sand that is necessary to close the dam. It is important to be able to assess the amount of sand loss accurately, because it could make the difference between needing an extra dredging vessel or not. The costs of these dredging vessels are about 1 million euro's a week; therefore, having an unnecessary vessel present due to very conservative sand loss predictions is costly. Laboratory experiments and a numerical model were used to investigate the morphology during bedload transport under a lateral expansion. A streamwise bar formed behind the tip of the lateral expansion for both the laboratory experiments and the numerical simulations. However, it was not possible to replicate the bedforms that occurred during the laboratory experiments with the numerical model. These bedforms are deemed to be important for the morphology during bedload transport. The numerical model was used to expand the research to suspended sediment transport by decreasing the grain size of the sediment. In the obtained morphological patterns, four areas are distinguished where the morphology was found to depend on the flow velocity and the degree of turbulence in the flow. It is expected that a variation of these patterns can be found during a sand closure, although these findings should be validated with a laboratory experiment or in situ measurements. Therefore, it is recommended to set up a laboratory experiment to investigate the morphology under a mixing layer for suspended sediment transport. Based on the results of the laboratory experiments and the numerical model, it is advised to look into the possibility to use the sand deposited as a streamwise bar during a sand closure as an additional borrow pit to aid the closure process, since it would lead to less sailing time for the dredging vessels. For the first stage of a sand closure, it is advised to use a two-dimensional model that incorporates a bedload transport formula to model the sediment transport. It is important to use a parametrization of the bedforms that occur during bedload transport. For the final stage of a sand closure, which is the most critical phase due to high flow velocities, high degree of turbulence and time restriction, it is advised to use a three-dimensional model with a pick-up equation that takes the influence of turbulence on the grains into account, such as the pick-up formula of Okayasu et al.","Sand closures; Laboratory experiment; Numerical model; TUDflow3d; Lateral expansion; Mixing layer; Morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the occurrence of a dropped object event, production is temporarily interrupted, resulting in unintended costs. Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company (CB&amp;I), a leading engineering company in the design of offshore topside structures, is continuously seeking for innovative solutions which minimize costs. To date, protection of vulnerable equipment against dropped objects is provided by conservative stiffened steel plates. An alternative in the form of Sandwich Plate System panels has been researched, as it could potentially reduce costs due to their high failure load to mass ratio.<br/><br/>Multiple design thicknesses for simply supported Sandwich Plate System (SPS) beam and plate structures have been considered analytically and numerically. Their masses and failure loads when subjected to quasi-static loads have been compared with a Stiffened Steel Plate (SSP) reference structure. ANSYS, a Finite Element Analysis software package has been used to analyse the force-deflection curves associated with each design and to compare the plots and results with the results obtained analytically.<br/><br/>Analytical calculations of the bending moment resistance have shown to be adequate for the beam models under strict assumptions only. For more comprehensive non linear analyses including circular impact loads, an analytical analysis is no longer readily accessible and a numerical analysis is required. While for stiffened steel structures subjected to a line load a ’beam to plate’ simplification assumption is justified, this is not the case for SPS due to its additional transverse stiffness. For beam structures subject to line or circular failure mechanisms, the SSP layout offers a greater yield resistance with respect to its mass than SPS. For plated structures subject to a circular failure mechanism the yield resistance increases more strongly for the SPS type, taking full potential of the increase in failure load through the additional transverse stiffness.<br/><br/>It can be concluded configurations of SPS with low face plate to core thickness ratios come closest to providing similar yield resistances as SSP, while maintaining a low mass. For the configurations investigated, SPS 5-45-5 seems to provide a best fit as a replacement for SSP-600, since the weight is lowest with respect to the minimum required yield resistance. No configurations for SPS are found to be better than SSP-600 when the models are considered 2D. For 3D models the additional stiffness in transverse direction significantly increases the<br/>maximum failure load of SPS. However, for the considered cases in this report no beneficial SPS configurations regarding yield failure were found.","Sandwich Plate System; Plates; Sandwich; SPS; Face Yield; Offshore; Dropped Object; Impact; ANSYS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-03","","","","","",""

The injection of foam is compared to the injection of water by comparing the injection pressures, which is represented as a dimensionless pressure rise at the injection well. The model first applies the forward-difference method to compute the changes in water saturation over space and time as the foam is injected. These changes in water saturation are related, via Darcy’s Law, to changes in dimensionless pressure. The non-Newtonian foam behavior is implemented in the model by making the gas relative permeability a function of position in radial flow, based on the exponent defined for a power law fluid.<br/>The validity of the model is assessed by a comparison with an analytical model using the method of characteristics to simulate Newtonian foam flow. This model was created by A.H. Al Ayesh. From this comparison, it follows that the numerical model converges to a correct solution for sufficient fine discretizations. Finer discretizations do however introduce drawbacks, such as long computation times and high computer-memory requirements. Another drawback of the numerical model is the inevitable error that is introduced by a numerical artifact in the computation of the total relative mobility in each grid block at the front as foam advances. This error can only be reduced by even-finer discretizations. <br/>The validity of the model for non-Newtonian foam flow simulations is not assessed directly in this thesis. But the model is expected to have similar or coarser grid-refinement criteria for shear-thinning foam flow, and finer or similar grid refinement criteria for shear-thickening foam flow.","Petroleum Engineering; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Foam; Numerical Simulation; Numerical Modelling","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Focusing on a developing country like India, violence against women, needless to say, is a grave concern. Crime in the form of rapes, molestation, and eve-teasing, has made public spaces fearful, and women have developed the fear of being a part of these places. The aim of this project is to redesign and reinvent the public spaces in New Delhi, India to reclaim the women’s right to the city in public spaces and make them gender inclusive and safe through the participation of stakeholders and community building.<br/><br/>The methodology adopted for this research includes “research by literature” and “research by best practices” which helps in evaluating the theoretical framework. The theoretical framework is used to relate spatial and social qualities of the site and recognize main issues by “research by design.” The site for this project is a neighborhood in Malviya Nagar, New Delhi, India. Womenspatialactivism is an urbanism approach devised in this project aiming towards re-appropriation of spaces by women in New Delhi, India. The concept of #WomenSpatialActivism is the re-appropriation of the front door by an old woman, the street by a working girl and the public park by mothers. It aims to spread in the city through digital media. <br/><br/>The women spatial activism is an urban designer’s approach which has three main components. These are the physical charter and physical interventions into space, a social stakeholder structure that connects the stakeholders (knowledge, financial and implementation partners) to implement the project and record the feedback of the interventions for its further scope and the third component is the digital structure which includes a mobile application “SHE-CONNECT” that allows women to travel together from the same source to the same destination. The physical structure works on a street and public park to make it more safe, lively and women-centric. The key projects taken up in the research are revitalizing streets (community building and cleanliness through guerrilla gardening), light your lantern (a fund-raising project for lighting the streets), the pink carpet (a wayfinding strip for a safer street), spatial activism headquarters (engaging citizens for temporary urbanism to achieve re-appropriation for women) and reclaiming the park (re-appropriation by women in the public parks with basic amenities). All these projects are a composition of small spatial activism physical interventions which are generic in nature and can be implemented in other areas. The implications have been tested with “Space Syntax” which proves the vitality and viability of the research.<br/><br/>Through these interventions, a gender sensitive neighborhood can be achieved which sets an example in the city of New Delhi and thereafter seeking attention globally.

The research is done into the difference of leadership styles of project managers in real estate projects when the contract type differs. Integrated contracts are seen more and more often in the real estate sector and that raises questions about the work of the project manager. This research gives the first view on differences in applied leadership styles when this relatively new contract type is compared with the traditional contract type.<br/><br/>Methods: <br/>For this research the leadership style of project managers is measured on the base of seven competencies: vision and imagination, strategic perspective, engaging communication, empowering, self-awareness, emotional resilience and influencing. A self-assessment questionnaire has been developed based on the LDQ of Dulewicz and Higgs (2005), since the LDQ was not available to use. The questionnaire consist of two parts: general and project-based. The scores on the competencies are used to define the applied leadership style of project managers in situations with different contract types.<br/><br/>Results: <br/>54 project managers participated in the research and filled out the questionnaire. The sample was largely male, had a long experience as project manager and worked in the public real estate sector. The participants themselves did expect a difference in leadership style when other contract types are concerned.<br/><br/>Conclusion: <br/>While the results show little statistical differences, there is still enough reason to take conclusions from the results. The project managers in general do not show large differences on the score of the competencies, but there are differences visible in the project-based score for different contract types. The emotional competencies and vision and imagination have a higher score when integrated contracts are used. Strategic perspective has a lower score when integrated contracts are used. For traditional contracts there is a bias towards a goal-oriented leadership style, while for integrated contracts there is a bias towards an engaging leadership style.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite the common believes, air pollution poses the single largest environmental risk in Europe today (EEA, 2015) and, among all the countries, Italy has the highest rate of deaths related to air pollution. The city of Turin, as one of the four most polluted cities in Italy, has been facing high rates of air pollution concentration for several year. Despite several attempts by the municipality to improve the quality of the air, the situation has slightly changed in the past years and the urgency of the issue calls for alternative and more concrete solutions. <br/>The graduation project, by discovering and analyzing the relationship between air pollution, built environment and urban design, aims to propose a thorough interscalar approach able to mitigate air pollution in the city of Turin. The form and the nature of the built environment are in fact critical to air pollution concentration: street orientation and width, building heights and several other urban features play a key role in air pollution dispersion. <br/>The design proposal focuses on three design interventions which are characterized by different scales of action: from the micro scale of a single public space to an entire neighborhood. Seen together, they form a comprehensive system for mitigating air pollution whose basis rely on the discipline of urban design.<br/>Overall, the graduation project substantiates the relevance of urban design when assessing air pollution in cities. It offers valuable, effective and alternative solutions able to support the already existing urban policies in the city of Turin.","air pollution; urban design; urban forms; environmental design; multi-scalar approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","45.0704900, 7.6868200"

When the stress response does not switch off, it not only affects the immune system, but also raises the risk of psychiatric diseases. Recent research elucidates that the risk of schizophrenia and other mental-health disorders keep rapidly increasing, and city life is one of the main factors leading to such crises. According to a study in Nature, published by psychiatrists Florian Lederbogen et al., city dwellers are more sensitive and susceptible to certain stress stimuli in opposition to countryside dwellers, further proving that city life makes a significant difference (Lederbogen, 2011). Although cities have abundant benefits such as convenience of life and copious job opportunities, such problems can not be neglected now since over half of the population live in cities world-wide. <br/><br/>According to Adli, social density and social isolation are the main causes of stress in cites (Adli, 2013). He proposes various solutions to reduce the problem, and minimizing the density is one of the solutions to counter the problems arising from high density. Despite appearing to be the most direct and effective way to reduce the problem, reasons such as the economic pursuit from the land and social need of gathering in most cities renders it unfeasible. <br/>The situation raises an interesting question: how to reduce the stress level while maintaining or even increasing the density in the city?<br/><br/>This is a problem and a question that is highly related to living environment in the field of urbanism, but there is limited research or design in the field to explore this discourse from this perspective based on my preliminary research. To advance this discussion, I intend to carry out an explorative research exploring the dynamic relationship between stress (wellbeing of people) and the city (high density).

In recent years, there has been a shift in the tradition of engineering the river landscape towards a more landscape-friendly perspective. However, the focus still remains usually on nature and recreation, while other functions, like housing, are restricted. In addition, the dikes of the Dutch defense system form strong borders between the urban fabric and the river landscape, allowing little to no interaction between them. The objective is to embrace the natural river processes and use the potentials of inundation and sedimentation as a condition for the creation of a multifunctional and sustainable landscape. A system of living mounds is integrated in the floodplains in balance with nature, through the use of local materials and sediments and with sustainable infrastructure. Main goal is also to ‘break’ the border of the dike and allow people of the surrounding cities to engage and reconnect with this unique, dynamic nature. Added functions, like the new community gardens and a visitor’s centre, act as an extension of the urban fabric into the floodplains and operate as a buffer zone. The proposal binds the dichotomy between processes and forms by combining process-oriented and architectonic-oriented decisions, that utilize the full potential of this dynamic landscape.","river landscape; floodplains; multifunctionality; natural processes; integral design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This content is often biased and filtered depending on the user’s connections on social media. However, almost nobody watches actual debates or reads reports from the actual Dutch House of Representatives (DHoR), where the most influential decisions are made. With our Bachelor’s thesis we aim to give users an insight into the language used by Representatives in the DHoR. This Bachelor thesis can be divided into two parts, the first part is the research phase, the second part the development of the Data Analysis Tool. During the research phase we searched for ways that would allow us to describe the use of language in the DHoR, and the resources necessary to perform corresponding calculations. We defined several non-topical text features to perform the description: complexity, sentiment analysis and the rate of femininity / masculinity. For each one of these features, we will calculate their respective values based on the particular language of a Representative. Besides these non-topical text features, we also introduce a topical text feature. As opposed to the first, topical text features actually focus on the content of a text, rather than the language used. Some politicians are known to act differently regarding certain circumstances. By introducing filters, we can explore the effects or influences these circumstances have on the use of language (text features) of Representatives. Finally, we examined the available data from the DHoR and how to access it.<br/>The second part of this thesis is the development of our Data Analysis Tool (DAT). In order to calculate scores for the text features, we used reported data from debates and discussions in the DHoR from the past five years. We developed<br/>a DAT that can be used to explore the use of language of Representatives by:<br/>– analysing individual Representative text feature scores<br/>– comparing the average text feature scores of all Representatives<br/>– allowing to plot the text feature scores of Representatives over time and filter on time<br","Speech Analysis; House of Representatives; Text feature","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Multimedia Computing","",""

When the induced propeller jet is directed towards a slope it might affect the stability of the slope material and this can lead to damage when the loads are too large.<br/><br/>The objective of this research was to extend and validate a method to determine hydraulic bed loads on slopes induced by bow thrusters and a method to determine the stability of slope material. In order to answer this objective scale model tests are conducted at the test facilities of Deltares. Velocity and stability measurements are performed during multiple test scenarios that contain variations in slope angle, axial distance and pile configuration. From the obtained data of the velocity measurements the time-averaged velocities and the turbulence intensities are determined. For example, the time-averaged slope velocities measured in the scale model that consists of an 1 : 3 slope with an open quay pile configuration and a rough bed (test scenario T10 in the research) are shown in Figure 1. These values are compared to the values according to the Dutch guidelines and a correction factor for the underestimation of the hydraulic bed load on a slope is defined for each test scenario. After that the consequences for a design of a slope protection are evaluated. Furthermore, for the stability tests it is determined what the critical slope velocity is. This is done for multiple criteria of initiation of motion. With these critical slope velocities a stability parameter for the stability relations can be determined that is applicable at situations similar to the scenario tested. These determined stability parameters are compared to the recommended stability parameters and the differences are evaluated. Finally recommendations are formulated for correction factors for the slope velocities induced by bow thrusters and recommendations are formulated for a proposed stability formula by an earlier research.","Bow Thruster; Quay structures; Stability slope material; Banks; Propeller jet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Ports and Waterways",""

The city, however, doesn't respond to this trend. Most families living in Amsterdam are unhappy with their living situation. As a result, a lot of families are moving out of the city when the children grow older and families expand. For the city this is a major problem: families have a large influence on the city economy and contribute to a safe and diverse city. Families who choose for the city are looking for a so called 'sheltered urbanity'. This means that there are more families with children, qualitative outdoor space, accessible amenities and no fast traffic. When children grow older their action range expands. A living environment for families has to facilitate this process.

At the same time, delta landscapes become more densely populated every year, creating an uncertain environment for high density urban areas. In the Netherlands, cities are facing treats from the sea level rising, heat stress and <br/>increasing amounts of rain fall. The high density combined with the hardening of surfaces in city areas, leaving little open green space with permeable soil, creates problems for cities in times of heavy rain fall. <br/><br/>Amsterdam is one of those cities, developing as the biggest metropolitan area of the Netherlands. The city of Amsterdam wants to solve the problems with rain water management, while at the same time developing as a smart, innovative, <br/>sustainable metropolitan area. Buiksloterham is a key area in this aspect, functioning as a test ground for sustainable neighborhood development. <br/><br/>To create a more sustainable way of water management, the thesis aims for Buiksloterham to become self-sufficient in water use. Storing rain water, re-using rain and grey water and creating high quality water are key factors for achieving this. The design creates 3 separate systems, one for black water which is cleansed by using a living machine. After the black water has been cleansed, it joins the grey water system. This system gathers all the grey water from the households in the <br/>neighborhood, circulates this and passes it through helofyte filters for cleansing. Then this water joins the clean water system, a system that is created for a larger part of Amsterdam North. This system is connected to the households, so that the <br/>households can re-use the rain water and cleansed grey water to create a circular structure. <br/><br/>In order to create more sustainable awareness for the inhabitants of <br/>Buiksloterham and make the area function as a sustainable water community, it is important for the inhabitants of Buiksloterham to experience water (visual, audial, touch and smell), to have a say in the way water is managed in the area, to have influence on the way water is managed and to have responsibility over this system. To achieve this, water storage is applied through every scale. On the small scale, <br/>changeable objects are added to the public space, integrated with water storage, so that the inhabitants can influence their public space. This creates an ambition <br/>in Buiksloterham, that closely connects the inhabitants of the area to the sustainable way of water management. It also creates the possibility for the <br/>inhabitants to adjust, add and change the system according to their wishes. <br/><br/>The combination of these two aspects, the technical water management part of the societal part which creates a sustainable community, creates an opportunity for both Buiksloterham and Amsterdam, to develop itself as an example of a new way of life, a more connected, interactive urban fabric with the environment and an <br/>example of high dense sustainable urban development. <br/><br/>key words: water management, rain water management, rain water re-use, sustainable community, sustainable urban fabric, interactive design<br","sustainable urban fabric; interactive design; water management; rain water management; rain water re-use; sustainable community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The blooming of a landscape has not the same speed of the fast-changing urban conditions. There is an absence of synchronization. Agriculture and agricultural practices help shortening this gap, giving immediate meaning to these spaces, and offering a glimpse on the time passing. The goal is to make the space useful and meaningful, with the resources already present and very few time. Students and people from the neighborhood can engage with the soil from the first moment, work with it, try new techniques and learn from it. The area becomes a symbol for experimentation. The city is given an enclave, a cultural reservoir where experiments become useful not only to the students (in this case) but to the community in general. The spaces for agriculture are alternated to open lawns and public areas where inhabitants can spend time. In this way, experimentation is showcased to people and is likely to spread and rise interest. <br/> <br/> The site is, therefore, an open laboratory, immediately readable and comprehensible to all. The urban field is now a privileged area for diverse research in a public manner. <br/>This originates a new type of evocative space, an intermediate landscape between agriculture and public space, that may sparkle playful social practices, shared between different groups. The main goal underlying this type of space is firstly aesthetic but also scientific. <br/> Meanwhile, the surrounding area is planted with a growing forest resulting into a large intervention of reforestation. The produced urban space, this micro forest for agricultural experimentations set himself in a new relationship with nature. On one hand, we are in front of a process of re-appropriation by nature of the human space, on the other hand, man is engaging with the soil to benefit from it. <br/>Nor man, nor nature is now prevailing but we find ourselves in front of a process of action and reaction. The man observes and allows nature to develop and reacts to it only when its own survival sphere is touched.<br/><br/>The site becomes now a metaphor for a laboratory dedicated to the relationship between man and its territory, in order to research how to reach a situation of balance.<br","landscape; experimentation; post-war; Sarajevo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","43.856117, 18.396054"

New opportunities from technology-related innovations for measurement devices are available for better-informed decision-making and for improved knowledge on the condition of a bridge. Even though, the adoption and use of these opportunities seems to be disregarded by the market and the main focus of innovation pushing organisations is mostly on the technical capabilities of these systems. This research presents a study on the effects of using technology-related opportunities on maintenance decision-making from a usercentric perspective. It performed a serious gaming experiment where bridge maintenance decision-making professionals were questioned to set up maintenance advices based on different types of data. No previous similar research was found through extensive literature search. Bridge deterioration scenarios were presented to experts throughout a within-subject fractional factorial experiment design. The experiment treatment groups consisted of data presentation from new innovative or potential bridge condition assessment mechanisms and the experiment control group consisted of the current data source, which is visual inspection. To observe the effects, the experiment used a quantitative and qualitative approach that considered expert judgement, maintenance decisions, and explanations of the experts for observing whether differences occurred between the different settings. It was indicated that significant differences were present if new data sources were added to the current visual inspection data, but no significant differences were observed between different types of data sources. It is expected that the differences are caused by the ability to observe quantified values of important performance indicators better, and that they provided indicative values that can be used during decision-making. It is expected that the latter described indifferences were caused by a lack of guidance by the market on how to use new data sources properly and consistently. These outcomes mean that for efficient and effective adoption of new data sources, more standards and guidelines about threshold values and causal links between deterioration parameters and possible deterioration causes are needed for practical guidance during maintenance decision-making. It suggests that in order to provide a broad facilitation for adoption of new data sources, long-term strategy behaviour must be considered by the market in order to provide a safe space for pilots and trials to learn about these innovations.","Bridge Maintenance; Maintenance Decision-Making; Serious Game; Bridge Inspection; Condition Assessment Mechanisms; Impact of Innovation; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Wireless Sensors; Non-Destructive Evaluation Techniques (NDT)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Gehl (2010) contributes to the idea of “ poor maintained urban environment” and “car oriented”, which causes the deserted space. In some cases, place has different meanings with space. According to Tuan (1977), space could be described as a location without any human beings, but place refers to how people use and perceive the space. In fact, only the minority of urban space is being used as public place. On the one hand, those unpopular spaces do not consider into human approach, lack attractive functions and reasons for people to use it. On the other hand, some poor urban space work as main transportation hub that is crowded with people in the low quality of human psychological aspects. Transportation hub (railway station and metro station) is a special space that holds both necessary and optional activities. Recently, the square of the transportation hub that aims to serve passengers and citizens suffers from many problems of public qualities (Juxin, 2015).

This graduation assignment worked towards a service strategy that lives up to KLM’s great ambitions. The service strategy should result in the ideal lounge experience, particularly for KLM’s most valued customer: the frequent flyer. KLM realizes the only way to meet today’s rising service expectations is by implementing a self-service solution. Eventually, this self-service solution will only play a small role in the overall service strategy.<br/> <br/>In the first phase of this assignment, several Service Design methods are used to gain insights for the new service strategy. Service Design connects the desires of the client with the desires of an organisation within an overall context. Therefore, a context analysis, a company analysis and extensive user research are used to answer the initial research question:<br/><br/>“How can we provide service to all future ICA lounge visitors, in a way that fulfills the user needs and matches KLM’s ambition for the new lounge?”<br/> <br/>Research in the context analysis showed that lounge guests differ in the way they deal with time and how they deal with control. These variables have to be taken into account in order to create a service strategy that covers the rich variety of lounge visitors. Extensive user research revealed the latent needs of the frequent flyer: a feeling of recognition and a sense of control. According to the company analysis, a customer-centric company as KLM should respond to these latent needs. Literature research showed that the ultimate customer-centric service lies in the combination between excellent digital operations and intimate frontline staff. Digital operations provide efficiency and the staff a human touch. The human touch injects emotion into the customer relationship by exploiting uniquely human qualities: creativity, passion and empathy.<br/> <br/>After the research phase, two personas and a customer journey are used to structuralize all the data. The customer journey uncovered three problem areas. These problem areas are later converted into ideal service experiences using the service requirements. In the proposed service strategy, all the service channels work together to create this ideal service experience. This ensures a high valued end-to-end experience.<br/> <br/>The customer journey also showed exactly where a self-service kiosk could respond to a certain need. These findings determined the final features of the proposed self-service kiosk. In the end, the new service strategy and the functionalities of the new self-service solution are explained using a scenario.","Self-Service; Service Design; KLM; Airport Lounge; Kiosk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Haansta, Jan-Otto (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Schiphol Airport has to cope with a passenger demand that will double over the next 20 years. In reaction to this growth Schiphol is designing new and redesigning existing piers to increase its capacity. Besides expanding and rebuilding the apron area, more efficient ways of handling passenger<br/>air traffic movements are currently under development to cope with a future capacity problem. The overall aim of Schiphol in this context is to make its apron capacity as efficient as possible. The pushback phase can be seen as an opportunity to address this. One way to achieve a higher static apron capacity is reducing the pushback wingtip clearance, which can only be done when the<br/>pushbacks at Schiphol are executed accurately. This report investigates if an increase in static apron capacity is feasible by wingtip clearance reductions to achieve a categorical upgrade. To acquire the knowledge how accurate the pushbacks are executed, aircraft transponder data will be analyzed. Using cubic spline interpolation, the pushback movements are reconstructed to calculate the spread of the tracks. The spread of the pushback tracks gives an indication of the accuracy. The results are compared to the acceptable level of safety and verify if a categorical upgrade is possible. The factors that cause the spread of the movements are determined by analyzing the current pushback procedures and the day-to- day operations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Sensor boards like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and LoPy are some examples of these small sensor boards. In this project, the LoPy is used which is a sensor board that is equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy, Wifi and a LoRa radio. This last one is a communication technology that makes longer communication distances possible.<br/>The sensor network measures four different environmental indicators that will be distributed to the public: temperature, humidity, noise and air quality. The network then communicates via LoRa this data to one centralized server where the data is stored, processed and sent back to the citizens. This data is made publicly accessible to academia, citizens and the stakeholders alike. The network is also made interactive, people who pass by can interact with the sensors and request specific environmental data in real time.<br/>The sensor network has been build and deployed in the city. During the uptime of the network it succeeded to provide the data to the citizens via the feedback mechanisms: a website with a dashboard and an automated twitter account.

Technology is evolving fast, enabling faster and more efficient data acquisition, storage, retrieval and processing. Point cloud datasets are such a type which relies on large files and lots of processing power. The rather fast evolutions in technology enable the shared idea between Delft University of Technology and Fugro of an ‘Open Point Cloud Map’. This Open Point Cloud Map aims at making point cloud datasets easily available to the public, even letting them performsimple analysis. Both Fugro and TU Delft want to take lead in development of such an environment; three student teams from TU Delft thus form a partnership with Fugro to kick-off three in-depth researches which would result in one step closer to the vision of OPCM. The ChronoCity team will focus on the time-component (Figure 1.1) in the acquainted point clouds, while the other two teams focus on location-dependency and different scales and granularities of the datasets.<br/><br/>The Chronocity-team strives to create an online interactive tool which gives the user the ability to view, explore and analyze massive point cloud datasets on-the-fly. Since the limited timespan in which the project should take place this would not yield a fully optimized application, but at least the general principles are defined and evaluated on for a more defined future in the development of the OPCM. A large portion of the efforts will go into making the data and analyses available to the public - in an interactive and user-friendly way; because without this availability, the underlying principles are not brought to the public also. Regarding these underlying principles the most important one is change detection.

The achievement of a sustainable and livable city is hindered by the constraints of urban form, and density, in particular, has a crucial role in defining the performance of urban environments in terms of livability and sustainability. Research shows that higher levels of density tend to result in more sustainable and less livable environments, and vice versa. In contemporary research, the understanding of the reasons behind this issue represents an urgency. There is, however, an apparent gap in knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The manifestation of this imbalance can take multiple forms. Being it an eminently abstract issue, its reduction to a manageable and well-studied problem facilitates research and the exploration of possible solutions. In this respect, the Urban Heat Island effect is a phenomenon that represents the essence of the issue and that is closely linked to spatial factors. The manifestation of the UHI effect in Málaga (Spain) constitutes a concrete problem, especially in the context of temperature rises and an aging population. <br/><br/>The heterogeneity of Málaga’s fabric, where different levels of density are present, can both explain the uneven manifestation of temperature in the city and define limitations and potentials regarding the exploration of solutions. <br/><br/>From an analytical point of view, this work seeks to define a criteria for the characterization of different density environments and a way to understand how temperature relates to its form through different scales. From a design-oriented perspective, the goal is to define a systemic approach to the issue and explore the ways in which urban form shapes the spatial manifestation of the solutions. <br/>Ultimately, the introduction of physical measures would not only help to mitigate the UHI effect, but constitute a step towards the necessary balance between sustainability and livability.<br","Sustainability; Livability; Density; UHI effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36.7213, -4.4214"

This negatively affects the environment. It contributes to biodiversity loss since less space is available as a habitat for flora, fauna and ecosystems. Secondly, the paved gardens do not allow the rainwater to infiltrate the soil. As a consequence, the rainwater is directly steered to the sewer system. With growing number of torrential rains due to climate change, this leads to an increased pressure on the sewer systems. Lastly, the paved garden negatively affects the temperature and the quality of the air as well. This project only focuses on the effects of the paved gardens on biodiversity, since this was the original interest of the foundation Operatie Steenbreek, which was involved in this project.<br/> <br/>Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources, ecosystems included. These ecosystems, among other things, provide food, control the climate, support nutrient cycles and offer recreational benefits. Any loss in biodiversity is a matter of public concern, since it underpins the health of the planet and has direct impact on all our lives. However, there is a widening gap between humans and the natural world. The extinction of experience, a cycle of impoverishment that is initiated by the homogenization and reduction of local flora and fauna, followed by disaffection and apathy, needs to be combated to counteract the biodiversity loss. Within the context of the paved garden, this means that positive interactions between man and nature has to be stimulated. In addition, plants have to get a new and clear function in the garden. It is important that paved garden owners see the benefits of having plants in the garden.<br/> <br/>The garden has served different functions over the centuries. Today, the domestic garden has mainly become an extinction of the living room. As a result, a high level comfort is one of the main requirements of the garden. <br/> <br/>Many different activities take place in the garden throughout the year, varying from having dinner in the garden in the summer and playing in the sand pit, to activities that take place all year long, like storing bikes or that only occur once a year, like a big party. These activities can be performed alone, by different family members or by a group of people, of all ages. This leads to a complex interplay of social interactions. This demand for a high versatile usage of the garden should be taken into account during this project, in the short as well as in the long-term perspective. The product should offer the garden flexibility in space usage, different possibilities in function, and the ability to create an intimate place as well as an open space. To respond to the assignment, this should be done in a way that supports biodiversity. <br/> <br/>The final concept is the Daeza, a rack with and integrated irrigation system where one can position plants on. It functions as a room divider for the garden. <br/> <br/>The Daeza enables the user to create an intimate place, separate different activities from each other, and maximizes the potential of the open space of the garden. The product supports the flexibility of the garden especially during summer when the garden is used most extensively. In other seasons serves different purposes like covering the unused furniture or creating a nice winter scenery that is perceived from the house. <br/> <br/>The product offers the garden owner a clear structure to position plants onto. Gardening becomes a matter of decorating the rack in which plants can grow, without becoming cluttered. By offering the customer a core pollinator-friendly plant package, they are helped in choosing a nice combination of plants regarding color, flowering period and benefits. The product enables the user to hang different things in the screen, this can be food for species, or personal decorations. In this way the user can express one’s identity in the garden and create something personal.<br/> <br/>The Daeza stands out in the paved garden by offering a large and clearly demarcated surface, which is filled with plants. The vertical direction contributes to the composition of the garden.

This has been the start for this research into a circular biobased composite façade. <br/><br/>The question for building materials is expected to increase in the future and some common used materials impend to run out, therefore biobased materials could provide a solution. <br/>Thereby is circularity often called as a solution for the material problems because when materials can keep performing, there is no need to discard them. <br/><br/>This thesis studies a high performance and circular application of biobased composite on a facade. During the research the focus was on office buildings in the Netherlands.<br/> <br/>Biobased composite has previously been used for bridge design, and a few façades have been developed of which only one has been built today. These designs regard quite simple facades without windows or insulation, while for office buildings (especially the higher buildings) extensive safety requirements are obliged. <br/>Because biobased composite is a material for which not many tests have been performed, the information, especially regarding safety requirements, is still scarce. <br/>With help of specialists of DGMR a set of requirements has been defined. Besides the safety requirements the research focusses on different production methods and their environmental impact. <br/><br/>For circularity, different scenarios are defined, which are reuse, adaptation and recycling. Especially the connection methods between different parts are very important regarding circularity, because they define whether a part can be reused, adapted or recycled. <br/><br/>To establish the durability of coated and uncoated biobased composite for external use (when exposed to weather conditions as any facade is) two different material tests have been performed. The first test focusses on extreme temperatures while the second test simulates freeze-thaw cycles. <br/><br/>Eventually different common building products and facade typologies are compared to their biobased concept in terms of weight, thermal insulation and shadowcosts. <br/>Thereby the circular scenarios of both the original element as the biobased concept are compared. <br/><br/>Overall it can be concluded that the durability of biobased composite is quite good when a safety margin for the bending stiffness is taken into account. The environmental impact is at this moment not better than that of most common building materials, therefore the shadowcosts require improvement. The materials does offer good options for designers, however requires more research and testing before large-scale application is possible.<br/><br/>The results of the research offers information on biobased composite useful for designers.

To do so, innovation is needed. Firms that have perfected the exploitation of their current portfolio now need to focus more on exploring new business opportunities.<br/><br/>Innovation Booster (IB) helps large enterprises to create new business by performing innovation projects together. Throughout recent years, IB has developed towards being a partner in making firms more innovative. As IB transitions towards helping companies perform transformations, they encounter a new challenge: How to measure our transformational effect on clients? This is the question this research originally set-out to answer.<br/><br/>To tackle this challenge, a lean and agile approach was taken. Due to this approach, two insights were gathered quickly. First, a ‘company transformation’ is dependent on the company and the industry that a company is in. This makes it impossible to measure the objective ‘state of transformation’ of a company. Nevertheless a relative measurement (where progress from a base-line towards a pre-determined strategy is measured) might be possible.<br/><br/>The second important finding of the exploration phase is that clients of IB do not have a strategy regarding innovation (and thus transformation). The design goal of this research thus shifted from creating an objective measurement to helping IB’s clients make an Innovation Strategy.<br/><br/>To realise this goal, the Innovation Capabilities Assessment (ICA) was designed. This assessment is based on a framework that was grounded in the Dynamic Capabilities and Innovation Strategy theory. The ICA works as follows: first, data is gathered through use of a chatbot. This data is then visualized and used as input for a qualitative session in which Innovation Managers determine a strategy and pinpoint hurdles to improve Innovation Capabilities. The results of these elements are compiled and presented in a report, together with actions on how to improve the innovation program.<br/><br/>It is important to note that the ICA is only a first step in making transformation more measurable. If IB wants to make more impact on enterprises and transform more effectively, senior management will need to redefine their strategy and develop a follow-up proposition. In contrast with the ICA, this service can aim at objectively measuring improvement of Innovation Capabilities and thereby at measuring IB’s transformational effect.","Innovation Strategy; Dynamic Capabilities; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The car-based urbanization is shifting into a pedestrian and bike based urbanization. This is the effect of the transition in society because the fossil-fuel based society is changing into a renewable energy-based society. Cities want to densify instead of expand to deal with energy and transport more efficiently and to not affect the landscape. A new city model arises which I call for the convenience the compact city. It puts an end to the CIAM concept in which live, work, recreation and mobility are strictly separated and introduces a mix of functional urban areas. The interrelation between functions and buildings is subject to change and therefore the following research question:<br/> <br/>What should the architectural design of buildings comply with in order to fit in the urban fabric of the compact city?<br/><br/>The main conclusions are:<br/>- Buildings of the compact city should combine several functions to create vibrant areas. <br/>- Due to the fact that the city is constantly changing the buildings should be flexible in every aspect to be able to adapt to possible future functional changes. <br/>- Because of the limited space, public spaces are an important part of the compact city. <br/>- The term energy should be a part of the architecture.<br/><br/>design<br/>I used the conclusions of my research and the analysis of the intervention area as the base for my design. The outcome is an ensemble of three buildings surrounding a public square opening up to the water. One of the buildings makes a gesture to the existing parking garage by cantilevering over the garage and therefore it becomes part of the composition. Each building combines working and living in different ways. The floorplans are designed in a way to give the user as much freedom as possible to arrange it to their own wishes. This flexibility is also to be found in the structure of the buildings. The concrete casco, which is designed with as few as possible ongoing walls, offers freedom in the choice of layout variants. The facades are designed in a neutral way with respect to the underlying functions and thereby avoiding an explicit residential atmosphere. This will allow possible future functional adjustments without losing the identity. <br/><br","flexibility; Dwelling; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultrasonic pulses, 1 MHz and 2.25MHz, are sent through rock samples and recorded throughout the loading up-to failure. A novel method is proposed, the rolling cross correlation, which can aid in the identification of the brittle fracture process. Unlike in previous CWI research a different method of referencing is used. The focus is not on velocity change of the medium with a fixed reference wavelet, but a variable reference point is used with a lag in respect to the newly measured wavelet. With this rate-of change method it is possible to quantify an incremental change in the scatter distribution as a result of micro-fracturing. Laboratory testing results showed similar curve behavior for the following rock types: Bentheimer Sandstone, Fontainebleau Sandstone, Indiana limestone and the Benin Granite. A correlation was found between the rolling cross correlation curves and the geomechanical phases of initial crack closure, purely elastic region and inelastic deformation. The detection of the latter was found to be a precursory indicator for yielding and eventually rock failure. The trend of the rolling cross correlation curve became more erratic when using a higher frequency as pulse source. In some cases individual events of faster displacement rate due to fracturing were detected in the change of coda waves. CWI analysis identified as an interesting tool for monitoring in-situ rock, such as fault stability in earthquake prediction, though future research is needed to enhance the correlation of change in coda to the actual change in the medium.","Coda Wave Interferometry; Brittle rock deformation; Uniaxial Compression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences","",""

Nowadays, all the photovoltaic applications on curved surfaces use TF technologies, however their low power conversion efficiency requires a large area, which is not always available. Therefore, the entry of SHJ technology in the environment-integrated applications will de- crease the required PV area being a competitor of TF wherever the surface available is scarce and the the shape curved and not complex.<br/><br/>A structure that would benefit the advent of SHJ modules is the infotainment spot, which is a solar- powered device that provides useful information and entertainment to the user through an interactive screen. Such a device was realized for the first time by Weeda et al. [1] in TUDelft, but the CIGS module that powered the device made the structure bulky, unattractive and unwieldy. In this thesis the experience of Kaneka Corp., which holds the world’s record of highest conversion efficiency for c-Si hetero-junction, was used to design the PV module that powers the stand-alone system of a new infotainment spot.<br/><br/>In order to calculate the irradiation on the surface of the infotainment spot the Optical Model developed by Santbergen et al. [2] was used because allows flexibility in choosing the design and the location separately. However, this model does not include the surrounding, thus in this thesis three new ap- proaches to include the influence of the surrounding environment were proposed and validated through experimental measurements. Moreover, two of these new approaches have the possibility to study the irradiance also in indoor places. After that, its power was simulated knowing the irradiance values, the temperature of the PV module, computed with a thermal-energy balance, and other meteorological data. Lastly, a load proﬁle was developed to simulate the system performance throughout the year. All these information served to find the best pair of number of SHJ cells to interconnect and battery capacity and basically it is a trade-off between system reliability and system size. The study indicated that in Osaka the infotainment spot would need 42 series connected half-cut solar cells that power a 12 푉 system with a storage capacity of 150 퐴ℎ in order to make the system completely autonomous and operable the whole year.

Contributors to muscle hypertonia are of neural (increased reflex activity) and non-neural (altered visco-elastic properties) nature. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), a new noninvasive treatment modality, appears to be beneficial as hypertonia relieving therapy. However, clinical assessment such as the Ashworth test are unable to discriminate between underlying intrinsic and neural properties. Therefore, the effect of ESWT on the underlying neuromechanical components of muscle hypertonia remains unknown. The effect of ESWT on the contributors to joint resistance can be quantified using motorized ramp-and-hold movements and neuromuscular modeling of the musculoskeletal system of the ankle joint.<br/><br/><i>Methods.</i> Patients with chronic muscle hypertonia (MAS &gt; 1) were measured using ramp-and-hold rotations applied by a robotic manipulator, using slow (15 °/s) and fast (100 °/s) movement velocities. Ankle angle, torque and EMG of the tibialis anterior, soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis were measured and used to fit a neuromuscular model to the measured joint resistance. The neuromuscular model contains 15 optimizable parameters which represent the intrinsic and active muscle components. Outcome measures were the estimated model parameters, the range of motion (ROM), and modified Ashworth scale (MAS) of the ankle joint.<br/><br/><i>Results.</i> No effect of ESWT treatment was observed on the estimated model parameters and the passive ROM. The MAS was significantly lower after ESWT treatment (Z = -2.121, p = 0.034). Movement velocity introduced changes in the estimated model parameters.<br/><br/><i>Conclusion.</i> Conflicting results between the biomechanical assessment (estimated model parameters, ROM) and clinical assessment (Ashworth test), raises questions about the validity of the Ashworth test. Furthermore, since no effect was observed on the neuromuscular model parameters, no conclusion can be drawn on the effect of ESWT on the neural and non-neural contributors to ankle joint resistance in patients with chronic muscle hypertonia.","Stroke; Muscle hypertonia; Spasticity; Neuromuscular modeling; Biomechanical assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis combines an exploration of integral solutions to these challenges, with the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPPs) approach, resulting in an answer to the following research question.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In structural glass applications the elements are dimensioned based on stiffness and strength requirements. This research investigates the potential of glass sandwich structures as a way to create planar elements with a high stiffness to weight ratio and reduce material consumption in structural glazing applications. The design focuses on the replacement of the glass floors of the Acropolis Museum in Athens with an aim to a)reduce material consumption, b)eliminate the supporting substructure and c)propose an optimised design. 7 different core topologies are designed and tested by means of a 4-point bending test in a way to assess the optical quality of such structures, showcase their potential and finally assess which configuration is the most suitable to be used in the aforementioned application. The topology that fulfills the structural and aesthetical requirements is furtherly investigated and its structural behaviour is “deconstructed”. The knowledge acquired through this process is used to optimise structurally and aesthetically the panels of the new glass floors.. Finally, a design toolbox is devised which constists of three phases: a)graphical/analytical calculations (predimensioning), b)Finite Elements Analysis (detailed calculation) and c)Bending Tests (evaluation). In general, this research proves the advantage of glass sandwich structures over laminated glass in stiffnes-dominated designs but also discusses the importance of integrating the process of selective distraction into the design.","transparency; sandwich structures; glass; core topologies; glass floor; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Traditionally, entrepreneurs raise capital from friends and family, angel investment, venture capital or bank loans. However, with the development of Internet platforms, alternative finance methods have arisen. Entrepreneurs are starting to look for financial help from crowdfunding platforms, at the same time, more people from the general public with extra money starting to invest on crowdfunding websites.<br/><br/>This research focuses on equity crowdfunding, an emerging entrepreneurial finance alternative. Equity crowdfunding has only existed since 2011 in Europe. There is limited research about equity crowdfunding worldwide, let alone research about crowdfunding in the Netherlands. Based on the “lemon market” theory from Akerlof (1970), information asymmetry would harm the market and lead to market shrink or even failure. This research is intended to reduce information asymmetry in equity crowdfunding ecosystem, in an aim to promote equity crowdfunding in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>There are two types of information asymmetry being mitigated in this research. The information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and investors can be mitigated by an assessment tool. The assessment tool was developed by first compiling 11 success factors of equity crowdfunding from 5 key literature sources. Then a selection of success factors was discussed before a draft assessment tool is developed. This draft assessment tool is validated later by entrepreneurs using a semi-structured interview approach. The assessment tool is meant for entrepreneurs in the Netherlands in the high-tech industry to pre-screen or evaluate them whether equity crowdfunding can be considered as an alternative funding during their seed-stage financing. This assessment tool can present a fast insight to show start-ups how to raise money successfully on an equity crowdfunding campaign. Hence, it helps entrepreneurs make efficient decisions whether equity crowdfunding can be considered as a source of financing. The assessment tool can also pinpoint their weaknesses if they are going to participate in an equity crowdfunding campaign. By raising the awareness of equity crowdfunding among entrepreneurs, it is possible to provide them with one more option (equity crowdfunding) in their seed-stage fundraising strategy. <br/><br/>The information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and platforms can be mitigated by collecting recommendations to platforms. There are two sources of recommendations. One is from entrepreneurs’ point of view by semi-structured interviews. The other one is from second hand information collected to learn from the market leader the UK.<br/><br/>Equity crowdfunding platforms in the UK have evolved with new operations compared to the Netherlands. One is lead investor system whereby the lead investor serves as an experienced investor who can conduct due diligence on behalf of rest of investors from the crowd, but also lead investor attracts followers to invest because of his/her reputation in the field. Under this system, the success rate of campaigns goes up to more than 72%, while platforms without lead investor mechanism is about 55%. Another trend is unified nominee structure, which is the “funds” function by Seedrs. So investors can invest to equity crowdfunding campaigns, convertible loans, or funds. In the earlier two options, investors invest under their own identity to projects, which means entrepreneurs can have hundreds of small investors that they have to manage updates with. However, in the “funds” option, investors put money into a pool under the name of Seedrs. And Seedrs invest to different projects to leverage the risks for investors, acting as a portfolio manager in traditional banking. Also, entrepreneurs do not have to worry about managing hundreds of investors. All investment is under the unified nominee structure, which is under Seedrs name. This structure provides both sides convenience. This innovative trend is definitely worth borrowing by Netherlands platforms. Also, there is a difference of operations on due diligence between the UK platforms and the Netherlands platforms. The Netherlands platform Symbid perform due diligence after the campaign target is reached and before passing to the entrepreneur. While the UK platforms perform due diligence before listing a campaign online. This measurement results a rejection rate of 72% of projects. However, investors can expect better quality projects to invest. As a result, platforms act with more reputation would attract more investors.<br/><br/>To summarise recommendations from entrepreneurs to platforms, they think if the speed of fundraising were faster than formal investors (VC and angels), it would be more appealing to entrepreneurs. So the platform can be attract more entrepreneurs by shortening the fundraising cycle of equity crowdfunding. Also, if the platform can enable functions of “network and knowledge” to be provided by the crowd, it would attract more entrepreneurs, because all interviewees in the research think it is very important. “Network and knowledge” are the most repeated key words when entrepreneurs answering the interview questions regarding their concerns in choosing equity crowdfunding. Not surprisingly, the most attractive part of traditional investors (VC and angels) is the value-added services. They can provide their network to boost the development of start-ups. They can also provide their knowledge or expertise in technical, managerial or strategic levels to help start-ups to expand as fast as possible. If those benefits entrepreneurs can acquire from the crowds on equity crowdfunding campaign, there will be more entrepreneurs to choose equity crowdfunding. One of the reasons why the equity crowdfunding in the UK market is much more developed than the one in the Netherlands market is that the equity crowdfunding platforms have been backed by venture capital or lead investors (angels). The collaboration between equity crowdfunding platforms and venture capital in the UK is the goal for the Netherlands to achieve. However, in the UK, there is more institutional investment money in looking for investment opportunities than the Netherlands. It might be a challenge for Netherlands equity crowdfunding platforms to seek collaboration with venture capitals, but there are advantages from government subsidies that are possible to collaborate with. <br/><br/>The hybrid financial instrument between equity crowdfunding and other sources is possible. Two possible applications are like this. 1) If the entrepreneur has reached the target of equity crowdfunding campaign, the government subsidy would be provided on top of the money raised on equity crowdfunding. So it doubled the investment originally it would acquire only from the crowd. 2) If the entrepreneur has reached the goal of equity crowdfunding, a bank loan under government incentives would be provided on top of this equity crowdfunding funding. In other words, entrepreneurs can exchange less equity for the same amount of money. However, on equity crowdfunding platforms, the innovative projects are limited. Future study can explore the feasibility of this suggestion. In the UK, the collaboration between VC and equity crowdfunding already exists. Venture capital start investing in start-ups via equity crowdfunding platforms. This has proved to be feasible in the UK. It can be possible in the Netherlands in the future as well, since from the regulation part, equity crowdfunding in the UK and in the Netherlands are similar.<br/><br/>With more actors (venture capital, angel investors, government subsidies) involved on equity crowdfunding platforms, not only the crowds, there would be a bigger cash pool to invest in campaigns. In return, it can attract more entrepreneurs to participate in equity crowdfunding platforms.<br/>By reducing information asymmetry between the entrepreneurs and the platforms and the entrepreneurs and the investors, it would be possible to mitigate “lemon market” effect by Akerlof (1970) and lead to a more prosperous equity crowdfunding industry in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>Keywords: Crowdfunding, Crowdsourcing, Equity-based crowdfunding, start-ups, seed-stage financing, entrepreneurial financing, lemon market theory, information asymmetry, information cascade, herding, crowd wisdom, signalling, success factors.","Crowdfunding; equity crowdfunding; success factors; entrepreneurial financing; seed-stage financing; start-up fiancing; information asymmetry; lemon market theory; herding; crowd wisdom; information cascade; startup; high tech","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-25","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Energy flexibility is the ability to change power production or consumption over time. It is required for a power system to function properly, to balance supply and demand. Currently, the largest providers of energy flexibility in the Netherlands can be found on the supply side and consist mainly out of fossil fueled power plants. As these are set to phase out in the near future and be replaced by mainly variable renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, the necessity for energy flexibility on the demand side is set to be increased. Therefore, a new role is expected to arise in the power system, namely that of the aggregator. Aggregators will combine small scale energy flexibility providers and provide this aggregated energy flexibility to the power system <br/><br/>In this MSc thesis, the focus lies with a power scheduling Electric Vehicle (EV) aggregator. Considering that the number of EVs will increase in the near future, the lack of control over charging a large fleet of EVs may result in an overloaded distribution grid. The charging behavior of a large fleet of EVs, connected in a Vehicle to Grid (V2G) setting, is formalized as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization problem. Allowing power consumption to be shifted within a finite prediction horizon. To optimally valorize the energy flexibility of the fleet and respect the limits of the distribution grid, the control problem is extended to include spatial information and network constraints. The goal is to develop multiple control algorithms to solve this control problem using distributed optimization.<br/><br/>The contributions of the work in this MSc thesis are threefold. First, the ability to optimally valorize the energy flexibility is increased by including spatial information in the distribution grid, represented as subsets of the fleet, such that congestion management services can be provided. Secondly, a parallel implementation of a coordinated distributed MPC is developed using resource allocation with feasible iterations for binary on/off input systems. Thirdly, a hierarchical MPC algorithm is developed using virtual batteries to represent the aggregated behavior of a fleet of EVs, for which new tight constraints are derived to better represent the EV fleet.<br/><br/>To conclude, numerical experiments are performed in closed loop to study the behavior of the developed algorithms with respect to a centralized benchmark. The experiments show that for a growing EV fleet, the hierarchical algorithm remains at the same approximate error with respect to the benchmark. This, while the distributed algorithm approaches the benchmark very well, with limited communication and in relatively short computation times with respect to the benchmark. For a growing number of subsets using the same amount of EVs, the hierarchical algorithm is able to come up with a feasible solution reasonably fast. Whereas, the distributed algorithm shows a drastic decrease in computation time as multiple smaller problems are now solved. Both algorithms achieve this at increasing costs. Future work is expected to further improve the hierarchical algorithm such that it will be able to outperform the distributed architecture in practical applications.","Model Predictive Control; MPC; Hybrid System; Aggregator; Smart Grid; Energy Flexibility; Energy Transition; Electric Vehicle; Distributed Optimization; Integer Linear Programming problem; DMPC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

A prototype has been developed which enables smooth and timely vario-scale map rendering against heavy user actions such as fast zooming and panning in a short period. Modified prototype program allows query of only relevant data chunks by current viewport position; it prevents repeated loading of same chunks; what is more, repeated transmission of data from outside to GPU is eliminated. A tree structure is embedded at the client side that facilitates retrieve time. Rendering happens every frame; hence the prototype responses to heavy user actions timely. Also, it can obtain coordinates in RD coordinate system by double clicking. After testing the modified program with a 9km by 9km dataset online, exceptional performance is indicated by a high average frame rate (57 fps) and low main memory occupation (with a network speed at 9MB/s). The prototype performance is significant affected by the client network condition; low network speed can decrease the frame rate. For instance, the web service achieved a frame rate of 47 fps at a network speed at 6MB/s.","SSC; WebGL; Web Service; 3D; tGAP; vario-scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Cutter suction dredgers are a type of hydraulic dredgers often used in areas with hard soil where other types of dredging vessels would be ineffective. As a result of the wide range of type of soil that is being cut a lot of variation is seen in the power demand on the cutter suction dredger's diesel-electric power generation system. Consequently, the load on the main diesel engines rapidly changes. To smoothen power demand the addition of an energy storage system to the power generation system is investigated to reduce the load variation experienced by the main engines. Reduction of the load variation is also relevant for the application of dual fuel engines in cutter suction dredgers. For dual fuel engines exceeding of the loading limit poses a significant risk of the main engines switching from combustion of (liquefied) natural gas to combustion of diesel fuel to prevent misfiring or engine knocking. Better control of the engine load is expected to allow continuous combustion of liquefied natural gas during dredging operation. <br/>From the analysis of the power demand measured during dredging operation it is concluded that energy storage systems capable of delivering high power and have relatively low energy storage capability are best suited for this application. Based on the required characteristics flywheel energy storage and supercapacitor energy storage are selected as suitable energy storage systems. For both energy storage systems a simulation model is created based on available literature. A benchmark simulation model of the driveline of a cutter suction dredger, including the power generation system and electrical network, is created and validated using measurement data. The power and energy storage capacity of the energy storage system are determined by exceeding of the loading capacity of the main engines defined by the engine manufacturer during several months of continuous dredging operation. Separate cases are investigated where a supercapacitor energy storage system and a flywheel energy storage system are added. Simulation results are compared to the results of the benchmark model. Furthermore, simulations are conducted where the main diesel engines are replaced by dual fuel engines running on liquefied natural gas with a methane number of 80. Results show that both energy storage systems are capable of increasing the percentage of load variation within the engine limit on the original driveline from 91% to at least 99%.<br/>For dual fuel engines it is found that without an energy storage system 75% of the load variation is within the engine's loading limit, meaning switching to diesel fuel is inevitable during dredging operation. The addition of an energy storage system increases the percentage of load variation within the engine's loading limit to at least 98%. While the engine limit is still rarely exceeded, further analysis showed that the air excess ratio stays between the knock limit and misfire limit, meaning no switching to diesel fuel is required. As a result, continuous dredging operation using LNG as fuel is possible resulting in a reduction in fuel cost up to roughly 30%. During this research it is found that the effect of transient loads on engine wear could not be quantified. Further research into this subject is needed before conclusions can be made with regard to this subject. Also, no reduction in fuel consumption is seen as a result of the reduction of transient loading.","Hybrid; Dredging; Supercapacitor; Flywheel; Transient operation; Peak shaving; LNG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-29","","","","Marine Technology","",""

This so-called ‘DG-RVMS’ strategy is developed, extensively verified, and tested on a more complex case.<br/><br/>The proposed DG-RVMS paradigm consists of three principle components. First, the perelement weak form is coupled by manipulation of the fine scale element boundary terms. Next, a fine scale surface model is introduced to make the global coarse scale weak formulation well posed. Finally, the coarse scale jumps and residual can be leveraged to formulate a new volumetric fine scale model. This volumetric fine scale model incorporates the fine scale effects onto the coarse scale solution. <br/><br/>The verification efforts will focus on a number of 1D test cases, concerning linear differential equations. In particular the Poisson equation and an advection-diffusion problem will be investigated. Within a controlled environment the finite element solution can be manipulated at will, by using explicit expressions for the fine scale terms. As an example the H1 and L2 projections of an exact solution are recollected. Each term in the obtained multiscale formulations will be verified by means of these numerical experiments.<br/><br/>Additionally, the multiscale principles will serve to develop fundamentally new insights into the nature of known discontinuous Galerkin formulations. It will be shown that classical formulations, such as the well known interior penalty method, can be interpreted as a specific fine scale model. It will also be shown that upwind numerical fluxes serve as an impromptu solution for the lack of a volumetric fine scale model.<br/><br/>Finally, the DG-RVMS framework will be utilized for a more complex partial differential equation. Thereby its effectiveness as a multiscale model can be assessed. For this purpose the nonlinear transient Burgers equation will be considered. Numerical experiments will consistently show a near order of magnitude decrease in the error in total solution energy. The experiments will make use of discretizations of polynomial order p = 2 to p = 4. The increase of performance is observed for all polynomial orders, and for the complete range of<br/>degrees of freedom in the convergence study.","Residual-based; variational multiscale; discontinuous Galerkin; Finite Element Method; computational fluid dynamics; turbulence modeling; multiscale; fine scale surface model; fine scale volumetric model; discontinuous","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","This research aims at modeling the trajectory followed by the Galileo spacecraft during a variety of flybys about the Galilean moons. The chosen flybys have good Earth’s elevation angles and either low or high closest-approach altitudes, so that the comparison of the two can give relevant insight into the accuracy of the corresponding trajectories. By propagating the state of the spacecraft during these flybys, optimizing the nominal initial state of the spacecraft (obtained through the SPICE program) and the spherical harmonics of the moons, and estimating new harmonics, the minimum root mean square error between the resulting trajectory and the ephemerides by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is found. The analysis of its components along the Local Orbital axes gives insight into the existing relation between them and the Earth's elevation and azimuth angles. In particular, a low-altitude flyby implies in general a higher error, but when two flybys have similar altitudes, then the Earth's elevation plays a relevant role and the flyby with the largest one is more likely to have a larger error too. The root mean square error of the fitted trajectories can vary from 15 cm to 7 m, so always less than the 9 m declared by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as the maximum error of the moons ephemerides. Furthermore, the flybys about Ganymede and Callisto show a high error in the along-track and cross-track directions, since the radius of their sphere of influence is quite larger than that of the inner moons' ones, hence there is more time for the perturbations to influence the orbit. A by-product of this research is the estimate of the Galilean moons' gravity field, in particular the new values for their J2 and C2,2 coefficients led to the conclusion that Io is less hydrostatic, while Europa and Callisto are more hydrostatic than previously thought.","Galilean moons; Orbit modeling; Flyby; Hydrostaticity; Gravity field; Spherical harmonics; MATLAB; Integration; Propagation; Optimization; Data fitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Based on six perspectives, the institutional, technological, financial, infrastructural, knowledge and social perspective, the value chain was analysed to create an overview of the current situation of P recycling in the Dutch communal wastewater chain. The research focusses on struvite from wastewater and phosphorus from sludge ash. The lack of demand is regarded as the most important barrier. Barriers related to this issue are the lack of a sense of urgency by consumers, the price gap between raw and recycled phosphorus and the risk perception related to recycled materials.<br/>Phosphorus recycling needs cooperation between actors in the whole value chain and needs a system perspective.

As a consequence, users become more aware of their energy usage which may result in a reduction in energy consumption. Nevertheless, many countries in Europe still use an analog electricity meter based on a rotating disk, which rotates at a speed proportional to the consumption passing through the meter. In contrast to a smart meter it is not possible to read out the consumption directly. As an alternative, the rotating disk can be observed such that the power (W) and Energy (kWh) consumption can be derived. The current sensor device developed by Quby, uses an LED and phototransistor, where the LED emits light on the disk that is reflected towards the phototransistor. Because of the physical properties of the disk, the sampled phototransistor signal can be represented as a pulse signal, where each pulse indicates a revolution of the disk. The sensor device is mains powered, however, many electricity meters are not located near a power outlet requiring the sensor device to be battery powered. This is a challenging problem since the LED has a relatively large power consumption. The pulse-detection algorithm running on the mains-powered sensor device assumes an LED current of 10 mA with a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. Quby requires that the battery-powered device will last at least one year on an energy budget of 4200 mAh (roughly four AA batteries), and the percentage error of the determined energy consumption should be less than 5%. This implies a factor 50 in power reduction. In this thesis we propose an energy-efficient noise-robust pulse-detection algorithm to detect pulses while keeping the LED current to a maximum of 1 mA. To preserve more energy, the LED is duty cycled to at most 20% instead of 100%, and the sampling frequency is reduced to a maximum of 400 Hz. The proposed method is based on a statistical model where pulse detection is used by means of a multiple-sample likelihood ratio test. Due to the low LED current the signal statistics, such as pulse amplitude, offset and noise, are very sensitive to ambient light. Therefore, an additional method is proposed to estimate these statistics continuously. As a consequence, the detection thresholds in the likelihood ratio test are dynamically adjusted based on predefined probabilities of a false alarm and true detection. The proposed algorithm is extensively tested in a lab setup with three different analog electricity meters, a varying load and a light source emitting light in the same relative spectral-power distribution as sunlight. Moreover, measurements are performed at two households for one week each. From the experiments it can be concluded that the proposed method can last for at least one year when battery-powered, while predicting energy consumptions with an error of less than 2%.","AMR; photo-reflector; analog meter; meter readings; meter reading; pulse detection; Toon; electricity meter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

So far, there are no therapies that can inhibit or even reverse the degenerative progress of this disease. Regimens and treatments that eliminate the pathological symptoms of DDD are mainly used in patients suffering from DDD. Among the promising treatments of DDD in preclinical development is the use of natural bioactive compounds, such as (-) -Epigallocatechin 3-Gallate (EGCG). EGCG is a compound of green tea leaves, indicating beneficial effects against several diseases, however it is rather degradable in its free form. Hence, on-target EGCG facilitation in human body, in a manner providing protection to EGCG against degradation and dose control over time, is necessary. It was hypothesized that encapsulation could protect EGCG and attenuate DDD features, once replaced locally and released long-term. Therefore, the aim of this master thesis was the design and synthesis of a drug delivery system (DDS) for EGCG encapsulation, stabilization and protection against unrestrained release, for potential local delivery as a DDD therapy.<br/>EGCG was encapsulated in gelatin particles via electrospraying. These particles were then embedded into HA-pNIPAM, a thermo-responsive hydrogel for further stabilization and release control. The hydrogel-particles mixture, consisting the DDS, would then be injected into degenerative disc tissue. The DDS was evaluated regarding its biocompatibility, EGCG protection and prolonged release rates. Firstly, an electrospraying protocol was established for EGCG encapsulation in gelatin microparticles. These particles were tested for their morphology and cytotoxicity. EGCG-loaded microparticles were combined with HA-pNIPAM hydrogel and tested in vitro (t=7days) for their ability to release EGCG and determine the activity of encapsulated EGCG via colorimetric assays and absorbance measurements.<br/>The electrospraying conditions of 2μL/min (flow rate), 20kV (voltage), 4% Gelatin solution and cross-linking with 37.5μg/mL glutaraldehyde (GA) gave spherical, dispersed particles with average size of 669.72 nm, facilitating injectability. Their effect on cells indicated 83-88% metabolic activity, compared to control cells (100% viability), regarding cytotoxicity. Encapsulated EGCG was released up to 50% slower than free EGCG, but kept the same activity (80%). Overall, it was demonstrated that the designed DDS is a promising approach, that can limit EGCG release and possibly protect its activity.","Degenerative Disc Disease; Epigallocatechin 3-Gallate; Drug Delivery Systems; Encapsulation; Electrospray","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","","","","","",""

The final design is attempting to responding to the environmental, historical, social and seismic context with the method which I researched in the first part. The program of my design is a botanical education center for young children in uithuizen. As for technology part, I chose the solar-tracking panels and intelligent light diffusion glass to achieve my final goal: communicating with nature in the ways of architecture and human experience.","biomimectic structure; seismic arhitecture design; sun-tracing louver; botanical garden","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","In this study a one-dimensional, steady-state, non-isothermal numerical model was developed in order to investigate the transport phenomena occurring in a membrane electrode assembly for fuel cell applications and to provide an insight on the effects of the hydrogen crossover. The hydrogen that permeates through the membrane is consumed without generation of useful work. Moreover, the effects caused by the hydrogen crossover are so far unclear. This complex phenomenon is usually neglected in fuel cell modelling and the results of experimental measurements are often not in agreement. The proposed model consists of a set of transport equations, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamic. The latter derives from irreversible thermodynamics and it provides a systematic way to study heterogeneous systems, like fuel cells. The numerical results are thermodynamically consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. Initially the isothermal boundary condition was applied to the system in order to first study the coupled charge and mass transport, including the hydrogen crossover. However, it was found out that the thermal effects are not negligible in the simulated system and thus the constant temperature assumption was removed. The model described with the NET method provides useful information about the driving forces profiles (total pressure, hydrogen partial pressure, electric potential and temperature) and entropy production. This allows a more accurate estimation of non-constant parameters and also a more reliable prediction on the hydrogen crossover flux over a wide range of operating conditions. An optimization procedure was carried out showing that even though the set of optimal parameters produced an increment of almost four times in crossover, the power output increased without being affected by the variations hydrogen permeation. Although the results of the simulations show that hydrogen crossover has no significant effects on fuel cell performance in term of power output, the adopted method of non-equilibrium thermodynamics permitted to identify that part of the reduction in cell voltage in near open circuit conditions is attributable to the hydrogen crossover. The effects of hydrogen permeation are only noticeable at very low current densities, so when the crossover flux is comparable to the hydrogen reacting at the catalyst layer. A final analysis was carried out with increased permeability (ten, fifty and a hundred time). This verified that considerable hydrogen crossover flux lead to effects on net heat flux, entropy production, temperature distribution and power output.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","ChemE/Chemical Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology",""

The latest market-led regeneration wave, however, is controversially and heatedly discussed. Council estates are densified and developed into mixed communities with the introduction of market tenure. Particularly in the context of London’s housing crisis, this approach is criticised to prioritise market demands over the needs of the original inhabitants and cause a loss of much needed genuinely affordable housing. The aim of this research is therefore to contribute to the search of methods to achieve more socially balanced development within these regeneration processes in London – in particular, to explore the role planning and design can play to ensure that the needs of lower income groups are met. The main evaluation criteria are the provision of genuinely affordable housing, meaningful resident engagement and design that responds to the various needs within mixed communities. A set of recommendations is developed based on the analysis of London’s planning and policy framework and two differing case studies: the controversial Heygate Estate/Elephant&amp;Castle development and the infill approach of the Dover Court Estate regeneration. What is more, lessons are drawn from regeneration approaches in Amsterdam and Vienna, two cities well known for housing. The research revealed that estate regeneration is dependent on multiple economic, political and social factors. In London, central government directives including housing policy, funding allocation and regulation of local authorities play a decisive role in how individual regeneration schemes can be approached. At the same time, planning tasks such as a thorough decision making process, meaningful resident engagement, detailed and transparent monitoring as well as effective negotiation with the private sector can be supported on the city-wide or local level. Therefore, the proposal does not only include process and design recommendations, but also institutional capacity building strategies.","Social housing; Urban regeneration; International lessons; Policy framework; Mixed communities; London","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.509865, -0.118092"

Openness and generosity of space are main intervention guidelines in all three spaces as the scale of the building needs these in order to be appreciated and fully experienced.<br/>Another, important element especially for the silo parts is the introduction of light as the enhancing element of the silo experience.

During the Delta works a lot of water infrastructures were built in the area as technical solutions, such as the Haringvlietdam. The Delta Works brought safety and made the area more accessible. However, nowadays we realized some negative effects as well, since ecosystems were damaged and lost. <br/><br/>Additionally, the climate is changing and in the future the sea level will rise. Due to storms and heavy rainfall rivers will have higher peak discharges. These changes will have considerable consequences for the Southwest Region and therefore innovative long term solutions need to be designed so that the area stays protected.<br/><br/>In this specific framework, it could be argued that the protection of coastal landscapes from flooding disasters is traditionally approached by engineering perspective that often resulted in negative impacts on local ecology and ecosystems. As well as massive mono-functional infrastructures that act only as intermediate space without culture and program value. <br/><br/>Taking this in to account, it could be indicated that there is a strong need to incorporate landscape architecture and ecological services in coastal protection. For this reason, the design assignment of this graduation project is the partial opening and slow transformation of the Haringvlietdam to an operative landscape infrastructure along with the creation of a group of islands for protection. <br/>It is important to slowly transform this area in such a way that people will be part of the development and can profit from it. The design should be considered as an open ended slow process towards an adaptive coastal self-sufficient region. <br/><br/>This slow process, would give people the time to realize what would change and understand the future possibilities of this area and could develop a self-sufficient region which is producing energy from alternative resources (water, wind, sun), producing aqua agriculture that is consumed domestically or is exported to other countries, attracting tourism to the extended coastline (islands) and providing a unique experience both for the residence of the region and for the visitors.<br","coastal landscape; coastal defense; slow transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

For example, the Paris agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is one of the most crucial steps that countries have signed recently. The aim is to cause a lower global temperature increase, and thus, to reduce the resulting climate risks.<br/>North Sea countries are working on a greener future in a national level, as well; and these are in fact, the countries which are the most concerned about the climate change globally. Moreover, these are affluent in terms of opportunities for using greener energy sources, due to their climatic and geographic conditions. Clear examples are hydropower plants in the Nordic region or offshore-wind in the North Sea.<br/>Nevertheless, these countries need also of infrastructure to achieve their objectives, such as a Power System which will enable to integrate green generation sources properly and to satisfy the societies’ energy needs successfully. Power Systems are in fact, needed key enablers of this energy transition. <br/>The topic of this Master Thesis is transmission expansion planning in the North Sea for the year 2030. PowerGIM and PowerGAMA are used. The objective is to find the socio-economically beneficial grid design which will help achieve these future ambitions that the North Sea countries have and at the same time, which will be robust w.r.t. renewable energy sources’ development uncertainty. The main finding of this Master Thesis is that Dogger Bank hub is obtained as part of the most socio-economically beneficial offshore-grid layout for the year 2030, in all implemented scenarios. Each scenario refers to one implemented ENTSO-E Vision (Visions 1-4) with some additional assumptions. <br/>In short, in this Master Thesis, four different offshore-grid layouts are obtained, one per each implemented scenario; and all of them have the same core. The core is Dogger Bank hub’s interconnection with Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Denmark. Nevertheless, there are some variations which depend on the implemented scenario and on the implemented assumptions. Overall, the obtained Dogger Bank hub could also integrate between 13-32 GW offshore-wind in the North Sea. Then, a reference grid layout is created, as well. This design embraces the previously mentioned four grid layouts in a conservative way, i.e. the repeated lines in all four obtained grid layouts are taken with the lowest capacity value among all four designs. <br/>The grid layout obtained after the implementation of the second scenario is the most robust grid layout w.r.t. different future energy prospects. Its operational cost saving throughout the lifetime of 30 years w.r.t. the reference grid layout is of 20-33 bn €, depending on the implemented future scenario; and the investment cost increase is of 5.5 bn € w.r.t. the reference grid layout.","Power System Planning; Power Transmission; Power System Management; Power System Economics; Power System Modelling; Load Flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","BEST PATHS","63.41797, 10.40183"

They are also a beacon for many who flock to these urban areas in the hope of better employment opportunities and quality of life. Cities are thus constantly growing and evolving in an effort to create a competitive advantage that can attract and retain more business. The pattern of city growth can be traced back to several factors that influence the location decisions of businesses to cluster. Service sector led cities witness the most prominent impact in real estate development, given that their economy is heavily reliant on business networks and economies of agglomeration. As such, these cities also bear the drawbacks of being popular migration destinations, including overconsumption of resources, crowding and high costs. Creating an environment that can benefit corporations, residents and the Government, while still tackling the negative externalities of agglomeration is crucial to maintain a city's competitive advantage. This tension is researched through an empirical study of the factors that have established Bangalore as the Silicon Valley of India. The dynamics between the private and public sector is therefore explored, making a case for more cross-sector collaboration in order to sustain Bangalore’s competitive advantage as an IT destination.","competitive city advantage; business location decisions; urban structure; negative externalities of agglomeration; cross-sector collaboration; Bangalore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","Real Estate Management",""

The demand for low-income housing is rising rapidly due to the contemporary aim to eliminate the unhealthy living conditions and the influx of migrants. Without newcomers a city would not be able to grow, as internal migration is essential for urbanization. Research has shown that migration within a country can even play a role in poverty reduction and economic development. A large amount of migrants can, on the other hand, also put pressure on a city when the city fails to have the capacity to adequately house all the newcomers. In turn this may lead to the formation of informal settlements, as previously mentioned. This describes in very few words what has and still is happening in Addis Ababa. <br/><br/>The cities government realized at the beginning of this century that the capital suffered a tremendous housing backlog and initiated the previously mentioned IHDP with good intentions. Unfortunately the result did not live up to its initial goals or the citizens needs and expectations. Only half of the predetermined amount of units were built, thereby the construction costs increased making the units unaffordable for one of the target groups; the lower-income. This so-called urban renewal begins with clearing out the site, meaning the often clinical demolition of entire neighbourhoods. Moreover, this means that the places which used to function as a foothold, the informal settlements, are being destroyed and replaced by static housing units where the newcomers and other poor can only dream of living in.<br/><br/>This research and design proposal aims at investigating the importance and potential of transitory spaces within developing cities. Eventually it has the goal of providing the poor with a foothold in the city, by creating truly cheap housing for a temporary period, through the creation of a permanent structure, which encourages the individual or group to develop.<br","Transitory spaces; Addis Ababa; temporary inhabitation; transformation; permanent structure; social; network; affordable housing; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","Affordable Housing for Sustainable Development in the Global Urban South, Addis Ababa",""

The analysis follows a layer approach that depicts the natural, cultural and urban layer, the social structure and its relation with the public space and the notion of play. The resulted strategy regards play spaces as polycentric, flexible and dynamic.","play; derelict urban area; water infrastructure; natural dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","51.9100465, 4.5085734"

It is necessary to come up with new solutions in order to give the planet to next generations. It is also known that buildings play a crucial role in this. This will be substantiated in the first chapter of this report. On the other hand, transformation of cities and buildings is one of the main emergent themes in contemporary architecture. Finding an appropriate balance between the old and the new is of fundamental interest for contemporary architectural design (Studio Heritage &amp; Architecture, 2016). Looking at these trends, it could be expected that also a flourishing integration of both takes place. But the opposite is true. When new buildings can be built sustainable but the demand is in the existing stock, the world will be left empty handed. That is the reason the problem statement in this project is: Transformation and sustainability are rarely being combined in contemporary architecture. Fenix II is one of the existing building complexes and located at the south side of the Rijnhaven. Temporary functions created on the short term a new life for the Fenix II. Now a plan is needed for the further development of the old warehouse. Fenix II is on the edge between history and future en thereby an interesting object for this graduation project. Considering the problem statement and object of this project, the aim of this design project is to transform the building into a sustainable building while maintaining the identity and underscore its characteristics. So the design question dealt with is: How to transform the Fenix II into a sustainable building while conserving its characteristics? From the research appeared that Fenix II has a high cultural historical value from which isn't much left in the current situation. On the other hand turned out that the purpose with regard to sustainability was to try to close the cycles of energy, water, material and food within the scoop of the project. Energy became the guiding theme of the design. The ambition is to give back and create energy in the appearance of the building, in its function and operation. The conclusion is that this design shows that it is possible to transform the Fenix II into a sustainable building and conserving its characteristics. Al together, Fenix II will be an energizing warehouse for the inhabitants of Katendrecht and the city of Rotterdam.","Heritage & architecture; Integrated sustainability; Transformation; smart bioclimatic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","51.9017601, 4.4862224"

However, the multi-actor complexity and the systems complexity of blockchain technology makes decision-making in this subject a difficult task, resulting in a proliferation of blockchain experiments that do not provide significant value. To capture the benefits of blockchain in processes where this technology is applicable in the EU, a blockchain assessment tool is needed that allows for the structural assessment of the fit with blockchain for an information exchange or registration process. This thesis uses a Design Science to design this blockchain assessment tool.<br/><br/>Six elements were found to be of importance for blockchain experimentation in EU Institutions and Bodies: Complexities, Process Factors, Ripple Effects, Organizational Factors, Decision-making Process and Design Features. It is critical to take the complexities involved in implementing blockchain in public administrations into account. Also, the factors that define the fit between the process and blockchain technology need to be considered as insight in this fit can enhance decision-making regarding blockchain experimentation in EU Institutions and Bodies. In addition, there are a number of organizational factors that determine the ability of a governmental organization to adopt blockchain technology. Given the institutional change that blockchains might present, it is critical to take into account the ripple effects of blockchains when deciding to experiment with blockchain technology as an EU Institution or Body. As there is not merely one decision-making process for IT innovation adoption, the process of how a decision on blockchain experimentation is reached needs to be considered as well. Lastly, as blockchain technology compromises of various types and design features, it is important to reflect on the impact of these features on the process criteria.<br/><br/>Using explorative expert interviews combined with Qualitative Data and Matrix Prioritization Analysis, the elements are concretized and translated into requirements for the blockchain assessment tool. Based on these requirements, the blockchain assessment tool is designed using a Morphological Chart to structure the design process. The blockchain assessment tool consists of three steps that allow a user to assess the blockchain fit, create a high-level blockchain design and to map the ripple effects. The blockchain assessment tool was demonstrated in two case studies exploring the possibilities of blockchain for an EU registration or information exchange system, for which the tool proved to provide key insights. Also, experts were interviewed to evaluate the tool, which demonstrated the need for this blockchain assessment tool for the public sector.<br/><br/>Future research is suggested to focus on the trade-offs between the design features to provide a better view on the possible blockchain architectures. Also, more research into the openness and interoperability of blockchain systems could create more depth in the debate of permissionless versus permissioned blockchains in governments. Lastly, research into applying Value Sensitive Design for blockchains could enable the design of permissionless blockchain systems where authorities can be supervisors to protect public values in permissionless blockchains.<br","Blockchain; Design Science Research; E-government; EU Institutions; Technology Assessment Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-14","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

Nonlinearities and time delay in the visual system play an important role in understanding the complex nature of the visual system. This study investigated the nonlinear interactions and time delay in the visual pathway, using several types of stimulation paradigms. Multisine (i.e sum of multiple sinusoidal signals) and sine light stimulation were presented to healthy participants in order to elicit steady-state visual evoked responses. The recorded signals were analyzed using multi-spectral phase coherence, a novel cross-frequency phase coupling metric, in order to quantify the nonlinear interactions, form a brain map and estimate time delay. Chirp light stimulation (signals with linearly increasing frequencies) was used to elicit visual responses inside a specific frequency range. Time delay was estimated using Fractional Fourier Transformation due to its ability to handle chirps’ non-stationary properties. Brain maps indicated that multisine paradigms elicit more localized nonlinear interactions than chirp paradigms. All sinusoidal stimulation provided clusters of similar time delays. Bisine presented the most distinctive groups, fact that suggests that bisine is able to be used as a distinction measure. Trisine time delay showed the lowest variance, fact that shows more accurate estimation. Chirp time delay presented also small variances but the mean time delay found to be very frequency dependent. To conclude, this study showed that multisine paradigms are suitable to be used to elicit nonlinear responses but time delay may not be sufficient measure to fully describe the visual system.","Nonlinear; Visual System; Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials; Light Stimulation; Light Processing; EEG Analysis; Brain Dynamics; SInusoidal; Chirp; Multisine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-30","","","","","",""

Products must meet high-purity standards to conform with market and customers’ requirements. Two chemical processes, reaction and distillation, are essential to achieve these objectives. To overcome certain disadvantages and/or limitations that each operation unit possess, these two processes are sometimes combined in one. The combination of a separation zone with a reaction zone in the reactive distillation column, leads to complex interactions between vapor-liquid equilibrium, mass transfer rates, diffusion and chemical kinetics, which are accurately described by rigorous mathematical models. Nevertheless, this kind of models are inconvenient when it comes to parameter estimation and model-based control implementation; controllers and estimators require simpler models to perform reliably and efficiently. This situation poses a trade-off problem between model accuracy and control efficiency and implementability.<br/><br/>The extents of reaction and flows is a mathematical framework that has been attracting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in processes with chemical reaction. This approach introduces a linear transformation to decompose the system dynamics into its reaction and flow spaces to obtain a decoupled quasi-linear representation of the system’s governing dynamics. The nonlinear model is brought to an LPV description by means of this transformation. Due to the decoupling effect on the global dynamics, the system is simplified in representation and no reduction of the state-space dimension or linearization needs to be done. <br/><br/>The extent transformation framework is extended to the case of a reactive batch distillation column to build an LPV model for control. This model is used to develop an MPC. To test the efficiency of the LPV-based scheme, the MPC is compared against a nonlinear MPC.","Extents of reaction and flows; Model-based Control; Reactive Batch Distillation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","IMPROVISE",""

Because of this repetitive motion at each cycle, the valve is constantly exposed to large variations of pressure and hemodynamic forces. Deterioration in its peculiar functioning could lead to the arising of valvular diseases such as stenosis or regurgitation. A widely spread procedure to cure severely damaged heart valves is the replacement with artificial heart valves. However, up to now, the natural aortic valve properties and functionalities have never been equalised by any manufactured prototypes in terms of efficiency and durability. This limitation has inspired many engineering researches with the purpose of gaining a complete understanding on the working principles of the valve and the evolution of the flow through it in order to enhance the performances of these medical devices. <br/>In this thesis, numerical simulations of blood passing through the aortic valve have been performed. In particular, this study proposes an alternative investigating approach which consists on prescribing the rigid motion of the leaflets a priori as taken from experimental values and without the employment of the structural solver. To execute this strategy, the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Euler method along with remeshing techniques has been employed in Ansys Fluent. The main objectives concern the study of the resulting hemodynamics in the aortic root and the validation with other investigating techniques such as experimental work and Fluid-Structure Interaction simulations.<br/>First, the methodology was tested in a two-dimensional geometry which embodied a simplified representation of the aortic root. Secondly, a more realistic three-dimensional case was analysed with the employment of a commercial bileaflet mechanical valve. In this case, two different methods were adopted to deal with the transition of the flow to a turbulent regime. Namely, the analysis was conducted both by the resolution of the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-ε model and by maintaining a laminar approach. <br/>Validation of the method with available experimental data showed that the two-dimensional case is well reproduced. On the other hand, mainly qualitative agreement is obtained for the three-dimensional case. This suggests that the proposed approach is able to capture the main features of the flow to a certain extent and future investigations are required to obtain more accurate predictions of the flow.<br","aortic valve; valve kinematics; CFD; dynamic mesh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Solid and Fluid Mechanics","",""

An entirely battery powered submarine will be air independent, which will provide the submarine tactical advantages. The feasibility is investigated by the creation of a concept design and by performing an operational capability study. <br/><br/>Implementing an entirely battery powered submarine system into a submarine will have a large effect on the design of a submarine. The diesel-generators and all support systems will be removed. This will reduce the number of systems on board the submarine significantly. The space provided by the reduction of these systems can be used to increase the number of installed batteries. Furthermore, this will result in a reduction in the auxiliary load of approximately seven percent. The reduction in systems will also have multiple second order effects. The safety characteristics will improve; there will be less pressure hull penetrations and the risks of fire decrease. Furthermore, the crew size can be reduced with approximately 20\%. <br/>The usage of lithium-ion batteries will influence the battery system design and the safety characteristics of the battery pack. There are also several other systems which will be influenced by the implementation of the new power plant; the high pressure air system, the HVAC system and the electrical system. The design of an entirely battery powered naval submarine will be volume critical. Approximately the same amount of lead-ballast as a diesel-electric submarine will be required to reach a natural buoyant state. Stability is not a problem when all battery compartments are created low in the submarine design. <br/><br/>Independent local to medium range missions are feasible for an entirely battery powered submarine. For example, the created concept design has a displacement of 1905 tons and will be able to reach a range of 1940 nautical miles and has an endurance of 24 hours. This makes an entirely battery powered submarine an interesting option for navies who use their submarine for homeland defence missions. Independent missions with a long range and endurance are not feasible. The range and endurance of an entirely battery powered submarine is expected to be four to six times lower than the range of a diesel-electric submarine. Missions which require a longer range or endurance can be feasible when on sea charging is performed. <br/><br/>An entirely battery powered submarine has the advantage of an air independent propulsion, therefore the total range and endurance can be sailed without needing to surface. Compared with a diesel-electric submarine with an AIP system, the submerged endurance of an entirely battery powered submarine is 1.5 times higher. However, the total range and endurance of an entirely battery powered submarine will be three times as low. The long submerged endurance of an entirely battery powered design makes air quality control of great importance. Much attention must be paid to carbon dioxide absorption, oxygen production and other systems and materials which can influence the air quality.","Submarine; Lithium-ion; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-25","","","","","",""

From the existing literature it was found that one of possible reasons dogs have this problem is excessive dependence on the owner. Therefore the goal of this project was not only weakening the stressful condition of the animal, but also strengthen the bond between the dog and the owner and thus improve the quality of the dog’s life. To achieve this, the positive design approach is followed.<br/> <br/>During the exploration phase different studies were conducted to identify wishes, needs, expectations and concerns of the owners and their dogs in daily life and among separation in particular. The main objective of these studies was to understand why some dog-human relationships are more successful than others in order to determine how design can help to improve dog’s well-being and optimise the relationship with the owner.<br/> <br/>From the insights the aim evolved to create a new and meaningful ritual prior to separation. The intended consequence of the ritual is to achieve more predictable and secure interactions between the owner and the dog. Also it should help the owner to become more aware of the own caregiving strategy. Knowing this may help to identify the source of conflict, contributing their bond and having a positive effect on the dog when left alone.<br/> <br/>On the basis of this vision, a concept proposal is developed. The concept is an illustrated story which serves as a mediator to inspire dog owners to create toys from their worn clothes. The toy can be used for an active play with the dog before separation and, by virtue of its scent, will soothe the dog when left alone. <br/> <br/>Finally, the concept proposal is tested on its core assumptions. This helped to estimate the effect it will have on the potential users.","dog-human relationship; separation anxiety; storytelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Room temperature CTOD measurements were performed on both, where RB specimen showed an average CTOD of 0.12 mm and C-C specimen of 0.18 mm. This difference is believed to be caused by the unique stress free situation at the crack tip of the C-C specimen. <br/>By using digital image correlation (DIC) and optical microscopy, the most accurate approximation of the CTOD was determined by comparing extensometer data to optical measurements.

Conventional optical microscopic observations, XRF and XRD analyses, Methylene Blue tests on rock powder, Methylene Blue staining of thin-sections, and Loss-on-Ignition have been conducted as well as more advanced observations using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM).

The SEM combined with EDEX measurements allowed the visualization of grains in 2D in great detail along with determining chemical elements at the sub-grain scale. Combined results showed that the Thorn-sandstone consists of quartz grains along with some grains of hematite, rutile or ilmenite. Porosity (excluding fissures) is very low. The grains are tightly packed and surrounded by a very heterogeneous fine-grained brown material. This brown material consists of a mixture of minerals, possibly clays, chlorite , micas, weathered glauconite and feldspar as well as small grains of rutile, hematite or ilmenite.

This main <br/>research question of this report is: How can an extra<br/>shell of fabric improve the gallery flat, Bosboom-Toussaintplein<br/>in Delft, on both its comfort and its energy<br/>performance? A design is made using an extra fabric<br/>shell for the gallery flat.<br/>The methodology chosen for this project is ‘research<br/>by design’ system. This method is used to structure the<br/>research leading into the design. Normally research by<br/>design starts of by analyzing a real world problem. In<br/>this case it started of with a fascination, a fascination<br/>for fabric. This fascination led to the initial research<br/>on fabric, how fabric played its role in architecture,<br/>what fabric is, and what fabric can do. Later, due to<br/>the case study, fabric is combined with a double skin<br/>facade. The research question splits up in two main<br/>parts, the energy part and the comfort part. Both these<br/>parts determine what is needed from the extra layer.<br/>The main problems are stated, criteria are looked at,<br/>possible solutions come into play. This leads to a list of<br/>requirements. Once this list of requirements is finished,<br/>conceptual designs are made, and quickly tested on<br/>whether these design can pass these requirements.<br/>The first concept that meets the requirements is the<br/>‘full control’ concept. This concept is a roll that combined<br/>PVC sheets and PTFE open woven fabric. The<br/>idea is to create an extra frame as a new facade, but this<br/>frame could hold two types of cladding. Design parameters<br/>are defined, by using equations on air- and heat<br/>flow. The design ‘COAT4Housing’ starts to take shape.<br/>The design is evaluated using the list of requirements.<br/>Fabric offers great possibilities, it can shade the sun, it<br/>can take care of draft, it can reduce maintenance, it can<br/>create a comfortable space and above all I think it can<br/>improve the gallery flat, Bosboom-Toussaintplein in<br/>Delft, on both its comfort and its energy performance.<br/>Most requirements are met by the design. The full<br/>control it promises should be able to be realized. Yes,<br/>an extra shell of fabric, can improve the gallery flat,<br/>Bosboom-Toussaintplein in Delft, on both its comfort<br/>and its energy performance.","Fabric facade; sun shading; plastic facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flood protection and measures against subsidence are, therefore, of high importance to Jakarta’s government. One of the options they are studying is a great sea wall to regulate the water levels in Jakarta Bay. These projects have to be tested and should be build to withhold extreme water levels. In order to simulate these water levels one can use a hydrodynamic model or look at observations. In theory these could be combined by using data assimilation which should improve the hydrodynamic model in such a way that it predicts the results for both observed as unobserved locations quite good. One of the most used data assimilation methods is the Ensemble Kalman Filter, which will be applied to an hydrodynamic model on the Java Sea. The model is simulated using Delft3D-FM and performs quite well as its results are in good correspondence with the observations. On this model data assimilation will than be applied, by making use of OpenDA, in order to further improve the model. With this set-up various twin-experiments will be performed to test the data assimilation method; some experiments with real observations will also be performed to test if it the set-up applicable in real projects. The experiments with real observations perform on the same level as the twin-experiments; the observations thus seem to be suitable for using in real projects. Unfortunately, the twin-experiment does not perform well; the assimilation worsens the results of the hydrodynamic model in both observed, as unobserved locations. In the assimilation process only one component, the localization, seems to performing quite well. This performance can not be studied fully, because the twin-experiments do not give correct results. It will be shown that future work is needed to research the various problems encountered, and that at the time of writing the assimilation with OpenDA does not improve the Delft3D-FM model on the Java Sea.","Data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; EnKF; Hydrodynamics; Java Sea; Jakarta; OpenDA; Delft3D-FM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

The project is located in the district Beato located near the harbor north of the center of the city. This project is closely related to the studio of Heritage &amp; architecture as it is not only worth keeping, but can and needs to be used to improve the quality of the neighborhood. With this project we find a new use and purpose for the unused site and near urban surroundings. We analyze the area and use this knowledge to create a funded design that shows the quality of the existing and the future. This project is a socially relevant project as it is being redeveloped at this moment by the municipality of Lisbon. A MODERN MANUFACTURING COMPLEX The manufacturing complex is the name for the new purpose of the project. The complex consists out of an upper floor zone with semi-private functions like creative workspaces, schools, conference rooms, hotel, craft brewery and winery. The ground floor is a public area with public spaces, craft shops and a museum. The area can be used by local inhabitants, young skilled entrepreneurs and eventually tourists. The site has zones where the different target groups can conduct their daily activities. The upper part will offer contemporary housing for new users. THE MEETING SPOT The focus of the design is in and around the old warehouse. This area is a meeting spot where all users and target groups can come together and enjoy and experience the qualities of the complex. This area is focused on recreational and cultural activities like a market square, exposition spaces, a food hall, tasting rooms, sport center and activity center. This area is the main entrance of the enclosed complex. This results in a design that is the mediator between the outside world and the manufacturing complex. MATCH The old warehouse has a new public use. This building located in the meeting spot is an old building with a new purpose where the old can be seen, touched and experienced. The focus of the building design is on the relation with the surroundings, the strength of the building characteristics and the relation between old and new. THEMES The project has focused on the problem statement translated into the research question ‘How can an enclosed industrial area work together with the urban surroundings as a tool to become reconnected that will serve as an incubator for future developments?’ With the help of themes the project uses the existing to create a new purpose without losing the values and character of the site. The themes are input for the design strategy and concept. The following themes related to the heritage studio are determined. The main theme ‘unite‘ is overarching social related. Bringing together different target group by promoting social cohesion on site. A new purpose is needed for the complex, but this might have negative consequences like gentrification.","Lisbon; Portugal; Military; Manutencao militar; disclosing; Beato; Match; Manufacturing; meeting spot; meeting; cultural value; technology; Heritage; architecture; heritage & architecture; social cohesion; brewery; foodhall; mixed use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Disclosing the military city Lisbon","38.73041979074967, -9.10740852355957"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In recent years the world is becoming more aware on the burden of the fossil fuels on the planets ecosystem as well as climate. One of the major reasons is, due to greenhouse gasses in which most of them are caused by carbon release by consumption of fossil fuels. The building sector in almost every country is a major contributor to the consumption of carbon-based fuels either for space conditioning, water heating or for electricity.<br/><br/>Operational energy in buildings must be lowered by bold measures to a point or the building should generate as equal as renewable energy as they consume. However it is not realistic to match the consumed energy if the building does not go through an energy refurbishment to reduce operational energy consumption. Refurbishment of ill performing building gives an advantage on not only reducing the operational energy consumption but also user comfort could be increased in the building.<br/><br/>Refurbishment in the report is integrated with the SUI project, which aims to create zero energy neighborhoods in Ramplaankwartier, Haarlem. The building to be refurbished is selected accordingly f and natural gas usage is aimed to be eliminated while annual energy balance is sustained in the building.<br/><br/>The report starts with a thorough literature research on four different topics. First of the topics is zero energy building definitions globally defined along with most commonly used zero energy building definitions in the Netherlands to highlight the important aspects in defining a zero energy design approach. Second topic is refurbishment strategies for the building envelope regarding different applications and scales are checked to determine viable options.<br/><br/>Third one is the regulations for refurbishment applications, necessary thermal performance values in the refurbishment buildings and the necessary comfort conditions in the buildings. Lastly the final topic is a to check refurbishment examples on row-houses in the Netherlands to highlight possible measures of refurbishments, their application and detailing, impact on residents and consumed energy reduction.<br/><br/>Case study design is based on achieving annual zero energy balance in case study building. Application of refurbishment strategies for the building envelope is divided into two for increasing the varieties of measures later on these measures are given detail on how they could be executed in real life.<br/>The case study measures aim to influence the building envelope composition such as Insulation levels, glazing thermal performance with passive solar gain and the infiltration rate of the building skin. Comfort in primary spaces will be tinkered to achieve necessary user comfort requirements in dwellings, while ventilation system is determined along with comfort provision in space.<br/><br/>After comfort measures are applied, building services will be evaluated to systems will be switched to full electricity to eliminate natural gas usage for space heating and domestic heated water. With the lowered energy consumption, energy generation on site will be utilized to create annual balance for the building to achieve zero energy building criteria’s.<br/><br/>Eventually all the refurbishment and energy generation measures will be applied to neighboring buildings to evaluate the advantages of application of energy generation in combination with the other refurbished buildings rather than individual generation. Effects of individual and group application of energy generation measures will be compared to determine advantages of each approach.<br/><br/>It is possible to use different measures for energy refurbishment to reduce space and heating energy and possibly energy on lighting itself. Usage of higher insulation values, better glazing, lower infiltration is always an option in building refurbishments however it all comes to the application of the theoretical measures accepted through calibration and the execution of these accepted measures is important to deliver accurate conditions in the refurbished buildings.<br/><br/>Different energy generation methods can be applied besides PV panels. Integration of wind energy for electrical building systems can be interesting. Totally integrated building services and on-site generation system with wood pellets and boiler system for individual or larger scale to provide zero energy balance for a group of buildings in a constant period of time. Energy storage for photovoltaic options could be used to eliminate seasonal energy mismatch for operational energy in a large scale for the neighborhood or for individual purposes with batteries.","Zero; Energy; Refurbishment; Indoor; Comfort; renewable; row; house","en","master thesis","","","","","","Refurbishment building is provided by Smart Urban Isles Research Project on going in TUDelft","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","52.383739, 4.606274"

The first part was constructed in 1909 and was the largest reinforced concrete structure of Europe at the time. Over the years the Maassilo has been expanded multiple time. During the 80’s the industry of the Rotterdam started moving towards the Botlek and the Tweede Maasvlakte. The company of the Maassilo moved away as well. The Maassilo remained functioning as an additional grain storage but the grain wasn’t any longer being processed at the building. At July 31st 2003 Ontwikkelingsbedrijf Rotterdam (OBR) became owner of the building and the building stopped functioning as a grain storage. The company planned on demolishing the building and redevelop the location. However due to expensive demolishing costs, the cultural historic value and the potential monumental status OBR changed its plans. The spaces of the Maassilo were rented out. The first tenant of the new owner was night club NOW&amp;WOW. After a shooting incident the night club was closed, but the Maassilo went on as a event location named factory 010. In 2008 the Creative factory moved into the former factory part of the building providing office spaces for start-ups. Until now the building has been partly redeveloped. During the redevelopments some of the beautiful characteristics of the building have been destroyed and a coherent solution hasn’t been found. The main question is what to do with the structures of the silos which form 60 - 70% of the building.

In order to answer this question, the goal of the project was to make such a therapist ourselves. <br/><br/>The first two weeks of the project were spent doing research. We looked into cognitive behavioural therapy and existing eHealth solutions for people with sleeping disorders. We also conducted research into existing chat bots, platforms and languages. At the end of the research phase we concluded that machine learning was the best way to make the agent smart. <br/><br/>During the design phase we stumbled upon the fact that we could not get access to a corpus of conversations between therapists and patients discussing sleep problems. This meant that we could not use machine learning on this corpus, which greatly influenced how smart the agent was going to be. We had to rethink our design choices concerning the artificial intelligence and decided to use a different platform. The personalized artificial intelligence was incorporated in our web application, which communicates with the code via our server. <br/><br/>The testing of the product is based on unit tests, where all modules and functions are tested individually after every new addition. The user interface was tested by setting up use cases. User tests on the final product were also performed. This gave us insight in how people with no knowledge about the system would interact with the system.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this project was to explore the possibilities and limitations for creating a virtual therapy that treats insomnia. Even though the solution we created cannot yet be used as a standalone therapy, it shows a promising glimpse of the many possibilities to conduct virtual therapy.

The application of landscape infrastructure is based on the concept of integrating natural and human habitats through biophysical forces to form an operative landscape structure. It is implemented through-scale under the guidance of two fundamental design principles, ground level adjustment and water level management. The overall operative structure consists of the prepared ground of the territory and a robust ecological backbone. It helps the territory to pick up the lost natural dynamics and habitat diversity, as well as to guide the cultural development in an ecological-based, multifunctional and adaptive way. The notion of landscape infrastructure and its application transform the original landscapes in Flevopolders into an interwoven landscape that contains diverse and flexible interconnected spaces. It becomes the new framework that guides the future development of the territory, and reveals the optimal characteristics of a delta area.","Landscape infrastructure; Habitat; Multifunctionality; Interwoven landscape framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","European postgraduate master","",""

In addition, multiple entrance layouts are applied. Currently, guidelines are missing for the design of inland port entrances along flowing waters with flow velocities larger than 0.5 m/s. A more generic insight into the minimum required nautical safe entrance width and most efficient entrance layout can reduce the design costs and time. The objective of this research was to find the minimum required nautical safe entrance width for generic situations for inland ports along flowing waters in non-tidal areas. To find this minimum safe entrance width, the most efficient entrance layout was determined. The influence of different design parameters was studied to provide the most efficient situation. Moreover, an insight into the influence of these parameters was needed to determine the effect on the most efficient situation when changing these parameters. A fast-time simulation study was chosen to analyse the influence of different design parameters on the entrance width. A rectangular entrance layout and a mathematical ship model comparable with a loaded CEMT class Va ship were used. Flow velocities between 1.0 and 2.5 m/s were taken into account. Moreover, the influence of the waterway width, entrance width, length and angle were analysed with the simulation study. The fast-time simulation program SHIPMA was used to perform the simulation study. As a result of the simulation study, it was found that the most efficient entrance angle is 120 degrees. Note that this is an entrance orientation in downstream direction. Also from a viewpoint of minimising siltation, this angle is more favourable than an angle of 90 degrees or smaller. The required entrance widths for arrivals sailing upstream and manoeuvring forward into the port are circa 55 and 80 meters, for flow velocities of respectively 1.0 and 2.5 m/s. For the determined most efficient layout, the forward manoeuvres into the port when sailing downstream were replaced by backward manoeuvres. For these backward manoeuvres the required entrance widths are circa 70 and 90 meters, for flow velocities of respectively 1.0 and 2.0 m/s. A linear relation was observed between the flow velocity and the required entrance width. For the most efficient entrance layout, it was found that the sensitivity of the entrance length, width and angle was small. These results are only valid for an available waterway width larger than 90 meters. For smaller waterway widths additional research is required. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the limitations of the SHIPMA model also apply for the acquired research results. The most important limitation is that human interference was not included in this research. Besides, only a limited amount of design parameters was included in the simulation study. Additional research is required to study the influence of other design parameters on the required entrance width.","Inland port; Port entrance width; Port entrance layout; SHIPMA; Ship manoeuvring simulation study; Port entrance optimisation; Inland shipping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One major way in which this is being achieved is through the Marker Wadden, designed as a wetland area featuring a combination of islands, marsh-pond areas, mud flats, and sheltered shores which will serve as bird and wildlife spawning area. One of the primary innovations within the Marker Wadden project is the utilization of locally dredged material to form many of the wetland areas. This dredged material −often referred to as mud− is characterized as a soft, cohesive, fine-grained soil material with a mixed sediment composition of clay, silt, fine sand, organic material, water, and often gas (Winterwerp and van Kesteren, 2004). This material has a lot of inherent uncertainties in regards to its behavior and use in construction, stemming from its general non-homogeneity and less predictable/studied behavior. When considering the use of this material to construct areas with specifically designated elevation and strength ranges, the additional strength and settlement effects due to desiccation and crust formation once the material surface has been exposed to atmospheric conditions must be carefully considered. The assessment of this process includes the outlining of a conceptual model emphasizing two distinct stages of desiccation, lab testing to define material behavior during this phase, large-scale testing, and finally an evaluation of an existing numerical model for this process. The conceptual model was then compared and validated in part through both physical, in-situ measurements from a large-scale test setup, as well as to a numerical model developed at Delft University of Technology and further adapted for this process. In addition, the numerical model was utilized as a prediction tool for the Marker Wadden, under various atmospheric conditions and surface water conditions. These effects were evaluated in terms of water content, void ratio, settlement, and strength.<br/><br/>The large-scale test setups −representing three varying degrees of atmospheric conditions and surface water conditions− exhibited similar trends in both the in-situ measurements and modelled results, with increasing levels of active surface water removal and precipitation minimization correlating to increased void ratio profile reduction −and therefore increased desiccation and drying− especially at the surface. However, due to the short-term nature of the large-scale testing, none of the large-scale tests ever reached the second stage of desiccation, and it can be concluded that in the initial stage of desiccation, minimal shear strength development will occur in the surface material. Modelling of variations in surface water conditions show that active removal of surface water promotes faster progression into the second stage of drying, and therefore faster initial development of shear strength. Other significant findings include the long-term stabilization in terms of total additional settlement, and that neither short-term re-submergence of the material surface nor initial seasonal start date will hinder this long-term settlement stabilization. Furthermore, the reality of the large-scale test material, including the presence of increased sand content layers, also highlights the importance of assessing the profile material variation, as deviation between the various in-situ measurement profiles and modelled “uniform” profile results show a high deviation. Modelling of this process is limited to the selection of the proper material input values utilized for the complete profile. During this modelling process, it was determined that the special consideration should be given to how the soil water retention properties are obtained, as well as the hydraulic conductivity relation and values utilized, as small deviations in these inputs impact the model significantly in comparison to other inputs.","desiccation; crust; cohesive soil; Marker Wadden; consolidation; dredged material; mud; drying; atmospheric conditions; surface water; drying model; evaporation; precipitation; soil water retention curve; SWRC; shrinkage; dewatering; fine soil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-20","","","","","",""

Here, we see a rapid development of logistics infrastructure and one of the key project is the utilization of Cikarang-Bekasi-Laut (CBL) canal as inland waterway. Due to its topographical condition and soil type, the surrounding area of CBL has high poten¬tial for agriculture. Moreover, mangrove forest located in the north coastal area protects land from abrasion as well as a home for biodiversity. Those potentials are also contributed by rivers crossing over this territory, including CBL Canal. The transformation of CBL canal from flood¬way system into an inland waterway that connects Jakarta Port and the Cikarang industrial area has a strong prospective to trigger urban sprawl from Jakarta and industrial investment along the canal. At the same time this development threatens the landscape diversity and the identity of today’s territory.

Taking one of the most illustrative river basin, Dajia River, the steepest river with the most water resource, as the study case, the project intends to test the hypothesis of perceiving mountainous river as opportunities for transforming the river valley as water-sensitive landscape infrastructures. Based on the theories of landscape urbanism, especially the discourses of landscape infrastructure, the project argues that by enhancing water sensitivity in living environment within river scape, the characteristic of landscape can help building a stronger identity for the territory and its inhabitants. Contextualizing the learnings from theories and practices with context analysis, the research integrates principles, strategic tools and spatial potentials at the regional scale, proposing operative landscape structures as the spatial framework for the future development of the river valley. Based on this spatial framework, strategies for transformation are introduced for upstream, midstream and downstream areas according to their respective situations. Then two zoom-in sites, one at the upstream and the other at the downstream areas, are selected to demonstrate possibilities and potentials through design intervention for integrating water infrastructure with spaces of local habitation and activities. To support the proposals with better feasibility, the project phasing and institutional framework will also be proposed, identifying the priority and potential actors in the process. With reflections on the contribution to the fields, suggestion to the current planning system, and evaluation of mutual influences between different sites within the river catchment, the thesis expects to provide a showcase with methodology, strategic tools, and spatial possibilities integrating different cases of interaction between human activities and river environment. More importantly, the project exhibits the spatial potential of a mountainous river landscape as an active role in engaging socioeconomic with nature, as well as guiding the spatial transformation of the territory for the future.","landscape infrastructure; river landscape; river basin integrated plan; water management; landscape urbanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

The method is based on the tools of scenario construction, transect analysis and urban section, and is tested in the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Region (MRDH). The goal of the method is to enable the urbanist to participate as a forerunner in the interdisciplinary discussion on the development of this novel technology.<br/><br/>Despite the potentially important positive and negative effects of automated vehicles on mobility and human life in general, their spatial represent a research gap which must be addressed by urbanism. In order to do so, the profession must have a specific aim and method. The identified aim is urban liveability, which is defined in the project as a combination of three criteria, performance and impact of mobility, natural and built environment, and society and economy, both in regional and local scales. In building a method to work with AV, the project resorts to two specific instruments of urbanism: foresight (scenario) and through-sight (transect and section). The method was designed in the following way: first, two main driving forces of spatial change were extracted from the available literature on AV, density and separation of flows. Secondly, the territory of the MRDH was analysed through the prism of these drivers using the transect method. The transect was applied to the most intense metropolitan axis between the two urban cores Rotterdam and The Hague. On this axis, data regarding urban subzones, network accessibility and liveability data were superimposed to understand the connections between urban fabric, mobility and liveability on which the scenarios would be built. Further, three critical points in different settings were chosen for case studies: an urban centre, a residential area and an urban edge with motorway links. <br/>The main step of the method is scenario construction. Using the driving forces of density and separation of flows, and based on hypotheses available in literature regarding AV and the evolution of the region, four extreme scenarios were described: Clockwork Utopia, characterised by concentrated urbanity and AV separated from other flows; Shared Patchwork, characterised by concentrated urbanity and AV leading to merger of flows; Efficient Garden Region, characterised by dispersed urbanisation and separated flows; and Infinite Randstad, characterised by dispersed urbanisation and merged traffic flows. The scenarios were inspired by various theoretical models, visionary and realised projects. In the second stage of scenario construction, Clockwork Utopia (S1) and Infinite Randstad (S4) were further developed. For both scenarios, regional models of networks and urban fields were designed, and the three case study locations were analysed using the urban section. For each of the case studies a package of briefs, for urbanism, architecture and society, were proposed based on the liveability analysis, and the specific context of the scenario. The solutions in the section have a research-by-design character, used to test the reciprocal resistances of the urban space and the AV technology which need to be overcome.<br/><br/>Finally, the scenarios were evaluated using the liveability criteria and future directions of research, design and policy were proposed. Overall, S1 could be described as an extreme evolution of current trends, where AV has a propelling role, while S4 is a radical change, with AV as trigger, creating new urban occupation patterns and lifestyles. Further attention needs to be accorded to the research of AV safely sharing the urban ground with pedestrians and cyclist, impacts on urban sprawl, connected energy systems and territorial coverage, to design spaces for socio-economic encounter and new architectural programs incorporating AV, as well as to policies regarding traffic management, active mobility and tackling economic disruptions.<br/><br/>This thesis aimed not necessarily to give answers to all of these questions, but to open windows for the urbanist to imagine the future of the relationship between city and AV technology starting from liveability. A future not for a driverless, but a self-driven city.","Automated vehicles; liveability; mobility; scenario; transect; research by design; MRDH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Master in Urbanism (EMU)","",""

(mentor)","2017","A new flood risk approach for design and testing of primary and secondary flood defence structures in the Netherlands relies on the probability of loss of the water retaining capacity. Determining this probability for levees requires a better understanding of consequences of extreme conditions leading to failure, starting with a study of soil. In breaching of levees high flow velocities occur. Conventional erosion models for non-cohesive sediments cannot handle this adequately and therefore overestimate erosion rates. Due to these high flow velocities and corresponding high shear stresses soils do no longer erode due to the pick-up of individual particles but fail as entire layers. Therefore in this report first a new process based erosion equation for dilatant material under the influence of high flow velocities is under development based on findings from the scientific field of Dredging Engineering. The soil can therefore be described as a saturated porous medium with a specified angle of internal friction and cohesion. Further the soil is assumed to be dilative, which means that over the depth of failure, soil particles need to dilate in order to be sheared off. The equation is then applied to a steady state situation at which no further erosions takes place in the case of jet flow applied to soil. Research over the last decade identified three key factors affecting erodibility, namely material texture, compaction moisture content and compaction energy. The importance of these factors is well known by now, however they are not integrated into erosion models so far. This study aims to provide thoughts in the erodibility of sand under the influence of water infiltration by means of experiments performed at the laboratory of fluid mechanics at the Delft University of Technology. Infiltration is generated by introducing a head difference between the top and the bottom of the sand layer. The soil is thereby kept fully saturated. A water tank set-up with a double bottom was created to be able to apply a water pressure at the bottom of a well-defined sand layer. With a tube connected to the double bottom of the tank the water pressure and the associated infiltration rate was regulated. The water head on top of the sand layer was thereby kept constant. Determining the erodibility of the soil was done with a submerged jet erosion test (JET). Therefore an impinging jet with known constant velocity was directed perpendicular to the sand surface and created a scour hole. The scour depth development was recorded over time and later processed into data sheets. This was repeated for several different infiltration settings. From the erosion rates first effects of water infiltration were detected. Based on two different analytical methods, the Blaisdell Solution and the Scour Depth Method the critical shear stress τc and the erodibility coefficient kd were determined. Results of the two methods differ significantly by order of magnitude which is why in the analysis for this research both solutions were used and compared with each other. With the scour depth recordings erosion rates were determined for the different water infiltration rates, showing than with increasing infiltration velocity the maximum scour depth decreased. Evaluation of the critical shear stress and the erodibility coefficient showed an inverse relationship between each other where τc increased and kd decreased with increasing infiltration rates. An explicit mathematical relationship between the critical shear stress and the water infiltration velocity could not be determined with sufficient certainty based on the limited data set. The validity of the two most common analytical methods to determine erodibility have been questioned since both provide non zero critical shear stress values whereas the stability of the scour hole could be explained from a continuum geotechnical model under the normal stresses and shear stresses applied on the stable wall of the scour hole.","Erosion; erodibility; critical shear stress; infiltration; non-cohesive; hig flow velocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Deze invloedslijnen zijn getoetst aan de hand van oplossingen van Guyon &amp; Massonnet en Pucher. Er is een breed inzetbaar, snel en betrouwbare ingenieurstool gemaakt waarmee het gedrag van platen wordt benaderd en invloedslijnen kunnen worden bepaald. Het basismodel voldoet aan alle toetsen, echter ontstaan er fouten rond de randen in de oplossingen voor buigmomenten en dwarskracht door de modellering volgens het balkjesmodel. Het model voor invloedslijnen voldoet aan de meeste toetsen. Alleen bij de dwarskrachten zit er een fout in de oplossing, waardoor deze een factor twee tot vier afwijkt van de oplossing van Pucher. Doordat de plaat als een balkjesmodel wordt benaderd, ontstaat er een grillig effect dat voor fouten in de vergelijking met het plaatmodel zorgt. Dit effect kan nog beter bekeken worden om inzicht te krijgen in hoe het balkjesmodel de plaat het beste kan benaderen. Ook zal onderzocht moeten worden hoe het model het daadwerkelijk gedrag rond de belasting het beste kan benaderen. Er ontstaan in dit punt nu nog grote pieken, die afhankelijk zijn van de detaillering van het model. Als deze punten goed zijn uitgewerkt kan dit model worden gebruikt als basis voor een programma met een makkelijke interface waarmee studenten en/of ingenieurs in de dagelijkse praktijk snel inzicht kunnen krijgen in het gedrag van platen.","Invloedslijnen; platen; constructiemechanica; balkjesmodel; ingenieurstool","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

After graduation I also worked as an architect in large architectural bureau which is specialized in design and construction of healthcare and resort facilities. Healthcare architectural typology is one of the most complicated ones because it deals with great number of technical and technological issues, which dictate the final spatial and design solutions in many ways. Moreover, technical regulations and demands in this type of buildings are one of the strictest ones based on the core functions and nature of the process. To find a rational balance between technology and architectural aesthetics in healthcare is a great challenge for architect.<br/><br/> In 2013 I started my MSc Architecture program in Politecnico di Milano in order to extend my architectural vision and to get European experience and understanding of the profession of architect. Because of the fact that I already had experience in the healthcare sector at that time, I chose the topic of healthcare as my graduation subject in Milan. There is a special department in Politecnico di Milano dedicated to design problems of healthcare facilities. The head of the department, professor Stefano Capolongo, was my supervisor of the graduation project which was dedicated to modular and prefabricated solutions in healthcare design. The main focus of my thesis was to design spatial solutions for general hospital where all functions and departments can be arranged into modular and prefab scheme by using the same span of the structural grid. Questions of modularity, transportability of the modules to the construction site, universality of the layout which allows to put different functions within the same module were the main ones in my research. In order to test my hypothesis and findings I designed renovation project for the real general hospital in one of the Russian provincial cities. The idea behind this step was to test possibility to extend existing healthcare facilities in a modular and prefabricated way which allows to minimize interruptions in the daily activities of the hospital while being under renovation, reduces time schedule for the renovation project in construction phase and increases the quality of the complete work based on in-factory production and assembly process. <br/><br/> The focus of my Milan project was mainly on spatial and technological aspects of modular healthcare design. Since I am particularly interested in medical design and construction sector, as I already mentioned, I decided to continue my research in this field while working on my graduation project in TU Delft on Management In the Built Environment Master program in order to understand the entire process of modular construction not only from architectural, but also from managerial, technological, logistic and financial points of view. The main question of this research is whether modular solutions in hospital construction more economically feasible than traditional on-site construction methods, considering the entire life cycle process of the hospital building? By answering this question, I will understand and evaluate financial, managerial and logistical aspects of hospital construction, which will give me the complete picture of effectiveness of modular construction in hospitals. <br/><br/> I would like to say thank you to my mentors, Peter de Jong and Ruben Vrijhoef, who supported me along this year and organized a number of interviews with the set of experts who helped me to get the picture of processes in modular construction. Special appreciation to all experts and specialists, who kindly agreed to meet and answer to my questions. All their interviews can be found in appendixes of this report. Special thank you to my family who supports me in my career and helps me to get the things I am working on.","modular construction; prefabrication; healthcare design; feasibility; modularity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, a transfer standard is needed to check the reliability of measurement setups in test laboratories worldwide. This project aims of designing a transfer standard featured with similar electrical behavior as SSL devices. Key features of the transfer standard are rapid stabilization and switchable configuration to simulate typical SSL topologies. The transfer standard has been designed into two types of device: the first type is a power electronics converter using a constant-power controller, and the second type is a dummy load device simulating the voltage and current waveforms of SSL products. It has been proved that two types of transfer standards can both minimize the fluctuations and uncertainties in measurement, so they can serve as power reference to check the reliability of measurement setups in test laboratories.","electrical reference; uncertainty analysis; Solid-State Lighting (SSL)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Companies and governments use information technology standards to conduct data exchange, the concept being called Business to Government (B2G) data exchange. Companies use these standards to report their financial and business data to the government and governments collect these data for regulatory purposes. This research analyses two such competing data standards EDIFACT and XBRL in the context of B2G data exchange in India. Both the standards have their own set of supporters (regulators and firms) due to which it is uncertain which standard will become the dominant standard in future. Therefore, it is important for standard supporters to identify and leverage factors that could increase the likelihood of dominance of these standards. This is because, implementation of such data standards firstly requires major changes to be made to the existing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures. Secondly, such decisions are costly and difficult to reverse.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the factors that play a major role in the battle for dominance in the field of B2G data exchange between EDIFACT and XBRL in India. Five phases were described in this research that the standards go through in their lifecycle when battling for dominance. These phases were designed using the framework of Suarez 2004 as a foundation [1]. To analyze the battle and identify the factors in a structured manner, this research was conducted in 3 main steps. Firstly, factors that were relevant in each phase for the battle between XBRL and EDIFACT were identified via an extensive literature search. This has resulted in a comprehensive list of 21 factors. The second step was primary data collection to identify the most important factors that are crucial to XBRL and EDIFACT with the help of a questionnaire. 9 experts in the field of data exchange standards answered the questionnaire. Data collection and data analysis were done using a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method called the Best Worst Method. The third step was to calculate weights and establish importance of these factors for EDIFACT and XBRL using BWM. In conclusion, 12 factors are identified to be very crucial in the battle for dominance between EDIFACT and XBRL in B2G data exchange in India. These are Availability of a more general standard and Collaborations in phase 1, technical Capabilities and diversity of network in phase 2, regulatory support, awareness of the standard, and, implementation costs and time in phase 3, infrastructure dependency, switching costs, trial-ability and observe-ability, intermediaries and Bandwagon effects in phase 4, and, the factor innovation capabilities in phase 5. Based on the progress that the standards have made till date, and the results of BWM, XBRL has better chances of becoming dominant in future.<br/><br/>The results of this research have significant contributions in research and practical applications of standard battles. This research bridges the gap that exists in the literature between two different aspects of standard dominance – Phases – which look at the evolutionary aspects of standards over time and, Factors – which<br/>consider a single point of time at which factors affect dominance of a standard. By combining these two perspectives, this research provides a way to not only analyse standard dominance battles in a phase-wise approach, but also to identify factors that can play a crucial role in increasing the likelihood of standard dominance in each phase of lifecycle of the battle. By doing so, one could establish chances for dominance of a standard in future, by analyzing historical progress of the standard.<br/><br/>This research also has practical implications for standard supporters and managers of firms who are willing to implement these standards in India. Standard supporters can strengthen their efforts in the direction of the factors identified in this research to promote the adoption of the standard they support.<br/>Managers of firms can also benefit from this research as it would help them make informed decisions about choosing the standard suitable for their organization. For example, they can see where their firms stand with regards to the factors identified in this research to improve their chances of successfully implementing their standard of interest by leveraging these factors. This is important because, with new innovations evolving rapidly in the field of ICT, implementation of ICT standards is no more seen as a tool for achieving business objectives, but has become a strategic choice and a part of the overall business strategy of the companies.<br/><br/>Future recommendations of this research include expanding the scope to analyze this battle in the field of B2B (business to business) data exchange. Another interesting area to study in future would be to explore the fragmentation of data exchange standards in the B2B and B2G sectors.","technology battles; data exchange; Business-to-government; data standards; EDIFACT; XBRL; XML; ICT; Best Worst Method; Business reporting; Electronic Data Interchanage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","","20.5937, 78.9629"

On every layer, you have a lot of possibilities and options to choose from. Also, a decision made on the one layer, can influence the other. For two or three layers that is not hard to understand and oversee, but it can hit complexity very fast. The Blockmaker software helps to choose from the options on every layer by offering direct feedback for every choice. It analyzes and evaluates every option by qualitative criteria you can set yourself. For our individual work, we use the Blockmaker to design a housing block, but we add an extra ‘filter’: a theme linked to a future scenario. In my case that is water: the Hydroblock. It stores energy by making use of the potential energy of water at a certain height, it contains a water treatment system, a shading system based on water flows and waterfalls are running down through the whole block.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","The Why Factory",""

The construction industry is very fragmented and there are a lot of different information and material processes, therefore it is difficult for a main contractor to get control of these all. It is assumed that if the main contractor gets control of the logistics, the logistics will become more efficient. One of the ways to get control is with BIM. Building Information Modelling combines the data of all stakeholders in one model and can help to streamline the logistics. The goal of this research is to show contractors how they can get change their traditional processes into a supply chain that is managed with BIM and get control of their logistics.<br/><br/>The research design that was selected is that of a single-case study. The case that is selected is project Bètatoren, a medium-sized construction project that is built by Waal. This research focusses on Waal, but includes also other parties. Two subcontractors and two suppliers of project Bètatoren have been selected, in order to research the whole supply chain. Also, experts from other construction companies are involved for the validation of this research. <br/><br/>Case study research shows that currently the logistic information and BIM are disconnected. The logistic information is send from the subcontractors and suppliers to the main contractor and back, but this happens mainly in 2D. This is partly due to the fact that there is a mismatch between the information processes and the production processes. As a result, information is missing in the BIM-model. This information should be completed, but that does not happen. No one takes responsibility and therefore the current information processes are fragmented and uncoordinated. The main contractor controls the process but does not coordinate the information, neither does anyone else. <br/><br/>Based upon a literature study and case study research several steps have been defined which the main contractor must take in order to manage the logistics with BIM. First, the main contractor must take the responsibility and control the changes in the process. He must actively lead the supply chain and demand collaborative behavior from the subcontractors and suppliers. Secondly, the main contractor must make sure that the information processes and BIM are connected, and that the logistic information is incorporated in both. This includes, inter alia, linking the planning to the BIM-model. Thirdly, the main contractor must make sure that the BIM-model aligns with the logistics on the construction site. <br/><br/>The information flows and the BIM-structure should be connected to make supply chain management with BIM feasible. According to the research, the process of changing a traditional supply chain into a supply chain management with BIM is both financially, organizationally and socially feasible for the main contractor. Concluding, if the main contractor takes control, actively coordinates and structures the information flow and focusses on connecting the logistic information and BIM, he can get control of the logistics.<br","Supply Chain Management; BIM; Construction Logistics; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

This demand, combined with the increase in complexity of new land-based mining operations increases the chances for a viable offshore mining business case. Goal and scope - The aim of this research is twofold. The first aim is to fill knowledge gaps in the offshore mining value chain, with a focus on the processing of the mined material. The second goal is to assess if shallow water offshore mining is a viable business option. Explicitly left out of scope are the exploration for mineral deposits as well as the detailed or new design of an extraction method for subsea minerals. Furthermore, resources beyond the continental plate are not part of this research. Approach - To answer the first goal of this research, an extensive literature study is performed comprising an assessment of potential offshore mineable minerals and their respective markets. It also included an analysis of current land-based mineral processing techniques and its limitations in an offshore environment. Furthermore environmental, legislative and tax aspects were included as well as detailed descriptions of future offshore mining projects, and current dredge mining projects. To assess the viability of an offshore mining project, a case study is set-up of a prospective offshore mining project. A method for executing the case study is developed. Results of the case study - For the case study the mineral deposit has been studied and based on its mineral characteristics a location specific processing flow sheet is developed. The case study resulted in a set of execution alternatives, from which a preferred option was selected. Based on this option the viability of the project is assessed with the use of a discounted cash flow method (DCF-method). Conclusions - Main knowledge gaps are identified as the impact on the environment, and the lack of legislation regarding offshore mining. Furthermore, it should be noted, that the public opinion regarding offshore mining is important to consider as well.","Offshore mining; Mineral processing; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","This project was done in cooperation with Van Oord Dredging and Marine contractors, therefore any company specific information is not taken into account in this public report.","","","","","","","",""

Hence they have increased reliability and lower complexity when compared to conventional actuators used for same purposes. Mobile components also contribute to increased vibrations, noise, loss of energy and they require lubrication. Non-thermal plasma actuators are highly efficient as they directly convert electrical into kinetic energy without use of any mechanical parts. Lack of mobile components in plasma actuators contribute to lower mass, meaning lower cost of spacecrafts. Another benefit related to use of these actuators is their short response time, which increases dynamical and control abilities of complete spacecraft. All the benefits just stated make this technology potentially very interesting for space-based applications. Presented thesis represents feasibility study, a first step required for application of plasma actuator on a spacecraft.<br/><br/>This research examined two objectives. First was to study the effect of an altitude on momentum exchange between high velocity external flow and created ionic wind. Second objective was to investigate and design DBD plasma actuator able to withstand orbital thermal loads. This study consists of literature research on two most common plasma actuators; various aspects of launch, orbit and re-entry of spacecrafts; and two analytical models. First model aims in estimating the influence of an altitude on the actuator force creation, which can be used for shock stand-off distance modification, and thus steering applications. Other model aims in estimating actuator thermal loads occurring due to spacecraft orbit in Low Earth Orbit. Results show that altitude has large effect on actuator force production. Analytical model shows an average reduction of 4.51 or 4.44 times per 10 km, depending on actuator’s orientation with respect to external flow. Difficulties relating high velocity flow fields such as molecular dissociation and very high friction heat loads are presented. Results show that DBD actuator system can produced significant perturbations between spacecraft surface and natural shockwave. Made perturbations are in form of a compression wave that interacts with natural shock wave and creates a dis-balance of forces proficient for spacecraft reentry steering. Second analytical model shows that there exist actuator materials which can withstand thermal loads due to spacecraft orbital Sun exposure. This thesis shows a promising first order results needed to qualify and apply DBD actuator on spacecraft. However much research on optimization and design are still required.","DBD; Plasma actuators; Space-based; High Mach number; Low pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In aircraft maintenance, the initial maintenance schedule of an aircraft is highly dependent on the maintenance planning document. This document, set up by manufacturers, regulators and operators, contains all the requirements for the initial maintenance schedule of a specific aircraft. It serves as a reference for the development of an optimised maintenance schedule by the operator. The initial workload distributions obtained by using the task data in this document, show a high and irregular fluctuation along the operational life of the aircraft. After the application of common task packaging methods, the operator can improve the initial maintenance schedule, but workload fluctuations often persist after these measures. This fluctuation is considered to be unfavourable because of several reasons; maintenance resources are used inefficiently, workforce scheduling operations on fleet level can become very complex and maintenance delays are more likely to occur as a consequence.<br/>In this research, a generic optimisation method is developed focused on the minimisation of the workload fluctuation resulting from the initial maintenance schedule of the aircraft. This method uses a single task reallocation process that systematically eliminates workload excesses by locally reducing task intervals. A software application was built for a fast, a more dynamic and a more customized reallocation process, using several variable inputs.<br/>This application has shown to be very effective in eliminating the workload fluctuation along the lifecycle of an aircraft. As an indication, from the data of the maintenance planning document of an A330, the average fluctuation of the workload among the C-checks over a lifecycle of 15 years, was reduced by more than 79%. Theoretically, this minimisation of the fluctuation could lead to a workforce size reduction of 41% for the C-checks only. These figures are even higher for the A-checks of the aircraft over the same period.<br/>Together with the simplification of the workforce scheduling activities and a more efficient usage of maintenance resources with constant workloads, these advantages are thought to outweigh the negative effects associated with the task interval reductions in the reallocation process, especially when an entire fleet of aircrafts is considered.<br/>Through the implementation of process improvements and additional features, the efficiency and the generic capacity of this application can be further improved with the objective to rapidly generate optimal maintenance schedules that are adaptable to different operational scenarios or constraints.","aircraft; maintenance; schedule; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Objects and devices are becoming more and more wirelessly interconnected, communicating information between themselves and to human beings. As an extension on static sensor networks that gather real-time environmental data, the feasibility of implementing a dynamic sensor network based on LoRa<br/>communication is researched. To achieve such a dynamic system, a self-developed sensor platform was constructed, based on the microcontroller LoPy. Sensors attached to it include a hygrometer, thermometer and microphone.<br/>The emphasis of the research was on localisation of the sensors, to put the gathered sensor data into geographical context. A WiFi fingerprinting radiomap was constructed based on available MAC-addresses, their signal strengths, and GPS coordinates. The GPS module was only used for composing the radiomap. When the radiomap is completed, the module can be switched off, only to be switched on for periodical updates of the radiomap. The quality of the radiomap methodology was evaluated by constructing it of measurements gathered in four days, and testing it for the remaining three days. This test gave a correctness of 50% while another 38% of measurements were localised in a neighbouring cell. The correctness can be improved by having a longer training period.<br/>The quality of the collected sensor data turned out to be dependent on the weather conditions and the placement location on the carrier vehicle. Vehicle requirements were specified as driving through the city centre and having a schedule and route producing as little noise, heat and air pollution as possible. Another topic of research was LoRa communication, which was deemed as very limited for dynamic implementations, as the sending of location-related data takes up a large part of the already limited message size. To decrypt the sent message and store it in a meaningful database, Node-RED was used. Despite visualisation of measurements showed promising results, there is margin for improvement as far as data capturing is concerned.","geomatics synthesis project; Internet of Things (IoT); sensor city delft; sensoring the city; sensor network; WiFi; LoRa; LoPy; PyCom; Air quality sensing; Noise sensing; Temperature sensing","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Solving this challenge enables appealing visualisation, usability for low and high computation powers and geometrical consistency for analysis. The following question is researched: 'To what extent can a vario-scale approach improve integration of point clouds with varying point densities?'. A data model is created that uses importance as an additional dimension. This dimension contains an importance value which is calculated using two methods. Firstly random assignment of values to the points and secondly exact computed values. To compute this value the smallest distances to its nearest neighbour is assigned as importance value. A web application shows the results. Both random and exact methods show an exponential decay in distribution of the importance value.

With the help of longitudinal dams, a two-channel system is created in which the river is divided into a main and a side channel. A combination of an inlet and several openings between the dams allows water and sediment to be exchanged between the two channels. This is expected to influence the discharge (and sediment) distribution between the main and side channel. Understanding the hydraulic conditions and the impact of the regulatory inlet and opening crest heights is expected to improve the control strategy and future design of river interventions using the concept of longitudinal training dams. A one-dimensional (Matlab) and a two-dimensional (Delft3D-Flow) model are created for this research. Both schematize the two channels with dams and openings. The influence of several mechanisms, factors and dimensional design parameters on the discharge distribution is assessed. Additionally, using Delft3D-Flow, the detailed flow patterns around the inlet and openings are evaluated and the schematizing of the inlet as part of the local bed topography or by using subgrid weirs is compared. From the several model runs, the discharge distribution shows to be mainly controlled by differences in longitudinal water level slopes in both channels, caused by the combination of too short inlet and opening lengths. It is not influenced significantly by the placement of the longitudinal training dams in a river bend. For increased crest heights the flow conditions change from submerged to free-flowing. In submerged conditions the velocity magnitudes and flow angles atop the inlet and opening crests are shown to increase in downstream direction while for free-flowing conditions they remain nearly constant. The free-flowing conditions are well described by empirical relationships, while for submerged conditions an additional angle submergence coefficient is suggested to parameterize flow angles. After some modifications, which will be included in the new Delft3D-Flow software release, schematization as part of the bed topography and subgrid weirs both predict similar discharges (&lt; 7% relative difference). If interest is only given to water levels and discharge distributions, the use of subgrid weirs is recommended in Delft3D-Flow. For models assessing other river functions requiring local flow patterns or sediment transport, schematization as part of the bed topography is essential. However, by including the suggested parameterization for flow angles, the errors in flow angles for subgrid weir can be reduced significantly. From this research, the adjustable inlet and opening crest heights do not show a large influence on the discharge distribution (5-10% difference). It mostly impacts the tipping point for submerged to free-flow conditions. In submerged conditions, the inlet crest height does reduce the specific discharge in the side channel, limits the transverse velocities in the main channel, and greatly influence the flow angles atop the crest. Besides the crest heights, the channel width and inlet length should also be included as adjustable parameters in the design or control strategy of new systems of longitudinal training dams.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It involves the application of a directional speaker in a totally new and dynamic way to trigger sound and light effects. The project is an example of a design project which is not about problem solving. It involves children as target group, which do not have urgent problems with current exhibits about light and sound interactions and do not have a specific need to learn about it. A solution space can thus not be defined by the needs of the target group. Therefore the context, the target group and the subjects of sound and light are thoroughly researched first. Then three iterations of experimentation, ideation, prototyping and evaluation are performed to gain a design vision. A final concept is developed which is evaluated with children in the context by means of a working prototype. The final concept, Sonolum, demonstrates a totally new dynamic application of a directional speaker to actively explore multi-sensory interactions with materials. With the Sonolum children can aim directional sound at modules to trigger sound and light effects. The children are invited to configure and explore patterns of modules with different materials on a magnetic wall. By doing so they can explore and learn more about different sound-light-material interactions. For example a module with a mirror reflects the sound and light in a specular and directed way, while a module with black foam will absorb the sound and light. The final prototype of Sonolum is evaluated upon enjoyment, stimulation of exploratory behaviour and bringing across the subjects of sound and light interactions with materials. The study was performed with 48 children over 2 days in the context of ‘Gamelab’ inside Science Centre Delft. The results show that children enjoy the exhibit, that the exhibit shows promise in supporting exploratory behaviour, but unfortunately does not yet bring across sound and light interactions with materials, although the children do indicate that the subject of the exhibit is light, sound and music. This may be due to some limitations of the prototype. Future development and investigation is needed to improve the perceivability of the sound-material effects in the exhibit.","sound; light; interactive exhibit; children; open-ended play; museum; directional speaker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","","52.0070726, 4.367312617"

In particular, the structure should fulfill certain strength and fatigue criteria among which Fatigue Limit States (FLSs) checks are critical. In terms of the process, fatigue assessment can be carried out in both time (TD) and frequency domain (FD), with the former being more popular in the offshore wind energy sector. Nevertheless, simplified tools in the FD have been suggested, since they yield results similar to those of the TD analysis. In order to decide upon the choice of tool in performing the FLS estimations, a relative comparison should be implemented. Particularly, fatigue assessment in the TD, fatigue assessment in the FD and a simplified type of fatigue assessment in the FD are examined. These types of fatigue assessment are conducted in three respective tools, with the TD type conducted in NREL’s FAST v8 and both the FD types simulated within MATLAB tools. The tools are judged upon the desirable levels of Modelling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity. A set of criteria are defined for the particular use case, in an attempt to express that fidelity. The criteria’s metrics are additionally provided in the proposed methodology and associated measurements are taken during simulations. Only after conducting further multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA), the eventual levels of fidelity for the three types of fatigue assessment result to a consequent ranking among the tools. Therefore, the measured criteria lead to the quantification of these levels of fidelity for all three tools and the application of MCDA results to their ranking. The proposed fidelity framework is applied in a case study in order to evaluate the proposed methodology, as well as to select the type of fatigue assessment and consequent tool that should be used within an early design stage. The results indicate that the simplified fatigue assessment in the FD should be preferred over conventional fatigue assessment in both TD &amp; FD. In addition, the criteria included in the fidelity framework seem to provide a multifaceted approach, since none of the tools is favored in all categories. Finally, similarities in results between relevant types of conducted comparisons as well as between different types of MCDA, enhance the consistency of the proposed fidelity methodology and increase its credibility.","Offshore wind turbine; offshore monopiles; Fatigue; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

FCD refers to the use of sources such as in-vehicle systems with network connectivity or road users’ mobile phones to collect relevant traffic information (e.g. vehicle speed or intensity). There is extensive literature on the feasibility of using FCD for traffic management purposes and on the added value of fusing legacy sensors data with FCD.

The Building phase is further subdivided into the specification of design principles and requirements and the development of the solution ICT Architecture. <br/><br/>The outcomes of this research are relevant not only to Rijkswaterstaat but also to other organizations looking to integrate FCD in their traffic systems, to design science researchers and to ICT architects.<br","ICT Architecture; Flexibility; Design Science Research; Action Design Research; Traffic Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional refrigerants such as CFCs and HCFCs are regulated or phased out by the Montreal and Kyoto protocol. Secondary loop refrigerant systems use less of these harmful refrigerants since they make use of a distribution fluid (for example water) as transport medium between the chiller and the coolers. The efficiency of these systems can be improved by using a phase change material as a secondary refrigerant. <br/><br/>Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) is a promising phase change material for air conditioning applications. The phase change can take places at a temperature up to 12.5 ºC, which allows for an increase in the evaporation temperature. Furthermore, due to its phase change, the TBAB slurry has an up to 4 times larger cooling capacity than chilled water. This can be utilized in order to reduce the flow rates in the system. <br/><br/>At his moment, the TU Delft has in collaboration with Hollander Techniek installed a small pilot air conditioning system in the sports hall 'De Jachtlust' located in Twello, the Netherlands. The system has a capacity of approximately 3.5 kW. It has a single 300 L storage tank of and it is equipped with sensors to monitor the performance of the system. In this study, an existing model of a secondary air conditioning system is improved and extended taking into account the design parameters of the installation in Twello. This model is validated using the experimental data from the actual system. <br/><br/>The simulations predict that using a 36.5 wt% TBAB solution increases the COP of the system from 2.96 to 4.00, while the energy consumption reduces by 24.8 %. This reduction is mainly due to a 30.5 % decrease in the power consumption of the compressor. At the same time, the generation side pump consumes 204 % more electricity due to adhesion of the produced crystals to the heat transfer surface. The performance of the TBAB can still be improved by lowering the initial TBAB fraction to 35.0 wt% or by further optimizing the control strategy for the crystal production.<br","TBAB; air conditioning; phase change materials; slurry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This would result in automated vehicles sharing the urban space with other road users including drivers of traditional vehicles and vulnerable road users. Pedestrians might be unable to distinguish the vehicle type (traditional or automated) they are interacting with and crossing situations might become confusing, possibly leading to dangerous encounters between pedestrians and vehicles. There is currently little knowledge about the interactions between pedestrians and AVs from the point of view of the pedestrian in a real life environment. The aim of this master thesis is to determine whether pedestrians’ crossing intentions differ when interacting with automated vehicles compared to when interacting with traditional vehicles. An experiment was developed on a closed road where participants encountered a Wizard of Oz automated vehicle and a traditional vehicle in a within-subject design. In the Wizard of Oz set-up, a fake ‘driver’ sat on the driver seat while the vehicle was driven by the passenger with a joystick. Different scenarios were studied regarding vehicle appearance (‘driver’ reading a newspaper, roof signs, hood/side signs) and approach direction (left vs. right). Results showed that the majority of participants reported that the vehicle was (sometimes) driven autonomously, which indicates that the Wizard of Oz was credible. Moreover, most of the participants perceived the differences in vehicle appearance and reported to be influenced by these features. Despite of this, measurements of critical gaps and self-reported level of stress showed no significant differences between the different conditions of vehicle appearance.","Automated vehicles; Pedestrians; Road safety; Crossing intentions; Gap acceptance; Perceived safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Breaks required by the European drivers legislation are nowadays planned as late as possible. However, in some cases it is beneficial to plan these mandatory breaks during waiting time, such as truck driving bans. In this thesis this problem is addressed by computing earliest arrival routes with optimal break planning. The problem is formulated and optimally solved as a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm. The slow Dijkstra computation times of several seconds per route are improved using time-dependent contraction hierachies, which enable a query time of several milliseconds per route while the solution quality remains good. For two days of driving with a night rest in between, 17% of the analysed routes improves with optimal break scheduling, resulting in an average improvement of 5 hours of driving time. <br/><br/>If the taking of breaks is additionally restricted to parking lots, the influence on the arrival time is on average increased with only 3 minutes. However, 5% of the considered routes are not feasible any more due to absence of truck parking lots along the planned route. Another 15% of the routes face large changes in roads that should be taken.<br/><br/>The planned routes are all optimized for having the earliest arrival time. However, the freight company's objective also concerns fuel optimized driving or providing reliable arrival times to the customer. This thesis analyses such preferences and combines them into a route planner that incorporates results of stated and revealed choice experiments. It is shown that generally toll avoidance and congestion avoidance have most influence on the route choice and arrival time. On average differences are small, but for some routes this leads to changes of up to 15% in travel time. <br/><br/>This thesis analyses the problem of route planning from two perspectives: algorithmic and behavioural. Several observations are made: algorithms are not suitable for obtaining the best route instead of the fastest, and the output of behavioural research cannot be used directly in practice to compute preferred routes. Effort could be made in future to integrate both research communities such that algorithms are able to reflect what a freight transporter actually wants.","shortest path; trucks; drivers legislation; preferences; utility function; time-dependent road network; break planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double Degree: Software Technology - Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

It is working with academics and industry on demonstrators to prove the current state of the art of SLM. Recently<br/>they started with additive manufacturing (AM) of internal manifolds. This thesis aims to provide a novel design approach by including topology optimisation for Navier-Stokes flow with the focus on SLM. This approach intents to bridge the gap between academics and industry regarding fluid topology optimisation by<br/>practically implementing the methodology. As a result, this thesis places emphasis on 3D topology optimisation instead of the very common 2D approach in academics. Fluid topology optimisation was chosen as the primary design step because it is a relatively new and unexplored method in academics and especially new in the industry. Moreover, it is a highly versatile design<br/>approach as it can come with any shape that yields the best result for the given objective and boundary conditions. Due to the complex nature of topology optimisation and its numerical implementation, it was chosen to divide this topology optimisation approach into multiple steps. Hence the goal of this thesis is to combine AM and topology optimisation of Navier-Stokes flow and to incorporate it into a design approach. <br/>The flow optimisation step aims to improve the performance, that is, minimising the power dissipation of the problem at hand. Besides incorporating fluid optimisation, this method also includes a weight reduction step by introducing constraints (volume and perimeter constraints), a specific AM post processing step to create self-supporting cross sections and a mass minimising structural topology optimisation step. Combining these methods lay the foundation for this unique design process for additivemanufacturing.<br/>The volume constraint is not directly proportional to the weight of the manifold, but it is an intuitive constraint that penalises the amount of fluid domain that can be used. The second constraint that is implemented<br/>is the perimeter constraint (including a greyness constraint). This constraint penalises the perimeter of amanifold, which is directly proportional to the weight of the manifold. The novelty of the perimeter constraint is that in fluid flow optimisation it serves as a direct mass control of the structural part of our manifold.<br/>Including this constraint will result in rather straight manifolds as opposed to the more organic shapes arising from the volume constraint.<br/>A three-dimensionalmanifold is used as the case study for thesis and is compared to a manifold that would be manufactured conventionally. The performance objective is power dissipation minimization, and it is shown<br/>to reduce the power dissipation by 47% as compared to the conventional tee, almost doubling the performance.<br/>The optimised manifolds are not always manufacturable due to the limitations of the AM process. In particular downward facing surfaces perpendicular to the build direction (overhang) cannot be printed without support. Adding sacrificial support material is not an option in manifolds, as it often cannot be removed.<br/>Therefore, a post-processing step is implemented to adapt the geometries to remove any internal overhanging regions. This post process step results in self-supporting manifold cross sections that are shaped like a droplet i.e. a 45-degree roof on top of a circular cross section. This approach yields manufacturable design, but it comes at the cost of performance. The x, y, and z build direction adjustments decreased the power dissipation by 41.5%, 27.9%, and 38.4%, respectively. Each design adjustment reduces the performance of the<br/>tee; nonetheless, they performsignificantly better than the conventional tee.<br/>Subsequently, amethod to optimise the local wall thickness is applied. For this purpose, the internal pressure field can be usedwhich is found with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation . This pressure field<br/>acts as the load condition in the structural topology optimisation. The result from this approach is a progressive wall thickness such that it is thick where pressures are high, and thin where pressures are low.<br/>The resulting geometries were manufactured after executing the completed design approach. It is shown that this method works well and can be practically implemented. A pressure measurement test showed a difference of 2.4% to 11.8% as compared to the simulations for the different designs, which is reasonable considering various assumptions such as the frozen turbulence, the turbulence model, mesh size and wall functions. Another test is carried out to look at the flow distribution of the tee and showed a larger difference<br/>of 2.8%-24% in flow distribution ratios. This larger difference is likely the effect of transient effects and possible internal roughness in the topology optimised manifold.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, IPS are deployed in environments covered with obstacles such as furniture, (partition-) walls, people and electronics influencing the signal propagation. The major factor influencing the system performance and to acquire optimal positioning results is the geometry of the beacons. The geometry of the beacons is limited to the available infrastructure that can be deployed (number of beacons, basestations and tags), which is dependent on the budget and deployment effort of the customer. <br/>This leads to the following challenge: Given a limited number of beacons, where should they be placed in a specified indoor environment, such that the geometry contributes to optimal positioning results? <br/><br/>This challenge is approached by using theoretical design computations. The design computations require the definition of a chosen 3D space, the number of beacons, possible user tag locations and a performance threshold (e.g. required precision). For any given set of beacon and receiver locations, the precision, internal- and external reliability can be determined on forehand. The results of a given geometry have been validated by deploying an IPS of BlooLoc and comparing the observed precision with the modeled precision for a chosen set of user tag locations. The theoretical model showed a precision pattern with several equivalent precision patterns of the measured data, however, some significant differences could not be explained physically and the model has to be adapted further. Besides determining the precision based on a set of beacon and receiver locations, the model is able to select the optimal geometric configuration based on a performance threshold (e.g. required precision). Depending on the performance threshold, the optimal configurations can either be a single solution or consist of multiple solutions that satisfy the performance threshold of the customer. The performance threshold varies depending on the use case and the user requirements. Therefore, the amount of possible combinations in terms of 3D space, amount of available beacons, possible beacon locations, user tag locations and performance thresholds are limitless and the model can thus be used for all kind of applications.<br/><br/>All in all, the initial model (design computations) can be used by IPS customers for all kind of applications. The model is able to select the optimal geometric configuration in terms of precision based on a performance threshold specified by the user. Furthermore, the model requires user specified input parameters and the amount of possible combinations are therefore unlimited. Although the initial model has to be adapted further to account for the differences in modeled and measured data as a consequence of environmental factors, the initial model is a good initiative for the rising indoor positioning market and its customers. Therefore, the model can be adapted further such that it can explain significant differences between the modeled and the measured data by including factors that influence the system performance in real life, such as materialistic properties, signal attenuation, interference, multipath, NLOS etc.","Indoor positioning system; Bluetooth Low Energy; System Performance; Theoretical Design Computations; Precision; Optimal Configuration; 3D Space; Reliability; Accuracy; Statistical analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-30","","","","","",""

Teams can offer “greater adaptability, productivity, and creativity than any one individual can offer and provide more complex, innovative, and comprehensive solutions to organisational problems” (Salas et al., 2005). Also in design projects, complexity has increased and time to market decreased. Only teamwork allows companies to deal with the required efficiency and the increasing number of parallel activities. As the designers of tomorrow, it is therefore essential for design students to become comfortable with working in teams, and to learn how to effectively work in these teams. <br/><br/>The central aim of this project was to research how design students can learn about teamwork. To answer this research question, an extensive literature review was done on the topics of teamwork, learning, and reflection. Furthermore, empirical research has been conducted, with research methods including interviews, pilot studies, generative sessions, and observation. The majority of the empirical research was conducted at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. <br/><br/>Literature combined with the findings from the empirical research suggests that students should develop situational awareness and learn to be adaptive in teams. To achieve this, the student should be educated throughout the curriculum on competences and skills in the areas of cooperation, coordination, communication, and self-awareness.<br/><br/>Throughout the project is became clear that reflection was the means to turn teamwork experiences into valuable learning experiences. Various tools that facilitate reflection on teamwork within group design projects were designed and validated. Besides designing effective reflective exercises, two other challenges were identified to achieve meaningful reflection on teamwork: creating an emotionally supportive environment and boosting students’ motivation for doing the reflection.<br/><br/>This project resulted in a product-service system Team Track. Team Track contains of a framework and three corresponding tools. The Team Track framework proposes a setup of a course in which students learn about teamwork, while doing a group design project. The framework can be used by course coordinators to embed teamwork education in their course. The key learning activities proposed by the framework are three facilitated workshops in which the student reflects on teamwork experiences and sets teamwork-related goals for the future. In between the workshop, the student completes modules that offer teamwork theory. <br/><br/>The three Team Track tools support the learning activities proposed by the framework. The Team Bricks are a dynamic and physical representation of the team’s reflections and goals. The team’s personalised Course Calendar contains daily exercises that students have to complete. The online platform has multiple purposes: if offers a database with teamwork theory modules; students have their personal page on which their teamwork-related insights are captured; the student sets teamwork-related goals for himself, which are monitored through the platform. <br/><br/>Finally, the framework and tools have been evaluated with experts on both teamwork and education.

For this purpose, the concept of superhuman sports is considered. Superhuman sports are activities that rely on technology for human augmentation, involve physical fitness and skills, which are played for fun, competition or health reasons. <br/><br/>The next step was the decision for a design direction. This decision was made to design a new superhuman sport, in the form of a running game in mixed reality, to make the running experience itself more fun and motivating and distract runners from the exertion activity. An ideation phase followed in which different ideas were considered and eventually a combination for a final game design was chosen. <br/><br/>The final game design Play your run! is a running game that can be played location independent and provides a virtual replication of the opponent by wearing augmented reality glasses. Thus, the running game augments the real environment of the runner. In the game, runners compete with each other in a virtual time measured race on a pre-set real distance. They can harass each other by obtaining power-up items by running into virtual boxes placed on the course in the real world. The power-ups are placed in relation to geolocation and meshed surfaces. These items, e.g., add time to the virtual time of the opponent, require the opponent to freeze, or offer protection. The type of item that a player receives from the box is influenced by the runners’ speed, heart rate and current position in the virtual race. Such dynamic game balancing makes it possible for runners of all different levels to play the game. <br/><br/>A tournament with six runners was organized in order to investigated whether this running game let runners experience more fun, motivation and engagement. During this tournament, the runners played the running game in which the way they perceived and obtained virtual power-ups was controlled by the researcher. In order to keep the burden of extra technology for the runners low and focus on evaluating the game experience, stationary objects and projection were used to visualize the power-ups. Based on the experience of the runners, the game rules were proved to improve performance, distract the runner from discomfort and involve the audience. <br/><br/>A presentation movie of a possible game scenario was create to explain and present the game play. This report provides a description of the scenario and visuals to support and explain the intended gameplay. At some points the technology is not yet developed enough to play the game the initial way. Therefore a future implementation plan and possible future suggestions are given. This report describes the process of a new superhuman sport, a running game in mixed reality. The decision for other emerging technologies or sports can result in more new (superhuman) sports, that can performed during the International Superhuman Sports Championship in 2020.","Superhuman sports; Mixed reality; Augmented Reality; Running game; Sports; Game; AR; superhuman","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Current camping shelters do not seem to support the desired nature experience of these campers. While protecting these campers from external conditions the shelters closes the campers off from the outdoors they came for. This led to the following hypothesis:<br/>Current camping shelters do not fit the desired nature camping experience.<br/><br/>By researching campers and their context this hypothesis is confirmed. Besides confirming the hypothesis the research gave two other noteworthy insights about the desired camping experience. Firstly, the research showed that these campers like to have the possibility to make a camping spot their own. Secondly, it was indicated<br/>that they want to have the possibility to retreat in this own created place, secluding themselves form the outdoors. Combining these findings with a future shelter and interaction vision led to the following design goal:<br/>To design a shelter where the feeling of being outside and inside merge smoothly into one another, giving the user the opportunity to seclude from and submerge in their surrounding. Meanwhile enabling the user to break with their daily routine and make a shelter and by that, making their camping spot their own, in a mindful and exploratory manner.<br/><br/>The concept designed based on this design goal is a modular shelter named the LUCID. The LUCID consists of seven components, which can be configured in multiple ways. Four configurations are designed during this project; other possible configurations are left to the user. Giving them the option to make the shelter and camping spot their own. Each of the four designed configurations can be opened and closed from the inside to ensure the user that they can both submerge in and seclude from the surroundings.<br/><br/>To answer the question whether or not it is a good idea to continue developing the LUCID (after completing this graduation project) a concept evaluation research is carried out. Based on this evaluation and the opinion of a consulted camping and outdoor specialist the advise on continuing the development of the LUCID is positive.","Tent; Shelter; Nature; Interaction; Experience; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Advanced fiber placement is a hybrid manufacturing technique that offers the flexibility of both filament winding and automated tape laying. With the development of this novel system curved tows can be placed and a spatially variable-stiffness laminate can be designed with continuous changing stiffness from point to point. <br/><br/>The increased design freedom to tailor a structure by in-plane stiffness variation leads to a challenging design optimization problem. A multi-step framework is developed by the aerospace structures and materials department to optimize variable-stiffness laminates. Variable-stiffness laminate design allows for sophisticated designs. Based on this premise it is investigated how such design could improve the structural performance of an engine thrust frame, a structural application that transfers the thrust loads from the rocket engine to the rest of the launch system. The engine thrust frame is subject to cryogenic thermal loads, something not incorporated in the available optimization framework. The goal of this work is to add thermal loads to the laminate analysis routine and to adjust the optimization routine to incorporate thermal influences.<br/><br/>With the thermomechanical optimization framework in place the engine thrust frame is modeled. Conceptual design optimization of the engine thrust frame under thermomechanical loads is performed to increase buckling resistance. A mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion is used by the optimal variable-stiffness design. The stiffened areas contract less than the inter-stiffener bay regions. Consequently a stabilizing tensile stress is induced in the prone to buckling bay regions, whereas compressive stresses are distributed to the stiffened areas. Based on the stabilizing thermal stresses and load distribution significant gains in performance are found. <br","Thermomechanical; Variable-Stiffness; Composite; Laminate Analysis; Optimization; Thermal Load","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Workspace extension methods can overcome this mismatch between master and slave. Literature proposes several workspace extension methods for translations such as scaling and indexing. However, for rotations it is unclear how workspace extension methods should be designed. The present study proposes a methodology to design rotational workspace extension methods with a variable gain. Which is designed based on the speed-accuracy trade-off and several task characteristics, like the distribution of rotational amplitudes during telemanipulation tasks. The effectiveness of the variable gain method is evaluated in terms of task performance and control effort in a within-subject-haptic-telemanipulation-single-degree-rotational-pointing-experiment, based on Fitts’ tapping task. The parameters are chosen in accordance with a care robot case study where the rotational workspace of the master device is 45°, but where most tasks require 90° slave rotation, and some even 180°. It is hypothesized that variable gain workspace extension allows improved performance in regions it is customized for (up to 90% of the slave rotations) with respect to a conventional constant scaling, while the operator is able to perform in all regions with similar order of magnitude metrics. To test this hypothesis a variable scaling method, a constant scaling method, and a baseline method (without scaling) are designed. The experimental results show improved performance on fine positioning time and reversal rate for the variable scaling method at the focus region. Furthermore, human operators accept variable scaling and are able to manipulate linear changes of the gain equally smooth as constant gains, while high nonlinear changes of the gain are more difficult to manipulate smoothly. To conclude, this study demonstrates a methodology for designing variable gain workspace extension methods for specific task characteristics which allows improved execution performance compared to the conventional constant scaling method. For applying this methodology in real-life applications, the results need to be scaled for more realistic situations, such as higher degrees of freedom and in-contact tasks.","Telemanipulation; Rotational workspace extension; Variable scaling; Within subject human factors; Fitts' law","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its ability to react quickly to stochastic disturbances, especially its ability to avoid falling, termed stability in this context, is of prime importance. The choosing of a suitable actuator that affords such stability is seen as a challenge in the current stage of the humanoid project. A novel method for comparing various actuators in terms of humanoid stability is investigated, to aid with this choice.<br/>A common method for comparing actuators is the use of low-level actuator parameters, e.g. power density. With a low-level parameter, a specific actuator property can be compared between multiple actuators. To incorporate relevant properties of all actuators, a large set of actuator parameters is required. This becomes even more challenging when comparing a heterogeneous collection of actuators, e.g. muscle and hydraulics. Besides subjectiveness in parameter definitions and comparisons, the multidimensional set of actuator parameters needs to be related to a one-dimensional measure of humanoid stability. As low-level parameters and high-level humanoid stability are not directly relatable, subjective weighting factors are traditionally employed to reduce dimensionality.<br/>Step time is introduced as a one-dimensional criterion for comparing different actuators. The ability to make fast movements is a critical component in defining humanoid stability. Therefore, by comparing step times of different actuators in a fixed test case, a measure of humanoid stability is obtained. The step movement represents a simplified motion of the lifting of a foot, in which essential elements of humanoid motion are incorporated.<br/>A framework is developed, with which step times of Human Muscle (HM), ElectroMechanical Actuators (EMAs) and Hydraulic Actuators (HAs) are computed. While EMAs are often thought to have limited potential for humanoid applications, step times are similar to those of muscle. Supplemented with recent examples of successful EMA implementations, step time demonstrates the potential of EMAs. Furthermore, HA capability is also demonstrated, as step times can obtain lower values than those of HM and EMA.<br/>Step time as developed in this thesis appears to be a powerful tool for comparing vastly different actuators. It provides a one-dimensional measure related to humanoid stability, evaluated directly for each specific actuator.<br","humanoid; actuator; stability; robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is developed due to the inherent benefits of these type of setups such as lack of wear, friction and problems due to mechanical phenomenon as play and backlash. Achieving higher accelerations and ultra-precise position control while reducing maintenance. <br/><br/>At Owl Tech the goal is to develop a magnetic levitation system capable of six-degrees-of-freedom motion to be employed in positioning systems, such as a 3D-printer, for the consumer market. The system consists of an array of electromagnets with an iron core which by controlling the current through each can shape a magnetic field. The magnetic field is manipulated to levitate and position a platform with permanent magnets in six-DoF.<br/> <br/>In previous research, the equations of motions for the platform have been derived. The equations of motion are a linearized version of the rigid body dynamics, allowing for translations and tiny rotations, subjected to external forces such as gravity, actuation and attraction forces. The actuation and attraction forces are non-linear with respect to the location of each permanent magnet. Finite element modeling was used to derive models for these forces with respect to the magnet location.<br/><br/>To measure the location of the moving platform an array of 36 Hall-effect sensors is employed. The output of each sensor is combined and through sensor fusion with an extended Kalman filter using an experimental measurement model the platform location is determined. The proposed extended Kalman filter of previous research is compared with an approach based on real-time optimization and a linear Kalman filter. With as argument that the EKF has no theoretical guarantee to converge and might give biased results whereas the optimization algorithm has guaranteed convergence towards to magnet location.<br/><br/>The localization algorithm is tested on the real system employing a positioning system. The positioning system performs a stroke while the algorithm is tracking the position. Resulting in an estimation accuracy error of $/pm 1$ mm while the precision error is $/pm 0.1$ mm.<br/><br/>The proposed control architecture of previous research consists of a feedback control loop based on a non-linear output mapping. The non-linear output mapping decouples the coupled input currents after which each degree of freedom can be controlled separately by single-input-single-output state feedback controllers. <br/><br/>In this research, a model predictive controller is proposed instead. A model predictive controller can deal with constraints inherently. Therefore it is capable of dealing with actuator saturation which would destabilize the system in the control architecture of previous research. Additionally, the MPC architecture is extended to the so-called tube-based model predictive control to achieve a robust model predictive controller.<br/><br/>Both control architectures are implemented in simulations and the real-system limited in two degrees-of-freedom and three degrees-of-freedom to test performance in regard of achievable bandwidth. In this analysis, the output uncertainty of the localization algorithm is taken into account. The results show that the system can be controlled and that the output uncertainty can be dealt with. The model predictive controller performs better achieving higher bandwidth due to the ability to perform at the saturation limits.<br","Magnetic Levitation; MPC; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research was executed using a questionnaire which was designed to examine if there are gender differences in the judgement of nanotechnology and if so, which variables play a significant role in this causal relations. Based on the factor analyses of the collected data, structural equation models (SEM) were estimated for the data of the whole sample, for the data of men and for the data of women. The analyses included the following 15 variables: gender, level of science education, studying nanotechnology, age, evaluation of nanotechnology, health and environmental effects, economical benefits, costs, level of trust in the government, level of trust in the industry’s concern with the environment, level of trust in the industry’s concern with safety, positive affect, negative affect, subjective knowledge, objective knowledge. The estimated SEMs showed that there is a significant gender difference in the evaluation of nanotechnology, as men evaluate nanotechnology more positive than women. This gender difference is largely explained by the variable on the expected effects of nanotechnology on health and environment. Other variables that have a significant effect on the evaluation of nanotechnology in the overall model are: age, gender, education, if the respondent has studied nanotechnology, trust in the industry’s concern with the environment. It was also found that the variable gender affects several relations between variables, meaning that the relation between these variables is different for men and women. The variables of which the direct relation with the evaluation of nanotechnology is affected by gender are ‘trust in the industry’s concern with the environment’, ‘expected costs’ and ‘studying nanotechnology’. The outcomes of this research suggest that it is essential to include women in the boards of the development of risky technologies. Women are for example less positive about the effects of nanotechnology on the health and environment, indicating that women pay more attention to the negative effects of the technology which makes them essential for responsible innovation. The results furthermore indicate that future research on the evaluation of risky technologies should take the underlying relations and variables into account because gender can influence the relations between the variables which results in different SEM’s for men and women.","Gender differences; nanotechnology; evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Ethics/Philosophy of Technology","","MOT","",""

In 2015, the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) announced that around 6500 MW of total offshore wind capacity required in the Netherlands could be realized by 2030. The relatively low commercial maturity of OWP technology and also some distinct technological features (e.g. long lead-time, high capital cost) of OWP lead to certain market barriers which consequently result in market failure. The Dutch government has applied economic policy instruments, as public resources, in order to overcome all the market barriers. Despite the fact that several support systems are being implemented by the Dutch government, they could not meet the predefined objectives. Up until 2017, only 957 MW was implemented and supplied to the grid. Primary literature study confirms that the lack of investment by investors is one of the most important reasons for this failure. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of economic policy instruments when it comes to stimulating investment in new OWP projects in the Netherlands by adopting a sustainable and distributive justice approach. This study is composed of four main parts: the literature review, the case study, the analysis, and the design. The review illustrates that FiT and TGC have been the most commonly implemented policies among EU member states over the last 25 years. Also by literature review four criteria are identified for the evaluation of those four suggested policy instruments. Effectiveness, efficiency (static and dynamic as well), and certainty for investors are the most common criteria for evaluation of policy instruments. Equity in terms of distributive justice is the fourth criterion to be considered in more recent evaluations. The case study confirms that Feed-in Tariff (FiT) and Tradable Green Certificates (TGCs) are the two main policy instruments implemented in the Netherlands. The lack of political stability is seen as one of main reason why they failed to meet their objectives. A multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was applied as the decision-making method for selecting applicable support system in sustainable way. Sustainable development implies that social, economic and environmental aspects must be equally considered whilst not compromising one particular aspect. This method is well-known as a method in which all criteria have equal weight. This analysis addresses the fact that while there is not one concrete policy instrument to meet objectives effectively and efficiently at the same time, one improved and adjusted (dual) FiT system is a proper policy instrument that could stimulate investment in OWP projects in the Netherlands in the new future. The last part of this thesis includes the design of the new recommended support system (dual FiT) to enable responsible innovation in OWP development.","Economic Policy Instruments; The Netherlands; Responsible Innovation; Offshore Wind Power; Effectiveness; Efficiency; Equity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The projected is conducted under the project ‘Meedoen=Groeien!’. <br/><br/>Within the current situation, children with cancer and the people around them experience several challenges which affect the school experience. One of these challenges is that teachers tend to underestimate children with cancer, while sick children tend to overestimate themselves. For teachers it is difficult to understand what to expect from sick children, since their mood and energy level is affected by the cancer and its treatment and can changes during the day. Sick children tend to overestimate themselves due to their willingness and enthusiasm. They want to do the same as they did before the cancer and do the same as their classmates to get a sense of belonging. The effects of over- and underestimation are similar. Both have a negative influence on the self-confidence, self-image, and development of the child. Therefore the project aim was to prevent over-/underestimation by designing a product/service that supports sick children to express their mood and energy level in order to create together with their teacher a suitable individual planning throughout the day. <br/><br/>This is established by the ‘Humeur adviseur’ which exist of the ‘Gevoelens medaille’ – product and ‘Mijn les’ – cards. The ‘Gevoelens medaille’ is lying on the table of the sick children and can be used whenever they want. The ‘Gevoelens medaille’ stimulates the sick children to think and talk about their mood and energy level, makes it possible to express this in an easy, quick, and unforced way, and reminds classmates and teachers of the impact cancer and its treatment has on the sick child. Based on the mood and energy level of the sick children, the teachers can decide which tasks the sick children could do. This can be written down on the ‘Mijn les’. To involve the sick children and regain control, they can mark which tasks they are going to do by choosing from the tasks proposed by the teacher and/or by adding extra tasks. <br/><br/>The ‘Mijn les’ – cards will be used by the classmates as well, to give the children the feeling that the sick child is treated like a “normal” child and create a sense of belonging. On the front of the cards the children can write down the goal of the lesson, the tasks they are going to do, and how long they have to fulfil the tasks. During the lesson they can mark which tasks they have finished and after the lesson they can reflect on the lesson. This makes learning visible and gives the sick children the opportunity to communicate to the teachers how they perceived the lesson. This information can be used by the teachers to create a better understanding of the sick children.","Childhood cancer; School experience; Human-centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The system is capable of acquisition of data in the form of distances between radar and targets, which can be used to localise and track one or multiple targets in real-time. The system can be used in a wide range of applications, ranging from security, such as anti-intruder systems, to commercial applications, such as tracking animals in a zoo.\newline<br/><br/>A network of four Time Domain PulsON 410 ultra-wideband radars are used in the sensing system, due to their availability, high spatial accuracy and performance in non-line-of-sight conditions. By using different transmission codes, interference between the sensors is kept to a minimum. Multiple antennas are considered, and the Vivaldi antenna is shown to be preferred over the dipole antenna for this application due to its slightly higher directivity, reducing the impact of multi-path effects. The data acquisition for the four radars is initiated almost simultaneously, up to the point that the radars can be considered synchronised. The received signal is filtered using background rejection and an FIR motion filter, to reveal motion of the target. Four detection algorithms are considered, of which the least-of constant false alarm rate (LO-CFAR) has a better performance for indoor multiple person tracking applications over conventional CFAR detection. The LO-CFAR algorithm can be applied to the filtered signal to detect targets in range of the sensors, and determine their distance from the sensor. Range-Doppler processing is proposed as a method to acquire a velocity estimate of the target, which can be used in a tracking system to estimate the position of the target more accurately. However, due to the relatively low slow-time sampling frequency, it is not feasible to utilise Range-Doppler processing in the current system. Only simulations of Range-Doppler processing are shown in the thesis. \newline<br/><br/>The system is tested in different environments; single person and multiple person situations are considered in an open and a cluttered area. It is shown that the developed system is capable of detecting a single target in both open and cluttered areas. With two targets in cluttered areas, it becomes difficult to distinguish a target from multi-path reflections, reducing the reliability of the system in these situations. In an open area, multiple targets can successfully be distinguished and detected. The sensing system can successfully detect and determine the distance to a person in non-line-of-sight conditions. Additionally, the detection system is tested on a smaller target to determine performance and accuracy of the system in situations with smaller targets. While the small target is possible to detect, the range at which reliable results are obtained is significantly reduced by the size of the target.\newline<br/><br/>It is concluded that there is room for improvement of the target detection system, especially in situations involving multiple targets in cluttered areas. Through-wall detection is shown to be feasible with the current sensing system. For small targets, a higher pulse integration index is required to achieve a reliable range similar to the results of person detection. Range-Doppler processing requires a higher slow-time sampling frequency in order to be feasible in a real-time tracking system. Further recommendations include testing alternative antennas to improve through-wall detection, designing a multi-static radar system and implementing more complex detection algorithms that have a better multi-person performance.","Tracking; Detection; CFAR; UWB; Ultra-Wideband","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By doing so, they reduce the use of fossil fuels, resulting in a reduction of emissions. However, many challenges exist for the traditional working fluids of the cycle, such as the crystallization problem of the water-lithium bromide pair and the difficulty in separating ammonia from the ammonia-water working pair. Ionic liquids, as novel absorbents in absorption cycles, have attracted considerable attention because of their unique properties like negligible vapor pressure, negligible flammability, thermal stability, low melting temperatures, liquid state over a wide temperature range and good solubility.<br/>In this thesis, a thermodynamic model of the ammonia based double-effect absorption cycle in series configuration was used to predict the performance and suitability of nine ionic liquids as potential absorbents. The performance of the ammonia-ionic liquid systems was compared with that of ammonia-water systems and the influence of the operating conditions and the design parameters on the performance was investigated.<br/>Furthermore, a method to experimentally determine the excess enthalpy of ammonia and ionic liquid mixtures is proposed and the suitability of using absorption refrigeration on a fishing ship, with ionic liquids as absorbents, is studied.<br/>The results show that the ionic liquids [Bmim][BF4], [Mmim][DMP] and [Emim][SCN] used as absorbents in the investigated absorption cycle reached the best performance and could be a promising replacement of water in the ammonia-water working pair.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Existing sophisticated numerical micro- and macro models have already proven to be capable of simulating typical masonry behaviour. However, assessing the global response of masonry buildings using brick-to-brick micro modelling or even simplified macro modelling, in which masonry is regarded as a continuum material, takes such an amount of time that these methods cannot be considered as cost-effective. For the last two decades it has been recognized that, for the global structural behaviour of masonry buildings, simplifications have to be made. The idealization of a masonry wall as an assemblage of numerically integrated (or fibre) beam elements could considerably reduce the computational burden and therefore this study addresses the following research question:<br/>To what extent are numerically integrated beam elements applicable for assessing the global response of masonry structures?<br/>Whereas existing equivalent frame methods are usually based on lumped plasticity models, the approach discussed here considers the entire member (e.g pier or spandrel) as an inelastic element in which the sectional response is evaluated via a fibre discretization in which each fibre (or integration point over the depth) may follow a material uniaxial nonlinear stress-strain relation. Initially the shear response is kept linear, automatically idealizing the structural response as purely flexural. The proposed model will be hereinafter named FFM (Fibre Flexure Model). Additionally, an extension of the FFM has been proposed, describing the shearing behaviour by means of a structural nodal interface element. Adopting the nodal interface element, placed between two nodes of adjacent beam elements, the axial and bending behaviour is described with the fibre-section discretization and the shear behaviour is modelled via an equivalent Coulomb-type criterion describing the shear force limit. The proposed model will be hereinafter named FF-LSM (Fibre Flexure – Lumped Shear model) because it lumps shearing nonlinearities in one single interface element located in the centre of the structural component, whereas flexural and crushing behaviour is evaluated via smeared crack beam elements. <br/>To validate the numerical models, two different types of benchmarks have been investigated, respectively representing the behaviour of either a single structural component (masonry pier) or a composite façade. All numerical models have been subjected to static nonlinear (pushover) analyses and results have been compared with experimental and numerical data through the use of a reference continuum model. <br/>First, it has been demonstrated that the FFM, idealizing the structural response as purely flexural, is capable of simulating the rocking failure mode of unreinforced masonry walls, whereas it fails to simulate typical masonry shearing modes such as diagonal cracking and sliding. The use of the model for squat members that are characterized by shear failure leads to significant overpredictions, making the model not applicable for the analysis of masonry structures containing relatively squat structural components, having shear span to depth ratios less than approximately 1. <br/>Second, the shortcoming of the FFM regarding the shearing failure mode has been overcome by combining the numerically integrated beam elements with a structural nodal interface element describing the shear behaviour. The FF-LSM including the nodal interface is able to correctly predict the shear capacity of both slender and squat walls, although the observed level of accuracy depends largely on the adopted shear failure criterion. Various shear force criteria (Coulomb friction based) have been considered: the Mann and Muller (1982) criterion, the correction proposed by Magenes and Calvi (1997) and the modification according to Abrams (1992). Generally it was observed that the criteria developed by Abrams (1992) was the most accurate and that especially for a decreasing shear ratio the criterion developed by Magenes and Calvi (1997) appeared to be less precise. <br/>Third, analysing a composite façade, with respect to the reference continuum model the FFM and FF-LSM significantly reduce the number of elements, nodes and integration points, consequently minimizing the computational effort and maximizing the computational robustness. In comparison with the corresponding continuum model the computational time decreases by a factor of approximately 10. Despite the limitations of the FFM regarding the shearing failure mode, the model shows an acceptable accuracy in terms of initial stiffness, stiffness reduction and peak strength. Adopting the FF-LSM the numerical model predictions were significantly enhanced and both flexural and shearing failure modes (in piers and spandrels) were detected correctly. Therefore, the result of the investigation has proved to be very promising as with the FF-LSM an acceptable balance between computational cost and accuracy is found, applicable to the global analysis of two dimensional masonry structures constituting slender as well as squat walls. As many problems in engineering practice require solutions in three-dimensional space, a fully three-dimensional extension of the FF-LSM is highly recommended. <br","fibre beam; numerically integrated beam; fibre discretization; nodal interface element; distributed plasticity; lumped plasticity; equivalent frame","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Weijntjes, M.W.A. (mentor); Rakhorst-Oudendijk, M.L.W. (mentor)","2017","Assignment With the release of new frigates by 2030, the target is set to operate them with fewer personnel by introducing more complex systems on board. An important human-computer interaction challenge lies in the design of decision support with new technologies, which was explored in my graduation project. Phase 1: Research This project started with a deep immersion into the Royal Netherlands Navy, the maritime domain and a trend analysis, which resulted in the formulation of the main research question: “How could Augmented Reality (AR) aid navy personnel with safe navigation on the bridge?” Based on meetings with operational personnel persona’s were made, in which the characteristics, responsibilities, values and needs of the various roles present on the bridge were described and visualized. The main users identified for a decision support concept were the Officer of the Watch (OOW) and Navigation Officer (NAVO), whom are responsible for the navigational decisions. Also an overview was made of the current systems at the bridge used for navigational purposes. An exploration in the Augmented Reality technique, a review of earlier studies executed about the application of it in the maritime domain and a look at already existing concepts lead to relevant insights about the foreseen capabilities, possibilities and implications. Based on this the research question was narrowed down with ‘when sailing through narrow waterways at night’. To gather rich insights in the OOW and NAVO way of working, where support by AR is most wanted and discover the users preferences for an AR device, a qualitative research study was done. This consisted of two separate parts; first six interviews were held on shore, followed by a two day observation aboard. Quotes from the interviews were used to generate statement cards, which is a method to transform raw data into information and knowledge. To find patterns and attach an interpretation to them, they were clustered on content. Six main functions were unveiled which need to be performed for safe navigation. With positioning you check where you are, and with track control you then check whether that your position is on the planned track or at least within the set safe water limits. This is strongly linked to avoid grounding, which is basically to avoid running into shallow waters. With avoid collision you are busy with avoiding that you crash into or get too close to another ship or something else in the water (such as a wind farm). One of the main functions on the bridge to ensure safe navigation is to look outside, which means continuously looking around what is happening outside (weather, sea, shipping, coastline). Lastly, one needs to respond to changing weather and sea conditions. From these, ‘to avoid collision’ turned out to have the highest potential of becoming critical. If something were to go wrong with this the impact would be severe. During the observational study it became clear that of the proposed AR options, it’s likely that an AR viewer device would reach the state of acceptance easiest and fits the context of use the most. Use it when you want the extra layer of information, and are not bothered by it when you don’t want it. Next, design guidelines were made in which was stated that the main things the solution should solve are the potentially critical points, the time consuming tasks at the bridge and the ones that generate long head down time (time spent looking for information in systems instead of outside). Five use cases were described where the design should aid the user with, which are as follows: perceive another ship, identify another ship, understand the shipping situation, define turning point and prevent a too small CPA. Phase 2: Design & Evaluate During the ideation roughly four areas were explored: which functionalities it should have, how you create a well perceivable projection in AR, how to visualize the information and how you interact with the device. This resulted in two concepts: Simple and Smart. They have the same basis of an AR viewer, however the information that the Smart concept gives is in certain cases more extended than that of the Simple concept. Next to that, the Smart concept is ‘smarter’ and in certain specific situations it automatically displays a certain type of information. They were evaluated in a comparative study with Navigation Officers by the use of a scenario that contained the five earlier specified use cases, a questionnaire and an interview. The Smart concept scored better and was optimized using the given feedback. Design: Augmented Reality Navigation The Augmented Reality viewer accelerates the buildup of situational awareness on the bridge of future frigates by projecting information over the outside view and thereby aids navy personnel with safe navigation and eases the decision making process. It aids you with identifying other ships, gaining insight in the shipping situation and provides you with instant clarity where you can and cannot sail when you need to deviate to avoid a collision. Also, it helps you to follow your planned route and enhances the bridge team communication. The device is wireless and can project a layer over the outside view containing information gathered from the systems at the bridge. The use of it is best compared with that of a binocular: look through it whenever you feel the need to, and when you don’t use it are not bothered by it either. Using the AR viewer is especially handy in low visibility situations such as in fog or darkness. The different types of information are located on layers which can be turned on separately. Each user can define presets which the system memorizes. Specific layers which the user needs for decision making in a certain situation are turned on automatically.","frigates; augmented reality; ship navigation; interaction design; bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","At the Paris climate conference in December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first ever universal, legally binding global climate agreement. This combined with the depletion of fossil fuels drives the interest in renewable energy technologies. The thermal gradient in the ocean is a largely untapped source of renewable energy. It can be utilized through ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), which is an excellent candidate to be included in the clean energy mix, especially for tropical islands, to provide base load. Ammonia is typically used in an Organic Rankine cycle for OTEC, however ammonia-water has been identified as a technically and economically feasible alternative to ammonia for OTEC in a Kalina cycle configuration. Ammonia-water is capable of having a temperature glide while evaporating and condensing allowing for a better temperature match between the source or sink and the working fluid, leading to fewer exergy losses, resulting in a higher efficiency. In order to assess the performance of ammonia-water compared to pure ammonia a model is developed using Python 2.7 based on the OTEC research prototype at the Process & Energy laboratory at the University of Technology, Delft. Either the CoolProp 6.1 database or REFPROP v9.0 can be used to determine the properties of pure ammonia and water. For ammonia-water the method proposed by Rattner and Garimella, based on the Ziegler and Trepp equation of state, is used. For the transport properties the equations by Conde and Shamsetdinov et al. are implemented. The model is validated using experimental data obtained from the OTEC research prototype. Water-water experiments have been conducted, which have been used to develop an empirical single phase heat transfer correlation. Experiments with both pure ammonia and a varying mixture of ammonia-water (90%-100% ammonia) have been conducted in order to assess the two-phase correlations available in literature. For the experiments the water mass flows, the warm and cold water temperatures, the working fluid mass flow, and the heat duties were kept constant, by adjusting the pressure drop over the valve (no turbine was installed). The correlation by Ayub was found to accurately predict the evaporating two-phase heat transfer. None of the two-phase condensing heat transfer correlations were accurate in predicting the behaviour of the condenser. This was overcome by adjusting the correlation by Winkelmann with a wetted area correction. The model results approach the measured experimental result with an average deviation of 10%. The model results show that for a constant heat duty of 5 kW, at a warm water temperature of 27C, a warm water mass flow of 0.3 kg/s, a cold water temperature of 5C, a cold water mass flow of 0.225 kg/s and a working fluid mass flow of 0.010 kg/s, that the theoretical turbine work increases from 90 W to 135 W and the thermal efficiency increases from 1.16% to 1.94% when increasing the ammonia-water concentration from 90% to 100% pure ammonia. The exergy analysis showed that the largest exergy losses occur in the condenser and the second largest losses occur in the evaporator due to the irreversibilities associated with heat transfer. The exergy efficiency increases from 18% up to 30% with an increasing ammonia-water concentration from 90% to 100%. The model is used to find the optimum performance points for each of the concentrations by adjusting the pressure drop, which showed that at a concentration of 96% the mixture performs similarly to pure ammonia, however ammonia still outperforms the mixture. At the optimum performance points the exergy losses are lower in the heat exchangers for 96% when compared to pure ammonia, confirming that the temperature glide lowers the irreversibilities. Additional tests should be conducted with different boundary conditions in order to conclusively decide which working fluid performs better. The effects on the CAPEX should also be considered in future optimizations.","Ammonia; Ammonia-water; Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-06-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","","",""

Although running such workflows in clouds promises reduces operational costs, there are still numerous scheduling challenges to overcome. Such complex workflows are dynamic, exhibit periodic patterns, and combine diverse task groupings and requirements. In this work, we propose ANANKE, a scheduling system addressing these challenges. Our approach extends the state-of-the-art in portfolio scheduling for data centers with a reinforcement-learning technique and proposes various scheduling policies for managing complex workflows. Portfolio scheduling addresses the dynamic aspect of the workload. Reinforcement learning, based in this work on Q-learning, allows our approach to adapt to the periodic patterns of the workload, and to tune the other configuration parameters. The proposed policies are heuristics that guide the provisioning process, and map workflow tasks to the provisioned cloud resources. Through real-world experiments based on real and synthetic industrial workloads, we analyze and compare our prototype implementation of ANANKE with a system without portfolio scheduling (baseline) and with a system equipped with a standard portfolio scheduler. Overall, our experimental results give evidence that a learning-based portfolio scheduler can perform better (5--20%) and cost less (20--35%) than the considered alternatives.","portfolio scheduling; resource management and scheduling; reinforcement learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Smart Connect",""

The port is located in the Santos - São Vicente estuarine system, delimited by scarps and subject to intense rainfall. The terminals are placed inside the estuary and their access is provided by a 24 km long channel with mean depths of 15 m DHN, subject to annual maintenance dredging with volumes in the order of 4 Mm³ [CODESP, 2016a]. <br/>A literature-based sediment mass balance is formulated for the system. Sediment sources and sinks are assessed based on data of the period 2005 to 2012 and expert judgment. The largest sediment input is given by winter storms (65%) followed by river sediment loads (25%). Up-estuary import of fine sediment is found as a third source, computed from the deficit between sources and sinks (trapping in the mudflats and maintenance dredging).<br/>An explorative process based model is set to evaluate the hypothetical sediment balance and expand the understanding of the system behavior. A period of six months is simulated to capture the expected seasonal variability in salinity gradients. Conditions for fluid mud formation are found in the entire channel. A rerun with salinity switched off promotes an expressive reduction (70%) in the cumulative fine sediment import. Up-estuary sediment transport is found as a result of salinity-induced residual currents, which increase in strength with deeper channels [van Maren et al., 2015].<br/>Fine sediment deposits in the final stretches of the channel that probably have been accounted in previous studies as from river discharges, according to this study are provided from marine sources. Model results suggest an annual import of 1.1 Mton of sediment, six times larger than the literature-based estimate. Additionally, results indicate that little quantity of riverine sediment reaches the channel. The literature mass-balance is therefore modified to incorporate these findings: river contribution is set to 15%, up-estuary transport to 30%, and winter storms to 55%.<br","Santos Estuary; Fine sediment; Harbour siltation; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","-23.956130"

The bow section of the wreck is located on a stability critical slope of 15 degrees. In 2016, Van Oord used a flexible fall pipe system to install a counter fill to stabilize the wreck and simultaneously cap a portion of the contaminated area. In the future, the Norwegian government plans to cap the complete area to prevent further dispersion of mercury. This research aims to gain more knowledge about the spreading of sediments during such an operation occurring under realistic hydrodynamic conditions. A more complete understanding of the process will allow for better risk assessment of future capping operations. To this end, the unique data set gathered during the counter fill project has been analyzed.<br/><br/>In order to predict extreme flow events, the bottom currents are decomposed. By decomposing the erratic velocity signal, tidal (25 %) and inter-tidal residual current (38 %) components are identified and understood. However, the driving force for the remaining intra-tidal part, which contains the highest current anomaly events, cannot be identified. Evidence is found for the occurrence of internal waves providing a possible explanation. Due to a lack of data, a quantitative prediction cannot be made. Consequently, the exact maximum currents at the site are unpredictable, but stayed below 0.4 m/s during the project.<br/><br/>During the installation work, high turbidity clouds have been measured. The origin is investigated by analyzing the particle size distribution and the mercury concentration of sediment samples; said samples are drawn from the capping material, the installed capping layer and sediment traps placed around the wreck. The findings indicate that the clouds are caused by a loss of clean material and are not from the contaminated seabed. This is supported by modeling the dispersal of clean particles from the flexible fall pipe. The promising results regarding the use of a flexible fall pipe for capping layer installation are not only applicable for the U-864 area but also for other polluted offshore areas.<br","U-864; sediment dispersal; hydrodynamic conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-06","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","60.770169,4.62432"

(mentor)","2017","As a result of increased economic development in Colombia, the pressure on the natural system has increased. The export of natural resources through international ports at both the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea causes conflicts between infrastructure and the dynamic behaviour of the coastal system. This Master Thesis focusses on the bay between Barranquilla and Santa Marta, along the Caribbean Sea. The case study combines structural erosion with an internationally recognized ecological zone and a vulnerable coastal highway (RN90) which connects the port of Barranquilla to the hinterland. The complex problem requires an integral approach, which aims at providing a most promising, long term solution to mitigate the adverse effects of coastal erosion. Relevant stakeholders were identified by means of a stakeholder analysis. No stakeholder was found who is responsible for coastal zone management in Colombia. The lack of ownership of the problem led to a late identification of the problem and resulted in the necessity to construct an emergency revetment along the RN90 at KM19. The processes driving the coastal erosion are: The natural relocation of the Rio Magdalena, the decreased supply of sediment from the Rio Magdalena and the strong gradient in alongshore sediment transport along the bay. The coastline development was predicted using different methods for several time scales. For short time scales (<5 years) historic coastline positions were analysed using satellite images. On intermediate time scales (5 -50 years) the process-based coastline model UNIBEST was used. The equilibrium bay position was estimated using MEPBAY, which is based on the Parabolic Bay Shape Method. Continuous, structural (long-term) erosion should be anticipated in the middle sections of the bay, since a timescale in the order of a thousand years is estimated before the bay reaches an equilibrium position. Using the predicted coastline development, two critical locations along the RN90 were identified; at KM19 immediate action is required and at KM28 action should be taken within the next 15 years. Six alternatives were defined to mitigate the adverse effects of erosion at the critical locations. The measures were implemented in UNIBEST to predict the coastline development. The impact of the alternatives was evaluated using a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA), with the criteria defined as the stakeholder requirements resulting from the stakeholder analysis. Hard coastal protection works, such as the “Revetment”, “Breakwater” and “Groin Field”, can provide local protection for critical locations by shifting the erosion away from the critical locations to the downstream area. However they are expected to become very costly over time as the static constructions require extensive maintenance and scour protection in the highly dynamic coast zone. The alternative “Nourishment” was best appreciated in the qualitative scoring, however the benefits of a nourishment are not appreciated enough to account for the relatively high costs. The most promising alternative is identified as the alternative “Relocate Road”. On the basis of the predicted coastline development a new road is built more landward at the critical locations. The solution requires limited intervention in the coastal zone and can be combined with the already planned highway expansion. An addition study is required to select the most suitable highway alignment taking into account the local soil characteristics. In general it is advised to assign coastal management to an existing or new governmental body, to ensure coastal protection is organized on a nation level. This will not only concentrate coastal knowledge, but will allow for monitoring and pre-emptive actions as well to avoid the necessity for short-term emergency solutions.","Colombia; Caribbean Coast; Rio Magdalena; ‘Ruta Nacional 90’; RN90; Coastal erosion; Alongshore transport; Erosion mitigation; Multi-criteria analysis; Delft3D-WAVE; UNIBEST; MEPBAY","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Civil engineering","","11.00000, -74.50000"

The process of moving a structure from the onshore quayside to the barge or ship is called the load-out. This load-out can be performed by lifting, skidding or using a trailer (SPMT). This thesis research focused only on a skidded load-out onto a barge.<br/>During the load-out the weight of the jacket or topside is gradually transferred from the quay to the barge. The barge gradually takes more of the load so ballast water needs to be continuously pumped or discharged depending on the location of the structure and the location of the ballast tank concerned. Improper ballasting during this process will cause the alignment between the quay and the barge to be disrupted which in turn causes peak loads in the topside or jacket and the barge. It is questioned if there are more suitable ballasting methods or a structural solution in order to lower these peak loads? It is also modeled what the effects are of quayside stiffness and the best method to model this stiffness.<br/>Therefore a 2-D representation of the entire load-out is made. This model will be made using the finite element method, via a numerical model, in MATLAB. A base case load-out of a topside will be applied to this model. Using this model, optimizing the ballast configuration will be researched. Several different criteria for the optimization were tested and its different effects on the forces during the load-out were researched and quantified. The structural solution of relocating the skidbeams to an area of lower deck stiffness was also tested and the results studied. The effects of the quayside stiffness and modelling methods were also quantified using the 2-D MATLAB model.<br/>The conclusion derived from the optimizations is that there are other ballast configurations which perform better in reducing the peak forces experienced during the load-out. The key to these optimizations is that they keep the barge-quay alignment as perfect as possible. If a critical element is present in the load-out the ballast configuration can be adjusted to lower the forces in this specific element. The results of the simulation in which the skidbeams were relocated show that this approach has no beneficial effects in reducing the forces during the load-out, mainly due to the presence of the transverse bulkheads in het barge. Furthermore for the modelling of the quayside it was proven that especially when using a low stiffness quayside, modelling the quayside without taking into account the foundation layer stiffness is inaccurate and can lead to lower forces in the model than which occur in reality.","load-out; optimization; skidded; ballast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first phase of sustainable innovation is idea generation. Ideas for improvement can come from all employees, among whom employees that operate machines. The problem is that companies that strive for sustainable innovation often do not use the potential of their operators’ ideas for improvement. Therefore, this research aims to gain insight in how companies that strive for sustainable innovation can facilitate operators to display promotive voice. When operators share their ideas for improvement, this is called promotive voice. This leads to the research question: How can changes in the organizational context increase the probability that operators display promotive voice in companies that strive for sustainable innovation? Sub-questions are (i) What stimulates and limits promotive voice, according to literature? (ii) To what extent do operators, team leaders and management at Van Houtum B.V. find sustainability an important motive for improvement? (iii) To what extent do operators at Van Houtum B.V. perceive barriers and stimulants to display promotive voice? (iv) How can Van Houtum B.V. increase the likelihood that operators display promotive voice by changing the organizational context? This research question will be answered for one case company, by performing a design-based research. A theoretical framework is constructed and applied to this case study. An intervention aims to change an element of the organizational context. The effect of this intervention is used to reflect on the theoretical framework. According to the theoretical framework, companies that strive for sustainable innovation can increase the likelihood that operators display promotive voice by influencing a set of individual and contextual constructs, or by influencing how important their employees value different motives for an idea. (A motive for an idea is how important the individual assesses the envisioned outcome of the idea.) At the case company, eight motives for an idea were identified; to make work processes safer, more sustainable, cheaper, cleaner, easier, faster, give more production, or produce products with better quality. According to importance, respondents ranked the motive more sustainable on the third place, out of eight. Besides, operators appeared to experience many barriers and stimulants for promotive voice, of which the greatest barrier was the feeling that their ideas are not heard. An intervention that aimed to reduce this barrier indeed resulted in an increased likelihood that operators display promotive voice, but this effect was limited. According to team leaders, the likelihood that operators display promotive voice had slightly increased, because operators felt more heard. Yet, operators did not notice this change. In conclusion: In theory, there are many starting points for companies to increase the likelihood that operators display promotive voice, but in practice it is not easy to effectively change the organizational context in favor of promotive voice. The revised theoretical framework replaced individual and contextual constructs by critical variables for promotive voice. By validating `being heard' as a critical variable and identifying more critical variables, further research can develop a model that describes the decision of individuals to display promotive voice.","","","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Science Education and Communication","","Science Communication","",""

A CAD model for the structure concept is generated in ParaPy , a KBE framework with CAD integration and coupling to various aerodynamic and structure analysis tools.<br/><br/>A numerical sizing method is selected due to the complexity of the airframe geometry. A model generatoris developed in ParaPy , a KBE-framework with integration of a meshing algorithm and coupling to aerodynamic and structural analysis tools. A CAD model is obtained from the model generator using<br/>a mission parameter set similar to that of an Airbus A350. The model is meshed using the SALOME algorithm for a finite element analysis.<br/><br/>The mesh is exported to Patran for a Nastran analysis. Between ParaPy and Patran, mesh element IDs are altered. This disables a feedback-enabled design loop. Analysis results cannot be interpreted in ParaPy . Automated design is foregone. <br/><br/>Patran mesh verification highlights critical and non-critical mesh errors due to the chosen geometry generation procedure. The flawed elements are redefined manually. Point and distributed loads are applied. Aerodynamic loads are obtained from Airbus’ LatticeBeta full-potential 3D panel method. Uniform material properties are assigned. Due to the thin-shelled nature of the model, out-of-plane element bending stiffness is low. Excessive deformations are observed under transverse load application and in-plane panel compression. A bending stiffness correction is applied.<br/><br/>The model is sized for material failure and local buckling by Airbus’ in-house structure sizing tool ZORRO. A validation is set up using outboard wing cross-sections. These are sized using analytical relations given the numerical procedure loads. From this it is concluded individual regions can only be assessed qualitatively due to the bending stiffness correction applied in the numerical model. Wrongly designed structure regions and load path propagation can be interpreted. Quantitative results are not omitted<br/>from the result interpretation. <br/><br/>An unforeseen load path is identified in the wing transition between the outboard wing front spar and root plane trailing edge. The integration of tapered fuselage within the wing transition is feasible, although the fuselage attracts more loads than anticipated. <br/><br/>The fuselage transition behaves as expected. Integration of the oval cabin concept into a the Flying V configuration is shown to be feasible and beneficial to volume efficiency and planform design flexibility. However, the existing implementation of the cabin concept must be altered for better adaptation in existing regulations.<br/><br/>The assumed static stability as optimised for by Faggiano shows large discrepancy with respect to the determined static margin. Part of this is caused by the incorrect quantitative sizing results. However, it is expected that the aerodynamic profile may be significantly altered in a multi-disciplinary design<br/>procedure. <br/><br/>In order to obtain a correct mass estimation, a new model generation procedure is recommended in detail. This takes multiple facets into account. Geometric model continuity is ensured. A straightforward implementation of stiffener elements is enabled by introducing a foundation for this on the<br/>top-level fuselage model definition. This also adds more possibilities for designing the aft half of an aerodynamic profile for the fuselage section of the planform.<br/><br/>Feasible design automation consequently enables multidisciplinary optimisation. The main hurdles to overcome towards realising design automation are development of a complete model generator, further development of ParaPy ’s geometry generation and Nastran coupling functionalities and feedback between analysis results and model generation. Realising these aspects in future research will finally allow solid conclusions regarding the Flying V performance to be drawn.","Flying V; structure concept; kbe; knowledge-base engineering; knowledge-based engineering; model generation automation; automated modelling; parapy; airbus; oval fuselage; unconventional configuration; flying wing; blended wing body; BWB; FW; salome; patran; zorro; latticebeta; lattice beta; preliminary design; aircraft; airplane; aerospace; numerical sizing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying V Research",""

As a result, the number of joint replacements is expected to grow substantially within the next decade. Today’s hip replacements have the potential to function for more than 20 years, but due to risk factors such as aseptic loosening, the younger patients will most certainly outlive their prostheses. Aseptic loosening refers to the mechanical failure of the implant-bone interface, which may arise as the end result of stress shielding or improper design. In places where the bone is understressed for prolonged periods of time, bone resorption will set in, which can eventually lead to implant failure. Optimization of this bone-implant interface is therefore of utter importance to increase the implant’s longevity. Recent advances in additive manufacturing (AM) have enabled the fabrication of highly-complex micro-architectures, which can be designed to exhibit novel mechanical properties at the macroscale. The development of these mechanical metamaterials has paved the way for personalized, life-lasting implants. This explorative study aimed to investigate the mechanical properties of 3D AM (hybrid) mechanical metamaterials and their potential to improve the mechanical fixation of off-axially loaded AM meta-implants, using the mechanical responsiveness of bone. The mechanical properties of six different 3D AM mechanical metamaterials were assessed during axial compression, with the help of Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Combinations of mechanical metamaterials were made to obtain novel 3D hybrid mechanical metamaterials, for which the expansions and initiated strain distributions were determined using DIC, upon off-axial compression. Finally, five different meta-implants (femoral stems) were designed. A compression was applied at the femoral head to examine the strain distributions in the surrounding, bone-mimicking foam blocks. Hybrid meta-implant Type 2 showed the most continuous compressive strain distribution, with a considerably different lateral strain profile compared to the current generation of femoral stems. These studies therefore demonstrate the potential of applying hybrid mechanical metamaterials in off-axially loaded meta-implants, such as the femoral stem, to initiate bilateral strains and potentially stimulate osseointegration at the bone-implant interface.","additive manufacturing; meta-implants; hybrid mechanical metamaterials; mechanical metamaterials; Poisson's ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-14","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mugge, W. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Human movement relies on noisy processes in neurons, muscle cells and sensory cells. Therefore, movements are variable and can never be exactly reproduced. The nervous system seems to exploit this movement noise for motor learning and specifically motor adaptation. However, a positive relation between movement noise and motor adaptation has not been consistently found in motor adaptation literature. Possibly, noise is comprised of distinct processes which contribute to motor adaptation in different ways. In Kalman filter theory, motor adaptation rate is calculated optimally from state noise and output noise, with state noise and adaptation rate positively correlated and output noise and adaptation rate negatively correlated. Therefore, if people learn (close) optimally from error, we would expect a similar relation. To investigate the relation between state noise, output noise and adaptation rate, we performed a visuomotor reaching adaptation experiment with a baseline and a perturbation block in 69 subjects. State noise, output noise and adaptation rate in the baseline and perturbation block were extracting using Bayesian fitting of a trial-to-trial state-space model. We found that adaptation rate in the perturbation block correlates positively with baseline state noise (r=0.27; 95%HDI=[0.05 0.50]) and negatively with baseline output noise (r= 0.41; 95%HDI=[ 0.63 0.16]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from baseline state and output noise correlated positively with adaptation rate in the perturbation block (r = 0.31; 95%HDI = [0.09 0.54]). Therefore, noise can be viewed both as a supporting factor for motor adaptation (state noise) and as a noise factor hampering optimal performance (output noise), and in order to understand the relationship of noise to learning, one must decompose noise into its constituent components.","Motor learning; noise; genetics; visuomotor adaptation; motor planning; human","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-01","","","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This project is based on the design of a hydraulic-wind-mill powered reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant (Freshwatermill), focusing on increasing the energy efficiency of the system. While RO membranes are generally not designed for variable operation, wind energy has a characteristic unpredictability and variability. In particular, the project focuses on enabling the combination of RO and wind energy by finding a system configuration that will enable increasing the operating range in order to maximise the production of fresh water with the available wind energy without the use of energy storage. The proposed solution is to use the strategy of unit switching, in which multiple equally smaller RO membrane pressure vessel units can be switched on or off depending on the power supply in order to maintain the membranes within their optimal operating conditions of As a first step, an experimental set-up is designed to test the behaviour of the RO system with a varying power supply and to measure how much fresh water production can be expected with the selected equipment depending on wind power. The test will then define whether the strategy of unit switching proves to be advantageous over a more traditional layout with a fixed numbers of units. After testing this strategy it is decided to reject it and opt for a fixed number of RO units as this is more advantageous in terms of fresh water quantity produced as well comprising a simpler and more robust RO system. Although the fixed RO system slightly lowers the fresh water quality at low powers, the level of salts remains within an acceptable range for drinking standards. Furthermore, with the fluctuating wind energy source, the lower quality water produced at low powers will combine higher quality water produced at higher powers resulting in an averaged out water quality in the long term. In a second part a computer model will then be developed to carry out simulations on a complete Freshwatermill system (including the windmill and hydraulic drive-train) to test its performance as a whole. This allows determining the capacity of RO to couple to the hydraulic windmill in order to exploiting the full range of available wind power and maximise the fresh water production. A financial analysis is finally performed to evaluate whether increasing the RO capacity is worth the investment of additional components.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","Sustainable Energy Technology (SET)","",""

(mentor)","2017","After stroke, functional recovery may be promoted during the first six months through rehabilitation. Several events are thought to lead to regaining lost functions, among which the remapping of affected limbs to other regions of the cortex is a frequent occurrence. High spatial resolution brain imaging techniques, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be used to observe the affected areas and assess the severity of the lesions, but are unable to provide much insight on dynamic changes in brain function. An alternative non-invasive technique possessing an excellent temporal resolution to observe transient events is electroencephalography (EEG), a method limited by a low spatial resolution. This study aims to combine 62-channel EEG recordings with anatomical information derived from structural MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to improve the low resolution of EEG. During EEG acquisition, stroke patients (N = 3) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 2) received electrical impulses at both index fingers, stimulating both brain hemispheres sequentially through somatosensory feedback. After a static estimation of the current time series of candidate sources distributed over the brain cortex, a multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model was used to estimate the causal interactions between those found to be active due to the applied stimulus. The result was a visualization of the information transfer between active sources. A reasonably accurate estimation was achieved, even in presence of low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of EEG. Physiologically plausible source locations and connecting pathways were found, but an explanation of the observed phenomena and the interpretation of the differences between patients and controls is beyond the scope of this thesis, as a more extensive study is needed for this purpose. Consistent results found within subjects provide evidence of the potential value of this method in longitudinal studies, even when a comparison between subjects were not possible due to confounding factors (i.e. SNR differences). The obtained results support the candidacy of this method in the study of stroke, as it was found to be useful to track the information flow in the brain and might constitute a first step towards the development of a precise prognostic model of stroke.","source localization; EEG; connectivity; MAR model; dynamic model; Bayesian estimation; stroke","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMedical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Bananas are the fourth most eaten product in the world. In Europe almost 4 million tonnes of bananas are consumed every year. These bananas need to be imported from plantations in, among others, Latin America. Due to the perishable nature of bananas the transport from plantation to Europe is done in cooled reefer containers. During transport the considered ripening stage is the green life period because of its ability to be influenced by external factors. The ripening rate within the green life period is largely dependent on temperature. Energy consumption for cooling is dependent on temperature. The current cooling strategy is keeping temperatures as low as possible without damaging the bananas, which asks for maximum energy consumption. This article proposes a cooling strategy which results in higher temperatures inside the container with the goal to minimize energy consumption which ultimately results in lower transport costs. In this article a model is developed to combine biological and logistical features of the banana supply chain. To assure right quality, continuous monitoring inside a reefer is used to check the ripening process and detect disturbances in ripening rate. To cope with the disturbances and delays in the supply chain a controller is designed which can adjust temperature during the journey. This is done to adjust the ripening rate and make sure the bananas reach the customer at the right quality at the right time while using up to 10% less energy than conventional cooling strategies.","Banana supply chain; green life; energy reduction; continuous monitoring; system and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

In practice, understanding the inner workings of software requires studying the source code and documentation and inserting logging code to map high-level descriptions of the program behavior with low-level implementation, i.e., the source code. Unfortunately, for large codebases and large log files, such cognitive mapping can be quite challenging. To bridge the cognitive gap between the source code and detailed models of program behavior, prior software-execution mining research primarily focused on reducing the size of the low-level instruction execution traces. In contrast, in this thesis we propose a generic approach to present a semantic abstraction with different levels of functional granularity from full execution traces. Our approach mines multiple execution traces to identify frequent behaviors at multiple levels of abstraction, and then analyzes and labels individual execution traces according to the identified major functional behaviors of the system. To validate our technique, we conducted a case study on a large-scale subject program, Javac, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mining result. Furthermore, the results of a user study demonstrate that our technique is capable of presenting users with a high-level comprehensible abstraction of execution behavior.","Dynamic Analysis; Visualization; Hierarchical Abstraction; Labeling; software","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Thomassen, E.W. (mentor)","2017","The graduation project This graduation project was executed for EDS – Casting & Forging B.V. (EDS). EDS (Engineering Design and Supply) is a company which is particularly involved in the designing of products and parts for other companies. These are metal products or parts which are mostly produced by casting. EDS reduces the weight and costs by analysing the relevant load cases and by designing products in a more critical way. EDS wishes to create a product that is able to collect and analyse the loads from real-life scenarios and therefore desires to eliminate the use of safety factors on load cases. Therefore, the assignment of this graduation project was to develop a method or tool that defines and analyses load cases derived real-life situations. At the start of the design process there are many uncertainties, the load cases of which are most critical for optimised design. The problem is that load cases are difficult to come by and an incorrect interpretation yields enormous risk. The current solution is to apply case-specific safety factors of up to a factor of five, this causes the resulting design to be heavier than necessary. EDS has to deal with this problem during the start of a design project. The later in the process, the more expensive it will be. Currently the uncertainties during this stage of the design project are filled in with assumptions for the program of requirements. Which load case and for what scenario is going to be designed is discussed with the client. This scenario should be a real-life scenario where no assumptions are needed since all the relevant values are known. Research made clear that clients tend to base the value of an applied safety factor on their gut feelings. From there the following vision was created: “Too many times a client’s decision is based on gut feelings during the analysis phase of a project. This should be replaced by facts and measured values”. By measuring the real load cases, the client can see what really happens with his product under certain circumstances and will be able to agree on using measured input instead of assumptions supplemented with a safety factor. Research Questions A combination of the company problem, the problem context and a developed vision resulted in the following research question: “How can load cases be gathered from real-life scenarios and how can that change the conceptual design process of EDS?” This question has been divided into three sub-questions to make it more easy to answer. The three sub-questions are: - How could real-life load cases change the concept design process? - How could real-life load cases convince clients to let go of their gut feeling? - How could load cases be gathered from real-life scenarios? To focus primarily on the loads that the particular part/product of a certain project undergoes is chosen as the scope for this project. It will not be necessary to analyse every possible scenario, since the client knows best what happens with his products and is the one who can decide what is acceptable. Fatigue and stress analyses are also out of scope of this project, because they are only relevant when the loads are known already. The solution Three types of hardware were analysed in order to develop a tool that is able to gather load cases from real-life scenarios. These types were load cells, accelerometers and strain gauges. Supported by a program of requirements, the strain gauges were chosen as the most suitable hardware for further development of the measuring tool. To answer the first two sub-questions, a future vision for EDS was developed. This future vision includes a new workflow and a future scenario. In this workflow is showed how the measuring tool changes the design process and in the scenario is explained how this tool convinces clients to let go of their gut feeling. With the strain gauges as starting point, a new measuring method was developed. The final concept is based on the kind of load cells that are made with strain gauges. Step by step this concept was developed based on mechanics theory and tested by SolidWorks simulations and real-life tests. Eventually the results of these tests made clear how sensitive and accurate the measuring method is. A case study was done in order to give an example of what the result could be if this measuring method is going to be used to gather real-life load cases. Further development will be needed in order to solve some limitations, but eventually this method will result in a more responsible way of using raw materials and huge cost reductions.","Load case; Measuring; Strain gauge; Concept design; Casting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Sypesteyn, M. (mentor); Snik, F.

However, light pollution and the complexity of optical instruments have made us lose touch with the splendour of the universe. An opportunity was found to remedy this issue by combining binoculars with augmented reality technology. This project was initiated to explore the development of this envisioned product. The major challenge in the project was found in the multidisciplinary approach required to obtain meaningful information about all aspects of developing the envisioned product. Some examples are optical engineering, information technology, user experience design and astronomy. All human, technology and business aspects were analysed to determine who the target user is and what this user wants from the product, how the product should work and how it can achieve a competitive advantage in the market. The results indicated that binoculars are ideal for astronomical observation because of their wide field of view and straightforward use. By digitally augmenting the natural view through the binoculars, the envisioned product can make it easier to discover celestial objects and to explore the night sky. The augmentation also makes it possible to show objects that are normally hard to spot, make smaller details visible and allow the user to interact with objects of interest. The result makes astronomy more accessible, less abstract and visually more immersive than traditional tools such as telescopes. From a technical perspective, further development was focused on seamlessly combining the natural and digital view. A custom optical construction, including specialised projectors and beamsplitters, was designed in order to match the perceived resolution, brightness level and focal distance of both views. From a psychological perspective, focus was put on evoking the ‘overview eﬀect’. This emotional response is deﬁned as a cognitive shift in awareness, created by truly understanding how immense the universe is; and how small we are. By oﬀering the user a way to visually understand the relationships between celestial objects, he or she is able to put the immense scale of the cosmos in perspective. Augmented reality was found to be perfectly suited for this purpose, because it maintains a clear visual connection to reality; unlike virtual reality, which replaces it completely with digital imagery. In order to prove the technical feasibility of the product, a functional prototype was created. Using a smartphone as the image source, custom digital content was successfully overlaid on the natural view through a pair of existing binoculars. The sensors inside the smartphone could be used to sync the content with the movement of the binoculars, creating an experience that comes close to the one oﬀered by the envisioned product. Together with an interactive computer simulation and a mock-up of a mobile application, the prototype was used to evaluate the actual user experience with target users. The results indicated that the envisioned product is successful at making astronomy more accessible by simplifying exploration of the night sky and at providing a visually immersive and entertaining experience. However, more work is required to ﬁnd a better way to make astronomy less abstract. The thesis was concluded with suggestions on how to do so, and provides recommendations for further development.","augmented reality; binoculars; telescopes; astronomy; astronomical observation; optical engineering; cyberware","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Sliggers, P.G.F. (mentor); van der Male, P. (mentor); Kwa, Marcus (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Renewable energy generated by offshore wind turbines (OWT) are nowadays more frequently used in the offshore industry. The design of OWT foundations share similarities with a typical offshore oil and gas construction, however a OWT farm usually consist of multiple foundations whose installation are more cost-sensitive compared to one oil and gas platform. Furthermore the profit target of the wind farm is generated at a later stage of the project. Thereby it is preferable to design a light OWT foundation that is cheaply fabricated and easily installed.<br/>Due to these reasons the OWTs are designed as slender constructions. When designing a structure the aim is to generate a design of which the natural frequencies do not overlap with the applied forcing frequencies. This is required to avoid resonance which results in low estimated fatigue life of the structure. A challenge regarding the slender OWT structures is that the natural frequencies are close to the forcing frequencies.<br/>This thesis is based on a project having OWT structures with the foundation consisting of a jacket design having a framework of four bays of cross braces. During a later stage of the project it was found by the substructure designer that the structure would have a low estimated fatigue life. The cause being that the applied external forces on the structure are in the same frequency range as the natural frequency of particular cross braces in the jackets, in the range of 2 – 2.5Hz. Consequently, due to resonance large brace excitation was found in the jacket model, created by the designer, which resulted in a low expected fatigue life. To mitigate this, double sided welds and external toe grinding were implemented. However no clear explanation regarding this issue was provided and not all parties involved obtained the same results and conclusions. Therefore further investigation regarding this theoretic fatigue issue was requested.<br/>The goal of this research is to identify and provide a clear explanation of the vibration amplification movement of the braces and thus independently assess if there is a fatigue problem with the OWT jackets. Furthermore this thesis focusses on alternative solutions to this problem, had the vibration issue been found during an earlier stage of the project.<br/>The first part of this thesis focusses on the identification of the problem. The approach was structured in three stages;<br/>First the identification of the forcing vibration in the critical frequency zone was performed with the use of a Fast Fourier analysis of time domain data of the applied forces on the OWT. The obtained frequency response demonstrated excitations around the critical frequency zone, which are due to the eigen-frequencies of the tower and the blades of the turbine.<br/>This was followed by the analysis of the eigen-frequencies of the cross braces of the jacket in bay 3 and 4 for the local and global response. This was performed with the use of ANSYS modal analysis in combination with a build-up of simplified brace models. Hand calculations were performed to verify the obtained results.<br/>Finally, a comparison was made regarding the overlapping of frequencies of the forcing frequencies and eigen-frequencies of the braces. This was done to determine if large brace amplification due to resonance would occur, resulting in a low estimated fatigue life.<br/>The second part of this research evaluates alternative solutions to this problem. Possible concepts were elaborated with their ad- and disadvantages, followed by a multi criteria analysis. Three concepts were selected for further investigation and examined in terms of whether a successful outcome could be achieved by their implementation.<br/>This thesis also provides a procedure with regards to identifying to the potential for resonance at an early stage of the design process. Keeping track of changes during all design phases will lead to avoiding the unexpected discovery of a short fatigue life, due to resonance, at a late design stage.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","Turbomachines have experienced a fast development over the last years, and are present in a wide range of devices involved in the generation of electricity and the transportation sector. Current challenges in both sectors have driven quite a number of developments regarding the increase of efficiency and use of new types of devices. Those changes have also affected turbomachinery design, and new innovative approaches are being used in order to solve current problems. As the design of those machines is sometimes done without lot of prior knowledge, new design techniques are required. Design optimization is usually involving a wide range of disciplines. When it comes to turbomachinery applications, this becomes more challenging as there are lot of parameters involved in the design. The heterogeneous range of applications imposes challenges from the designer point of view as different architectures may need to be considered, different working fluids, different number of stages, etc. In this Master Thesis, the problem of multi-stage turbomachinery analysis will be undertaken. Simulation of multi-stage turbomachinery presents a number of limitations when it comes both to modelling of the problem and the use of CFD codes, among which the main one is the modelling of the stator-rotor interface. To overcome this problem, a number of solutions are proposed, of which some are presented in the present report. The Mixing-Plane interface is one of the most used, especially when design optimization is considered. The Mixing-Plane interface creates an artificial interface between turbomachinery blade rows which forces the match of the average of physical quantities at both upstream and downstream sides of the interface. However, since in general specialised turbomachinery solvers are multi-block structured, current approaches based on the Mixing-Plane interface are not adapted to unstructured edge based solvers. This imposes limitations in the mesh types that can be used for simulating turbomachinery, and add some design constrains. In this Master Thesis the existing methods are analysed and extended to the edge based unstructured solver SU2. After implementing the proposed approach, a multi-stage turbine for which experimental data is available is simulated. By comparing the results with the experiments and simulations with another CFD solver, the implemented method is validated.","turbomachinery; CFD; mixing plane; multi-stage; NRBC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","MSc Aerospace Engineering.

The outcome of this analysis helped to define the five concepts directions for smart applications: smart communication, virtual situational awareness, contextual navigation, monitoring health and artificial senses. The monitoring health direction is chosen as the most promising. It has the potential to prevent physiological injuries and it could be a first step towards data collection at the fire department. This could contribute to a more efficient and safe fire department. On the basis of this design direction, a concept proposal for a smart system is developed: the QuantiFire. This system improves the communication between firefighters by making smart use of digital audio and it helps in preventing injuries from heat related illnesses. Through rapid prototyping and several iterations, the system is embodied resulting in a smart earpiece and a connected smartphone app. Finally the concept proposal is tested on its core assumptions.

Wind energy is a promising technology with rapid developments and the installed base of wind turbines is continuously increasing. Currently, the majority of the installed wind turbines can be categorised under the direct drive wind turbine and the gearbox turbine. Both technologies have a substantial market share and the technological developments in this industry are advancing rapidly. At this stage, it is uncertain which technology will become the dominant design in the future. Therefore, both designs are analysed in this research by the application of the Best-Worst-Method, a type of Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making model. First, a list of factors for technology dominance is established for the technology battle between direct drive and gearbox wind turbines by conducting interviews with experts in the wind turbine market. The relevance of these factors is determined in a literature study. This results in a set of relevant factors that are ranked during a second round of interviews among four categories of experts in the wind turbine market. Furthermore, the experts will ranked the direct drive and gearbox technology with respect to the relevant factors for this specific case. This methodology is applied during three phases of the technology dominance process. Hereby is empirically determined if there is a change in the importance of factors and final technology score throughout the dominance process. This provides insight in which of both designs is most likely to become the dominant design in the future. During this study, a list of 8 relevant factors for the technology battle between direct drive and gearbox wind turbines has been established and two new factors are found. These factors and two technologies have been ranked in three phases of the dominance process resulting in a ranked list of factors and a final technology score. Based on this it is found that the importance of factors varies between the three phases of the dominance process. Furthermore, it is found that before the technology battle the gearbox wind turbine scored highest and that currently the transition from gearbox to direct drive wind turbines is going on. Our data proves that the direct drive wind turbine will win the technology battle and will become dominant. However, we also found that the wind turbine market cannot be considered as a “winner takes it all” market. Implying that the gearbox and direct drive wind turbine can coexist, where the direct drive is the dominant technology. In this study a new factor was found (rate of adoption) that allows both technologies to coexist. We suggest to further analyse the effects of this factor in future research to provide a body of cases to confirm the effect of the rate of adoption on coexistence. Furthermore, it is suggested to research the effect of policies with respect to the factors for technology dominance that have been found to speed up the adoption of wind turbines as a renewable energy source. Finally, we propose to construct a framework that provides an overview of which factors apply to which industry. This framework can serve as a valuable managing/ decision making tool.","Renewable Energy; Sutainability; Energy Transition; WInd turbine; Direct drive; Gearbox; Best-Worst-Method; Technology dominance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Farah, H. (mentor); Broeren, P.T.W. (mentor); van Gelder, P.H.A.J.M. (mentor)","2017","Weaving sections are frequently applied on Dutch freeways. Guidelines are present for designing those freeway weaving sections. However, the origin of these guidelines is unclear and it is not always possible to apply the guidelines. Dutch road designers and road safety experts are searching for methods to evaluate the safety of a (proposed) design more quantitatively than is currently done by expert judgement. An alternative option would be to determine safety of Dutch weaving sections using VISSIM micro-simulation models in combination with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). SSAM is able to calculate the number of conflicts that occurred in a micro-simulation model using the surrogate safety measures time-to-collision (TTC) and post-encroachment-time (PET). A conflict is an observable situation in which two or more road users approach each-other such that there is a risk of collision if their movement remains unchanged. The goal of this master thesis research is to assess whether this number of conflicts observed from VISSIM microsimulation models using SSAM is representing safety (crash rate) of Dutch weaving sections. For that nine Dutch weaving sections were selected, and were ranked based on four criteria: (I) the crash rate from the BRON crash database, (II) the conflict rate (conflicts per number of vehicle kilometres) calculated from VISSIM micro-simulations using SSAM, (III) the expected number of crashes calculated using the crash prediction model developed by Iliadi et al. [29], and (IV) the judgement of road safety experts. The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient was calculated between these rankings, to validate the ranking based on the conflict rate. For initial VISSIM and SSAM settings, a correlation of 0.567 was found between the crash rate and conflict rate ranking, indicating a reasonable fit. However, due to the small sample size this correlation is not significant (𝑃-value is 0.112). The effects of some micro-simulation settings, conflict analysis thresholds and the calibration method are assessed in a sensitivity analysis. Reducing the TTC threshold from 1.5 seconds to 0.5 seconds resulted improved the correlation between the conflict rate and the crash rate. However, changing other settings resulted in a weaker correlation. Although different than expected, extending the calibration process by adding calibration on speeds resulted in a weaker correlation. Hence care should be taken when using conflicts calculated by VISSIM and SSAM as (only) predictor for safety of Dutch weaving sections. It is recommended to expand the selection of weaving sections to assess whether a larger sample results in a stronger, significant, correlation. Also, it can be assessed how a more extensive calibration of VISSIM parameters affects the correlation between the conflict rate and other measures. Furthermore, crash numbers might have more impact on policy makers and public perceptions than alternatives such as conflicts and surrogate safety measures.","traffic safety; weaving sections; surrogate safety measures; SSAM; conflicts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Jurors cannot directly observe the state of nature, but only a noisy signal, that is correlated with the true state of nature.

Not all jurors vote simultaneously, and jurors that vote later are informed on what previous jurors have voted. We want to know what the optimal role assignment, if we have jurors with different ability levels. In a two juror advisor-decider scheme, the first juror has the role of advisor and the second juror is the decider. The advisor passes his vote to the decider, and the decider’s choice is the final decision the of the whole decision process. For random signals with linear-, β- and Gaussian probability densities, the best jurors should be the decider. For three member casting vote schemes, the first two jurors vote simultaneously. If the decision is not unanimous, then there is no majority decision, and the casting juror breaks the tie. Besides receiving his own signal, the casting juror is informed on what the other jurors have voted. For random signals with linear-, β - and Gaussian densities, reliability is maximised, when the median ability juror has the casting vote.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

Such methods include among others the observation of radial velocity, transit photometry, and timing variations. These techniques allow for the vast majority of exoplanet detections up to date. An example for a very successful detection that has been achieved recently is the TRAPPIST-1 system. Indirect methods like these can provide us with estimates of a planet’s size and orbit for Earth-like planets. Yet, when we would like to detect life outside our Solar System, the fact alone that a planet lies in the habitable zone and that it has the right size is not a guarantee, but an indication of possible habitability. In order to have absolute certainty, a direct analysis of the atmosphere is needed. Direct observations would allow for a first-hand spectroscopy of the atmosphere in order to search for bio-signatures. These bio-signatures are markers created through biological processes and are indicative of life. Such elements include oxygen, ozone, nitrous oxide and methane. In order to allow for direct observations of Earth-like exoplanets, the New Worlds Observer (NWO) has been proposed as part of NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC). NWO is a space-based observatory that will search for Earth-like planets that are located in the habitable zone in neighboring stellar systems. NWO consists of two spacecraft: a 4 m aperture-diameter diffraction-limited telescope and an occulter, called Starshade, which is 50 m in diameter. These spacecraft are located thousands of kilometers apart. This thesis discusses an analysis of the behavior of a satellite pair to be used for a preliminary observation campaign design for the NWO mission concept. In this concept, the two NWO spacecraft are positioned in Halo orbits about the Sun-Earth L2 point. This study demonstrates a novel method that may be used to redirect NWO’s observation vector from one star to another using dynamical systems theory, taking advantage of the non-linear dynamics around L2.

(mentor); Infante Ferreira, C.A. (mentor)","2017","The oceans cover over 70% of the earth’s surface and are therewith the largest source of renewable heat available on the planet. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a process that exploits this low-grade oceanic heat. A heat engine is employed to generate electricity from the small temperature gradient that is available between the tropical surface water and deep seawater. The big advantage of OTEC is that it provides base-load power and it is especially interesting for tropical islands who currently rely heavily on diesel generators. The small temperature difference between the heat source and sink leads to a significant challenge to attain reasonable thermal efficiencies. The working fluid and the applied thermodynamic cycle significantly affect the thermal performance of the plant. In this work an analysis is made between pure ammonia and ammonia-water as the working fluid for an experimental OTEC set-up. Simulation software has been created and validated for the OTEC demo set-up in the Process & Energy laboratory of Mechanical Engineering at Delft University of Technology. The simulation software finds the operating conditions of the OTEC set-up with respect to the ammonia concentration of the working fluid, the geometry of the components and the mass flows of the system (cold & warm water and the working fluid). Each process unit is modelled separately to increase the flexibility of the model. The model is written in Python 2.7 and can use the REFPROP 9.0 database (Lemmon, Huber & McLinden, 2007) or CoolProp database (Bell et al., 2014) to determine the required properties of water and ammonia. For ammonia-water the thermodynamic properties are determined with the Ziegler & Trepp equation of state implementation by Rattner (Rattner and Garimella, 2016) and the transport properties by Condé (Condé, 2014). Water-water experiments have been conducted in order to empirically fit a heat transfer coefficient correlation. The result is a custom single phase water correlation - GoudKuik - for the heat transfer of water in the OTEC set-up. Component level validation with experimental data leads to the selection of the Donowski & Kandlikar heat transfer correlation (Donowski and Kandlikar, 2000) for the single phase behavior of ammonia(-water), and the two phase ammonia(-water) evaporation behavior is relatively well predicted by the Ayub correlation for direct expansion evaporators (Ayub, 2003). There are currently no two phase condensation correlations that predict the behavior of ammonia(-water) well enough. Therefore a surface area fraction correlation was fitted with the experimental data. An analysis of the experimental data leads to the conclusion that the saturation pressure of ammonia-water depends linearly on the liquid solution ammonia concentration. Therefore the power output also mainly depends on the liquid solution ammonia concentration. The power output is further decreased for a mixture due to a decrease in overall heat transfer coefficient in both the evaporator as well as the condenser. An increase in heat transfer area or Reynolds number of the flow can counteract this effect, then ideal Kalina cycle operating conditions can likely be achieved. A model optimization leads to the optimal operating conditions for the OTEC set-up for several ammonia concentrations. Though the difference between ammonia and ammonia-water (96%) becomes smaller in terms of power output and thermal efficiency, pure ammonia remains superior. The off-design performance of the set-up is analyzed with two case studies for different in- and outlet (sea)water temperatures for 96% ammonia-water and 100%. In both cases pure ammonia still outperforms ammonia-water, though there was one scenario where the thermal efficiency of 96\% ammonia-water was higher than pure ammonia. Ammonia-water also shows more steady behavior between different boundary conditions which can be beneficial for large fluctuations in (sea)water temperatures. From the results of this work an updated Kalina cycle configuration should be designed and compared to optimized Organic Rankine cycle design (both single as well as multi-stage) before a conclusive decision can be reached about the superiority of pure ammonia over ammonia-water.","Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion; working fluid mixtures; Kalina cycle; Organic Rankine Cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy (P&E)","","","",""

A hand luggage problem occurs when the amount of hand luggage brought to the gate exceeds the available space in the cabin. First an overview was created of all insights to indicate the deeper reasoning why hand luggage problems occur, focusing on different point in the passenger journey and different involved parties (e.g., Transavia office, handler, cabin crew, airport). Motivating passengers to voluntarily check in their hand luggage at the check-in desk would (partly) solve the hand luggage problems, since there is a certain amount of pieces filtered out of the process. A message is shown in the internet check-in flow in which benefits one may gain by doing so are emphasized. Benefits concern the allowance for big liquids, a more stressfree experience at security and no hassle with carrying items you do not need until your destination (e.g., clothes, toiletries). A test was conducted by showing the message to actual passengers towards 10 destinations, for duration of 4 days, therewith potentially targeting a lot of people. However, result show no clear positive, nor negative effects, which could be linked to the interference of this message. People do indicate however that they would be willing to make use of such option during their next flight. Eye tracking results show that the message attracts attention, though most cannot recall the information afterwards. It is therefore recommended to test this message for a longer period of time and via multiple communication channels rather than just the internet check-in flow.","hand luggage; passenger experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This thesis report considers a research about the usage of composites (fibre reinforced plastics) as structural material of a 7500 m3 gas carrier. The focus of this research is on two different subjects, namely the feasibility of producing such a structure and secondly to determine how the lightweight characteristics of this material can be utilised in the design of the ship and thereby generate financial benefits to the ship-owner. The first subject of the research consists of determining the feasibility of the production of the composite structure of a gas carrier. Existing production methods are only applied on ships that are much smaller than the considered gas carrier. Therefore, it is investigated if these methods are also feasible for larger ships and what the associated limitations and challenges are. Furthermore, a new production concept is proposed and analysed, which is able to overcome these limitations and challenges. The second subject of this research is about how the lightweight characteristics of composite materials can result in a better performing gas carrier. In this context, three different types of composites are considered ranging from a low-tech chopped strand fibre glass polyester to a high-tech carbon fibre epoxy. First, the reduction in structural weight is determined when these materials are used. Whereupon, it is researched how the corresponding weight reduction leads to a better designed ship. In order to determine the extent of the reduction in structural weight, a part of a ship structure is designed making use of these materials and steel. The latter one serves as a reference point. The weights of the partially designed structures are consequently used to estimate effect on the total weight of the ship when their structure is made from composites. Weight reduction can be implemented beneficial in the design of a ship in multiple ways. In this research, two approaches are applied, namely creating a design with equal design requirements, but with a lower fuel consumption. And the second applied approach is to compromise the reduction in weight by increasing the cargo capacity without changing the ship’s dimensions. For both options, the relating financial benefits for the ship-owner are described.","Composites; Fibre reinforced plastics; Gas carrier; liquefied gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

The combination of various failure modes (brittle and ductile) , anisotropic behaviour, contact of steel elements and large deformations that can occur in a timber joint challenges the use of FEM. To this date no widely used approach is available for the modelling of timber connections. This knowledge gap impedes the use of large timber connections for high rise buildings in seismic regions like New Zealand. For tall seismic resilient structures a profound understanding of the various failure modes of a connection is needed to guarantee a safe design. In this thesis a new model approach with the use of cohesive elements to simulate cracking is investigated for the prediction of the mechanical behaviour of connections. An embedment test simulation is a logical step towards this connection model.<br/><br/>Timber can be characterised by its strong longitudinal fibres and the lignin that forms the bonding between the fibres. This anisotropic structure of the material results in a strong and stiff parallel and a weaker perpendicular behaviour of the material. Timber reacts ductile to compression loading and brittle in tension and shear loading. A typical crushing action of the timber (with micro cracking and densification of the timber) occurs when the maximum compression parallel to the grain stress is reached. <br/><br/>The specific manufacturing process of Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) reduces the inhomogeneous character of timber. This improves the strength and the predictability of the material. The cracks that occur in tension and shear can cause four different brittle failure modes in a dowelled connection (row shear, group tear out, failure of the net cross section and tensile splitting). A brittle failure mode can be prevented when minimum end or edge distances and spacing between fasteners are satisfied. In that case a ductile failure is expected with plastic deformation of the dowel and crushing of the timber underneath the dowel.<br/><br/>FEM is a powerful tool that is able to solve complex partial differential equation problems. Its basis lies in the linear formulation of small elements that are linked by coinciding nodal degrees of freedom to form a structure. The linear formulation has limited validity and a failure criteria is needed to define the onset of nonlinear behaviour. Multiple nonlinear approaches are available to accurately simulate the complex behaviour of timber in connections. The most promising approach is the use of cohesive elements at the locations where cracks are expected. The anisotropic nature of wood makes the prediction of crack locations in connections possible. The cohesive elements have a damage formulation to simulate strength and stiffness loss after the material strength is reached. This softening model hinders the solution procedure and therefore special solution techniques (e.g. line search, automatic stabilization and viscous regularization) are employed.<br/><br/>A first model is made to simulate the embedment behaviour in LVL. In the embedment tests conducted by Franke and Quenneville a steel dowel is pushed in a timber block with a pre-drilled hole. In the translation of this test to an accurate FEM model three nonlinear phenomena are simulated (cracking, crushing in compression and contact). The cracking behaviour in tension and shear is modelled with cohesive elements with a damage formulation. These cracks are inserted at the location of potential crack growth. The remaining timber has a trilinear isotropic plastic hardening formulation to accurately predict the deformations in the LVL under compression loading. The last nonlinear phenomena is contact between the steel and the timber. This is simulated as ""hard"" contact in normal direction and frictional contact in tangential direction. <br/><br/>The implicit solver encountered difficulties in converging due to contact alterations (chatter) and the softening behaviour in the cohesive elements. The automatic time incrementation algorithm reduced the increment size to overcome these difficulties. The analysis resulted in a load displacement curve that had good agreement with the experimental curve. A parameter study proved that the small difference can be related to the natural variation of material properties.<br/><br/>The approach of the embedment FEM was implemented in a more complex connection model. The connection tests conducted by Ottenhaus et al. that is simulated consists of 4 dowels that connect two outer LVL blocks with an inner steel plate. The spacing was chosen in such a way that a ductile failure mode was expected with brittle failure modes at large deformations. In the connection model plasticity in the steel dowels, the size of the specimens and the inclusion of tension parallel cracks increased the complexity of the model. This increased the convergence difficulties and the analysis ceased (at 0.43 mm) before the maximum load was reached .<br/><br/>A study was made to improve the stability of the numerical solution procedure. The impact of changing the formulations of cohesive elements, contact and the solution procedure on the convergence is tested. The viscous regularization and the initial dummy stiffness of the cohesive elements had the most influence on the convergence. With increased viscous regularization the implicit solver becomes more stable and computes more displacement increments (up to 6.91 mm). However, viscous regularization introduces artificial forces that significantly decreased the damage evolution. This prevented the formation of brittle failure mechanism.<br/><br/>By reducing the initial dummy stiffness of the cohesive elements (down to 2 times the timber element stiffness) the convergence improved significantly. With this initial cohesive stiffness the global softening behaviour (up to 10.08 mm) and failure development that are observed in the experiments could be simulated. The failure development consisted of the formation of plastic hinges in the dowels, tensile splitting and finally row shear failure that completely removed the supporting action of the timber under the dowels.<br/><br/>The decrease of cohesive element stiffness has impact on the effective stiffness of the adjacent timber elements and decreases the accuracy of the model. The model needs to be improved to make the predictions of the brittle failure development more accurate. With arc-length control, an explicit solver or the sequential linear analysis method the convergence might be increased, without the accuracy loss that is attributed to cohesive stiffness decrease. Further research is needed to improve this connection model approach.","Cohesive Zone Model; Timber; FEM; Laminated Veneer Lumber; Nonlinear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Avoidance of wired connections reduces cost, mass, and increases the flexibility and reliability of the system. The impact of wire reduction can be significant, especially for small satellites with many sensors, like temperature and sun sensors. Previous research has already focused on wireless intra- spacecraft communications. This research tests the self-powering capabilities of a system based on a COTS thermoelectric generator connected to a Bluetooth Low energy communication system, with a built-in controller and temperature sensor, and a power management interface. The system will be considered as a candidate for an autonomous temperature sensor in a future PocketQube mission of the university.<br/><br/>Controlled temperature differences can be achieved in a test environment, allowing the measurement of the generator power capabilities. It is tested that the system requires, for operation, a minimum temperature difference of 2.31 degrees between the extremes of the thermoelectric generator. It generates a peak power of 234 μW for that difference. In addition, the voltage difference obtained of 35.5 mV exceeds the minimum voltage required by the power management subsystem to be used. The power management sub-system consists of an ultra-low power converter that provides an output voltage of 4.1 V and a measured power efficiency of 32 % Moreover, thanks to the management of the Bluetooth sleeping modes, with the built-in controller and several operational amplifier comparators, an average power consumption of 5 μW is required during operation. The case studied would allow measuring temperature and sending the data over a Bluetooth link to the on-board computer every 16.2 seconds <br/><br/>It is concluded that the technology, based on COTS components, can be implemented and considered as the first step for a fully autonomous sensor with thermoelectric power generation in small satellites. Its implementation may provide substantial advantages for remote or/and locations where wiring is difficult to integrate.

The tool is run through a number of tests for verification, culminating in the forward modeling and subsequent inversion of synthetic density anomalies, showing a > 97% recovery of the original density anomalies. The density inversion is applied to a number of lunar regions. The region containing the landing sites of the Apollo 12 & 14 missions is selected first. The results of this region are consistent with returned samples, providing validation of the inversion. Next, Mare Crisium and Mare Orientale are selected, to give insight into the formation of melt sheets after impacts and subsequent mantle upwelling to achieve isostatic equilibrium. To do this, the tool was expanded to estimate multiple layers of density anomalies, which required constraining with the help of a priori information, which itself was in part derived from lunar seismology. Such constraining is necessary to remove the non-uniqueness inherent in inversion. The results show that Mare Crisium still contains a thin sheet of several (4 to 6) km thickness on the crater floor, showing that mantle upwelling has not reached the surface. For Mare Orientale a melt sheet of higher density than the surrounding crust (2650 kg m−3 vs 2550 kg m−3 ) is found with a thickness consistent with Zuber et al. [2016] (10 km). If this higher density is not present, the melt sheet is thinner than that proposed by Zuber et al.

(mentor); De Vries, S. (mentor)","2017","In 2014-2015 the coastal stretch between Petten and Camperduin was strengthened by using 35 million m3 of sand. At the seaward side of the Hondbossche & Pettermer sea defence a beach and dune system was built which is called the ‘Hondsbossche Dunes’. The old sea dike has disappeared behind the new dunes and is no longer an active part of the primary flood defence system. Since 2015 the Hondbossche Dunes (HD) protect the hinterland against flooding during storm erosion events and simultaneously it creates a large opportunity for the development of new nature and recreation areas. Along the Hondsbossche Dunes five different dune profile types have been constructed to stimulate morphological dynamics of the system. The Hondsbossche Dunes have the advantage of being a dynamic system which is highly adaptive to changes in climatic forcing. This climatic forcing redistribute the marine sand from the foreshore towards the dunes. To this day, the predicted influence of aeolian sediment transport on dune development for this system is only based on previous research and expertise. For this reason, the quantification and understanding how aeolian and marine sediments are transported towards the dunes is required in order to realize an effective approach for management and maintenance of the HD system regarding to the expected sea level rise and land subsidence. The main objective of this thesis is to explore the effect of aeolian sediment transport on the morphological development of the beach and dunes at the Hondsbossche Dunes, thereby concluding on the differences in response within the five different dune profile types. A conceptual framework of the parameters that characterize the system is introduced which distinguishes three components: (1) climatic forcing, (2) sediment supply and (3) dune types. Insight into these three components is obtained by a twofold approach: a data-analysis at the JARKUS transects for the first 19 months after construction and the application of the wind sediment transport model AeoLiS at a two-dimensional scale. The results obtained from the data-analysis show that an alongshore variations in beach and dune development is strongly present, for which the morphological changes were most pronounced in the seven months after construction. High beach volume losses were observed along the Hondsbossche Dunes. The volumetric losses were transported in alongshore direction leading to accretion of the beaches. Besides, volumetric losses were transported in cross-shore direction resulting in an average dune growth of 28 m3/m/y. The supply-limited model overestimates the measurements with a factor varying from 1.2 to 3. The model shows to predict alongshore variations in dune growth as a result of spatial variations in sediment availability regarding to topography and grain size characteristics. It is seen that the five man-made profile types show an appreciable different response to the aeolian sediment transport towards the dunes. Dune growth of a profile type is likely to be determined by: (1) a temporal variability in local processes that determines the aeolian sediment supply towards the dunes and (2) the dune geometry that determines the capacity of the profile type to capture the sediments.","Aeolian sediment transport; dune development; Hondsbossche Dunes; Sediment Supply; Dynamic system; Coastal einforcement project; Aeolis; Aeolian sediment transport model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydrailic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Renting, F.W. (mentor)","2017","Fluctuating oil and gas prices, coupled with initiatives toward energy security, drive the global storage market of oil and gas. A tank farm, often referred to as a terminal, is an industrial facility for the storage of the oil and/or petrochemical products. Vopak's biggest terminal, Vopak Terminal Europoort (VTE), has an immense capacity of 25 million barrels. The terminal contains over 200 on-site pipelines to handle the products in and out the terminal. (VTE) was mostly build in the early seventies and after years of operation and alterations, the older pipework might not be able to handle the required pressures, forces and flows required by new projects. Inspections are performed to measure and monitor the pipework degradation. Completely and thoroughly inspecting all pipework would be the best practice to determine the pipework integrity. Unfortunately, inspecting all the existing pipework would be extremely expensive. In addition to the costs of outsourcing the inspections itself, it would be very time consuming, resulting in an immense impact on operations and planning. Also, due to the presence of insulated pipelines, buried pipelines and inaccessible pipe sections, the accessibility of pipework for inspections can be challenging and therefore extremely expensive. Pipework degradation due to corrosion is an uncertain process. The temporal variability of corrosion makes the decision making regarding maintenance and inspection actions challenging. Therefore, Vopak is calling for an alternative approach in addition to their already existing Risk Based Inspection (RBI) strategy, that more structurally accounts for pipeline degradation uncertainties. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate a decision making process for inspection and maintenance of pipework, with a structured probabilistic model. The inherent uncertainties of pipeline degradation in time and space are accounted for within a Two-Stage Bayesian model framework. The wall loss, with its variability, is modelled by a Gamma process. Within this framework, also the epistemic uncertainty due to limited available data and lack of knowledge is modelled. The observation of the amount of wall loss, within a certain time span, provides information on the corrosion rate. In the Bayesian framework, the epistemic uncertainty will be reduced each time new observations become available. The amount of localized corrosion is modelled with a Poisson process. The proposed model makes use of the binomial distribution to account for the possibility that some locations may have no observable corrosion and therefore impose no risk to the non-inspected part of the pipeline. In the reliability analysis of a pipeline of interest, this distribution is combined with the calculated corrosion rate distribution, to describe the Exceedance Probability (EP) of an introduced threshold that is associated with reliable pipework operation. The output of the proposed model presents the (EP) in time for a non-inspected pipework of interest. The current- and future state of a pipeline is determined by combining the calculated (EP) with the corresponding consequence of failure, which results in an expression for a Risk of pipeline failure. The decision to either perform extra inspections, maintenance or replacement of pipe sections is formulated based on the Risk of pipeline failure results. Through multiple Case Studies, the results from this approach proved that it can advice on the next inspection date by not accepting the transition of the (EP) towards a higher Risk region. In addition to the already existing (RBI) strategy, the proposed model can be used to analyze a complete pipework system at a terminal. This would provide meaningful assistance for prioritizing pipework inspection and maintenance based on Risk of failure of each pipeline. The model needs some extra professionalization steps in order for Vopak to adapt and implement it in the current (RBI) practice. These steps consist of, but are not limited to, model validation in time, optimization of the Hyper-parameter probability space and calibration of the Coefficient of Variation for different corrosive environments. In addition, the presented inspection coverage method for a sequential inspection strategy shows promising results for future research.","Corrosion; Two-Stage Bayesian; Stochastic Processes; RBI; RCM; Pipeline reliability; Pipeline degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-06-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kleinsmann, M.S. (mentor)","2017","The assignment given by AFKL was to improve customer satisfaction of outstation lounges. Whether this be by improving the current lounges or by coming up with new, alternative services to the lounge. From research it was concluded that there are three different types of lounge users: time efficient, regular, and cautious or working. It’s important to understand the specific needs of these customer segments in order to deliver solutions that are appropriate for each customer segment. Analyses proved that the amenities and services that current lounges provide are in line with the needs and expectations of regular and cautious or working lounge users. However, the current lounge service is not designed for or tailored to the needs of time efficient travellers. Time efficient travellers mainly use the lounge to grab something to eat and drink before they head to the gate. Importantly, sometimes being time efficient means customers decide not to make use of the lounge at all. Sometimes because the lounge is located far from their departure gate, sometimes due to a lack of time, or sometimes because it’s not worth the effort. Therefore, it was decided to focus on creating an alternative solution to the lounge for time efficient travellers. A design goal was created to summarise the desired intention of the design solution. It describes the target group (elaborated on in the next chapter), the situation they will use it in, and the desired effect. The design goal was stated as follows: ‘Enabling AFKL to anticipate and deliver personalised services to the individual needs and circumstances of time efficient AFKL premium customers, during their dwell time at airports.’ The main goal of time efficient travellers is to be time efficient, which implies that their needs at the airport must be fulfilled in a time efficient manner. Their main needs are getting something to eat and drink, check emails, and read a newspaper before boarding a flight. The solution created consists of physical and digital elements that together form the service proposal. Airport facilities provide goods and service to the customer, the KLM app is the medium through which the service is offered, and digital technologies are the means to connect them. The service enables customers to make free use of airport restaurants, grabbing something to eat and drink before they board the flight. Through the KLM app, customers can explore what venues are available to them, select the items they fancy, order ahead, and collect without having to stand in line.

(mentor)","2017","In existing modular adaptive control approaches, the effects of external disturbances such as atmospheric turbulence are often not considered. In real-life flight applications, stochastic atmospheric disturbances can severely degrade the performance of these approaches, resulting in undesired and unpredictable control behavior. In this thesis, robust adaptation laws are developed within the framework of multivariate-spline-based adaptive control. This new approach, referred to as robust spline-based adaptive nonlinear dynamic inversion (R-SANDI), integrates nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) and spline-model-based control allocation with a robust real-time aerodynamic model identification routine. The latter is based on the conditional estimation of the deterministic and the disturbance effect. The developed method is applied to control a F-16 aircraft subject to significant aerodynamic uncertainties and turbulence. Simulation results show that the developed control system outperforms a previously proposed deterministic spline-based adaptive NDI controller, which is shown to become unstable in the presence of turbulence. The new controller is able to adapt to large uncertainties within the onboard aerodynamic model, even in the co-existence of high turbulence levels. This enhances flight performance, safety and survivability and facilitates future real-life flight applications in high performance aircraft.","multivariate splines; modular adaptive control; nonlinear dynamic inversion; spline-based control allocation; real-time model identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-02","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Simulation","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This thesis studies ways of broadening the range of a piezoelectric flow induced vibration harvester. The proposed device consists of a flap connected with a hinge to a spring. Existing harvesters are designed to replace or charge batteries for low power systems in the range of milliwatts. These systems produce low amounts of power, but for low flow speeds. The objective of this thesis is to increase the range of efficient harvesting. To achieve such a harvester, the coupling between the spring dynamics and aerodynamics will be studied. Considered methods for changing the dynamics of the spring are stiffness and length modifi- cations. Besides changing the aerodynamics of the wing will also be considered as a solution. Linear state space models are derived and validated with experimental tests. After derivation of the models, changes in aerodynamics will not been seen as a feasible solution because of the required power transfer across the hinge. Despite stiffeners can contribute to the effi- ciency of a harvester by changes in the mode shape. Additional stiffness resulted in lower eigenfrequency changes than expected. Only the changes in length seem to have a significant influence on the range of harvesting.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The ballistic coefficient β of a satellite indicates the influence atmospheric drag has on the orbital decay of said satellite. The method developed in this study estimates the ballistic coefficients of 1U CubeSats by analysing both its historical TLE data and the density it experienced along its trajectory according to the empirical density model NRLMSISE-00. In parallel the same is done for a spherical satellite with an already known ballistic coefficient, given the object is experiencing near-similar atmospheric conditions as that of the CubeSat. Any density error associated with NRLMSISE-00 along that trajectory is consecutively largely mitigated, resulting in an improved model-dependent estimated ballistic coefficient for the CubeSat. This procedure is iterated upon with a batch of 60+ CubeSats, leading to a single procedure capable of estimating the ballistic coefficient of a large group of objects. The estimated β are consecutively adjusted for the epoch- and altitude-dependent drag coefficient, performed analytically as a function of ambient gas-composition and spacecraft geometry. Additionally, an investigation in the computation of the energy accommodation coefficient α, an essential variable for the CD computation, is performed, assessing whether a constant α = 0.8 can be assumed or if Langmuir’s adsorption model based on the ambient presence of atomic oxygen wouldn’t be more suited. When subjecting the estimated and adjusted β values to a propagator build in TUDAT, based on Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 7(8), and comparing them to their actual orbits, prediction improvements of up to 40% are observed compared to regular non-adjusted β values for CubeSats re-entering the atmosphere. For CubeSats orbiting Earth above 500 km, improvements between 5% and 15% are observed. The research furthermore highlighted the sensitivity of the iterative process and the orbital element selection criteria through which satellite pairs are assumed to have near-similar atmospheric conditions – the tighter the selection criteria the better the quality of the β estimations were, though at the cost of fewer β estimations to occur. Overall, it can be concluded that the β estimation method can be applied on a scale covering multiple satellites, potentially growing to a global ballistic coefficient estimation model which could also include space debris. Improvements to orbital lifetime predictions are primarily seen in the lower parts of LEO. Furthermore, the adjustment for the variable drag coefficient proved most useful for the CubeSats above 500 km, given Langmuir’s adsorption model was used. For the lower orbits, Langmuir’s adsorption model lost its accuracy and an adaptation of Langmuir’s model which considers an object’s historical orbit data is suggested.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); miedema, S.A. (mentor); Visser, C. (mentor)","2017","The Offshore wind industry harvests energy in offshore locations, using large turbines to convert this energy to electrical power. The electricity is gathered and transported to shore via cables. These cables need to be protected from external hazards that could result in damages and thus economic losses. Generally the cables are buried in the seabed or covered with solid objects like rocks or concrete matrasses. For cable burial a trench needs to be created in the seabed, this process is called trenching. Tideway acquired a trenching vehicle to enable provision of a wider range of cable protection solutions besides rock placement. Instead of more familiar trenching ploughs, this machine is equipped with a track drive and is self-propelling. To create trenches the vehicle has two options, mechanical cutting and jetting. Expected progress rates of the vehicle are to be determined to make a more realistic assessment of the expected project durations in the pre-execution stages. This can only be done if specific knowledge regarding the interaction between seabed soils and track drive is available. Further-more it is interesting to look at the most optimal setup of the vehicle for each project, make the machine work more efficiently and decrease the trenching duration. The current thesis proposes a model that can assess the trench production rates for a tracked trenching vehicle. Inputs for the model are CPT results, operational conditions and general vehicle specifications. Furthermore, the model considers the fact that the vehicle has a limited amount of power onboard. The sensitivity of the model parameters and impact on production is analyzed via a tool created specifically for Tideway’s subsea trencher. The project is based on a review of literature regarding soil mechanics, soil cutting and Terra-mechanics. Using this knowledge the model is developed considering a rest state and a steady driving state of the vehicle. The final model incorporates several sub-models, accounting for the resistant-, thrust forces, slopes and more. Phenomena as shear displacement and slip are incorporated and build towards the output for the model, a forward speed of the vehicle while cutting. The model can include seabed slopes and layered homogeneous soils. The presence of boulders, currents and effects of acceleration/braking are outside the scope of this thesis. Based on the developed model a software algorithm is developed in the open-source programming language Python. This algorithm generates a working area which indicates the zone within which all operational and machine boundaries are fulfilled. Additionally an optimal working-point is also suggested. This point corresponds to the given combination of operational and vehicle specifications, where the machine operates at a desired efficiency. Several conclusions are drawn, accompanied with recommendations regarding optimization of the model and industry procedures. The goal of thesis has been achieved, by developing the model and the tool. A validation process based on measured field data shows that the several (sub)models are within range of the measured data.","jetting; Track drives; slip; shear; mobility; trafficability; cutting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Google Location History Timeline could be used in the future to track mobile devices of users with a Google account. The Department of Forensic Digital Technology in the Netherlands Forensic Institute might consider using it as available data for evidence in its investigations. A part of this research is to assess the accuracy of the locations given by Google Location History Timeline. Google informs that any registered mobile device was at a certain time at a certain position, and provides a measure of the accuracy. To study the veracity of the information provided by Google, a series of experiments were carried out. During these experiments the true position was recorded with a reference GPS device with a superior order of accuracy. Subsequently, the accuracy values given by Google were studied and analyzed based on various parameters, such as the configuration of mobile device connectivity, speed of movement, environment, traffic density and weather. The distance between Google provided position and actual position (determined with a more precise device) is computed and called Google Error. Then this error was compared with the Google provided accuracy to have a measure of Google data quality. Additionally, linear least squares multivariate models were developed with the purpose of calculating the precision that Google would provide a priori together with its positioning error. When studying the variability of the Google accuracy and Google error, in the experiments it was found that these variables are dependent on the configuration of the mobile device, the environment, and the means of transport, but weather and traffic have no influence on these variables. To quantify the performance of the values provided by Google, a Hit is defined as the observation in which the actual error committed by Google is less than the accuracy provided. The configuration that has the largest Hit rate is the GPS connection, with a 52% success. Then 3G and 2G go with 38% and 33%respectively. The WiFi connection only has a Hit rate of 7%. Regarding the means of transport, when the connection is 2G or 3G, the worst results are in Still with a Hit rate of 9% and the best in Car with 57%. For predicting values for Google accuracy and Google error, six multivariate linear models were defined. The model input variables were the distances and angles from the position of the device to the three nearest cell towers, and the categorical (non-numerical) variables of Environment and means of transport. The signal strength received by the device from the base stations were treated as possible input variables too, but not sufficient correlation was obtained, on top these models would not be useful to study future forensic cases, since these measures are not usually available. To evaluate the utility of a model, a Model Hit is defined when the actual observation is within the 95% confidence interval provided by the model. The model that shows the best results was the one that predicted the accuracy when the used network is 2G, with 76% of Model hits. The next one had only a 23% success (accuracy 3G). As a conclusion from the performed experiments the assurance of Google providing the correct position can not be given. The accuracy radius Google provides when using exclusively telephony networks (2G or 3G) is over bounding the actual position error only in about 35% of the experiments; in the other 65% of the experiments, the actual error is larger than the given accuracy radius. For an accuracy measure to be of practical meaning, the confidence level should be much larger, for instance 95%. Even when using WiFi and GPS, Google gives accurate locations but the accompanying accuracy measure is too optimistic (small radii) and hit rates are very low. The linear models developed in this thesis gave results which were not satisfactory enough yet. Further research in the parameters involved and a major collection of data is required.","Wilkinson; accuracy; case; base station; Android; Cell; Cell ID; Cell Tower; coordinates; GNSS; Google account; Google accuracy; Google Maps; Google Timeline; GPS; signal; power interpolation; least squares; linear model; location history; multi linear model; NFI; position; signal strenght; WiFi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor); Remis, R.F. (mentor); Webb, A. (mentor)","2017","The quality of magnetic resonance images produced by conventional MRI scanners is guaranteed by the strength and homogeneity of the magnetic field. However, the superconducting magnets required to produce such a field make MRI scanners large and expensive and hence inaccessible to a large number of people in developing countries. Our partners are developing low-cost, portable MRI scanners that do not depend on superconducting magnets. In these scanners, the signal-to-noise ratio will be significantly lower due to the lower magnetic field strength. Additionally, inhomogeneities will be present, which means that the traditional way of obtaining the image, by inverse Fourier Transform, is no longer feasible. In this research, image reconstruction is done using an ill-posed system of equations of the form Ax = y, where A is the reconstruction matrix and x and y are vectors containing the image pixel values and the measured signals, respectively. Three different regularization techniques are considered, with total variation yielding the best results. Two methods for solving the regularized least-squares problem are considered: CGLS and CGNE. For the types of problems we are dealing with, CGNE is outperformed by CGLS: CGLS requires a lower number of iterations to converge and the computational cost per iteration is lower. The main focus of this research is on super-resolution: reconstructing a high resolution image from one or several low resolution images. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratios that are expected in the low-field MRI prototypes, it might be better to reconstruct images of a low resolution, and using these, create high resolution images, instead of opting for a direct high resolution reconstruction. In order to test this, the signal generation in a Halbach array based MRI scanner is simulated. Our simulations show that for very low (<1.5-2) signal-to-noise ratios, super-resolution can yield better results than direct high resolution reconstruction. Data obtained in a 7 T MRI scanner is used to validate our reconstruction model. Due to the type of gradient used and the low number of measurements in this experiment, the amount of available information is very limited. This makes it challenging to produce an image of good quality. However, in our final image, out of the four water bottles in the phantom, the three largest ones are clearly visible.","conjugate gradient methods; Super-resolution; magnetic resonance imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

A solution came from the Paris agreement in 2015, which sets new goals for 2030, and eventually for the long term in 2050. This time the Netherlands is eager to reach their goal and amongst many other initiatives, a proposition came from TenneT, the country’s national energy operator, to construct an island in the North Sea, functioning as a central “wind connector hub” to connect multiple offshore wind farms and distributing the energy more efficiently over the neighbouring countries. The goal of the project is to propose and analyse a preliminary design for the construction of that artificial island in the North Sea, capable of acting as a central energy hub. An analysis for optimum location for the island was performed based on maximum wind generation, shallow water depths, centrality to the North Sea countries, and environmental restrictions. Of various types of island considered, the reclamation type was chosen for preliminary design because it is the most cost effective for the location’s water depths and the most commonly constructed island type. Following the scope definition, correspondence with TenneT and consultancy with subject experts at TU Delft was made to refine preliminary design outcomes. The preliminary design covers the analysis of available environmental and geotechnical data, safety approach, island shape, zones, elevations, analysis of alternative sea defence structures, building with nature measures, port and terminal design, and preliminary construction plan. The conclusions of this investigation cover practical issues, project risks and uncertainties, and opportunities to reduce costs are discussed.","Artificial island; Building with Nature; Doggersbank; Sea defence; Sea level rise; Wave analysis; Wind farm","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""
