(mentor); Goossens, R.M.H. (mentor)","2010","Physical workload can cause injury to the employees’ health and this could results in absenteeism. Low back pain is the most frequent physical cause of absenteeism. Low back pain is also experienced in the Engine Shop of KLM by mechanics of the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT), a component of the aircraft jet engine. Especially the work on discs one to three during the assembly and disassembly of the LPT, causes physical injuries. The problems seem to be the result of unhealthy postures which have to be maintained for extended periods of time. While working on the LPT the mechanics have to bend forward, rotate their spine and apply force to components of the LPT. Their reach is limited while precision is required. The prevention of injuries is important for the efficiency, safety, health and job satisfaction of employees. After analyzing the situation it became clear that the amount of complaints during assembly could be mainly reduced by designing an improved workplace. The disassembly could be enhanced with adjusted equipment. An external company was appointed to improve the equipment. Therefore the assignment of this paper was; ‘Design a device for the assembly of the LPT that reduces the lower back problems, without displacing the problem.’ In order to reduce the back problems extreme joints postures should be avoided, the upper body, head or arms should be supported and the time of an operation should be decreased. Variation in postures can contribute to better health as well. In this way the activity of the surrounding muscles and the tension in ligaments can be minimized. To be sure mechanics will use the product voluntarily, they were closely involved in the gradual development of the product. After a brainstorm session with a divers group of stakeholders, four different ideas were developed into a concept. Finally, two concepts were chosen based on the feedback of the mechanics and according to the design criteria; 1. The Fat-Support; to give the users a more comfort and support during the assembly. 2. The Feetsupport; enables the mechanics to straighten their back and gives support to the feet. In the detailing phase the selected concepts were optimized on the domain of material, form, safety, stability and comfort. It could be said that after years of operating in bad circumstances, a design proposal is presented in this paper which finally improves the poor ergonomic conditions at the workplace, while fulfilling the preliminary demands and requirements. The design is a combination of different devices which will make the operation much more comfortable. A prototype of the devices has been tested with the mechanics during an LPT assembly. The mechanics were enthusiastic about the devices and loved to use them. Especially the Fat- Support increases the comfort for mechanics with all different heights. Its positive effects are ensuring that the chance of rework and foreign object damage is diminished, the arms are provided with more support, the pressure on the stomach is reduced. The Feetsupport mainly improves the situation for the smaller mechanics. While they are positioned closer to their task it provides the body to stand with less extreme joint postures and it enables the mechanics to straighten their back more. A posture analysis confirmed that the supports improve the body postures of the mechanics during LPT assembly. Next to quality improvement, and more job satisfaction for the mechanics, the devices will also save costs and time. Together they will result in success for all stakeholders. Though, if the LPT operation remains to be done manually, the operation will never become ideal and will always remain intensive. However the product designs will make a big step in the right direction and the mechanics are content their situation is finally improved.","low back problems; low pressure turbine; physical injuries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Khoshelham, K. (mentor)","2010","The coastal area is an important territory for many reasons, e.g. as a recreational area, natural parks and reservoirs, protection against sea flood and storms. The last usage is especially crucial in the Netherlands, because the most densely populated areas are located just behind the coastal defense and are partly below the mean sea level. Therefore, it is essential to continuously monitor and maintain the coast in order to protect the Dutch hinterland from the sea. Since 1965 the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management (RWS, Rijkswaterstaat) annually acquire the JAarlijkse KUStmetingen (JARKUS) data. The cross-shore topography and bathymetry is measured along profiles 250m apart. The disadvantage is, that the JARKUS data are too sparse in time and space, to ensure sufficient observations of the dynamic coast environment. The time is especially important, when a high energy event occurs that can cause most dramatic changes. Therefore, a flexible system is needed that can access a damaged area immediately after the storm and enables (near) real-time processing of the captured data. To make right and timely decisions it is important that results, e.g. DTM, are available shortly after the acquisition itself. Besides, to estimate in detail the beach erosion caused by heavy storm events, high spatial resolution measurements are needed. According to the above described application and requirements the most appropriate acquisition technique and processing has to be chosen. Advances in the hardware and software technologies enable to directly acquire 3D models from real world environments [Grinstead et al., 2005]. Compared to the laser airborne system, i.e. ALS, which is commonly used by now to map the beach topography, the vehicle platform is considered to be more flexible. One of the potential techniques is the laser L-MMS. It is a complex real-time, multi-tasking and multi-sensor system. It integrates line scanners and optionally digital cameras for mapping, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for positioning and usually Inertial Navigation System (INS) to measure platform orientation. The measurements from those sensors are integrated and result in a 3D laser point cloud. In principle it is possible to quickly obtain 3D data of a large extended area with a high spatial resolution. On the basis of the mentioned properties, RWS decided to initiate a pilot-project using a laser L-MMS. The requirements for the acquired data are that the vertical accuracy of DTM is at least 10cm at a grid spacing of 1x1m and that this result is available close to the real-time. In this master thesis the level of obtainable quality of the laser L-MMS data and derived laser L-MMS DTM is investigated in detail. This evaluation is performed in three steps. First, an a-priory analysis is performed on the basis of the L-MMS geo-referencing model. This model includes L-MMS measurements of the three sensors and calibration parameters connecting those sensors. The result is 3D laser point cloud. By nature, the observations entering the geo-referencing model include errors and therefore effect the 3D laser point positioning quality. To estimate this quality a theoretical random error budget is constructed. It shows the relative components of random errors within the system and the expected quality of the laser point positioning. The specifications and estimated observations’ random errors of the L-MMS system called StreetMapper are considered in a practical random error budget computations. Results show that the GPS/INS positioning error impacts the 3D laser point position the most. The second biggest contributors are errors of the laser scanner measurements, i.e. errors in range and scanning angle. The range error effects more the horizontal and scan angle error the vertical positioning error. Because the StreetMapper GPS/INS positioning solution on the open beach area is relatively good, the further laser point quality improvements should consider laser scanners of higher precision. In the second analysis the theoretical model of the described pre-analysis is applied on the real L-MMS data. That is, the height precision due to the L-MMS measurement and calibration errors (measuring precision) is computed for each laser point. Besides, the intersection geometry of the laser beam with the relatively horizontal and flat beach is investigated. The scanning geometry is changing a lot over the beach and gets poorer further away from the trajectory. This means that the distance from the laser scanner to the target as well as the incidence angle increases. Those geometric attributes are teken into account to compute the so-called geometrical precision. Together with the measuring precision they define the theoretical precision of the laser point height. Besides, an empirical quality measure is obtained by a relative Quality Control (QC). The relative QC is here developed considering the land-based laser data advantage, like a high laser point density that results in overlapping footprints. Height differences between the two overlapping laser points, called identical points, are considered as the empirical quality measure. The comparison of the theoretical and empirical quality measures shows big differences. Most likely the theoretical precision is estimated too pessimistic, because the random errors of the measurements and calibration parameters are mostly overestimated. It is therefore recommended to first verify the theoretical error model by comparing the values obtained in this research with reference data of a higher quality. This way also the systematic errors could be verified, that are here assumed to equal zero. On the other hand, the assumptions on the identical points should be further tested. In the third analysis a laser L-MMS DTM is evaluated. DTM is the most important or in other words, the most widely used L-MMS product that should be provided to the end user together with a detailed quality description. This way, a DTM user can better trust and rely on the DTM height information. Here, the goal is to answer the RWS question, weather the DTM of 1x1m size can have a quality better than 10cm. The L-MMS and ALS dataset are used in this analysis. First, the L-MMS terrain laser points are divided into a 1x1m grid cells. A weighted Moving Least Squares (MLS) is performed for each grid cell to fit a tilted plane to its terrain points. The weight matrix is constructed from the individual theoretical laser point variances. This method is applied on the StreetMapper terrain points that lie on the sandy beach and part of the dunes. Resulting interpolated grid point heights do not differ much from the averaged height of those terrain points. Therefore it is concluded, that the simple averaging interpolation can be used to construct a laser L-MMS DTM on the Dutch beach. The resulting L-MMS DTM quality is highly dependent on the number of terrain points within a grid cell. Because the L-MMS point density is in general very high, those redundant data reduce the random errors of laser point positioning. Thus, the DTM has on average higher quality than the input laser data. It is concluded that the RWS requirement on the laser L-MMS DTM accuracy can be easily met for the beach and the dune area. Most of the grid cell on the beach have the height precision better than 1cm. To achieve similar accuracy also in the dune area, a measurement set-up needs to be changed in order to acquire more points. Thus, it is recommended that the vehicle drives closer to the dune foot and that the laser scanners are lifted higher above the ground. The comparison of L-MMS and ALS data shows the advantage of the L-MMS technique due the high laser point density. On the other hand ALS technique offers better data coverage on the coast. However, higher laser scanner platform might minimize the L-MMS data voids that occur behind elevated features in the pre-dune area. This way the completeness, reliability and the quality of the laser L-MMS DTM DTM could be improved.","mobile laser scanning; morphology; coast; hazards; quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-23","Aerospace Engineering","Department of Optical and Laser Remote Sensing","","MSc Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Crul, M.R.M. (mentor)","2010","In a laguna a few kilometres out of the coast, wind and solar power are used to evaporate ocean water. Hardworking men (salineros) manage the current of the water trough a complex system of pools and channels by hand. The water travels for three weeks trough various pools until the percentage of salt is so high that it crystallizes. In the last decades the production and the price of salt decreased year after year. Once the salinas were the main salt source for the country and the main economic activity of the region. When the situation changed, the salineros did not adapt and continued working with the same methods as many generations did. The majority of the production of the cooperative in Chile is not being sold for human consumption. Salt alone can no longer generate sufficient income for the families of the salineros, younger generations abandon the salinas. The salinas date back to the 17th century; the Spanish conquistadores brought the European technique of harvesting sea salt to South America. The exact same technique, first used by the Phoenicians in 700 BC, is still being used in all the South European countries. In the seventies the tradition of harvesting salt by hand almost disappeared. French chefs started to prefer the natural sea salt above industrial mine salt, they claimed that the high percentage of different minerals gives the salt its better and more natural taste. Because of the appreciation from the culinary market, the price of sea salt rose and in France, Spain, Portugal and Italy salinas have been restored. Regular table salt is industrially mined, during the extensive processing it looses al the minerals and only NatriumChloride remains. Salinas in Europe not only offer sea salt in varies grains, they also produce the more exclusive fleur de sel. During the process of evaporation a thin layer of salt comes to the surface of the water. This type of salt has the highest concentration of minerals possible, the crystals are naturally homogeneous, the salt maintains its humidity long after it is harvested. For the commercialization of the regular salt a small processing facility is needed, the grain size needs to be selected and the packaging process should be organized professionally to achieve a sufficient volume. The cooperative has a rural mentality and is used to sell in bulk, just as they would do with other agricultural products. The first step was the understanding that a transition is needed from selling 50 kg bags to selling products instead. In Chile sea salt is produced in two lagunas that lay 30 km apart. In the first weeks in Chile, the company mentor and the author advised the two cooperatives to work together enter the consumer market under the same brand name. They were convinced by the argument that, when the consumer perception towards sea salt changes, the market is big enough for both. Competition between the cooperatives would be counter productive at this moment. Based on the brand literature a project model and a brand model were created. First step of the project model is the analysis of the company, second the world around the company is studied. This internal and external analysis conclude that there is an enormous gap between what the potential of the cooperative is and what possible for them to do. Their products are on the top of the salt hierarchy and the high price of flor de sal offers unique opportunities. The esthetical appearance of the salinas, the production in harmony with nature and the history are ingredients to build a great brand. The capacities are limited; the cooperative has no money and no people to fulfil the potential. By developing products for the gourmet market, a way is found to combine the potential and the limited capacities in a positive way. The high margins for gourmet products make it possible to make profits with a limited sales volume. The current capacities limit the cooperative to professionally produce process, package and distribute products. The analysis part shows that the gourmet market is growing in Chile and specifically in certain areas of Santiago, many new shops opened the last 2 years. The supply is limited; most shops offer the same products. By using the gourmet market the brand will be positioned as a luxury and culinary product. In this channel the presentation might be as important as the product itself, a packaging form is chosen that adds value for consumers and that needs limited investments. The result is a rustic ceramic pot with flor de sal closed by a cork lid. An elegant etiquette seals the pot and attaches a handmade spoon. A small folder visualizes the salinas and the salineros and explains the product, the salinas and the cooperative. For tourist that visit or pass the salinas a cotton bag with 250 grams of coarse salt is developed, this product can entirely made by the cooperativa itself. Both products are results of brand driven product development. These products should make create brand awareness under consumers and give a direction for future product development. Main results of this project are that the two cooperatives decided to join their forces. Salineros started to produce large amounts of flor de sal. The cooperative became convinced of its own potential. A strategy is determined in which step by step the cooperative grows to company that has a 5-10% share of the Chilean market of human consumption. A brand is developed which can be used for all future products and is used in the development of two products that are ready to profitably be commercialized. In the future a situation has to be created that the salineros can focus on the production and that the cooperative can hire employees that do the sales and organization.","brand strategy; DFS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic product design","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis concerns the work that has been done during graduation, conducted within Integrated Product Design of Industrial Design, at University of Technology Delft. It describes the design of a flexible Light Emitting Diode (LED) engine for Heritage luminaries, from Philips Lighting (Professional Luminaires). The light-engine should be applicable in 4 faces luminaires in France. LED it will reduce costs because of the significant reduction in energy use and price, while performance will be increased. LED engines are used for indoor lighting but also outdoor lighting. An LED engine is a light system that uses LEDs for illumination. Important issues are the heat management and glare. As the lifetime of the LED will be less if the heat sink is too small for the capacity required. Glare is a perception phenomenon what could appear with LED lighting. This blinding occurrence should be prevented with the final product. At first sight Heritage luminaires appear very similar. However, closer study shows a strong diversity concerning design, dimensions, ingress protection norms and the light system used. Reasons for this diversity include: differences in manufacturers, era of fabrication, production technologies and area of installation. Philips has knowledge concerning specific light systems for Heritage luminaries, and also has its own partners in the Heritage market. However, Philips does not have any Heritage luminaire models in its portfolio. Before starting to design the product, application specifications should be examined because a lot of variables can influence the criteria of the final design. A combination of light class, mast height, spacing, and road width has been set as the boundaries for the target application. The target countries of France, Spain, Germany and the UK are all affected by a number of sales related arguments: energy savings, ban on mercury lamps, Total Cost of Ownership, green image and maintenance. The levels of importance of these arguments can vary from country to country. In general, the municipalities will order the product on advice of installers. The product will be focused on the installers and citizens. The municipalities will be used as bases where the sales arguments can be applied. Eventually a list of requirements has been made to validate the choices for the final design. France is chosen as the main focus area because: 1. Overall similarities with all target countries 2. Amount of luminaires 3. HPL substitute After the analysis a brainstorm session has been carried out to obtain a sufficient morphological map. With this map a certain amount of ideas were generated. Eventually, 3 ideas were chosen to be developed at concept level. These were the ModuLED, the Chandelier and the Bowl. During meetings and e-mail communication with several employees of Philips Lighting the Bowl concept is chosen for the embodiment design. This choice has also been verified with the list of requirements. The Bowl will be interesting in differentiate aspects in relation to the current LED engine solutions. At the moment, LED engines have to be installed in local workshops. With the Bowl it is possible to install on site. Even the light positioning could be done on site, all of which results in a less expensive installation. Another distinguish feature is the flexibility. The flexible engine will give the municipality an option to choose what will be illuminated, thus preventing energy waste. In big cities in France, 25% of the luminaires are situated on the wall. The result with conventional units is a lot of light waste on these walls. With the bowl it is possible to avoid this aspect. The atmosphere lighting perception is also an important strength of the final design. Present LED engines provide directly aimed LED light via optics. The Bowl uses the remote phosphor layer technology which will provide homogenous light. The design uses 4 Fortimo TWIST modules which can be installed independently. This modular system gives the opportunity to vary with the lumen packages (1100, 2200, 3300 or 4400 lumens). The system will also be upgradeable with newer remote phosphor modules in the future. The concept has the potential to grow within Philips? remote phosphor platform. A demonstrator of the Bowl will show if the assumption concerning ambiance illumination is valid and if less glare will occur. The demonstrator resulted in several recommendations regarding light perception. The use of frosted protection caps will be needed in luminaires with clear glass because there was too much glare from the light. Eventually the illumination was well received by employees of Philips Lighting. In the end, a final design has been made. All features of the concept have been explored, new solutions have been generated and some of these have been introduced into the final product. Eventually, a 3D model is made with 3D design software. Most of the components have been calculated regarding the feasibility. Some components have been designed on the basis of suggestions from engineers within Philips Lighting and TU Delft, and others based on general assumptions. That is because more time was needed to calculate or analyze each component in depth. A number of tests have been done in respect of light distribution. An application area was identified via 3D light visualization software. Some features have to be verified. While the results are quite positive, with an improved reflector design the modules could provide much better light distribution. A spot on the ground could be more spread over the surface. Another improvement should be done by verifying the frame. Overall, the Bowl is a realistic design which is confirmed by the analysis and list of requirements. The final design is flexible in terms of lumen package and light positioning. It is suited for installation in “all” 4 faces in France, easy to upgrade, easy to install and the design also has a high IP rate.","LED; luminaire heritage sustainable flexible light modular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Wang, J. (mentor)","2010","The effect of the financial crisis is definitely being felt in the greenhouse sector of the Netherlands. There has been a significant decrease in the trade of flowers, plants. The import of flowers and plants to the Dutch flower auctions, in January 2009 has dropped by 14% compared to January 2008. Import of plants dropped by 6% for this period, where the import of flowers has dropped by 18% for this period [de Bont(2009)]. The export of cut flowers has dropped by 10% for this period (Jan 2008 - Jan 2009) and the export of pot plants has dropped by 3% [de Bont(2009)]. In addition the Dutch greenhouse industry, profitable production and assemblage of the logistics systems have become increasingly difficult and competitive. Moreover the greenhouse market has been changing. The bargaining power of customers and suppliers has increased, since they are getting integrated; the horticultural production units have been shifted from developed countries to the rest of the world; the value chain of the market has been transforming continually and also market trend alters all the time. From another point of view the flower export to the new market (Poland and Russia) has been increased from 2007 to 2008, while the traditional clients of Netherlands (Germany and Great Britain) imported fewer flowers in the same time period. Therefore one of the best possible options for Dutch companies such as CODEMA is to target international markets. Aims In general and through implementation of this project, CODEMA will achieve: 1. New Global Business Strategy 2. Market extension 3. Designing Innovative Product concepts And specifically the goal of CODEMA in Iran, the first target market in the Middle East is as follow: CODEMA, the Dutch holding company, is specializes in manufacturing greenhouse logistics systems, flower sorting machines, ERP systems, and manufacturing aluminium structures. To extend its market internationally, the company will provide equipments and services in the Middle East. CODEMA as the market leader in Iran will penetrate in the market with innovative, first to market, high quality products and services. The company will establish its flower distribution channel, will produce presentation tables and COOLBOX , and export its sorting machine to the region. The company also plans to cooperate with Dutch companies to provide packaging machines for the flower growers. Finally with the execution of robust strategy with an international brand name, we expect to reach the financial forecasts, cited in this chapter.","greenhouse industry; Middle East; Iran; strategy; design; flower; business","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-02-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Smulders, F.E.H.M. (mentor)","2010","For 85 years, Dijkstra Lampenfabriek BV has been a luminaire manufacturer that co-designs, develops and produces architectural luminaires using the name Dijkstra Lampen. For the last five years, the management of the company has focused on the professional market, the project market. Dijkstra Lampenfabriek B.V. wants to support the selection of suitable luminaires for each specific architectural design of the client using its own product portfolio or a custom-made luminaire. This strategy is related to the customer intimacy strategy that focuses on the desires of (potential) clients. Dijkstra Lampenfabriek B.V. is a small company that has a lot of knowledge of lighting and technique. These strengths make it possible to fulfil some opportunities in the project market. The target groups in the project market expressed a need to increase knowledge and expertise concerning: artificial lighting, light sources, selection of luminaires and the development of a custom-made luminaire and lighting plan. To develop a concept that is profitable and meets the needs of the target groups using the strengths of the company, the following strategic issues are formulated: 1. How can we enhance the identity before we inform the project market about custom-made luminaires and the development of a lighting plan? 2. How can we enhance the communication of being an expert before we inform the project market about custom-made luminaires and the development of a lighting plan? 3. How can we use the fact that Dijkstra Lampenfabriek B.V. is service focused as an advantage in serving the need for help during the development of a custom-made luminaire and a lighting plan? The identity and strategy is (re)formulated to enhance the identity and influence the image of Dijkstra Lampen (fabriek B.V.). To communicate the values of the company (to increase the image of the company), the following communication touch points have the most potential for Dijkstra and for the target groups: - Website; - Representative/advice team; - Catalogue; - Workshops and presentations; - Newsletter; - Fair; - E-mail advertising. When the identity is communicated clearly to the target groups and the right image is generated in the project market, it is time to launch the new developed concept “Lighting Development Centre” for Dijkstra Lampen (fabriek B.V.). This centre is part of the company Dijkstra Lampenfabriek B.V. where (potential) clients can increase their knowledge and skills of the development of a lighting plan. This centre will offer: - lectures and workshops to increase knowledge and skills of the development of a lighting plan but also of the development of a custom-made luminaire; - experimental labs to explore and increase knowledge of light sources, lighting, the influence of a luminaire and the influence of materials; - an inspiration area where literature about lighting, posters and information about earlier developed lighting plans and custom-made luminaires are presented. - An atmospheric luminaire book that represents well considered lighting plans with tips and tricks to implement such a plan in a new project. The added value of this centre is that long term relationships will be build with (potential) clients. Because the (potential) clients will come to the “Lighting Development Centre”, the (potential) clients and the company form a closer relationship. Thus, needs of the project market are defined more easily to implement in new products and services. This will result in more interest of (potential) clients in the company and the product portfolio from Dijkstra Lampen. Eventually more orders will be collected.","positioning; identity; relationship; service; development; market research; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

However, the existing literacy rate and limited technology exposure of the community health worker may cause usability issues. Normal use of mobile phones requires different skills from the user, such as literacy, understanding of hierarchical menus, and appropriate cognitive models. It is not clear to which extent semi-literate users possess these skills and much remains unknown about how they respond to different UIs The current, paper based information collection system poses the following problems:  Loss and deformation of correct information  Loss of time  Overwhelming amount of paperwork. The proposed solution involves introducing mobile phone technology to the users which in turn poses its own problem:  Usability issues due to existing literacy rate and exposure to technology. By conducting context research and a usability test with an existing mobile application, the needs and goals of the users and other stakeholders could be investigated. Furthermore, a literature research was done to get a clear overview on related work and important information with regard to this subject. Also, an intermediary list of design guidelines for semi-literate users was derived by means of extracting these from various articles. By means of an iterative design process two user interface design ideas were developed and an experiential prototype was made. During a final user and product evaluation qualitative and quantitative data were collected and previously setup guidelines and requirements were evaluated. After a discussion on all the aspects such as UI components, usability, the intermediary guidelines and requirements conclusions could be drawn. Conclusions include statements with regard to the use of different UI components and usability. Finally a list of improved and more specific design guidelines has been made and some recommendation are made with regard to UI design, user evaluations and further research.","usability; mobile user interface; iterative design procses; context research; user evaluations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Sustainable energy development is an important topic nowadays, where new ways to obtain and use the energy are worldwide researched with a common objective, to mitigate the global warming. Two of the main CO2 polluters are the electricity and the transportation sectors. While some renewable energy technologies are taking place in the electricity sector (e.g. wind, solar and hydraulic), the transportation sector remain stagnant continuing mostly dependent on fossil fuels. Therefore, the request for sustainable mobility is taking high priority for governments, automobile firms and public and private research institutions worldwide. Electric Vehicles (EV) are becoming more attractive nowadays (mainly due to battery evolution) as a sustainable alternative. EV contribute to reduce CO2 emissions, even when charged with electricity generated from fossil fuel (mainly because EV has higher well to wheel efficiency than Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)). On the other hand, if EV are charged from renewable energy then EV will have zero emissions. The objective of this MSc thesis is to develop an insight into the dynamics of the possible diffusion of electric vehicles and find out the uncertainties which can have a significant influence in the EV diffusion. A model is needed to assess the impact of uncertainties in the EV diffusion. Where first, the model can be used to simulate the possible EV diffusion, afterwards the impact on the diffusion can be observed by considering different circumstances where the uncertainties are taken into account. Two different diffusion models are combined in this research, one on a global level (worldwide scope) an another on a local level (country scope, The Netherlands for this research). The global diffusion model creates different conditions to the local diffusion model, therefore the global diffusion model influences some “exogenous” variables of the local diffusion model. Different kind of uncertainties are explored to observe the impact of uncertain conditions on possible diffusion of EV, apart from the different exogenous parameter combinations, uncertain behavior variables and event surprises (e.g. Peak oil prices, new technology surprise, technology breakthrough) are included. The same experiments are also simulated considering EV and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) as possible technologies to diffuse. In general, PHEV faces less problems to diffuse than EV, mainly because PHEV can take the advantages of ICE (high driving range and the existent infrastructure). The current potential market for PHEV (short, medium and large distance drivers) is bigger than for EV (just short distance drivers, because EV driving range limitation), therefore the expected PHEV diffusion level is also higher than for EV. Furthermore, PHEV diffusion stimulate a natural transition to pure EV if electric infrastructure is provided, where PHEV diffusion make the batteries attributes (price and range) evolve by economies of scale mechanisms. On the other hand the electric demand of PHEV incentives the building of electric infrastructure, and once electric infrastructure is available and the batteries attributes have improved then EV will become highly attractive and a natural transition from PHEV to EV is then expected.","System Dynamics; Electric Vehicles; Exploring Uncertainties; Diffusion Model; Consumer Behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-02-24","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","With the growing usage of mobile devices, manufacturers have to distinguish themselves in their devices to keep their share of the market. Most important is that the consumer is satisfied with a given brand, since then the chances are high that he will stay loyal to that brand when it is time for a new device. A consumer buys a mobile device based on several factors. The user interface is one of these factors, and it is an easy aspect for the consumer to evaluate. It is what he sees and uses, and therefore, has to be made easy to use, intuitive and attractive. One way of making a user interface attractive is by using a new technology, such as an auto-stereoscopic display. This type of display makes use of binocular depth, also called stereopsis, which allows users to see depth without the necessity of using viewing aids. Nowadays, static images on a standard 2D display get an impression of depth by using monocular depth cues, e.g. occlusion, shadows, relative size, and linear perspective. However, an auto-stereoscopic display provides a real sense of depth with objects popping out of the display screen. It is interesting to investigate the effect on the overall experience of a user interface of a mobile device with an auto-stereoscopic display when combining stereopsis with these monocular depth cues. To answer this research question three experiments have been performed. The goal of the first experiment – the pilot experiment – was to find which attributes were appropriate for evaluating the overall experience of a graphical user interface of a mobile device. In this experiment subjects saw stimuli based on a simplified menu of a mobile device, consisting of a background image with five background icons, and one ‘selected icon’ on the foreground. The stimuli varied in the monocular depth cue used, being shadowing, relative size, and luminance differences, and in the background image and depth mode used. The subjects were asked to score these stimuli on three predefined attributes, which were affordance, aesthetics, and preference. From this experiment the attributes affordance and aesthetics were found to represent different assessment criteria, which implied that these two attributes were useful for the assessment of a graphical user interface of a mobile device. The goal of the second experiment – the tuning experiment – was to find the preferred setting of the subjects for the disparity difference between foreground and background items in the graphical user interface, for the size increase of the ‘selected icon’ and for the luminance increase of the ‘selected icon’. Subjects were requested to indicate their preferred setting via a tuning for each of the variables separately. The results showed that there was quite some spread in preferred disparity among the subjects. The preferred size of the ‘selected icon’ was on average about 130% of its original size. The increase in luminance for the ‘selected icon’ was found to be too small to be detected in the absence of reference material. Therefore, it was decided to leave this variable out of the rest of the study. The goal of the third experiment, being the main experiment, was to find the added value of the various depth cues for the user interface of a mobile device with an auto-stereoscopic display. In this experiment the subjects were selected based on having about the same preferred disparity. These subjects were asked to score the stimuli on the attributes perceived amount of depth, image quality, affordance, and aesthetics. The stimuli consisted of combinations of the same variables as in the first experiment, with the exception of the luminance cue. The results showed that the bigger size of the ‘selected icon’ and the addition of a shadow both contributed to higher scores for all four attributes. Additionally, the depth mode ‘sinking background’, in which the ‘selected icon’ was displayed at the screen and the background behind the screen, gained the highest scores for the perceived amount of depth, image quality and affordance. The depth mode ‘none’, representing the background image that already contained depth had the highest score on aesthetics. The natural background image had the highest score on perceived depth and affordance, while the uniform background had the highest score on image quality. Overall it can be concluded that an auto-stereoscopic display has clearly added value for the design of a graphical user interface on a mobile device. The various variables studied for the graphical user interface affected different aspects of its overall experience. Clearly, a ‘sinking background’ depth mode is more appreciated than a ‘floating icon’ depth mode. A background containing depth is clearly appreciated from an aesthetic point of view. Additionally, the user interface should be designed such that no artifacts affecting the overall image quality are introduced. As the amount of disparity that has to be used is very dependent on the viewer, it may be a good option to allow the user of a mobile device to personalize the amount of disparity to his or her own preference.","auto-stereoscopic display; 3D; mobile device; depth cues","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction Group","","","",""

(mentor); Schoormans, J.P.L. (mentor)","2010","This master thesis shows the design process of “Developing an innovative product for Bolletje, based on rusk”. Bolletje is a Dutch company which is specialized in making bakery products with a long storage life. The brand Bolletje has an awareness of 98% in the Netherlands and its core product is rusk. This product is closely associated with the brand Bolletje. Two other interesting facts were found concerning this product. (1) Rusk has not been strongly promoted in the media the last years which can lead in a decrease of the target group on the long term, (2) Bolletje has just five different rusk variations on the market. Unlike, for example, the knäckebröd market where are fifteen knäckebröd variations, varying from different flavours to total new products addressing a new need of the consumer. These two facts have led to the graduation assignment to develop an innovative ‘rusk based’ product. Bolletje can expand with this new product their rusk category in the market, resulting in an increase of the target group. The product innovation process has been followed for working out this assignment. In the first phase, the Fuzzy Front End, a qualitative research has been held. In the qualitative research participants had to make a collage about their eating moments during a weekday. After this they were interviewed about rusk and everything in this context. Out of the qualitative research insights were derived which formed the basis in this report for the development of ‘rusk based’ ideas. Performing two brainstorm sessions was the start of phase two, New Product Development. In the brainstorm session were ideas for a ‘rusk based’ product generated. The ideas that had most potential based on the criteria “innovative” and “fit to the brand Bolletje” were chosen and further evaluated with key Bolletje employees. This has led to a top five. These five are worked out into concepts. One concept was chosen to continue with and this is the concept mini rusk. It is technical most feasible and it has the most potential, because it is addressing a different need of the rusk-eating consumer. This concept is further developed and some characteristics of the product are: the diameter of the product is 50mm, the height is 15 mm and a flavour is put on the rusk. This flavour could be salty or sweet and both options tasted nice. For this project there is chosen to continue with the sweet flavour cinnamon and sugar. Though the option to market the product later with a salty flavours stays open. The developed concept concerns a line extension of rusk. To get more information about the factors that affect the success of a line extension in the market, a literature study has been performed. This study has led to the fact that the mini rusk best can be market in the in-between market. In the last phase of the product innovation process, commercialization, the product was evaluated by consumers and a market strategy is developed. Result from quantitative research showed that participants liked the mini rusk. They found the product ready to eat and the product looks like rusk. A negative finding was that some participants found the mini rusk too dry. Based on the results of this quantitative study, a first draft market strategy was developed. There is advised to market the product in the in-between shelf close to the product of the brand Snack-a-Jack. The price of the product should be around 1,35 and for the name of the product B’schuitjes is chosen. The product should be packed in portion packages. Finally some recommendations were done about: the dryness of the rusk, the name, appearance of the package, price and market strategy.","consumer research; food product; innovative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-02-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Product innovation management","","","",""

(mentor); Buijs, J.A. (mentor)","2010","O’Neill, a surf lifestyle brand, has a legacy of bringing innovation into the surf world. Therefore they always have had innovation as an important brand driver. However currently O’Neill lacks a structure where new product ideas are systematically developed. There is no way to communicate an idea and to spread an idea around the company. Therefore whenever someone has a new product idea, he has no place to put to be further developed and then the idea comes to a stop However O’Neill needs these new product ideas, since they are the seeds for innovation. Therefore a graduation project was executed, to design a software tool which not only makes it possible for all employees within O’Neill to communicate new product ideas, but also to involve other employees from different departments into the initial steps of development of the new product idea. This way the new product idea is given an initial chance to grow and become more suitable for the company before a decision is being made about the follow-up of the new product idea. Current software solutions for idea management have been investigated. It appears that they can be used as communication means for new product ideas. However there is still room for improvement on the matter of the creative steps of idea development. When you compare these tools with the principles that support groups to be creative, called creative facilitation, there are quite a few differences which make the current idea management tools unsuitable for creative idea development. Based on the principles behind creative facilitation demands for the tool have been described in order to improve the potential of the tool of involving other employees into the development of a product idea: Employees need to be guided, all contributors have to become owner of the idea, and there should be no hierarchy in the creative process. To make sure that this tool will work in a remote setting (as opposed to a group setting in which creative sessions are carried out) three challenges will have to be met: Employees need to be confronted with new ideas, ideas need to be updated based on contributions, and motivation needs more attention. Since this tool has to work in a specific environment, O’Neill is investigated to understand the way employees think and work. This results in 5 demands for the tool to fit in with the culture of the company. It has to spark the imagination, it has to guide through suggestion, employees have interact with it in a visual way, interacting with the tool should be low-barrier and the interaction has to happen in a quick and dirty way. With this view on the project 13 concepts have been generated. The one which fits in the most with O’Neill has been chosen: A concept in which a product is presented visually with a certatin type of consumer and a certain context, thus creating a use situation. Employees can contribute to this by editing the situation making remarks and creating new situations for the idea. Some additional features have been designed to guide employees to do this (for instance a database with information on new products, new types of consumers and new contexts). This concept has been developed to a real tool, called Jack-in-the-Box. This is done up to a level where this could be directly programmed. The methodology behind the tool has been tested to see whether employees would enjoy working with Jack-in-the-Box, and whether this way of working with ideas empowers employees to contribute constructively to new product ideas. From this test it appeared that employees enjoyed working in this way. Also the tool proved to be a first good step in the direction of developing a software tool, where employees can remotely work on the real development of ideas. From the test also some recommendations are made and the possibilities of such a tool within organizations is explored.","innovation culture; idea management; ìnnovation tool; creativity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Well-known examples include GMail, Hotmail, Google Wave and office applications. One common way to provide assurance about the correctness of such complex and evolving systems is through regression testing. Regression testing classical web applications has already been a notoriously daunting task because of the dynamism in web interfaces. AJAX applications pose an even greater challenge since the test case fragility degree is higher due to extensive run-time manipulation of the DOM tree, asynchronous client/server interactions, and (untyped) JAVASCRIPT. In this research, we propose a technique, in which we automatically infer a model of the web application and use this as an input for the test suite. We apply pipelined oracle comparators along with generated templates, to deal with the dynamic non-deterministic behavior in AJAX user interfaces. Our approach, implemented in the open source testing tool CRAWLJAX, provides a set of generic oracle comparators, template generators, and preconditions for handling the dynamic aspect of AJAX applications. We present a plugin that shows visualizations of test failure output in terms of differences between expected and observed DOM trees.We describe four case studies evaluating the effectiveness, scalability, and required manual effort of the approach and the applicability of CRAWLJAX in a real world production environment.

(mentor); Lindenbergh, R.C. (mentor); Storms, J.E.A. (mentor)","2010","The formation of the current Rhine-Meuse delta has mainly taken place during the Holocene (the last 12,000 years). This period is characterised by avulsions that lead to sudden shifts in the location of river channels. The channel deposits left behind by abandoned rivers are often distinct sandy layers in the shallow sub-surface, called buried channel deposits. Knowledge of the location of buried channel deposits is interesting from a historical point of view and is essential for planning, constructing and maintaining structures that intersect these channels. Traditionally, buried channel deposits are traced using labour intensive soil drillings and visual interpretation. However, some buried channel deposits can also be detected by using local elevation differences (1 - 2 m) caused by differential compaction. Automating the detection process and using Digital Elevation Models could result in faster processing and a higher detailed, more objective map. This leads to the following research question: is it possible to automatically derive a detailed map of buried channel deposits from high resolution laser altimetry data? The dataset used for this purpose is a rasterized elevation model measured by the FLI-MAP system with the same specifications as AHN-2. First, two filtering methods are applied to remove infrastructure and other objects using existing topographical data (GBKN) and terrain characteristics (variability and density). If these objects are not removed they cause errors in the final result. In the detection procedure four structural attributes are calculated using the elevation dataset: slope, curvature, relative elevation (TPI) and smoothed TPI. This is done to use as much of the available information in the detection procedure. With these attributes a multi-band image is formed. Classification is then performed using a Maximum Likelihood classifier were each point is assigned to a predefined class. A majority filter is applied on the result and empty areas are interpolated using a conditional dilation to get a full coverage of the area. Processing speed is increased by downsampling datapatches that are used for computational intensive algorithms. Additional automation of the detection process is performed by developing a method to resolve edge effects on tiled datasets. Validation is performed by comparing the detection result to two independent datasets. A palaeogeographic map is used to make a numerical and visual comparison. An analysis using shallow drilling measurements is performed to determine the depth of the detected sand layers. The results indicate that buried channel deposits (between 4,620 and 1,700 years old) can be mapped roughly in a fully automatic way. The probability that these channels are within a certain depth can be calculated. Validation shows that this new method is strongly hampered due to human intervention in the landscape. Further research is recommended to improve the filtering and detection method.","buried channel deposits; FLI-MAP; airborne laser scanning; Rhine-Meuse delta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-19","Aerospace Engineering","Mathematical Geodesy and Positioning","","","",""

(mentor); Banga, I. (mentor); Snelders, H.M.J.J. (mentor)","2010","For Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) to become preferred airport in Europe, Schiphol Group constantly invests in innovation. Dynamic Branding, the topic of this graduation project, is one such innovation. It entails the exploration of means for airlines to identify themselves in a common-use check-in area in 2015. Common-use check-in implies that passengers can check-in with every airline at any of the (self-service) facilities within the confined area. The reason why common-use is appealing is that it can solve the current capacity shortage due to more efficient use of the space and facilities. This graduation project consists of multiple phases, all through which the focus lies on the check-in (process/facilities). Each phase will be shortly described in the following paragraphs. During the analysis phase of this project, the roles of the many stakeholders at AAS are analyzed. The passenger plays a leading role, and their experience is influenced by factors such as waiting time, reliability of the process, ambiance, etc. The quality of the passenger’s experience is thus reliant on the service offered by the airlines, the airport and the handlers. The airlines provide the principal service of airline travel, which includes the (pre)departure processes. The airlines contract one of the various handler companies at AAS to carry out these processes, such as check-in, boarding and baggage handling. AAS facilitates the departure process through their infrastructure, facilities and extensive information system. During the Idea Generation phase, a design goal is set up. Additionally, to get inspired and to strategically launch the idea of common-use check-in, a creative session is organized with people from Schiphol Group. While generating the first ideas, it became clear that branding is inherently linked to the process. In addition, most branding and communication means in the departure halls have been added over time; some temporary solutions have even turned into permanent ones. So, in order to come up with a strong Dynamic Branding concept, a process for 2015 has to be developed. Based on a largely self-service process, several concept elements are put forward, such as overview, reassurance and flexible demarcation of the common-use area. The first step towards common-use is to cluster on the level of the alliances. The concept focuses on (restructuring) the different levels of information that direct the passenger through the check-in process. Starting in the areas leading up to the departure hall, wayfinding is enhanced by depicting the airline and alliance branding. In the departure hall itself, shields are placed at each self-service drop-off point (SSDOP). They communicate the common-use clusters (the alliances) and the member airlines departing within 5 hours. Additionally, the class of service (i.e. economy or first class) of the facility is communicated. According to the demand, each facility can be separately allocated to an alliance cluster, accounting for the dynamic character of the concept. Also, it is possible to use the shields of unallocated SSDOP’s for additional branding, such as See Buy Fly advertising. Concurrently, the shields also create a personal space at the SSDOP’s. This personal space makes it possible to target the applicable airline branding and process information at the passenger, through the designed interface of the SSDOP display. Additionally, the passenger can acquire reassurance by consulting the ID posts, found at multiple locations throughout the terminal. The ID posts are information points, including wayfinding, airline and commercial information, to help reassure passengers at certain decisions points throughout the departure process. The information content of the posts is dependent on their location. For instance, at the ‘entrance’ of the bay areas, the posts provide the passengers with a quick, ‘at a glance’ overview of their progress towards their final goal of getting on the right plane. The Dynamic Branding concept helps create ground for the common-use model among the airlines (alliances), to defer a large investment otherwise needed to increase the capacity (Departures 0). Most properties can be revised as to fit a specific check-in area and the branding accordingly.","Airline; Branding; Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

If 40% of the electricity consumed in residential lighting could be saved, a 320 MW power plant could be taken off the grid. The European Union has acknowledged this problem. Its `ban on bulbs'--regulation tries to force consumers to switch to more efficient lighting (such as the compact fluorescent lamp or the LED lamp). However, we would like to know whether the ban will be effective. Are there other policy measures, perhaps more transition-oriented, that are also effective? This research aims to create insights into the ill-understood dynamics in the complex system of consumer lighting. The main research question is ""How can we explore the consequences the E.U.\ ban on bulbs will have on the electricity demand of the consumer lighting sector?"" A socio-technical systems perspective is applied to the system, with insights from innovation diffusion theory, and marketing science. The consumer lighting sector is a complex socio-technical system. Consumers mutually influence each other through word-of-mouth and normative adaptation, but they are also subject to influences of manufacturers, stores, government and technological options. The dynamics of the consumer lighting sector cannot be understood in advance, which necessitates a social simulations approach for assessing the consequences of the ban on bulbs, as well as from a number of different policy option. An agent-based model is developed in which consumers are simulated in their behaviour (purchase, sharing of information). Consumers are modelled based on heterogeneous preferences and have memory and perceptions. The results indicate that the ban on bulbs will be effective in realising an energy efficient sector, albeit at significant expense to consumers. Interesting so, a tax (of 2 euro) on incandescent light bulbs is also effective given that it is high enough. A full summary of the research is included in pages v-vii of the thesis.","Transition Management; Consumer Lighting; Agent Based Modeling; Social Simulation; Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","","",""

The thesis project is the third stage of a continuous Direct Memory Access(DMA) Controller project in NXP Semiconductors for the purpose of specifying and implementing a DMA Controller to take over data communication tasks from the microprocessor. In the first step of the thesis, a test principle was investigated to fully test the existing results, but the simulation results of the Core Unit did not satisfy the requirements. The Core Unit of the DMA Controller is responsible for the sequential-single transfer and burst transfer involving wait states. The existing specification and implementation were analyzed, and a number of possible approaches for improvements were identified. During the second step, the Core Unit was re-specified according to these approaches, and fully implemented using VHDL to fulfill the requirements. After the Core Unit design, the functions of Linked List transfer was specified with Hatley and Pirbhai methodology. The Linked List Unit, which manages the Linked List transfer, was specified to support both the Static and Dynamic Linked List transfer. This specification provides an essential base for the future implementation. The implementation of the Core Unit was tested with Simvision following the proposed test principle. The results satisfied the function requirements. Thus, the specification was proved to be feasible. Additionally, the Core Unit was synthesized using Cadence Ambit. The number of the equivalent gates of a Core Unit Cell is 3k, which is smaller than the currently used DMA Controller in NXP Semiconductors.","DMA Controller; Hatley and Pirbhai Methdology; Core Unit; Burst Transfer; Wait State; Linked List","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Brand, D.I. (mentor); De Winter, R. (mentor)","2010","Welding is a heavy and dangerous job; the heat, smoke, splashes, radiation and gasses that arise make protection very important. Good protective accessories are necessary. Welders use; gloves, glasses, jackets, hats and welding helmets to protect themselves. The extensive use of protective accessories and especially a welding helmet causes lots of comfort problems during welding activities. Most welders make long working days using their protection; therefore quality and comfort are very important aspects. Vlamboog is a supplier of welding accessories and personal protective equipment. Vlamboog produces electrode holders, gauging clamps and the Multi Vision welding helmets. These welding helmets are on the market for over 13 years and Vlamboog sees possibilities for innovation and improvement. That is why this graduation project was originated. An extended research on the welding market and the current protective accessories clarified the need for an innovative and more comfortable protective device. The current products offer sufficient protection for welding, but there is a lack of comfort in all day use. The safety regulations become more severe and the need for more advanced welding helmets is growing. The welding market is very conservative but more often combinations of welding helmets, safety helmets and fresh air units are used for personal protection. This research has led to a vision for designing a new protective device; that needs to become a successor of the Multi Vision products. The device should be multifunctional protecting welders in all their diverse activities. It needs to offer protection against all welding dangers; heat, radiation, smoke, flying particles and falling objects. Acceptation by the users is important; therefore it must be comfortable for all day use. Especially weight reduction and distribution are important, as well as robustness and protection aspects. The device needs to appeal to future welders. This vision is used in a design process and concept ideas where developed. These ideas where translated into three concepts and the one with most potential is selected. This concept is based upon the current product layout in order to be accepted in the conservative welding market. Some innovative functions are implemented and the whole product will be designed for full protection and comfortable use. During the third phase the embodiment design is made and the innovative functions are given form. The whole shell is designed for appeal and functions as base of the device. A concept for 2020 was created. And the design is translated into a prototype that is used for testing the new features. Most functions have potential to become successful. Although some changes need to be implemented for final production, the working principles are tested on their functionality. The complete design appeals well and has potential to become successful in the welding market. The process to market introduction has been described in the fourth phase of the project. This implies a product development planning with recommendation for design changes. The pricing and promotion strategies are mainly based upon existing structures within Vlamboog. The device will be branded under the Multi Vision brand. The project resulted in a new design which has potential on the market. The knowledge and resources of Vlamboog will enable welders of the future to use a more comfortable and healthier protective device during welding activities.","design; head protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-02-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis discusses the use of perturbation theory in the context of financial mathematics, in particular on the use of matched asymptotic expansions in option pricing. Our methods are applied to the ordinary Black-Scholes model for illustration. In this simple example of the Black-Scholes model an exact solution is available, so it is in fact not neccessary to apply the method of asymptotic expansions on this model. However, in case we do apply the method, two artificial layers have to be constructed. Making smart choices for the local variables leads to a transformation of the equations into a heat equation, which can easily be solved. Finally, the results are compared to a Taylor expansion of the exact solution to see that this method is very accurate. After this first instructive model, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is applied to two more advanced models based on papers by Sam Howison and Patrick Hagan et al.. Here, different choices for the scalings are made. The former discusses a fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility model that turns out to have many open ends. In Howison's paper quite a lot of assumptions and simplifications are made. Unfortunately, often the motivation for them is not explicitly given in the paper, and in some cases we even think these assumptions and simplifications are incorrect. The latter examines a new three-parameter stochastic volatility model that successfully prices back the volatility smile as observed in the market nowadays, and that is commonly used. The derivation of this model is the main focus of this thesis. The resulting expression for the implied volatility under the SABR model is obtained by considering the forward and backward Kol-mogorov equations per order in epsilon, making some smart choices for local variables and functions in order to transform them into an equation that looks like a heat equation, which is easier to solve. Recommendations for further investigation on these models would be to consider several different choices for the scalings and see which one works best.","European options; option price; perturbation theory; method of matched asymptotic expansions; implied volatility; financial models; financial derivatives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this thesis, the implementations of Single Electron Tunneling (SET) circuits for Brownian Motion Based Logic and Arithmetic Computation were investigated. Random fluctuations and noise are major factors interfering with the operation of nanometer scale electronic devices and circuits, as the feature size decreases. In SET technology, one of these interfering effects, namely quantum tunneling, is actually utilized for computations by controlling the transport of individual electrons. However, at the single electron level, random fluctuations are largely unavoidable. In previous research, Brownian Motion based building blocks were proposed which take advantage of random fluctuations to function. i.e, Conservative Join (CJoin)and Hub. However, the SET design of the CJoin had two major limitations when taking industrial implementation into account. Firstly, it had long diagonal wires that appear on the design literally. Secondly, the circuit parameters of the tunnel junction capacitances fell short of the industrial standard. In this research we present a new design for the Cjoin, i.e, the Redesigned CJoin. In the Redesigned CJoin the long diagonal wires that cause routing problem are eliminated and additionally the circuit parameters are industrially realizable, while meeting the same functionality. Secondly, we construct networks of the Redesigned CJoin design and the Hub and show that the two blocks can be used to build computational units. We investigate networks of two Hubs and one redesign CJoin, three Hubs and two redesign CJoin and network of four Hubs and four redesign CJoin. Third, we propose logic and arithmetic computation with 2-by-2 CJoin Brownian circuit Network. We investigate the logic and arithmetic computation with 2-by-2 CJoin based NAND-gate, NOR-gate and Half-Adder. Finally, we utilized a buffering scheme from previous research to improve the functionality robustness of the Half-Adder. We also investigate static buffer with circuit parameters at 1K. We investigate a static Buffered 2-by-2 CJoin based Half-Adder. All designs in this thesis are verified through simulations.

The airline industry is a worldwide operating business to transport passengers and freight in an economical and fast manner. Jet engines consume kerosene to power the aircraft. However, kerosene is a distillate of crude oil and airlines are entirely dependent on this energy source. As a result, airlines are facing two problems. Firstly, the energy security is at stake when the conventional oil resources are depleted. Secondly, green house gases are produced by burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is one of them and it is regarded by scientists as contributor to climate change (IPCC fourth assessment report group I, 2007). Biofuels solve these two issues, as they are renewable and they emit less carbon dioxide. Several airlines have already conducted test flights with biofuels, such as Virgin Atlantic, Air New Zeeland, Japan Air Lines and KLM. Feedstocks for these biofuels were camelina, jatropha and micro algae. Macro algae are also a feedstock for biofuels. This report is dedicated to the feasibility of bio jet fuel from macro algae from an end-to-end chain perspective. The main research fields were on the technical side, sustainability side and economical side of the bio jet fuel. Technically, it is possible to produce bio jet fuel from macro algae. Several macro algae cultivation methods and conversion methods exists to produce bio jet fuel. It is also better for the environment. The carbon dioxide emissions are reduced at least with 75% compare to fossil fuels. Besides this, the energy balance is also positive. More energy is produced in the form of biofuel than the energy is needed to produce it. An issue so far is the economical side of bio jet fuel. Bio jet fuel is substantially more expensive than fossil fuels. The price will decline when the production of macro algae increase. The transition from fossil fuels to biofuels will take decades and large investments are essential. In this report, several actions are discussed how the transition to bio jet fuels can be accelerated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Many governments in developing countries fail to deliver affordable and sustainable water and sanitation services to their people, particularly the poor. Weak governance, insufficient investments in infrastructure, and inadequate tariff structures are considered to be at the core of poor performing water utilities. Since 2006 the UN Secretary General!s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation is promoting the WOP (Water Operator Partnership) concept as a way to improve worldwide access to water supply and sanitation. The WOP is defined as a structured program of cooperation among water operators, implemented through mutual support based on knowledge transfer on a not for profit basis. Vitens Evides International (VEI), an alliance of two Dutch drinking water companies, is involved in different WOPs in Yemen, Vietnam and Mongolia. Each project has its successes, but also difficulties are experienced during the execution of the partnerships. To support future decision making on participation in new partnerships, VEI attaches importance to research on lessons that can be learned so far from the ongoing partnerships. The main question in this research is: What factors decisively affect the performance of a WOP, (how) can these factors be influenced, and what conclusions are to be drawn given a certain state of these factors when assessing the feasibility of a successful WOP? Two of VEI!s currently executed WOPs (one in Da Nang (Vietnam) and one in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia)) were analyzed in order to identify the determinants of a successful WOP. Against the backlight of a theoretical framework provided by the New Institutional Economics (NIE), a qualitative holistic approach to case study research was chosen. By doing so, the case study findings provided the opportunity to – apart from drawing conclusions about the determinants of a successful WOP – reflect on the applicability of the NIE theories on the concept of a WOP. The theories provided by the NIE appeared to be unable to give an explanation for the empirical observations, and give no coherence to the observed characteristics of transactions, actors, and coordination mechanisms. Reflection on the theory shows the context specificity of the NIE framework. The identified determinants of a successful WOP are: a supportive institutional context of the water sector, and relationships between the key individuals that execute the partnership, that are based on trust, respect, and mutual understanding. Building such relationships asks for frequent interaction, time, patience, and for generating “quick wins”.","Water Operator Partnership (WOP); New Institutional Economics (NIE); water sector; Vitens Evides International (VEI)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-27","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Infrastructures","","","",""

This is the pressure exerted by the fluid on the structure as a result of the different behavior in motion of solid and fluid. To determine this pressure there are several available methods which focus mainly on large dams or fluid storage containers. However, the hydrodynamic behavior of these types of structures is different and these methods may or may not be applicable for navigation locks. Therefore an analysis is made to determine the factors that contribute to the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on large lock structures. As a case study the Third Set of Locks Project of the Panama Canal is used. This expansion project ensures that the Panama Canal can process larger ships than the current Panamax class of ships, which dimensions are limited by the existing locks. Therefore larger locks are required which will operate next to the existing locks. The new locks are planned to be operational in 2014-2015. The Panama region is prone to earthquakes which could result in large hydrodynamic pressures on the locks. For the evaluation of hydrodynamic pressure on large lock structures, two analytical (1D and 2D) and one 2D finite-element model using DIANA are made. Three main aspects that contribute to hydrodynamic pressure are treated in detail: - Lock dimensions and water levels; - The effect of surface waves on the hydrodynamic pressure distribution; - The flexibility of the structure.","hydrodynamic pressures; locks; panama canal; DIANA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Since reverse osmosis membranes are designed to be operated for continuous periods under constant power, it has been unclear how the fluctuating operation will affect the performance of the membranes. In these experiments, a small-scale reverse osmosis unit (maximum production 8 m3/day) was set up in the laboratory to continually recycle and treat a reservoir of artificial seawater (32 800 mg/L NaCl). The power of the high pressure pump feeding the reverse osmosis membranes is fluctuated corresponding to inputs of real wind data entered through an automated computer system. Measurements of pressure, permeate production and conductivity were continually recorded and used to determine if there were changes in the membrane permeability coefficient and salt rejection of the membrane resulting from fluctuating operation. After more than 650 hours of fluctuating operation, no deterioration of reverse osmosis membrane performance was observed.","reverse osmosis membrane; fluctuating operation; flucuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

In the heart of this platform Joost uses a large database called the MDDB to store all video and channel meta data, however there was no proper way to analyze this data. Our assignment was to extract this information from the MDDB and supply this data in such a way that it can be imported by a Business Intelligence suite called Diver. The Diver program then enables the Business Intelligence team to get easy insight into the data, using figures, charts and other analytical functionality of the program. After ten weeks of labor we produced an application, named IMDEAD, that performs this task. This application offers a command line interface to start the extraction and parsing process. Also almost all settings used in the program are configurable, so that the execution can easily be adapted to each situation. The current implementation can be improved in a few ways. At the moment it does not allow for easy extension concerning Diver output. Also the locking system can be improved. Besides these improvements, we have assessed a few possible extensions to the program. At first the program might also integrate the Hadoop database data and hence be able to correlate this data with the meta data from the MDDB. Secondly, an archiving system could be introduced to provide Business Intelligence with an option to store and view historical data. In the conclusion we verify that the IMDEAD application complies with all the original software specifications and hence we conclude that we have successfully accomplished our assignment at Joost Technologies.","metadata; database; analyses","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","","",""

In this system, the surfaces are subdivided in a preprocessing step to better localize ray-patch intersections and to provide better initial seed-points for the root-finder to converge more quickly. For scene-traversal, two approaches have been investigated, a packet-based traversal scheme, employing a shared stack implemented using the GPU's fast on-chip memory. The second approach uses an optimized single-ray traversal scheme, in which the scene-traversal and root-finding are separated from each other, to help maximize the utilization during root-finding. The single-ray approach turns out to be up to three times faster than the packet-based approach. Furthermore, a hybrid approach has been used in tracing primary rays, by employing the rasterizer. Besides that only one ray-patch intersection test is required per ray, the initial seedpoints provided by the rasterization are very close. Using the hybrid approach, the performance will generally be increased.

The Issue Churn View shows quantitative changes in the open issues for a project and can be used to show the changes in activity in an issue tracker. The Issue Lifecycle View provides a more detailed view of the issue handling process and shows the age composition of the issues, as well as simultaneous events on multiple issues. The SIG quality profile model is applied to issue trackers, resulting in a model that allows us to compare systems based on the speed with which issues are resolved. By comparing the ratings from this model to system maintainability, we conclude that there is significant correlation between system maintainability and defect resolution time. The most correlated system properties are unit size and complexity and module coupling.","software repository mining; software maintainability; issue tracker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In the Netherlands, four million people watch television programs with closed captions because they are hearing impaired or non-native speakers. Closed captions contain Dutch speech transcriptions and non-speech sound descriptions and are displayed as subtitles. Due to government obligation, the number of television programs that must be closed-captioned will increase to at least 95% in 2011. Closed caption alignment comprises the timing of the subtitles as closely as possible to the corresponding times of the video signal. Since alignment is a costly and labor intensive process demanding high quality outputs, an automated solution is desirable. This thesis addresses the application of automatic speech recognition to the task of on-line closed-captioning of television programs. The thesis focuses on the development of an automatic closed caption alignment system for TT888, a company that produces subtitles for Dutch-language television programs. Investigation of related research, consulting professional editors and analyses of a variety of captioned television programs have contributed to the development of an automatic closed-captioning system named SETH (Speech Estimating Title Heuristics). The core of the system is an algorithm capable of matching manually produced captions with speech transcriptions produced by a large vocabulary speech recognizer. The architecture of SETH combines the benefits of modular programming and the pipes and filters architecture. The best results are achieved when the speech is rather formal and nonspontaneous, pure Dutch pronounced by a native speaker and does not contain crosstalk nor background noise. Dissimilarities between the speech and captions are not a major problem as long as the captions include the most important words. The alignment algorithm is also robust to most of the insertions caused by music. Deviant language use, songs, spontaneous speech, strong regional accents are still a difficult job for the speech recognizer and hence a major problem in automatic closed caption alignment. Since there will always be broadcasts with poor speech quality, manual verification or adaptation of the subtitles remain necessary.","closed captioning; subtitle alignment; natural language processing; speech recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction Group","","Media & Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bronsvoort, W.F. (mentor)","2010","Due to an increase in scale and amount of detail needed for next gen games, the time required to design a game world has increased dramatically. Even though more advanced tools have become available, designing a game world is still largely done by hand. One area that suffers substantially from this is the design of large scale natural phenomena like rivers and mountains. The goal of this project is to research and implement a procedural approach for designing large scale natural phenomena inside a game level, culminating in a prototype level design tool. In the first part of this project three related subjects are discussed. The first subject is the role of level design within the game development process and activities performed by a level designer. Both have been put into a historical perspective that explains why level design came into existence and what the future of level design might look like. Secondly, a better understanding is acquired of the natural phenomena we are trying to generate. This is done by looking at three models used in earth science. These models provide a top down view of natural phenomena, starting with our earth as a whole, all the way down to individual landforms. Combined, these models offer insight into the processes that form natural phenomena and provide a framework for describing and classifying them. The final research subject is procedural content creation, which separates the design of game content from the actual construction. By automating the construction part, which takes by far the largest amount of time, the efficiency of the entire content creation process is increased significantly. Because procedural content creation is already being used in a handful of specialized tools, two of these tools are reviewed. From these reviews, a number of guidelines are proposed that should be kept in mind during the development of a procedural content creation tool. The result of the research performed during this project is the concept of natural systems; a procedural level design approach that separates the shape of natural phenomena from how they look. With natural systems, the user defines two separate components. The first is a shape in the game world, which can either be a freeform area or a fat curve. The second is the natural system blueprint which dictates what the natural system looks like. The blueprint is designed using four kinds of environmental features that specify the height and color of the terrain, the vegetation that grows there and the height of the water level. By applying a natural system blueprint to a shape, an instance of a natural system is created in the game world. This instance is generated on the fly and in real-time. Any changes made by the designer to the shape or the blueprint are therefore applied to each natural system instance immediately. In the second part of this project a prototype level editor has been implemented that allows the user to design a game level using natural systems. The prototype is developed inside Cannibal Composer, which is a framework for game editors, and uses the Cannibal Engine for visualization. Because the natural phenomena that are modeled with natural systems are often very large, it was necessary to adopt a new terrain visualization technique that can display very large terrains. Great care has been taken into separating the terrain data from its visualization to make the system easier to work with and maintain. The result of this effort is the concept of data providers, an extension to clipmap terrains that functions as a two-way interface between the data of a terrain and its visualization. Because the user should be able to freely mix manual and procedural editing, a special layering system has been implemented as part of the Composer framework. With the work performed during this project, we have proposed natural systems as a procedural alternative to manually editing large scale natural phenomena. Although the current prototype is not yet ready to be used in a real production, it shows that the procedural approach taken with natural systems is able to increase the efficiency of designing and changing natural phenomena significantly. Natural systems also allow a level designer to reuse existing natural system blueprints, further increasing his performance. Future work should focus on improving the performance of the procedure that combines a shape with a blueprint and on increasing the usability of the system. The former can be achieved by implementing large parts of the procedure on the GPU. The latter involves improving and extending the available environmental features and the editing interface presented to the user.","procedural; content creation; level design; natural systems; environmental features; computer games; computer graphics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); Juurlink, B. (mentor)","2010","How to develop effcient and scalable parallel applications is the key challenge for emerging many-core architectures. We investigate this question by implementing and comparing two parallel H.264 decoders on the Cell architecture. It is expected that future many-cores will use a Cell-like local store memory hierarchy, rather than a non-scalable shared memory. The two implemented parallel algo-rithms, the Task Pool (TP) and the novel Ring-Line (RL) approach, both exploit macroblock-level parallelism. The TP implementation follows the master-slave paradigm and is very dynamic so that in theory perfect load balancing can be achieved. The RL approach is distributed and more predictable in the sense that the mapping of macroblocks to processing elements is fixed. This allows to better exploit data locality, to overlap communication with computation, and to reduce communication and synchronization overhead. While TP is more scalable in theory, the actual scalability favors RL. Using 16 SPEs, RL obtains a scalability of 12x, while the TP implementation only 10.3x. More importantly, the absolute performance of RL is much higher. Using 16 SPEs, RL achieves a throughput of 139.6 frames per second (fps) while TP achieves only 76.6 fps. A large part of the additional performance advantage is due to hiding the memory latency. From the results we conclude that in order to fully leverage the performance of future many-cores, a centralized master should be avoided and the mapping of tasks to cores should be predictable in order to be able to hide the memory latency.","H.264; Cell Broadband Engine; parallel; decoding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","CE","",""

In this study magnetite bearing samples were distinguished from greigite bearing samples. In more than 75% of the samples it was legitimate to decide upon IRM and Curie measurements whether the sample consisted mainly of magnetite or greigite. For the uncertain part of the samples additional experiments were carried out to further determine the mineral content. One of the data processing steps, the construction of IRM components analysis graphs, was rather subjective. Finally it was found that at certain depths the natural remanent magnetism is small because of a small magnetic mineral content. Later formed authigenic greigite is able to lower the overall remanent magnetization due to having an opposite polarity than the polarity being present in the earlier deposited magnetic minerals.","ferromagnetic; ghmt tool; geomagnetism","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Geology","","","",""

(mentor); Van Diessen, R. (mentor); Gross, H. (mentor)","2010","Because of their poor Business/IT alignment, many legacy systems lack the flexibility to support rapid changes to the business processes they implement, required by today's enterprises. Furthermore, after many years of maintenance, there is a need to manage their resulting increased complexity and maximize asset utilization through reuse. The third complicating circumstance is that these legacy systems cannot simply be replaced as it is too expensive and risky. For these three reasons, legacy systems are modernized towards a Service Oriented Architecture. This thesis presents a framework for performing an impact analysis of such a modernization. It supports the trade-off analysis, needed in the planning phase, for finding the optimal selection of modernization strategies and judging their yield. The impact is expressed through the estimation of, on the one side, the effort and, on the other side, the gain of the changes these modernization strategies entail. The thesis concentrates on one of the many types of changes in modernization -- the architectural and design changes to the software system. The presented framework structures current approaches to modernization in a set of class definitions, system model relationships and a process description. This is done according to the effort they produce, preparing them for its estimation. For this effort estimation, this thesis introduces a Rating Model for quantifying the modernization effort using the system models of the framework. This quantification is done through the identification of so-called Points of Modernization, a categorization of the modernization strategies and a set of effort indicator metrics. Based on this framework, this thesis also presents an experiment. For a subject legacy system, concrete approaches are shown for the instantiation of the framework models and the subsequent effort estimation is done using the indicator of Scattering. The analysis of the resulting effort and its relation to the gain show the optimal solutions for the modernization of the subject system. Concluding, this thesis discusses the feasibility of the approach and the future work such as more quantitative research on the rest of the effort indicators.","SOA; Service Oriented Architecture; software architecture; Modernization; legacy system; effort estimation; modernization effort; trade-off analysis; impact analysis; metrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","","",""

This has resulted in the emergence of Business Process Management (BPM), a field that has quickly grown into a multi billion euro industry. The development of the industry has led to an abundance of tools and methodologies that claim enormous benefits. In practice however, most organisations attain a low level of maturity in managing their business processes and largely continue to rely on standard office tooling. There is a large gap between theoretical BPM developments and its application in practice. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the state-of-the-art in BPM tools and methodologies and its suitability for satisfying the expectations of a large financial service provider?s financial accounting department starting with BPM. The expectations are elicited using a self-constructed catalogue of criteria and a case study has taken place at a financial accounting department of a large Dutch financial service provider. The empirical results gathered from the case study combined with an extensive literature review allow the main research goal to be answered. Although it is not possible to give a definitive verdict, BPM tools and methodologies do not appear to form a bottleneck in the practice of BPM. This thesis provides recommendations to tool and methodology developers through which they can improve their products and to organisations practicing BPM so they can improve their current approaches. A practical advice is given to the management of the case study department that allows them to determine their BPM strategy.

The project is executed under the authority of the TU Delft, at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, as part of the master Design for Interaction. The client is Born Digital, an organization that supports collaborations between New Media artists both within a national and an international network. Key-points of both the virtual and physical ways in which Born Digital manifests itself are the creation of art, the sharing of knowledge and creativity, and the development of a multidisciplinary network. The term New Media art refers to art that is created by using new media technology, and encompasses a great number of artists and disciplines. The focus of this graduation assignment is limited to the creation of static visual art, created for commercial or educational purposes. Disciplines that are related to this assignment are graphic design, illustration, photography, typography, cartoons and any other possible art forms that involve image manipulation. As a means to explore the world of the New Media artist, interviews were conducted. The goal of this approach was to gain understanding in the thoughts, considerations and actions of the potential users of the online platform. Also, the web-based project management tools Huddle and Basecamp were examined. Their features were investigated and compared to the intended functionality of the Born Digital platform. An analysis of the version control system Subversion showed how this software is able to streamline and organize files in a collaborative project that is executed online. In differently setup user tests, user behavior was observed and analyzed. Step by step, improvements were made to a prototype. The conclusions of the of the target group analysis and the investigation of existing technology, as well as the outcomes of the user tests, were used to state a list of design requirements. This list served as a basis for the design of an interface of the platform. Finally, a last user test was executed to validate the design. The graduation projected resulted in a concept for a web-based tool for the collaborative creation of static visual art. It is designed in such a way that it smoothly and intuitively guides its users through the intended interactions, meanwhile inspiring them and motivating them into participation. In this virtual environment, New Media artists have the opportunity of starting new and innovative collaborations.","online art collaboration; New Media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P.J.M. (mentor); Zevenbergen, J.A. (mentor)","2010","The main objective of this research project was to assess the quality and feasibility of the guidelines for INSPIRE Network Services. The completeness, clarity, consistency and ease-of implementation of the guidelines were considered. Part of this assessment is also the question: how can INSPIRE compliance be tested and measured? The topic was tackled both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The theoretical part of the project included a detailed investigation and assessment of the INSPIRE requirements and recommendations as regards: technical architecture of the services, functionality of the particular network services, quality of services, rights management issues, elements of spatial data and metadata models. This part of the project has been finalized with the synthesis of the guidelines derived from the INSPIRE documentation. The review of the INSPIRE documents showed that these guidelines are specific and clear enough in most points, however not yet complete. The status of work as regards the technical guidelines for particular INSPIRE Network Services is different. The topic which calls for particular attention is the adaptation of the INSPIRE services to SOAP bindings. Another item that is needed and that is currently missing in the guidelines is the provision of more strict rules for compliance testing (Abstract Test Suites (ATS) for INSPIRE services and data) and quality of service (QoS) testing. The practical part of the project was the implementation of some prototype View and Download services. For the implementation of the prototype services existing software was chosen, namely GeoServer, one of the spatial data server products implementing the OGC standards. The specific scenario chosen for the case study are web services for a national park. The spatial data for the prototype was acquired from the resources of the Narew National Park (Poland). The prototype was realized in order to validate and evaluate whether the Implementing Rules and other guidelines contained all necessary information to set up INSPIRE compliant web services, with special attention to the question how this ‘compliance’ can be measured using both manual and automated testing methods. First, the prototype has been evaluated for the compliance with INSPIRE guidelines by manual inspection of the prototype services. Secondly, the compliance test methodology proposed by OGC has been used to perform automated tests on the GeoServer instance. The evaluation of the prototype showed that the web services provided with GeoServer fulfill the majority of requirements for View/Download Services through the WMS/WFS functionalities (mandatory operation parameters, offered output formats etc.) Some elements need to be configured within GeoServer (e.g. the required spatial reference system, layer/feature type names that conform to the INSPIRE data specifications). Still, some INSPIRE-specific extensions to the functionality provided by GeoServer are needed for both services (support of the SOAP/POST methods for the service operations, solutions for multilingual aspects of services and rights management). Another requirement for the INSPIRE-conformant web services is that the spatial data and metadata are provided compliant with the data models required by INSPIRE. The study on compliance testing methodologies is followed by the recommendation that the standards and testing programs from ISO and OGC can be of particular relevance for the development of Abstract Test Suites for INSPIRE services. The reference framework for INSPIRE compliance testing can be partially based on the OGC Compliance & Interoperability Testing & Evaluation Initiative (CITE) testing program. The OGC tests are especially suitable as reference since the core technical specifications for implementation of the particular INSPIRE Network Services are the OGC web services specifications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","GIMA","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this project you will read how Christiaan Huygens used continued fractions to build a Planetarium. Continued fractions are rational approximation for (ir)rational numbers. Continued fractions resembles the Pythagoras theorem, as neither the discoverer nor their origin is known. Examples of continued fractions can be found throughout mathematics over the last 2000 years. Nevertheless, we know that Christiaan was the first to demonstrate a practical application for them.","planetarium; kettingbreuken","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","EWI","","Technisch Wiskunde","",""

(mentor); De Broe, A. (mentor); Barlas, T. (mentor)","2010","The global scope of the investigation considers the modelling of flexible wind turbine blades. Due to the increase in blade size and ever present push for better blades (in any way), less stiff blade design are (re-)entering the horizon of engineers. It is argued that due to the complexity of a flexible blade design, current modelling techniques have to be adapted or at least reviewed against new designs. In order to be able to capture the complex deformations of flexible blades (which in this case also includes structural couplings due to manipulated fibre lay-up strategies in the composite glass fibre epoxy material of the blade), a finite element analysis is required. For the aerodynamic modelling, the blade element and momentum theory is expected to give satisfactory results under fast computation times. Computational fluid dynamics is considered too time consuming (with respect to both computation times and modelling) if to be considered in an engineering friendly environment which focuses on design and analysis of multiple cases.","","","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""
