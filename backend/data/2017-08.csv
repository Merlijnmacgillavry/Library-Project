This is done by concretizing the positioning of the company and how it could communicate according to this positioning. Mooie Boules is a five year old start-up, which organizes boules events and ran a pop-up bar for young people. With the desire to grow and to create multiple permanent bars throughout The Netherlands, all relevant aspects have to be made clear for being able to create a strong brand. While analyzing the company, aspects like the core values, mission and vision of the company have been defined with the team, which capture the essence of the brand. The competitors can be divided into (1) boules, (2) leisure and (3) boules &amp; leisure. During the consumer/customer research the target group was found to be ‘bon vivants’: people who enjoy sensuous pleasures in life, such as food and drinks. The customers of Mooie Boules can be divided into four segments, which are divided by the amount of focus on boules and their visiting behaviour at Mooie Boules. These four are: the boules lover, the community friend, the day visitor and the experience seeker. Personas have been made which show what what the needs of these customer segments are. Regarding companies, which is an additional target group for the company outings at Mooie Boules, the company should focus on the already existing concept, but can adjust its offers to what the company in question wants. As a result of the total analysis, the positioning and the proposition of Mooie Boules have been defined. The positioning is: “Mooie Boules is the French originated all-in-one leisure brand for bon vivants, which enables them to enjoy their life with others. It does so by providing boules, parties, drinks and food at central places in cities.” By using the Brand Resonance Model it can be concluded that improving the brand imagery and matching the judgments and feelings with the communication, can make the brand stronger. By creating design guidance, the former research can be put into practice. This design guidance is then applied in a brand book, which consists of three parts: an explanation of the brand, the communication guidelines and a few examples of the application of these guidelines. To apply more detail on using the design guidance and to create a specified touchpoint, a website is created. It is a one-page website, with the goal to briefly explain Mooie Boules and its activities. Within the website, the upcoming food hall is explained, the different activities are illustrated and the current activities are shown.","branding; brand book; positioning; brand strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, scalability remains a key challenge. Without a horizontally scalable solution, where performance increases by adding more nodes to the system, blockchain systems remain unsuitable for ubiquitous use. We design a novel blockchain system called Checo. Each node in our system maintains a personal hash chain, which only stores transactions that the node is involved in. A consensus is reached on special blocks called checkpoint blocks rather than on all the transactions. Checkpoint blocks are effectively a hash pointer to the personal hash chains; thus a single checkpoint block may represent an arbitrarily large set of transactions. We introduce a validation protocol so that any node can check the validity of any transaction. Since it is a point-to-point protocol, we achieve horizontal scalability. We analytically evaluate our system and proof a number of highly desirable correctness properties. Further, we give a free and open-source implementation of Checo and evaluate it experimentally. Our results show a strong indication of horizontal scalability.","blockchain; consensus; distributed systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A traditional alternating least squares (ALS) scheme for solving such problems is presented, and we discuss two efficient solutions to the subproblems arising in the corresponding iterations. The first relies on a least-squares formulation while the second on a gradient-based solution from the literature. The former new approach is slightly less efficient but more robust as it does not involve forming the normal equations. We also advocate for employing a Nesterov-type acceleration in the higher level \ac{ALS} scheme. Usage of the resulting algorithm is evaluated in the context of approximating inverses in low Kronecker-rank form in order to preserve this structure for its continued exploitation in applications such as the matrix sign iterations and preconditioning linear systems.<br/><br/>Our theoretical study is motivated by two real-life practical applications in the field of adaptive optics (AO). We address each of these in terms of exploiting the Kronecker products featured within their problem formulations. <br/><br/>A minimum variance control scheme of wavefront control for atmospheric turbulence correction leads to a large-scale Kronecker structured constrained least-squares problem whose efficient solution is crucial for real-time implementation. Potential approaches based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), projected alternating Barzilai-Borwein (PABB), and active sets (AS) methods are analyzed and compared in the context of exploiting the Kronecker structure of the system matrices using data from a partially realistic numerical study. The PABB approach is shown to be the most competitive, also with respective to alternative solutions exploiting only the sparsity of the system matrices instead of their Kronecker form as well. <br/><br/>The optimal design of a novel wavefront sensor called a sparse aperture mask (SAM) is also addressed in our work. Here Kronecker products appear when propagating wavefronts using the matrix-form of evaluating two dimensional Fourier transforms. The design problem is formulated in terms of a trade-off between the achievable light throughput of the mask and its ability to distinguish so-called Zernike modes that form a basis for the reconstructed wavefront. Two nonlinear optimization approaches for the solution are presented and discussed in terms of exploiting the Kronecker products by evaluating matrix-vector multiplications with them using a large but sparse philosophy. A final framework is proposed to combine the strengths of these in order to tackle the design problem.","Kronecker product; inverse approximation; low Kronecker-rank; wavefront control; adaptive optics; sparse aperture mask","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-31","","","","","",""

This method is based on the extension of the 1D Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equation to a 3D medium. One of the assumptions of the Marchenko method is that the medium is lossless. If the lossy reflection response is used in the Marchenko scheme, some artefacts in the Green's functions as well as in the seismic image are present. One way to circumvent this assumption is to find a compensation parameter for the lossy reflection series so that the lossless Marchenko scheme can be applied. The main tasks of this thesis are to: [1] use the Marchenko equation to estimate the attenuation in the subsurface, [2] find a compensation parameter for the lossy reflection series so that the lossless Marchenko scheme can be applied, and [3] to create an upscaling method for wave propagation. The Artefact Removal Method was created which makes it possible to calculate an effective temporal Q-factor of the medium between a virtual source in the subsurface and receivers at the surface. This method is based on the minimization of the artefacts produced by the lossless Marchenko scheme. The minimization was performed in three ways: [1] in the space-time domain, [2] in the frequency domain and [3] to the scales of the wavelet transform applied to the artefacts. This method can also be used to find the layers with high attenuation. The upscaling method which can be used to construct macro-scale homogenized viscoelastic properties of the medium from the micro-scale properties of a heterogeneous medium was developed. This is done through linking the macro- and micro- scale Lippmann-Schwinger equations which describe the wave field and the strain field scattering in an inhomogeneous medium, respectively. In this thesis, the macro-scale homogenized viscoelastic properties were calculated by using the T-matrix Approach and the Generalized Dvorkin-Mavko Attenuation Model. All theoretical results are supported by synthetic 1D modeling. The theoretical part of the thesis and the general work flow can be used for a very complex medium.","Marchenko; Attenuation; Q-factor; Seismic Upscaling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It describes the process and results of the graduation project ‘Assuring the occurrence of intended learning situations in a nautical simulator’ that is executed in cooperation with VSTEP, a Dutch company that develops simulators and visual training software. VSTEP learned from its customers that Nautis is suffering from usability issues. It is initially not described where these issues are located. The project therefore starts with desk research, analysing Nautis’ current system. Additional expert interviews are conducted and literature research is executed. Observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted with instructors, the endusers, at five organisations that use Nautis. This has demonstrated that instructors are have a relatively small fraction of time available to develop scenarios. A scenario implies a virtual environment in which target vessels are following pre-specified routes, in order to mimic nautical traffic and thereupon form learning situations for the trainee. A significant amount of the little available time goes into testing and subsequently modifying. Testing usually occurs by the instructor entering one of the bridges connected to the simulator and sailing through his created scenario. Testing suggests verifying the behaviour of target vessels along their respective routes in order to prevent collisions with others, while at the same time checking if learning situations are encountered by a trainee vessel as intended. Modifications are made to the scenario when it does not come out as desired, and extra learning situations are added to accommodate different trainee performances, i.e., their pace through the scenario. This would allow for a better comparison of trainee performances. After modifying a scenario, it is again tested. Nautis offers an inefficient way of developing scenarios, which leaves instructors doubting if a trainee will reach the training goals properly. Therefore it is decided to focus on creating a solution for instructors which them to efficiently design learning situations in scenarios that allow for comparing trainee performance in order to assure that learning goals are reached. A design is proposal consisting of three components; an event creator, a trigger system, and a route generating algorithm. Each component supports the user in efficiently creating learning situations as intended. The first two components have been designed through an iterative process, suggesting sketching, prototyping, and user testing. Seven prototypes were made to validate concepts and test interactions with 13 unique participants. Some participants have tested multiple prototypes. Three instructors have taken part in the user tests. The algorithm is evaluated on its feasibility with an AI expert and desirability with an instructor. The route creator enables the user to efficiently draw out learning situations. A timeline is used to give the instructor quick access to any given timeframe in his scenario. When drawing a route for a target vessel, the currently displayed timeframe moves forward concordantly to the time it takes the particular vessel to travel the distance between the previous and the new waypoint. All target vessels in the scenario are displayed at their respective locations associated to the current timeframe. This offers the instructors direct insight whether a collision occurs, and can as such be immediately avoided. The trigger system allows the instructor to connect specific locations for target vessels in a learning situation to a manually drawn trigger area. The system assures that the target vessels sail their routes following the specified locations when the trainee enters the area with his vessel. This way the learning situation happens as intended by the instructor, independent of the trainee’s performance up until the trigger area. The route generating algorithm is used to save time on scenario development. Instructors are enabled to focus on drawing relevant parts of routes for target vessels that form learning situations. Parts that are deemed irrelevant, i.e., prior to or after a learning situation, are generated to lead the target vessels out of the trainees view. It is calculated that through the design proposal instructors can save more than 80% of their time on the development of a single scenario, ergo more time can be spend on the quality and the variety of the scenarios. Furthermore provides the assurance of the occurrence of learning situations them more guidance during the actual training sessions, and offers better comparison of trainee performances. To conclude, it can thus be stated that the design proposal would support an improvement in educational use of Nautis.","Nautical; Simulator; User testing; Usability; Rapid prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

These numerical methods are adapted to work on Paillier encrypted data values. The main challenge is the fact that Paillier encryption can only be applied to a field of positive integers. Moreover, cryptographic protocols have to be invoked to perform non-linear operations. Also, the square root and division operations are computationally heavy in the privacy preserving domain. The numerical algorithms are adapted to overcome these challenges and be more suitable to work on encrypted values.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The Antea group has recently proposed the addition of Electrostatic Precipitators (or ESPs) on the top of sound barriers adjacent to highways, in order to capture the particulate matter and safely discard them. This is an attractive, but expensive, supplement. While estimates of the collection efficiency (i.e. what percentage of particulate matter mass entering the ESP is collected by the device) are known, the aerodynamic efficiency of the ESP (i.e. what percentage of pollutants reach the ESP entrance as compared to the mass emitted) is yet to be determined. The net efficiency of the ESP will be the product of the above two efficiencies, making it necessary to study the latter, prior to large-scale installation.<br/><br/>Scaled down experiments were performed in a water channel, housed in the Laboratory for Aero and Hydrodynamics at the Delft University of technology. Simultaneous measurements of the flow velocities and dye intensities in the symmetry-plane of the channel were made through planar Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF). A few flow configurations were studied by varying certain parameters. It was found that: (a) ESP installation is more beneficial on top of shorter sound barriers. (b) Slightly raising the ESP from the top of the sound barrier is advantageous. (c) Installation of ESPs in isolated highway canyons should be done with care, as several flow regimes are observed.<br/><br/>First order estimates on the aerodynamic efficiencies of the ESP were determined. This was accompanied by the identification of ESP performance trends that should serve as a guideline for the initial testing of the ESPs at full scale. The guidelines include the physical location and entrance orientation of the ESP. It is known that the collection efficiency of the ESP is a function of the incoming flow velocity. It is recommended that the entrance flow velocities reported here be used as an input for calculating the associated particle collection efficiency. Together, the collection and aerodynamic efficiencies can be used to estimate the overall efficiency of the ESP. If the overall efficiency satisfies a minimum desirable threshold, the field experiments yield promising results, the device clears safety requirements, and the benefits outweigh the costs, the ‘Open Air Line ESP’ can be installed along the highways en masse in the future.","Pollution dispersion; Scaled down experiments; Aerodynamics; Particle Image Velocimetry; Laser Induced Fluorescence; Particulate Matter; Air quality improvement; Electrostatic Precipitators; Sound barriers; Highways","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brouwer, een Nederlandse wiskundige die de stroming intuïtionisme in werking zette. Met als belangrijkste uitgangspunt het verwerpen van Het Principe van de Uitgesloten Derde en hiermee Het Bewijs uit het Ongerijmde bracht deze stroming heel wat teweeg binnen onder andere de logica. Hoewel het Brouwer was die van oorsprong het intuïtionisme bedacht, had het vele aanhangers. Brouwers leerling A. Heyting is bekend om de formalisering van de intuïtionistische logica, waarna andere wiskundigen dit afmaakten en perfectioneerden. De nieuwe syntax en semantieken van de intuïtionistische propositie-, predicaten- en modale logica zorgden voor veel verandering ten opzichte van de klassieke logica. Zo verdwenen de Boolese algebra's, waarna de Heyting algebra's hun plaats overnamen. Het continuum, vooral bekend dankzij G. Cantor, moest binnen het intuïtionisme opnieuw beschreven worden, wat vooral te danken is aan de eisen voor oneindige rijen, die volgens Brouwer alleen bestaan wanneer ze door wet beschreven zijn. Deze rijen kunnen worden weergegeven in een spreiding. Op spreidingen worden waaiers gedefinieerd, waarvoor mooie eigenschappen bewezen kunnen worden. In het bijzonder zullen in deze scriptie de Barrière- en de Waaierstelling aan bod komen.Dit alles zorgt voor de geldigheid van het continuïteitsprincipe. Om de filosofie achter het intuïtionisme hard te maken, bedacht Brouwer het scheppend subject, dat later aan de hand van axioma's geformaliseerd is. Helaas vond A.S. Troelstra een paradox in het scheppend subject, maar ook een oplossing. <br/>Deze oplossing komt niet volledig overeen met wat Brouwer naar alle waarschijnlijkheid gedacht zou hebben.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis explores in-situ alloying of commercial Manganese Aluminium Bronze (MAB) with copper rich Cu3Si filler wire during deposition, as a microstructure control strategy for designing components that are resistant against selective phase corrosion. Evolution of microstructure during WAAM processing of MAB and during in-situ alloying with Cu3Si wire is investigated using optical and electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and fluorescence. The microstructure of the as-deposited MAB bead is observed to change from continuous connected dual phase to cellular single phase upon controlled addition of Cu3Si in a MAB melt pool. Corrosion tests showed reduced severity of surface attack and an improvement in the rate of corrosion by 3 times for the new alloy. Thus this technique can be used in industries to improve corrosion resistance as an energy efficient alternative of conventional high temperature aging treatments.<br/><br/>Additionally, the possibilities of improving mechanical behaviour of the new alloy (cellular single phase) are explored using the principles of grain refinement in the context of WAAM.","additive manufacturing; bronze; welding; phase transformations; solidification; Materials science; corrosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spotify, Airbnb, and Uber are examples of successful businesses using IT driven service models. The academic community researches aspects of IT governance, frameworks, architecture, and business model innovation, management and organisational theories in order to develop a more successful IT service delivery model. The heterogeneous body of these academic theories addresses different parts of the service model development. However, current IT service delivery models lack sufficient support for contextualisation. In a case study at Dutch IT services provider KPN, Agent Based modelling is used to develop future scenario’s for the IT services organisation. With a strong focus on the organisation and the agents in the organisation, the Agent Based modelling approach OperA is applied. By Using semi-structured interviews to collect data throughout the services delivery chain, a future scenario with the IT broker as a new role was developed. Consequently, roles facilitating legacy platforms are expected to discontinue. From the future scenario, a roll-out plan using three phases is developed using the social structure of the organisation model. The environments of the OperA model enable the research to focus on the social structure of IT services delivery and the analysis of interactions between roles. The OperA model is a sufficient model for strategic decision making in IT services delivery. Further work could generate tools to fully automated the validation of the OperA model and connect it to real life phenomena with real time adaption to changes.","IT Services; Modelling; ICT; Cloud Computing; IT Broker; Agile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This gives a powerful tool for robust stability analysis of nonlinear systems. The use of SOS optimization is limited to small dynamical systems, because of the demanding numerical complexity underlying SOS optimization. For systems where scaling of SOS is a concern, diagonally dominant SOS (DSOS) is a possible alternative. DSOS approximates the SOS problem from within and results in a less complex optimization problem. The shortcoming of DSOS, however, is conservatism within the robust stability analysis, entailed by the approximation.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we consider the problem of conservatism in robust stability analysis due to the application of DSOS. We propose new DSOS-based formulations which aim to reduce conservatism in robust stability analysis. Furthermore, we show how to formulate optimization problems which don't require an initial Lyapunov function candidate, and stabilize the numerical solutions of the DSOS problems. The main tool we leverage in this study is the Positivstellensatz in combination with DSOS. <br/><br/>We demonstrate the proposed formulations on three numerical experiments. We estimate the region of attraction of the van der Pol oscillator, investigate stability of an uncertain nonlinear system and proof stability of a nonlinear system, which is documented to suffer from numerical issues when approached with SOS methods.

It is a major concern of all waterflood operations now in the industry, to adopt cost effective and environmentally sound water disposal systems. Re-injection into the subsurface has been chosen to be a potentially attractive option from environmental regulations view point, but to become the preferred alternative for produced water disposal, re-injection (PWRI) must also be economical and should not incur excessive risk in form of injectivity decline and damage to the formation. In this study, a semi-analytical model of contaminated water injection under fracturing conditions, including the effects of damage mechanisms over time is developed, that couples the reservoir engineering and fracture mechanics aspects of the problem. The main features of this model are finite fracture conductivity, external filter-cake build-up on the fracture face, internal plugging at fracture tip by injected solids, backstress resulting from pore pressure inflation (poro-elastic stress), backstress resulting from formation cooling (thermo-elastic stress), and fracture propagation. The most important characteristic is that the fracture is of finite conductivity due to fracture fill up by total suspended solids and oils in injected water. This is what differentiates this model from conventional waterflood induced fracturing simulators. This model is an extension to Koning’s model for waterflood induced fracturing, where fracture is of infinite conductivity. This model is largely based on work of Hoek et al. for finite conductivity fracture. This model incorporates a rectangular fracture that fully penetrates a permeable layer bounded by impermeable layers on top and bottom. The fracture is surrounded by three elliptically shaped zones, formation damages caused are included which are critical for fracture propagation, and the primary objective is to predict long term fracture growth and well injectivity. The governing Equations for fracture propagation are based on four fundamental physical phenomena which are fluid leak-off from the fracture into the formation, fluid flow inside the fracture, poro-elastic and thermo-elastic backstress on the fracture face and fracture propagation into the formation. The novelty of the new simulator is the ability to model waterflood induced fracture including all kinds of damage mechanisms, and accurately predict fracture propagation quickly.","Waterflooding; Induced fractures; Formation damage mechanisms; Fracture propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

Operating flow rates and pressures can be estimated with a nodal analysis procedure by calculation of the intersection of performance curves. Input parameters in nodal analysis of production systems are considered deterministic, however, some of these parameters are better represented as distributions. In this report, the ensemble-based data assimilation methods “ensemble Kalman filter” (EnKF) and “particle filter” (PF) are applied to steady-state models of a production system for tuning of uncertain model parameters during the test separator phase. The performance of the EnKF and the PF is tested with the use of twin experiments. The calibrated model parameters of the choke, tubing and the near-well bore elements with EnKF and PF can be used to create an ensemble of performance curves leading to an ensemble of operating flow rates and pressures. The foreseen next step is to use the posterior distributions of model parameters as inputs for soft sensing of flow rates during semi-steady-state production for a single phase oil reservoir, where the oil rate and reservoir pressure are considered as unknown parameters. In the twin experiments as used in this thesis, a total number of three steady-state pressure drop measurements was used to estimate a total of six independent parameters which constitutes an ill-posed problem, resulting in non-unique parameter estimates. It is recommended to alleviate this issue by either reducing the number of parameters or by using multiple separator tests at different flow rates.","Data assimilation; Production systems; Petroleum; Ensemble Kalman filter; EnKF; particle filter; Nodal analysis; Tuning of model parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

LSCs can absorb part of the incoming sunlight and re-direct it to the edges, where PV-cells can produce electricity. Light transport efficiency is then determined by several characteristics of the glass waveguide and thulium as luminescent particles. The main objectives of this work were to find the most relevant characteristics of a LSC affecting its optical efficiency, and to optimize such parameters for a high performance.<br/><br/>In the first part of this work, LightTools, a ray-tracing software, was tested to model a LSC based on red-dyes. Simulation results were compared with experimental measurements using a sample of PMMA doped with red-dye (Lumogen F 305). The optical efficiency of the red-dye model was 4.1%, and LSC sample had 4.5% of efficiency (measured in a previous thesis work [Overbeek, 2015]), meaning 0.4% of marginal error. Optical losses were identified and quantified; from them, specular transmission resulted in 25.5% losses, and 0.1% error compared to measurements. In this respect, LightTools was proven to be a useful tool for modelling LSCs and quantify accurately the optical efficiency. With these results, the ray-tracing method proposed was extended for thulium based LSCs.<br/><br/>Two thulium LSC models were simulated in LightTools: A glass doped with thulium particles (model 1), and pure glass with thulium coating (model 2, PowerWindow design). From the tested variables, the mean free path (MFP) length, related to the luminophore concentration, is one of the main parameters affecting the optical efficiency and transmission losses. Moreover, the MFP ratio showed high relevance in the optical efficiency since it describes how large is the path length for photons in the emission range compared to blue (absorbed) photons.<br/>In both models, it was shown that large MFP ratio (ℛ = 10), high quantum yield (QY= 1), small area (25 cm²), and 5 mm of glass thickness provide optimum results. With these parameters, the optical efficiency of model 1 was 11%, and model 2 about 13%. However, a large scale model 2 of 1 m² had maximum optical efficiency below 1% with light transmission above 80%, and concentration factor of 1. Considering the optical efficiency of this large scale LSC model, and high performance CIGS PV-cells, the energy yield was estimated as only 1.4 kWh per year in the Netherlands. LSC performance might be improved by adding thin film layers in the glass, such as anti-reflection coating and selective filters to allow visible light and reflect NIR photons into the glass.<br","Luminescent Solar Concentrator; BIPV; Simulation study; solar energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This conclusion<br/>leads to the idea that a quantum network requires certain dierences in its structure in order to guarantee<br/>transmission to take place. Furthermore, the existence of synchronisation heavily depends on the parameters<br/>used for the oscillators.<br/>The analysis is then continued in the quantum domain where optomechanical systems are introduced. At<br/>rst, two systems are connected to each other by a gaseous interaction and an electric interaction via a<br/>Dung circuit. The main investigation is again into the synchronisation, which implies that the operators<br/>belonging to both systems behave the same as a function of time. Then several synchronisation measures<br/>are introduced to measure the ability of the systems to synchronise. As predicted, both systems synchronise<br/>in terms of the operators for each system. Then a quantum network is introduced, where a complex yet<br/>ecient network is created. This quantum network is a small world network, where a transmitter node is<br/>able to connect to the receiver node by only a few links. Furthermore, multiple transmissions can take place<br/>at the same time and links which are not connected do not synchronise with the transmitter node. After<br/>modelling this network, the results are in compliance with the theory available.<br/>Challenges for a practical quantum network include the experimental basis of being able to utilise optomechanical<br/>systems outside laboratory circumstances. Also, the network should be tested for practical use and<br/>expanded in a much larger size both in theoretical analysis as well as in experiments.","Synchronization; Network; Quantum","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

This nonlinear system has the interesting property that it can be solved analytically using nonlinear Fourier transforms. To utilize this property, new methods of optical communication are being developed by embedding information in the nonlinear Fourier domain and employing fast nonlinear Fourier transforms. Many of the recent works use a specialized form of inverse nonlinear Fourier transform to generate information-bearing fiber inputs in the form of so-called multi-soliton pulses. Recently, multiple fast inverse nonlinear Fourier transform algorithms that can generate multi-solitons have been proposed. The goal of this thesis is to study and improve these algorithms, in particular, with respect to their computational complexity.<br/>Based on the literature survey, discrete Darboux transform combined with other discrete techniques is studied and a new algorithm is proposed. The algorithm employs a single-start approach in which discrete Darboux matrix is computed at only one sample point and rest of the samples are computed by evolution of the Darboux matrix. The algorithm is hence named as discrete Darboux evolution algorithm (DDE). The errors in the generated signal and run-time are studied by comparison with the classical Darboux transform (CDT). The DDE algorithm is shown to have floating point operations complexity of O(KN) for K eigenvalues and N samples. However, in a limited precision environment the number of samples that can be generated is found to be limited. To better understand the effects of machine precision, both the CDT and DDE algorithms are studied in a multi-precision environment. Certain insights from the study are used to develop two modifications to overcome the limitations. The first modification computes the signal using multiple single-start runs while the second one uses a multi-start approach. The second modification is shown to have errors comparable with other fast algorithms in literature. Additionally, in a qualitative comparison it is shown to be potentially faster than existing algorithms in a certain regime.<br","classical Darboux transform; discrete Darboux transform; multi-solitons; nonlinear Fourier transform; inverse nonlinear Fourier transform; fast inverse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In order to ensure a stable energy supply, different storage technologies attract a lot of research attention. For long term storage, using hydrogen as artificial fuel is a promising option. However, in order for hydrogen storage to be renewable, the hydrogen must be produced using renewable energy. A possible option is to use solar energy to drive the electrolysis of water. In this way, hydrogen is produced directly from sunlight by driving the redox reaction with a reversible potential of 1.23 V. However, due to overpotentials and possible losses a voltage of 1.6-2 V is needed form the used device to drive the reaction. Recently, a wafer based triple junction silicon solar cell was proposed to generate the voltage needed to drive the water splitting reaction. The cell uses an n-type crystalline silicon wafer as substrate, and has an a-Si/nc-Si/c-Si structure. Although this cell demonstrates the feasibility of this technology, the performance is not good enough yet to drive the water splitting reaction efficiently. <br/>In this work, several ways to optimize the triple junction solar cell have been studied. First, optimising the tunnel recombination junctions improves the open circuit voltage of the device. For the tunnel recombination junction between the top a-Si and the middle nc-Si cell, this is done by using a combination of a thin n-SiOx layer and a thin n-a-Si layer. Apart from a small improvement in optical performance this configuration improves the conductivity of the junction and also slightly enhances charge separation and collection in both sub-cells. For the junction between the middle nc-Si and the bottom c-Si cell, the same result was achieved by increasing the doping in the n-layer. Subsequently, to improve current matching of the device, the nc-Si layer thickness can be increased to 3500 nm without sacrificing the electrical performance. In addition, optimizing the interface between the top p-nc-SiOx layer and the front transparent conductive oxide (TCO) also improves the electrical performance of the device. Moreover, it was found that using hydrogenated indium oxide as front TCO instead of indium doped tin oxide increases the current by decreasing the reflection in the wavelength region of the current limiting nc-Si middle cell by having reflection, and also increases the open circuit voltage of the device by 0.3 Volts. The final triple junction cell achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.93 V and a short circuit current density of 8.5 mA/cm2, with a fill factor of 0.65. With these improvements, it is estimated that a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 6.2 % can be reached by using an IrOx counter electrode.<br","solar fuels; solar cells; multijunction solar cells; silicon; hydrogen production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Unfortunately, it remains a way of brand management for many companies, rather than a drive for structural change in business practices.Business models should therefore be reshaped, to deliver environmental sustainability based on the core logic of a firm. While previous studies are concerned with the typological and antecedent factor of start-ups’ environmental orientation, this study seeks to explore how start-ups incorporate their environmental orientation into their business model and (re)design their business model to respond to changing market demand for ecological sustainable solutions. An important distinction is made between sustainability practices that are innovating the business model as a whole (e.g. architectural innovations) and sustainability practices that are affecting single components of the business model (e.g. modular innovations). It is argued that environmental sustainability can position itself within the architecture of a business model, influencing all business decisions, or environmental sustainability can position itself outside of the business model, allowing for modular business model innovations. To explore the role of environmental sustainability for business model innovation of start-ups within Indonesia, a multiple case study design has been set up. Two startups that are in the process of designing their initial business model are selected, one company that has ecological sustainability embedded in the design of the product, and one that is focused on other, mainly economic brand related, values to remain competitive. Also two startups that have already commercialized their product and thus have an established business model are scrutinized. Again, one company that has ecological sustainability embedded in the design of the product, and one that is focused on other, mainly economic brand related, values to remain competitive. The research design allows for cross case comparison on the different axes whilst aggregated data may reveal more general approaches towards environmental sustainability. All four cases were found to consider the environment in their business model to a certain degree. Seven sustainability practices have emerged from the aggregated data and is linked to business model components. It was found that, however space for improvement, the cases on the sustainable value dimension did place environmental sustainability within the architecture of their business model, considering the environment from the core logic of their business and affecting to a certain extent the interdependencies of the subsystems. The cases on the economic, brand related dimension showed to position environmental sustainability outside of the architecture of their business, not regarding the natural environment as a stakeholder. Consequently, they merely allowed modular business model innovations regarding environmental sustainable practices. However progressive, the ecological orientation of the cases on the sustainable value dimension can be said to eco-open rather than eco-dedicated, whilst the ecological orientation of &lt;Case 2&gt; and &lt;Case 4&gt; are to be placed on the spectrum between eco-open and eco-reluctant.","Business Model; Business Model Innovation; Environmental Sustainability; Startup; Entrepreneurship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","","6.9175, 107.6191"

To advance the era of the circular economy and foster the participation of companies, understanding circular business models is essential. <br/><br/>This research studied three cases of circular business models (CBMs). The companies that use resource-based CBMs and bulk waste and deal with business customers were selected.

This brings the theoretical contributions to the definition of CBM and developments of the business modelling tools for CBMs. The practical contributions are made to the firms who are considering implementing a CBM as a reference book.

It will show how different turbulencemodels performat a Reynolds number of 15,000 inside a conical diffuser with an angle of 2θ=8°, no separation is expected in this geometry. The turbulence models investigated are the k-ε, the k- ω and the RSM model. The mesh refinement is tested on produced accuracy of the results. The final results of the simulations are compared with both DNS (direct numerical simulation) and experimental results. All models produce different behavior, due to transport equations, algebraic models and empirical constants used. The deviations are dependent on geometry and flow conditions, where certain turbulence models are better for specific cases. The simulations showed different representations. The flow behavior of the k- ω model was the most realistic, due to the correct core velocity although it showed flow reversal at the wall. Various parameters are reviewed, such as velocity profile, flow reversal, pressure coefficient, friction coefficient and turbulent statistics.<br/><br/>The oscillating flow will represent a case which is more closely to the flow seen inside a thermoacoustic engine. The geometry is a rectangular diffuser and the flow is compressible. It is a much more complex flow with frequencies ranging from 6-21 Hz during the simulations. Laminar, transitional and turbulent cases are simulated by Reδ numbers of 380, 580 and 740 with varying displacement amplitudes. The transitional k-kl-ω model is used, because of its ability to also simulate laminar and transitional cases besides only turbulent cases. Additional the k- ω SST model is tested. The velocity profiles are not simulated well with the k-kl-ω model, which was caused by the under estimation of simulated turbulence near the wall. It was found that for both models separation will induce early and low in the diffuser and expand downstream as the cycle passes. As a result the Reynolds shear stresses show higher values earlier in the cycle. It was also seen that the reattachment would differ in pattern. The trend is found that separation begins earlier with increasing Reynolds number and increasing displacement amplitude. The minor losses, or irreversibilities, vary in accuracy, the effect of the displacement amplitude is not always seen for variables which are dependent on the magnitude of the pressure. In addition turbulence would not show an increase at the point of transition compared to turbulent cases.

The learned representations with binary segmentation achieve a fine-tuning performance comparable to the representations learned with ``gold'' standard segmentations.

Marine seismic data are recorded with towed streamers that acquire the desired upgoing wavefields containing information of the geology beneath. The upgoing wavefield will travel past the streamer/hydrophone to be reflected at the sea surface and propagate back down to be collected as undesired downgoing (ghost) wavefields, before propagating further downward as a surface related multiple. Because up- and downgoing wavefields interfere, these ghost wavefields generate peaks and notches in the recorded amplitude spectrum that compromises the bandwidth, reducing the resolution and the interpretability of the seismic data. Two classes of ghosts exist - source and receiver - that can be removed (’deghosting’) through two main approaches; utilizing different acquisition strategies and/or computer based processing algorithms. Additional measurements may prove useful in acquiring broadband data but may be hampered by high costs and limited availability. Vast amounts of 2-D single streamer legacy data exist that can still benefit from enhanced deghosting techniques. Acquisition uncertainties, such as the unknown exact depth of sources and receivers, the unknown reflectivity of the free-surfaces, and the unknown propagation velocity of seismic waves in water, lead to an increased complexity in finding a solution to the deghosting problem. In this thesis, sensitivity analysis has shown that a variability in the propagation velocity of seismic waves in water has the greatest effect on the conventional 2D receiver deghosting result. The least sensitive parameter turned out to be the water surface reflectivity. A multitude of adaptive deghosting techniques - which optimize the parameter settings through data driven optimization - have been found in literature and are summarized to identify the shortcomings. A quantitative uncertainty analysis into these methods seems to be missing. A new adaptive deghosting method based on echo-deblending is introduced that incorporates an uncertainty analysis. Results look promising for determining receiver depths, however, the water surface reflectivities results are more challenging. Recommendations for future work to improve the method are given for future students pursuing the topic.","adaptive deghosting; marine seismic; uncertainty analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","IDEA League Joint Master's in Applied Geophysics","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

(mentor); Doelman, N (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Recently, with the switch to the new generation adaptive optics systems like the VLT and ELT an important identification problem emerged. These telescopes are so-called integrated systems, which means that open-loop calibration of the interaction matrix is not possible anymore. The first and foremost reason for this is that the new generation of integrated adaptive optics (AO) systems are much more sensitive to external factors like gravity causing misregistrations and system parameter changes. This sensitivity is due to the integrated design, because each time that the telescope will change from operation setup, such misregistrations will be created. Unfortunately, this can lead to performance loss or closed-loop instability very fast. Even misregistrations as big as 10% of a subaperture of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor lead to significant performance loss. <br/><br/>For this reason, the identification and thereby correction for parameter changes in the deformable mirror (DM) have to be done during operation. Since the identification needs to be done during operation, it becomes much more important to have an identification method that does not disturb the closed-loop operation of the plant. Therefore, in this thesis, we will focus on a least cost method, preferably even a costless method for identification purposes. <br/><br/>Since the concept of integrated AO systems with a deformable secondary mirror (DSM) is still relatively new, there has been only one serious proposal for the solution of the problem by Béchet and Kolb. They falsely claim to have developed a non-parametric costless method, i.e. a method without excitation, for the calibration of the IM and achieved ”reasonable” results. <br/><br/>In our work, we will first of all prove why their method is fundamentally wrong. Furthermore, we will also prove that their approach will result in the identification of the inverse controller instead of the plant. This is probably also the reason why they falsely suppose to have achieved ”reasonable” results, because the dc gain of the inverse controller resembles the plant itself, which we will show as well. <br/><br/>After explanation and comparison of several methods, we will propose the recently developed least cost identification paradigm as the best solution. This paradigm is a framework for parametric prediction error identification and is meant to minimize the impact of the experiment on the underlying system in terms of experiment duration, distortion of the closed-loop operation, power of the input signal or a combination of these, while at the same time guaranteeing a predefined level of accuracy. Different bottlenecks that need to be overcome to apply this method will be taken into account in order to adapt the least cost identification paradigm for the calibration of the interaction matrix (IM). <br/><br/>Using the expression for the information matrix we will first of all derive and proof that, theoretically, and if the experiment duration time allows, unlimited accuracy is achievable with zero cost in closed-loop using the excitation coming from the disturbance. <br/><br/>Furthermore, we will prove in our study that, when the cost is solely defined as the impact of the excitation signal on the normal closed-loop operation, the information-to-cost ratio per frequency is inversely proportional with the squared magnitude of the disturbance H(ω), i.e. proportional with 1/|H(ω)|² . Therefore, this means that in our specific case, in which we try to find the static gain matrix for an underdamped second order resonance system with a low frequency disturbance originating from atmospheric turbulence, the Nyquist frequency will always be the optimal excitation frequency.<br","least cost identification; calibration; information matrix; AO system; adaptive optics; Deformable Secondary Mirror; DSM; low cost identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The Dutch government - for example - recently invested € 70 million to look for technological opportunities in the ITS market. However, although significant sums are invested, the return in realized projects is limited. This is because the ITS projects don’t produce adequate results. <br/>But what causes these inadequate results? The literature implies that, along the process of ITS-projects, a number of challenging issues tend to surface. Policymakers seemingly do not know how to cope with these issues. Examples of these issues are amongst others: (1) uncertainty about the technological performance of the system, (2) an unclear vision of the potential of the system in the market, and (3) potential hurdles in the collaboration process between relevant project stakeholders. <br/>These indications show that ITS projects are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. More knowledge about uncertainties looming up during ITS projects, and information of adequate reactions for policymakers on this phenomenon can be of great help to produce more satisfactory project results. Hence, this thesis explores the different types of uncertainties and subsequently aims in providing insights in how policymakers can cope more effectively with these different types of uncertainties. <br/>This thesis starts with the examination of three correlated factors, namely 1) the number and types of uncertainties emerging in ITS projects, 2) the extent of awareness of policymakers on these uncertainties, and 3) the way policymakers tend to act in the face of uncertainties. <br/>By means of three ex-post case studies, insights were obtained on these factors. After analysing these three cases, thirteen different uncertainties were identified and distinguished. The policymakers in these ITS-projects were only partly aware of those uncertainties. I analysed five situations of uncertainty ‘unawareness’. From those five ‘unawareness’ factors, four had an impact on the outcome of the project. This emphasizes the importance of awareness among policymakers of the different types of uncertainty. <br/>In addition, based on policy guidelines supplied by the literature, I evaluated the way policymakers acted when coming across uncertainties. This evaluation showed that policymakers didn’t follow adequate strategies to cope with the different values of uncertainties. Even worse, more than once uncertainties were deliberately ignored. Policymakers tend not to know how to deal with uncertainties in ITS projects and to ignore them. <br/>When policymakers do not ignore uncertainties, they tend to follow strategies and policies that are inadequate to cope with the different types of uncertainties. When comparing the findings of these three case studies with the suggestions made by the literature, we deduce that there is a lack of knowledge on ITS-project policymakers can act effectively when coming across uncertainties. My case studies support the suggestions of the literature that policymakers do not know how to cope effectively with uncertainties in ITS projects. <br/>The conclusion of this thesis entails, that knowledge and awareness amongst ITS policymakers of the different uncertainties would be a first step in the direction towards more robust policymaking. In addition, policymakers should adopt more active strategies in anticipation of the different types of uncertainties. When coming across an uncertainty during the project, the selection of an appropriate strategy should be based on the type, and the extent of complexity within the uncertainty. The same accounts for policies. Based on a theoretical framework of uncertainties, policymakers should adopt a more appropriate policy in order to cope with them. <br","Policymakers; Uncertainty; Policies; Strategies; Intelligent Transport Systems; ITS; Case study; Unawareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","Because of confidential information, explicit interviews are excluded in the appendices.

The design team Bdot, a group of students from the TU Delft, made a concept design for the company Merford. After the success of the Bdot concept, Merford was inspired to continue development further to a high fidelity prototype or even production. The open workspace, or so called ‘office garden’, is becoming more popular in modern and renovated office spaces. Such office spaces do not have many walls, which offers benefits to work culture development but can also lead to a variety of problems. Research shows that acoustic hindrance is one of the biggest problems found in open workspaces (JMP, 2017). The concept developed during the JMP project provides a solution to that problem. The Pinecone as designed by the JMP group, ended with a concept design and a prototype which showed the sense of scale of the product. This graduation project will focus on three important aspects of the design. First of all, the panel will be redesigned, having a refined finish and look. Secondly, a solution for hanging the acoustic panels had to be designed. From the beginning of this graduation project, the idea came up to make panels modular, and connecting them instead of hanging them on complete rings. Thirdly, the focus was on designing a functional retraction mechanism making the prototype prove that the mechanics will work for the end product. A new design brief was made, including these three focus points. Together with the company Merford and information from the previous design report, a list of criteria was formed for guiding this project. During the exploration phase of this project, numerous resources were reviewed. This gave more information and inspiration for several solutions for each focus area. The development of these focus areas was a very iterative process. Finding solutions, then getting more information through experts, and making revisions of these solutions to find better ones happened multiple times. During this iterative process, the switch between design for end product and design for a show-model had to be made continuously. This means that during the development chapter, conclusions are drawn for both the prototype and for the end design of this project. The prototyping phase focused on getting a working prototype build. The goal of this prototype was to prove the mechanics would work, together with being a show model for Merford. The prototype will eventually hang in the showroom of Merford and will be used for business events and fairs. The final chapter elaborates on the final design of the Pinecone. Materials, production techniques and production series are spoken of in this chapter. The chapter doesn not only give the design of the ‘standard’ Pinecone, but also gives multiple opportunities and possibilities for Merford to sell more Pinecones in the near future.","reactive acoustics; acoustics; sound absorption; furniture design; office design; Interior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Deformation models, used as constraint in the parameter estimation, often do not capture the full extent of the deformation behaviour. This results in a poor separation of signal and noise, and rejection of arcs that do not behave conform the functional model. Previous work assumed that deformation behaviour is stationary and that a full time series can be described with a single set of deformation parameters. In order to develop a more broadly applicable deformation model, this study applies a temporal smoothness constraint during parameter estimation, by assuming that deformation rates are affected by a temporally correlated zero-mean random acceleration. This constraint is implemented using recursive least-squares, similar to Kalman filtering, which also enables efficient updating of arcs when new acquisitions are available.<br/><br/>Various kind of deformation types are simulated to create phase observations based on real TerraSAR-X, Radarsat2 and ERS stacks of interferograms. This simulated data is processed using the new recursive estimator and results are compared to that of a batch estimator using a steady-state assumption, to analyse the impact of adding a priori information about the smoothness of the physical signal. Furthermore, a case study on real data is performed on an area where non-linear subsidence has occurred, due to soil remediation. This study presents a mathematical framework for incorporating a priori knowledge about the smoothness of the deformation signal as constraint for parameter and ambiguity estimation. Especially non-linear deformation is better estimated using this method, resulting in a higher success-rate, better separation of signal and noise, and more PS passing quality thresholds. The framework moreover enables efficient updating of existing datasets when new acquisition are available.<br","InSAR; Adjustment theory; PSI; Recursive least-squares; Phase unwrapping; Parameter estimation; Persistent Scatterer Interferometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-31","","","","","",""

Although it is easy to directly calculate monetary gains due to a speed improvement, monetary gains due to transport service improvement like comfort or ability to perform useful activities during a trip are far more difficult to include in CBA. This is because the total travel time stays the same before and after such service improvement since there is no visible reduction in total travel time. This is of course not true because travelers who travel comfortably and are able to engage in productive and pleasant activities during their trip can derive some benefits from the trip. These benefits can have an impact on the traveler’s VOTTS e.g. a reduction in the VOTTS of the traveler. <br/>In order to measure this impact and calculate the monetary value of activities, a new methodology is proposed. The intuition behind the method is that the same traveler might have two different VOTTS. One VOTTS when he/she is able to make productive or pleasant use of the travel time by engaging in a preferred activity and another VOTTS when he/she cannot engage in the preferred activity during the journey. If the VOTTS without the activity is higher than the VOTTS with the activity, then the difference between these two VOTTS can be conceptualized as the monetary value of the activity. <br/>The proposed methodology was translated into a hypothetical stated choice experiment with in-vehicle time and cost attributes. Respondents were recruited from train travellers on Netherlands Railways(NS) panel. The VOTTS of respondents with and without the ability to perform their preferred activity was then calculated. The results show that the ability to perform certain preferred activities like reading, working and listening to music during train trips, reduces the VOTTS especially for commuters by about 5euros/hour. For leisure travellers, reading was found to reduce the VOTTS by about 3euros/hr. The research concludes with a discussion on the general implication of results for transport project evaluations and investments. Based on this, some recommendations are made for NS and also for the Netherlands institute for transport policy analysis(KiM) regarding future VOTTS calculations that will be used in transport project evaluations. <br","Travel based multitasking; Value of travel time savings; Impact of ICT use; productive and pleasant trip; discrete choice modelling; Stated choice experiments; Automated vehicles; value of comfort; self-engagement experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

And it is expected that even more satellites will be launched in the upcoming years. Most of these small satellites are launched as piggy back together with a large spacecraft. The location and time of launch and orbit will therefore be determined by another mission. A dedicated launcher for small satellites will contribute to the success of small satellites by bringing the satellite at the right time in the right orbit.<br/><br/>Fourteen European companies and institutes are working together in a European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 project called “SMall Innovative Launcher for Europe” (SMILE). The project aims at designing a launcher for satellites up to 70 kg and a European-based launch facility at Andøya. To make this project a success the launch cost must be below the "" 50 000 per kg and a total launch cost of 3.5 ""M. One of the ways to cut the costs of the launcher is by the re-use of the first stage.<br/><br/>This research will answer the question if recovering of the first stage will be cost-beneficial, answering the following research question; What is the performance gain in terms of cost when reusing the first stage of the launcher within the SMILE project? To answer this question, three different steps are taken.<br/><br/>The first step is to investigate the boundaries of the recovery of the first stage. The impact region, velocity and maximum altitude and loads are investigated to understand the recovery mechanisms needed. It is found that the impact region of the first stage is between the coast of Norway and Jan Mayen. This means that the first stage needs to land on water. Using the information found, seven different recovery options are designed.<br/><br/>During the second phase the different designs are optimised to the minimumtake-off weight. This optimisation is done by first making use of Monte Carlo simulations to find the region were the minimal is found. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation are used in a genetic algorithm the find the minimum system weight. After this evaluation two different options remained; retro-propulsion option and a parachute system option.<br/><br/>The last step is to evaluate these two options in more detail with a six degrees of freedom simulation. After the evaluation of the two options, the options are designed in more detail. Three different landing techniques are<br/>discussed; resulting in three different options. The first option found is the retro-propulsion with an airbag landing. The second option considered is the parachute system with an air bed landing. The last option found is the parachute system with a mid air capture performed by a helicopter. The different options are re-designed and the extra weight and volume needed is computed. The cost of the different options is calculated and compared. It is shown that if the first stage is used four times of more per year, recovering is cost-beneficial for all options.","Launcher; Recovery; Cost analysis; First stage; Re-use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","SMILE",""

Being part of reinforcement learning techniques, their intelligent and adaptive characteristics provide a fault tolerant solution to non-linear control problems. As a starting point, this paper compares the two fundamental forms of ACD's for aircraft control and evaluates their future potential for the VCCTEF design. The two forms are Heuristic Dynamic programming (HDP) and Dual Heuristic Programming (DHP). In an experimental study, both algorithms are integrated in a F-16 aircraft model. First, the agents are trained offline to learn to control the baseline F-16 dynamics. Then, the aircraft dynamics are changed online and the controllers need to adapt to the new plant dynamics. The results show that DHP has a higher success ratio in the offline learning phase and particularly converges faster to an optimal solution. During online simulations, both algorithms can deal with some changes in the F-16 aircraft dynamics even without adaptation, although HDP reveals more robustness in this case. DHP on the other hand, adapts better to changes in the plant dynamics when online learning is applied.","Heuristic Dynamic Programming; Dual Heuristic Programming; Reinforcement Learning; Aircraft Control; adaptive control; Adaptive Critic Designs; ACD; HDP; DHP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Airline Maintenance and Engineering (M&amp;E) organizations are faced with a number of repairs time to time for their fleet of aircraft due to accidental damages. As these damages are unpredictable in nature, the approach to repairing these damages is reactive. These type of repairs fall under the category of corrective or unscheduled maintenance policy compared to the planned preventive or scheduled maintenance. As the occurrence of these unscheduled repairs result in consumption of more maintenance resources in an untimely manner, they add to the existing costs for the organisation. Hence, it is of interest to the M&amp;E to predict the demand for these resources for a future period so that the organisation is better prepared to handle future maintenance activities. One of the resources impacted due to unscheduled repairs is capacity, i.e maintenance hangar facility. If the capacity of a hangar facility can be divided into certain number of slots, then prediction of the demand for these slots would be beneficial to the maintenance planner. In order to identify the demand for these slots, it is first important to forecast the trend of unscheduled repairs. To achieve this goal, i.e. prediction of future repair and determination of slot capacity, a novel application for the integrated use of a reliability and inventory control model has been identified in this thesis. Here, the concepts of inventory control has been specifically applied to a maintenance application to determine the maintenance capacity by taking into account the stochastic demand of unscheduled repairs. The model used to predict the demand of unscheduled repair is a Non-homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) reliability model with a Power law intensity function and the inventory control model that was found to be applicable is the singlesystem single location Base-stock policy model. The reliability model considers the superpositioning principle through which the failure behaviour for the entire fleet of aircraft could be predicted. Certain performance measures were identified from the inventory control model, which helped in determining capacity based on optimum costs as well as service level requirements. As a proof of concept, a study is done on identifying the long-run capacity requirements for a fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft of a major European airline. Two specific structural components were identified on which the study was carried out, namely, the leading slats and the outboard flaps. The results showed the successful implementation of the model by identifying 30 slots necessary in the next 1500 flight cycles at an optimum cost for the case of leading edge slats.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Offshore pipelay is the operation of laying a pipe from a surface vessel to the seabed. As the suspended pipe approaches the seabed, it bends downwards forming the sagbend. The sagbend is controlled by the vessel position and a tensile load is applied to counteract the weight of the pipe. During the engineering phase of previous HMC projects, compression was observed in the sagbend, for both shallow and deep water projects. Clients and regulatoratory authorities are hesitant to allow compression, limiting workability. DNV-GL implies that compression can be accepted if it does not induce other failure modes, like local buckling. A global stability assessment should be performed to identify if the resultant deformations are acceptable. HMC is intrigued to discover what the constraints are regarding global buckling during pipe-laying. The objective is to develop a methodology to calculate an allowable compressive load, increasing the operational window.<br/><br/>During pipe-laying, the vessels motions are transferred to the pipe, resulting in a time varying loading that can exceed the applied tension in the sagbend area, leading to compression. This can induce two different mechanisms of stability loss. Either the lateral vibrations can be excited, amplifying the amplitudes of the lateral motion, or tension can change into compression in a segment of the pipe for a part of the wave cycle, leading to a pulsating compressive loading. Focus is given on the instability onset due to the compressive pulsating loading, named as impulse dynamic buckling, as dangerously high strains can occur in that case. The system can exhibit higher load bearing capacity than the quasi-static Euler buckling load, when the loading is dynamic, due to inertia and drag. <br/><br/>Depending on the project requirements, different installation vessels are utilized. The vessels response under wave excitation should be taken into account for the pipe-laying analyses. For that reason, a specialized finite element software, Flexcom, is used. The ability of Flexcom to accurately predict the onset of impulse dynamic buckling is validated by comparison with a simplified analytical model. A curved simply supported Euler-Bernoulli beam is utilized for validation, based on the theory of moderately large displacements. A dynamic buckling criterion and an applicable methodology, capable of predicting the onset of impulse dynamic buckling based on Flexcom’s post-processing results, is proposed. Constant velocity loading is applied to demonstrate the effect of loading velocity in the dynamic buckling load. Harmonic displacement loading is applied to validate the proposed dynamic buckling criterion. <br/><br/>Two previous HMC projects are utilized as base cases to evaluate the proposed methodology. Finite element analyses in Flexcom is performed and the critical parameters regarding dynamic compression generation are identified. Based on the proposed dynamic buckling criterion, global stability assessment is performed for the base cases, against regular and irregular wave excitation. The critical vessel motions for the onset of impulse dynamic buckling, are identified. A sensitivity study on the driving parameters is performed. Following a limit state design approach for the base cases, results demonstrate that compression could be tolerated during pipelay operations, providing that other failure modes are covered. Hence, the limit of the local buckling criteria can be fully exploited despite the occurrence of compression. <br","pipeline installation; j-lay; buckling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

First: Is it possible to calibrate a ductile failure model, where the strain at failure is a function of stress triaxiality and Lode angle, using only a single SENB specimen? The failure model that is referred to describes local failure in a finite element model to simulate ductile fracture. In this thesis, an orthotropic damage constitutive material model is constructed to accommodate the most realistic fictitious crack growth. Simple isotropic element erosion or deletion was found to have severe effects on the stress states of neighbouring elements due to a major loss of constraint. The damage model is based on the stress triaxiality and Lode angle, derived from the invariants of the stress tensor. For any combination of stress triaxiality and Lode angle, an equivalent plastic strain to failure is required in the form of a three-dimensional failure surface. Typically, multiple experiments with varying dominant stress states are needed to accurately calibrate such a failure surface or model. This research project shows that one can not only calibrate a failure surface from a single three-point bending specimen, but also obtains more calibration points than other approaches that are typically used for this purpose along the way. These calibration points are collected during a fully automated iterative procedure, where points are added every time the force in the simulation exceeds the force found in the experiment by more than 1%. As soon as enough calibration points with distinct stress states were found, the Hosford-Coulomb model was fitted using the least squares method. Finally, the obtained failure model was verified by using it to simulate the specimen on which it was calibrated. From these results, it can be concluded that it is possible to calibrate a failure model using only a single SENB specimen. In addition to this thesis, this procedure is outlined in a paper (Coppejans &amp; Walters, 2017). The second part of the thesis revolves around whether a ductile failure model obtained from the procedure presented in this thesis can be successfully used to predict failure in different geometries. To verify this, the differences in stress states that occur in specimens with different dimensions and aspect ratios is researched both theoretically and numerically. From that study, it is found that indeed the geometry has an influence on the stress states that are present and where they are present. This influence is great enough that simple fracture mechanics approaches such as the J-Integral and CTOD are only transferable if strict requirements are met between SENB specimen from the same material but with different dimensions. Standards such as BS7448 and ASTM E1820 describe the validity of the experimentally obtained fracture toughness parameters with respect to the specimen size to deal with these requirements. Where the global approach (fracture mechanics) fails, the local approach (damage mechanics) finds a natural application due to its revolving around stress states. Application of the failure model obtained from the smallest specimen to the specimen with greater size and to the specimen with a different aspect ratio strengthens this claim. The failure model is able to predict the onset of element failure, used to simulate crack growth, within 2.5% deviation in experimental and simulated force at crack initiation. The force during crack propagation is simulated with 99% accuracy for crack mouth opening diameters (CMOD) at least twice and up to four times the CMOD due to plastic deformation. For greater amounts of CMOD, the reaction force is simulated with decreasing accuracy. The crack path on the free surface is verified by comparing the simulated crack path, visualised by removing all damaged elements from view, to a picture that was taken after the experiment. This reveals that while the extent of the crack is fairly accurately simulated, the width of the crack is both not accurately represented by simply removing all damaged elements from view, and the created damage model may require more development.","Continuum Damage Model; Fracture mechanics; Damage mechanics; SENB; Calibration; Crack growth; Ductile fracture; Steel; Plasticity; Lode angle; Stress triaxiality; orthotropic damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-08-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

To date pharmacological treatment is the golden standard. However, the medicines used have many adverse effects and, only work for a short time period. The best solution would be to cure the disease and thus stop the degradation of neurons and replace the already lost neurons by healthy ones. With the development of regenerative medicine, strategies to replace the lost neurons are emerging. One of the approaches includes the use of neuronal progenitor cells to differentiate and grow into functional neurons. To achieve this, a suitable in vitro environment is needed that includes an optimal use of culture medium and substrate. Laminin has been shown to be an effective substrate for neuronal cell culture purposes as it is part of the native extracellular matrix in the nervous system. However, laminin represents a family of 20 isoforms as known so far and there is still a lot unknown about the functions of each isoform on neuronal cultures. In this study the effects of eight available human recombinant laminin isoforms (i.e., -111, -121, -211, -221, -411, -421, -511 and -521) on cell attachment, differentiation, neurite outgrowth and connectivity of cerebellar progenitor cells have been assessed by means of immunofluorescence techniques. A general laminin substrate stemming from mice sarcoma (L2020) was used as a control. The results show that Laminin- 211, -221 and -411 do not possess any neurite outgrowth and differentiation abilities and thus were not included in the remaining experiments. Between the remaining substrates used no difference was found on cell attachment and neuronal differentiation. Laminin-511 and -521 increased neurite outgrowth the most and laminin-421 the least. Laminin-111 took third place. Laminin-111, -511, -521 and L2020 were included in the connectivity experiments. Laminin-521 stimulated synaptogenesis to the largest extend followed by laminin-511 and then -111. Overall, laminin-511 and -521 showed the best results in this study and performed better than a general laminin substrate that studies mostly use.","Laminin; cerebellar progenitor neurons; regenerative medicine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-25","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Many of these bridges were designed and built in the 1960s and 1970s. These bridges are still in service, and subjected to higher and more frequent loads than at the time of design. This leads to uncertainties in the safety of these bridges. Many municipalities become increasingly aware of these uncertainties and want to verify their bridges according to current standards. Especially the shear assessment is critical, since some former codes do not contain shear checks. Municipalities usually do not have sufficient financial resources to investigate and recalculate all of their bridges. A Quick Scan model is a cheap and fast tool to do structural checks, or to classify a number of bridges for structural safety. A literature study and Finite Element Modelling research was performed in order to make the Quick Scan more accurate. In general, existing municipal bridges are not exposed to the same heavy traffic as governmental highways. Nevertheless, municipal bridges were calculated with the same load models as governmental bridges. For the assessment of existing municipal bridges research was done to the possibility of reducing the design loads of Load Model 1 (LM1) from the Eurocode. This reduction can be done with the α- factor on variable loads. The possible reasons for this reduction is threefold. Firstly, municipal roads are significantly less exposed to heavy traffic compared to governmental highways. Therefore the chance of occurrence of the governing vehicle according to LM1 is decreasing. This assumption was supported by Weight-in-Motion measurements on a municipal road in Rotterdam. With the reliability index (β) for existing bridges in Consequence Class 2, this lead to a governing axle load of 225 kN, instead of the 300kN from LM1. The second reason for the reduction of the design load is the fact that municipal bridges usually have relatively small spans (5-20m). LM1 is designed to simulate a fully loaded bridge with a span of at least 20m. For small spans it can be useful to calculate with real occurring traffic, since axle distance is more important than axle loads only. A third (small) reduction is the fact that an existing bridge has a shorter reference period than a new bridge. This leads to smaller chances of the occurrence of the governing vehicle. New load models for small span municipal bridges were designed taking into account these reductions. The governing vehicle for small span bridges is a 5-axle vehicle with axle loads of 137,5-165 kN and axle distances of 140-175mm. Occurring shear forces due to these loads are higher than due to a long vehicle with higher loads, mora axles and greater axle distances. The new governing vehicle was used to determine the reduction factor α. This was determined by a comparative research in the Finite Element Modelling program RFEM. The resulting shear stresses and flexural stresses from the different load models were compared. For spans up to 11m the loads from LM1 can be reduced by an α factor 0,8. This factor increases linearly to a factor 1,0 for a 20m span. Besides the differences in loads and dimensions, municipal bridges also differ from governmental bridges in lay-out. In general, the distance from the carriageway to the edge of the slab is larger for municipal bridges due to the presence of a footpath or bicycle lane separated by a kerb. Bridges in 10 different municipalities were examined on lay-out. Roughly 58% of the municipal bridges in the Netherlands have significant edge distance (&gt;1,2m) This leads to a difference in the force transmission, since the high axle loads from LM1 cannot occur near the edge of the slab. The influence of this edge distance for different spans was investigated with RFEM. Also, the variable and permanent loads were investigated separately to give insight in the resulting shear stress due to different loads. Distinction was made between slabs in cracked and uncracked state. Cracking has significant influence on the transverse force transmission of the axle loads. The transverse force transmission is influenced by the ratio between longitudinal and transverse stiffness, which was conservatively chosen as 1/3. Also, distinction was made between in-situ casted slabs and prefab slabs. The self-weight of in-situ casted slabs leads to a constant shear force on the support. A prefab slab was treated like a theoretical slab, where the self-weight leads to peak forces near the edge due to torsional moments near the edge. The critical edge distance was determined for different spans. For a cracked in-situ casted slab with an edge distance &gt;1,5m, the middle of the slab is always governing in shear. An edge distance &lt;0,7 leads to the edge of the support being governing in shear. Research by Eva Lantsoght to shear force in reinforced slabs under concentrated loads close to the supports was used for rules and assumptions based on experiments. These rules were used to get a better understanding of the results in RFEM, and to develop the Quick Scan Model. The Quick Scan model uses findings from literature research combined with findings from finite element modelling. The output is a Unity Check which can function as real structural shear check if the concrete compressive strength and steel yield strength are known. When only dimensions are known, the Quick Scan model can function as classification for a series of bridges in a municipality. The Quick Scan model was tested by a series of case studies, which did not yet lead to the verification of the model. Results from the Quick Scan model were compared to results from the FEM research. Occurring shear stresses in the Quick Scan model are conservative with a maximum error of 11%. With the possibility of lowering the reliability index β to 2,5 (‘disapproval’ level) and taking into account the possible error due to several uncertainties, the upper boundary of the Unity Check was found as 1,4. Bridges with a Unity Check: 1 &lt; UC &lt; 1,4 according to the Quick Scan model need further assessment or material testing in order to fulfil the requirements. Extensive research was done to loads according to the Eurocode (LM1) on slab bridges and the force transmission of these loads. The capacity of existing concrete slabs was investigated relatively brief. More research to the capacity side of existing concrete bridges is expected to be beneficial.","concrete; slab bridges; alpha factor; shear force; existing bridges; Quick Scan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dilemma has led many researchers on the field of wind energy to wonder about the optimum size for wind turbines concerning the lowest cost of energy. This project studies the optimum turbine size for offshore applications through the modeling of the costs of the components that have the largest contribution to the Levelized Production Cost (LPC). Since at different power ratings different power densities are optimal, the turbine size is considered in terms of the rotor diameter and the turbine rated power. Therefore, the cost models developed in this work are a function of these two parameters. To develop the cost models, classical scaling approaches are used along with an offshore wind farm design emulator tool. Regarding that the optimum turbine size is not the same for all situations, two case studies of offshore wind farms are established. These case studies contrast some of the relevant characteristics of an offshore wind farm as the power installed capacity, the distance from shore, the water depth, and the wind and wave environment. The optimal size for large, far offshore wind farms was found to be in the range of 10-13 MW, while it was around 5-7 MW for small near shore farms. The optimum turbine size depends mostly on the reduction in the cost of the O&amp;M and the increment in the costs of the turbines and support structure as the turbine scale employed in the wind farm becomes larger. Finally, the blades cost appears to be a limiting factor for the increment in the rotor diameter for the large turbines scales.","Offshore Wind Energy; Turbine Size; Upscaling; Optimum; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design area is limited to 3.5 um², to allow it to be manufactured with the cheapest 65 nm prototyping run available at IMEC. In order to achieve this small design area, a new 24-port register file design has to be devised. In its current state, it is implemented using standard logic cells. Clever optimizations involving cell padding and minimum overhead power routing are necessary to reduce a total routing overcongestion from 7% to zero.<br/>This implementation is expected achieve a clock speed of 141 MHz, only limited by the ρ-VEX reconfiguration logic. By lowering the frequency to 100 MHz, the energy dissipation is reduced by 96%, to a total of 367 uW/MHz. This is comparable to similar VLIW designs. Using LVDS communication clocked at four times the core frequency, a data bandwidth of 4 Gbit/s is achieved using only 26 external pins.

On the other hand, there is continuous demand for lighter, faster and more efficient vessels. Technological advancement in composite materials and better design methods invariably leads to more sophisticated computational tools. In these tools, the inherent flexibility of the structure is involved in the calculation of its<br/>loading and response – introducing the aspect of fluid-structure interaction. However, more than fluid-structure interaction, hydroelasticity which is a subset of fluid-structure interaction allows for deformation of the structures due to fluid. Current industry practice neglects these deformations and all structures are designed as rigid bodies. These practices lead to overestimation of the frequency which translates to the mass and how stiff the structure is. Design based on hydroelasticity<br/>allows for knowing the true behaviour of the structure; thus, a coupling of fluid and structure yields a true appreciation of these designs. The objective of this study is to formulate and solve analytically the coupling phenomenon behind fluid-structure interaction. An experiment designed by Lampros Rizos in 2016 which modelled fluid-structure interaction consisted of a set-up with a cylinder immersed in a larger cylindrical tank. The immersed cylinder having a flexible circular membrane (structure) located at its bottom. The cylinders were filled with non-viscous liquid and exhibited free surface. The designed experiment was decoupled and a systematic build up in understanding the dynamics of all components – structure and fluid were solved. Firstly, the dynamics of the structure when dry (In vacuo) was idealized in 2-D and 3-D. Secondly, the system was coupled and solved<br/>in 2-D and 3-D when structure is located at the top and bottom of a single cylinder individually. The use of a series solution: Fourier-Cosine and Fourier-Bessel series solutions were used for 2-D and 3-D cases respectively. Along with these series solutions, the fluid governing equations were employed to solve for the coupled frequencies. Lastly, the entire submerged structure was analysed and solved. The hydroelastic or coupled frequencies and vibration patterns are determined for lower angular and radial modes for which the influences of various parameters are investigated. A trend was observed – that for lower modes, the hydroelastic frequencies are lower than individual membrane natural frequencies at low frequencies. At higher frequencies, the coupling effects are larger making the coupled frequency higher than uncoupled frequencies. There is a strong relationship between the tension of the membrane and the hydroelastic frequencies. An increase in the tension causes an increase in the hydroelastic frequencies. Also, the hydroelastic frequencies increase as the fluid depth increases. More so, the increase in fluid depth tends to converge towards the uncoupled fluid free-surface frequency. The comparison of the analytical solution with experimental and numerical solutions does not match perfectly and thus, further works to improve this study are recommended.","Hydroelasticity; Fourier-Bessel; Coupling effect; fluid-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An audit of the Bang &amp; Olufsen automotive brand compared to the in home audio products has revealed an opportunity to introduce “magical” experiences to impress and delight customers the same way the home speaker group does. The technological changes in audio devices has changed the meaning of music for listeners: music is now a way to directly enhance the environment, sometimes resulting in moments of perfect synchronization between the music and context, resulting in phenomenologically intense music experiences. Music is also listened to constantly and brought along with listeners to define the different contexts and spaces. The poised changes in automotive technology, including integration of spaces and deprivatization, mean that musical experiences will become seamless and music may fill the roll or social device or privacy barrier. Conceptualization of this project focused on the entering and exiting of the car in with the aim of contributing to or enhancing phenomenologically intense music experiences. The chosen concept was a seamless audio experience that allowed users to continue listening to music on their headphones when they entered the car on the car audio system. Once in the car, they could choose to listen to their own music or join in the music with others. When leaving the car, they could choose to continue to listen to their music when it transferred to their headphones.This idea was elaborated into a headrest based device. The user can listen to their own music in “private” mode, in which case the flaps of the headrest are forward. They can chose to switch to “social” mode, in which case the flaps of the headrest are pushed backwards. This requires the installation of 4-5 autonomous audio systems in a car, which would could be controlled or synced independently.The biggest detailing challenges rely in the communication technologies: transferring music from a users headphones to the headrest system requires a mixture of a one-time NFC check-in and a long term WiFi connection with the user’s phone.

Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA), the practice of showing advertisements based on individual users' web browsing behaviours, greatly improves the expected effectiveness of advertisements, and is believed to be beneficial to advertisers and users alike. The privacy of users, however, is threatened by the widespread collection and exchange of users' browsing behaviour by dozens of companies for the purpose of behavioural advertising. The aim of this thesis is to alleviate these privacy concerns by investigating how an online advertising system can serve advertisements tailored to users' interests within the current online advertising ecosystem, such that no party other than the user themselves can gain any knowledge of the user's interests. To protect user privacy in the online advertising ecosystem, two main challenges need to be overcome. Not only do advertising companies need to adapt their machine learning models to a setting in which they have no knowledge of user interests, they also need to integrate their privacy-preserving targeting systems into a complex advertising landscape where advertisement impressions are traded within a fraction of a second. We present two complete privacy-preserving protocols for online behavioural advertising that combine machine learning methods commonly encountered in existing advertising systems with secure multi-party computation techniques. The first protocol uses a threshold variant of an additively homomorphic cryptosystem to distribute trust between parties while allowing computations on encrypted data, such that advertisements can be served based on detailed user profiles. The second protocol distributes trust between advertising companies using an additively homomorphic threshold secret sharing scheme, allowing collaborative computations on user profiles while preventing a coalition of colluding parties smaller than a predefined threshold from obtaining any sensitive information. Both protocols achieve performance multilinear in the size of user profiles and the number of advertising campaigns, and show promising initial results in terms of privacy and performance. To the best of our knowledge, our two protocols are the first protocols that preserve user privacy in behavioural advertising while allowing the use of detailed user profiles and machine learning methods.","applied cryptography; online advertising; privacy; behavioural advertising; response prediction; multi-party computation; homomorphic encryption; secret sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Science","",""

This study therefore aims to research to what extent voluntary employee turnover can be predicted on an individual employee level using only core employee data. We design and extract features related to voluntary turnover using the hierarchical structure of the company such as features measuring team diversity and the hierarchical position of an employee in the company. This allows us to considerably increase performance compared to only using the original numerical features. Despite this increase, we feel performance needs another boost to make it usable in practice. We therefore investigate the underlying problems, showing that the root problem is not likely to be the inherent class imbalance or a lack of sample size, but rather a severe class overlap, meaning that the extracted feature sets are likely not informative enough to separate the voluntary leavers from the other employees.","voluntary employee turnover; people analytics; binary classification; feature design; class imbalance; class overlap; feature importance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The one-dimensional model, that describes the blood flow, is derived based on the physical laws of conservation of momentum and conservation of mass. A high resolution flux differencing scheme is applied to a stented artery, a tapered artery, an arterial bifurcation and a network of the 55 main arteries in the human arterial tree. It is found that inserting a stent led to an increase in the peak pressure and a dip below the equilibrium pressure, just before the stent. The nonlinearities in the model are shown using a long tapered artery, in the form of the steepening of the pulse. The current treatment of the bifurcations has led to reasonable physical reflections, in the bifurcation test cases. The network of 55 arteries showed that bifurcations play an important role in the blood flow patterns and, as such, they should not be ignored when considering a single blood vessel. Further research should focus on the implementation of a vascular prosthesis and more advanced treatments of the bifurcations.","blood flow; Finite Volume Methods; FVM; stent; tapered artery; arterial network; reflection; bifurcation; flux difference splitting; Riemann problem; Partial Differential Equations","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Completely developed in the High Speed Lab of the Aerospace Faculty at TU Delft (The Netherlands), the experiments were conducted in the transonic/supersonic wind tunnel TST-27. In order to achieve time and spatial resolution of the phenomenon, high-speed Schlieren and time-resolved particle image velocimetry were used as the main measurement techniques over two aerodynamic models, the NACA0012 and the OAT15A. The aim of the project was to achieve fully developed buffet conditions, to study the time evolution of the flow and the dynamic characteristics of the features involved in the phenomenon, to investigate the wave propagation in the flow that maintains the self-sustained character of buffet and to study the origin and dynamic development of these waves.<br/><br/> An spectral analysis of the shock wave motion was done over all the experimental test cases to analyze the influence of different aerodynamic parameters (Ma, Re, AoA) over the phenomenon and to come up with the cases were buffet is most fully developed. The results showed that, as expected, there is a range of values of these aerodynamic parameters under which buffet develops, and out of this range it just vanishes. Buffet was fully achieve for the OAT15A model at Ma=0.70, AoA=3.5º and fixed transition at x/c=7%, on the other hand, buffet about the NACA0012 was not fully developed, but it was found to be stronger at Ma=0.70, AoA=4º and free transition. From the PIV results, the instantaneous and the phase-average velocity fields showed how the actual flow development takes place and all the features involved in the buffet cycles. It was shown that under fully developed buffet conditions, massive separation takes place from the shock foot and extends beyond the trailing edge during the upstream motion of the shock wave, whereas reattachment occurs in that region during the downstream motion of the shock.<br/><br/> Finally, a correlation analysis of the velocity fields demonstrated the presence of the so called upstream traveling waves shed at around 2000 Hz and traveling upstream at -80 m/s. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the vortices shed from the shock foot when full separation occurs are not the cause for the upstream traveling waves, instead they are originated by another type of disturbances shed when reattachment occurs at the shock foot. This made possible a reformulation of the hypothetical dynamic evolution of the features involved in the buffet cycles, explaining the links between them and the physical mechanisms that cause their self sustained development.","buffet; aerodynamics; experimental; PIV; Schlieren; shock wave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

Frequently measuring water levels in areas with tidal influence is especially desirable because it enables observations to follow the rise and fall between minimum and maximum water level. However, a majority of developing countries are not able to measure water levels at the desired time stamp and spatial scale with currently available water level measuring instruments, predominantly due to limited financial resources. Countless reliable instruments exist that measure water levels, although low-budget instruments are few and far between. Literature study showed that the price of water level instruments are not representative of the water level measurement accuracy acquired.<br/>This research focuses on the need for a water level measuring instrument that is low cost, automatic, reliable and suitable for use in developing countries, specifically in Myanmar. In Myanmar, automated water level data collection remains challenging due to limited financial resources. This data collection limitation inhibits Myanmar's ability to optimize the distribution of water resources, potential consequences of poor water resource management include floods and droughts. Key requirements for a water level gauge to be considered suitable for use in developing countries include, simple to operate and repair, made from off the shelf components and operational in remote areas.<br/>We developed an automatic water level gauge incorporating an acoustic distance sensor, which is the type of sensor used for parking assistance in modern cars.

Reproducibility is recreating an experiment by a different researcher. Science in general struggles with repro- ducibility. MOOC experiments often contain useful code that could be used by other researchers, but that code is oftentimes not shared with others. To improve S&amp;R in MOOC research, this thesis first identifies the challenges MOOC sci- entists encounter when trying to share code and when making their experiments reproducible. Then, user interviews are performed to further understand MOOC research and to better understand the challenges identified earlier. A conceptual experimental workflow is designed and implemented in the form of a workbench. The workbench is then evaluated. The identified challenges based on literature with regards to S&amp;R are: (1) Difficulty in selecting the right tools, (2) lack of a standardized workflow that en- ables reprodubility and (3) manual work required to enable reproducibility with- out a clear incentive to perform that work. From the user interviews, researchers indicate experiencing these same challenges. Based on these challenges, I pro- pose an experimental workflow that focuses on making research reproducible and on sharing code. This workflow is implemented in the form of a work- bench, where researchers can create and manage their MOOC experiments. This workbench allows for sharing code between researchers and is evaluated using a real-world data science task by three actual large-scale learning analytics re- searchers and a visiting volunteer researcher. The evaluation finds that the work- bench needs more work to be suitable for actual MOOC research use and that more researcher education is needed to improve sharing and reproducibility in MOOC research.","workbench; MOOC; reproducibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two different situations are investigated, one without any measure and one with canalization of the river. These two situations are compared with a zero variant where no navigation restrictions occur and therefore a so- called reference situation is also investigated. The focus is on the direct costs for the inland shipping sector due to navigation restrictions caused by insufficient water depth and canalization. Besides, the more integral picture is taken into account by the total costs due to canalization, which consist of the shipping costs due to canalization and the weir- and lock complex costs. For studying the effects of the different developments on the inland shipping sector an effect model is developed, validated and used. <br/>The consequences in case of several scenarios for this canalization option are investigated to get insight in the range of possible outcomes. The scenario analysis shows that the shipping costs for all scenario combinations are lower in case of canalization than in case without any measure. Looking to the more integral picture, the total costs due to canalization are only in case of the most extreme climate scenario lower than the shipping costs in case without any measure. For all other scenarios, the total costs due to canalization are much higher. During the sensitivity analysis, the total costs due to canalization for various weir- and lock complex costs are investigated. The result is shown in the figure alongside to here. For total weir- and lock complex costs below 400 million Euro the feasibility of Waal canalization is quite high, which means that for many scenario combinations the costs due to canalization are lower than the costs in case without measure. However, for WLC costs between 400 million Euro and 900 million Euro the feasibility decreases to 20%. It is expected that 1000 million Euro is quite large for one complex and therefore it is assumed that a feasibility of at least 20% is reached.","Climate Change; River canalization; Inland shipping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some recent commercial applications use sensors in the ear but are faced with motion artifacts which corrupts the signal. In this report, a comprehensive review of heart rate detection methodologies was completed in order to find possible solutions with better performance. Infrared thermography is a non-contact technique and was selected because it may minimize motion effects with better user comfort and lower power consumption. Thermopiles were chosen as the sensors used in the system based on their responsivity, relevant wavelength detection and size. The anatomical distribution of the arteries in the external ear was studied in order to select the best position of the sensor. The cavum conchae and anti-tragus were studied considering the irrigation of the posterior auricular and superficial temporal arteries. The signal analysis was performed using a continuous wavelet transform which extract frequency features of the bioheat transfer waveforms.<br/>A digital sensor was evaluated first in the neck, nose, wrist and ear but did not render relevant results mainly due to quantization errors. Subsequently, analog thermopiles were studied with ultra-low noise amplifiers. First, the Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference from a ST150 thermopile was calculated using a Peltier cooler and a Pt100 reference sensor. This sensor was then used to measure the infrared signals of the wrist, neck and ear in order to find pertinent heart rate signal. Next, a smaller sensor was used to try compare the locations of the anti-tragus and the cavum conchae in the ear and under the effect of a fan. The fan did not had any effect on the measurement and the smaller sensor had significantly less signal than the previous sensor. The localization of the arteries was not possible as a result of the reduction on the detection area of the skin. Finally, the effect of the detection area of the skin was tested under 2 conditions using the ST150 thermopile. The results show that a separation of the sensor from the skin increased the detection area and the quality of the heart rate signal measured. The proposed system successfully uses infrared differential thermometry to detect the heart rate in the auricle.","Heart rate; Infrared Thermometry; Wavelet Transform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method was based on Verganti’s Design driven innovation to (re)define the meaning of the product. The analysis phase deconstructed the product into its physical capabilities and its current meaning. These key qualities were then clustered and examined within the Japanese context. This part of the research was based on desk research, own past experiences and a stay in the context that resulted in interviews with experts and observations. The research concluded that there was not a need in nutrition assistance, but in nurturing the mental health as factors such as high societal pressure, loss in genuine intimacy and a need to escape were evident. <br/><br/>This resulted in the vision of food poetry which seeks to share memories through food by addressing the senses using the ingredients that correspond to that memory. The physical outcome is the concept of a food haiku; a food composition that consists out of three edible snacks, representing the most important elements of that memory, a written haiku and a specially designed case that enhances the experience. In addition, as food printing requires the skills of both ingredient / cooking knowledge and 3D modeling, a complete product service system was then proposed. The service consisted out of three stakeholders; each having their respective roles in the process of creating and receiving a food haiku. Lastly, the concept’s value was evaluated with interviewees from the Japanese context.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Geothermal energy is a way of reducing the cost of energy. Deep geothermal energy systems extract heat from very deep soil layers where the temperatures are very high. Shallow geothermal energy systems are about 150 metres deep and they are used to store heat in the soil, to extract it later and use it for space heating. These shallow geothermal systems are generally embedded in a borehole, but they can also be cast into structures, which are called thermo-active foundations. An example of such a foundation is the energy pile, a foundation pile with a heat exchanger embedded in it, connected to a heat pump. There is no need to drill an extra hole in the ground, but the downside is that it is not well known how the bearing capacity of the pile is affected by the heating/cooling cycles. An energy pile experiment is planned to investigate the thermo-mechanical behaviours of the pile and the goal of this thesis is a numerical investigation of the pile. It serves as an estimate of the pile and soil behaviour prior to installation and the results will be used to confidently design the experiment. The model was built with DIANA FEA software, that is capable of coupling thermo-mechanical behaviour. Firstly an experiment in London clay was recreated in order to verify and validate the model and modelling approach. The experiment in Delft was modelled using site investigation that was done at the location where it will be built. Along with old Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data the subsurface was mapped and soil parameters used in the material model were chosen. The thermal cycle that was imposed on the pile was chosen on the basis of preliminary modelling done at different temperature increments. The temperatures were chosen such that the pile was affected to a significant degree of its capacity. It was cooled for three weeks to 0 °C and then heated to 24 °C for three weeks, this was repeated for 6 years. The research focussed on finding which thermo-mechanical effects can be expected and what the scale of those effects could be. The effect directly linked to an increase in temperature is thermal strain. Materials tend to expand and contract with the temperature at different rates and so do the pile and the soil. The gradient of the heat flow is also an important factor as the pile is subjected to the temperature before the soil is. The pile will expand first and this will be resisted by the soil, the strain that is resisted by the soil is called the restrained strain and that is responsible for the change in stress in the pile. A pile that is heated will have more stress than with just a mechanical load and a pile that is cooled will see a reduction in stress. The pile will expand vertically around a null-point somewhere along the pile, this is the point that does not move. In principle, an unrestrained pile will have a null-point in the centre of the pile, but because some soil layers resist the pile movement more than others the null-point is closer to the stronger layers. In the Delft experiment model the null-point was halfway down the pile at first, but as the amount of cycles progressed it moved down. This is due to a decrease in resistance from the weaker layers and an increase in resistance in the strong sand layer on which the pile is based. The amount of stress that is generated is also less in these later cycles as the resistance of the soil became less. With that reduced resistance an increase in settlement is also seen. This can lead to differential settlements of structures that are built on such a pile, possibly damaging them. The results of the modelling are used to give an advice on the experiment details, such as geometry, thermal cycle and pile layout. An advice to the layout of the sensors is included as well as a prediction of the results.","geothermal energy; energy pile; numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, during orthopedic trauma surgeries, 3D volume data is acquired prior to the surgery to visualize the extent of the injury and also plan the operation. During the surgery, 2D fluoroscopic images are acquired to visualize the position of surgical instruments and understand the progress of the operation. However, the depth perception from these 2D images becomes difficult. By employing 2D/3D registration to overlay pre-operative imaging modalities, doctors may be presented a better way to visualize the progress of the surgery. Although several approaches have been proposed in the literature to deal with 2D/3D registration, they are limited by the need for a good initial alignment. This requirement for accurate initial alignment is the main reason hindering the adoption of 2D/3D registration in clinical practice. In this thesis, we propose automated initialization strategies, the output of which can be used by any common 2D/3D registration algorithm for<br/>further fine tuning.<br/><br/>A library based approach is to used to study the initialization problem. Four parameters of the six dimensional parameter space are sampled and their projections are stored prior to the surgery. We proposed frequency and feature based methods to retrieve the correct library match which is used for the initialization during the surgery. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by initializing an intensity based 2D/3D registration method with the automatically obtained estimation of the initialization transformation parameters. For fixed C-arm cases with available ground truth the initialization was successful for 87:41% for various anatomies such as the head, pelvis, spine, knees and feet. We further tested the approach in a completely un-calibrated scenario using a mobile C-arm. Visual evaluation of the results revealed a success rate of 88:4% for the initialization. Successful results were also obtained even in the presence of additional surgical instruments indicating the robustness of the proposed approach.","2D/3D registration; Initialization; SURF features","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sea level rise has been historically considered as the key factor in coastal retreat, but waves also play an important erosive role along the coast, which can also be affected by the changing climate. During the last years, important advances have been achieved in climate modeling, with a very detailed characterization of the different components of the climate system, for the present and for different future scenarios. However, characterization of future ocean waves is still a matter of discussion and ongoing research. In this thesis, a statistical downscaling methodology based on weather types has been chosen to model the present wave climate and explore potential changes in future waves. These changes are quantified in terms of the impact of these variations in the longshore sediment transport. The methodology is applied to Noordwijk, selected as a representative location of the central Dutch coast. The statistical downscaling methodology is based on a classification procedure of the predictor into similar atmospheric patterns over the wave generation areas, namely the weather types. Then, the wave data is grouped according to the occurrence of the weather types. The predictor is built from the sea level pressure fields (SLP) and the squared SLP gradients, while the predictant wave climate is characterized by significant wave height, wave peak period and mean wave direction of wind sea and swell components, resulting in unimodal or bimodal sea states. The chronology of the weather types is modeled using an autoregressive logistic model, which incorporates the seasonality, the interannual variability and the persistence observed from the historical data. For each weather type, wave parameters are modeled using the categorical distribution for the sea-state type, non-parametric kernel density functions for the central-mass regime and two generalized Pareto distributions for the lower and upper tails of wave height and wave period data. The statistical dependence between wave parameters for each sea state is included using a vine-copula approach, where the bivariate dependence of H_s and T_p is modeled using the AC skew t copula and the remaining relations are considered to be Gaussian. The effect of climate change is studied using SLP predictors from the global circulation model ACCESS1.0, under the RCP8.5 scenario and period 2070-2099. The statistical model is applied to identify changes in the occurrence probability of the weather types in the future. The importance of these changes are quantified in terms of the wave-induced longshore sediment transport using the process based model Unibest TC. The longshore sediment transport distribution for each weather type is computed and afterwards the changes in gross and net transports are estimated using the present and future probabilities of the weather types. In terms of the weather types, the results of this work suggest changes in the occurrence probability of the weather types in the future, with variations of ±60% with respect to present climate, and no relevant changes in the sequence of weather types, neither in terms of the transition probability matrix nor in terms of the persistence of each weather type. In terms of longshore sediment transport, significant changes are detected in the transport associated with some of the weather types. For the remaining weather types, the changes are in the order of the model uncertainty. Taking into account the contributions from all weather types, a net increase of the southward directed net longshore sediment transport with respect to the historical period is detected. This increase is driven by a decrease in northwards transport and a lower decrease in southwards transport. This result is in line with a poleward shift of the North Atlantic storm track reported in other studies. Most importantly, weather-type based climate classification has in this thesis been succesfully proven to be a reliable tool to analyze the wave climate at the location of interest. Furthermore, the statistical downscaling also provides a climate emulator that captures the climate dynamics at different time scales, which can be used for stochastic simulations of the atmospheric and wave climate, either for the recent past or future projections.","Statistical downscaling; Climate Change; Weather types; Longshore sediment transport; Noordwijk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.239024, 4.450041"

Also, more knowledge is sought in the process of FDM printing and optimizing quality as the layer by layer deposition inevitable results in poor surface quality. This study covered the surface quality of FDM printing by both objective and perceptual exploration. In the objective investigation the influence of build plate orientation, layer height, printing temperature, printing speed, cooling fans, angle orientation from horizontal plane, line width, material type and material color have been assessed with samples produced by the Ultimaker 3 3D printer. With an optical scanner build internally by Ultimaker, the surface roughness was calculated and statistically processed. Via screening and correlation experiments it was found that layer height and angle orientation from horizontal plane were most significantly influencing the surface roughness for both upward and downward facing surfaces. Other investigated parameters were found insignificant. The optical non-contact type of measurement has been compared with contact type measurement in a control experiment. For this the same trends in roughness values were visible for both types of measurements however contact type measurements resulted in lower surface roughness values.<br/>The perceptual exploration of the study investigated the Point of Subjective Equality(PSE) and Just Noticeable Difference(JND) for the most significant surface roughness influencing parameters from the objective investigation. This experiment was done with the use of a new designed haptic apparatus. Participants of this experiment were capable to distinguish samples from each other in terms of different roughness values and detect small changes in fine-textures.<br/>Combining the objective and perception data has led to a design of a 3D printable model which is an attempt in standardizing surface roughness in FDM printing.

New projects of energy sharing are coming up which allows a household to become a consumer, as well as a producer of energy in case of excess and sell it to make profit. But these projects fail within few years due to number of social, technical, cultural, political, and environmental dynamic factors playing role in the community. Thus, the research question is raised that “Given the dynamics of rural communities of India, how can socio-technical systems of solar electrification be sustained?"" This project develops an institutional innovation framework that helps answer this question. The framework is conceptualized and operationalized to understand that how the institutions around these factors can be changed by the community and individual actions in such socio-technical innovations and infrastructure systems. The study follows empirical analysis and develops simulation model (agent based model) for the case study of rural solar electrification in India, which helps in developing the institutions. The case study and the framework together emphasizes the importance of the institutional innovation approach, where institutions need to be adapted and diffused within the community to make the sustenance of the project possible in various domains. The final results show that new type of projects, labelled as hybrid projects, would be most sustained. These would be sharing projects and would only use the existing micro grids, when there is higher demand. Also, it emphasizes on the need to look at institutions development, not just as a collective perspective which happens with interactions of actions, but also a perspective of majority or collection of actions. The policies generated at two levels of usage (prioritization of resource usage, constraints on resource usage, etc.), and for acceptance of innovations (co-operative shops, in-house manufacturing, etc.) prove to help the sustenance of these electrification systems further.","Agent-Based Modelling; community-led developments; solar energy; sustainability; Institutional Economics; Technology innovation; Energy Sharing; Microgrids; Energy infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","25.3541, 68.2683"

Currently most of the power production in the wind energy sector is done using the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT). due to its higher efficiency and reliability as compared to Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT). However, due to limitations of HAWTs such as the complex yaw mechanism, higher positioning of the center of mass and relatively difficult up-scaling, VAWT are receiving more attention. <br/><br/>Attempt to access high range of power from VAWTs at offshore locations may damage the turbine blades due to increased loads. This thesis is dedicated to reduce the periodic disturbances on the turbine blades of VAWTs without affecting the total power production in a rotation, thereby ensuring the reliability and safe operation of VAWT. A control technique called Subspace Predictive Repetitive Controller (SPRC) is used for the recursive identification to estimate the parameters of wind turbine model and further providing an optimal control law accordingly. Basis functions have been used to reduce the dimensionality of the system, following which the system identification has been performed in the lifted domain. <br/><br/>Using the identified model, two types of control approaches have been applied. In the first approach, the objective function is to track a specific reference that indicates blade load. This reference ensures a reduction in peak loads of the VAWT by transferring the loads from their upstream to their downstream part, without comprising on the power production in one whole rotation of VAWT. In the second approach, a general control strategy is used in which the controller is given freedom to choose the pitch trajectory so as to reduce the blade loads. The controller is specified with a power reference that ensures the maintenance of total power. This strategy allows the turbine to be operated in different wind conditions, as a higher weighting is assigned to power production when wind speeds are less than rated wind speeds, and a higher weighting is assigned to the reduction of blade load when wind speeds are more than the rated wind speeds. .<br/><br/>These results show a real potential of the data-driven SPRC approach in wind turbines, and highlights new mechanisms to reduce the turbine loads on \ac{VAWT}s. These mechanisms offer valuable insights into enhancing the functions of VAWTs in a more reliable and damage-free manner.","data-driven; vertical axis wind turbine; repetitive control; blade loads; power production; Offshore Wind Power; floating turbines; horizontal axis wind turbines; subspace predictive repetitive control; lq tracker; identification; fourier analysis; basis functions; optimal pitch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","S4VAWT",""

In comparison with other contemporary technologies, the AFMs have been able to obtain atomic resolution both in high vacuum and liquid environments thus affirming their supremacy. The AFM can be perceived as a combination of a mechanical profilometer, where mechanical springs are used to sense the forces, and a Scanning tunneling microscope, where piezo-electric transducers are used for scanning. The AFM is widely used to generate a topographical image of the sample surface and also to study certain characteristics of the sample. The latter is aided by measuring the forces between the sample surface and the tip of the probe.<br/><br/>The non-linear, rapidly changing and hysteretic behavior of the tip-sample forces makes their accurate estimation extremely difficult in dynamic AFM. Moreover, the cantilever probe responds to an average of the different forces acting on the probe tip. Since several permutations of different forces can give the same periodic average, the accurate estimation of each of these forces has been evidently impossible. However, some probes exist for which the motion of the cantilever consists of super harmonic components of the tip-sample forces which provide more information about the tip-sample forces. Nevertheless the construction of these cantilevers is challenging and time consuming. Knowledge of the dynamic properties of the cantilever facilitates one to study its behaviour to a particular input. Since different forces act at different tip sample distances, a more mathematical approach towards tip-sample force estimation which includes the dynamic characteristics of the cantilever is necessary. <br/><br/>The accurate knowledge of the cantilever dynamics is extremely important for precise estimation of tip-sample forces, deduction of mechanical properties, controller synthesis etc. Therefore in this research, the techniques to identify the state space matrices is explored. One, rather old but an immensely useful identification method are the black box identification techniques. These techniques can be used to accurately estimate the fully parameterized state space matrices of the system. The main difficulty arises in estimating these parameters specially in the absence of one of the inputs (tip-sample interactions). <br/><br/>In this thesis research, an algorithm is developed to identify the fully parameterized state space matrices. A secondary cantilever of very high fundamental resonance frequency is used as a force sensor. This force sensor set up along with the periodic property of the tip-sample forces during TM-AFM is used to reconstruct the tip-sample interaction forces. Using the estimated tip-sample forces, a transfer function between the cantilever deflection and the estimated force is identified using a curve fitting technique. The curve fitting technique uses iterative least squares to reduce the two norm between the experimental frequency response and the frequency response estimated using the identified transfer function.<br/><br/><br","Atomic Force Microscope; System Identification; Unknown Input; Curve Fitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

We conclude that solely considering two-point interaction results in an inaccurate model, as the domain boundary behaviour found by N. Batenburg cannot be reproduced. An attempt was made to include three-point interaction,<br/>but due to a lack of time this attempt has not been successful.

All these converge to the evolution of a concept – Microgrid, which empowers Smart Grid of the Future. <br/><br/>In the thesis, the concept of Cell, a microgrid comprising of Distributed renewable energy sources like solar, wind etc., Battery energy storage systems and Controllable loads is conceived. Devoid of use of any communication equipment, the Cell relies on measurements of local variables for evaluating the State of Energy and Power. The primary focus is on the formulation of control strategy based on droop control that enables a seamless (dis)connection of Cell with External Grid, with still maintaining the operation of converter in voltage source mode. This control scheme is further extended for connection and disconnection of multiple Cells interconnected through a Backbone bus, referred to as Interconnected mode. Adding to this, a decision-making algorithm is developed for an autonomous operation of Cells, that determines the switching instants between Stand-alone and Interconnected modes. <br/><br/>The developed control strategy and automated decision-making algorithm was simulated in DIgSILENT PowerFactory software for varied scenarios to evaluate the performance and the overall stability of the system.

Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) and Transient Stability (TS) simulation are the two main dynamic power system simulation methods. To simulate large and complex power systems in sufficient detail without sacrificing execution time, one of the idea is to perform a co-simulation that couples EMT and TS simulator. Although several attempts have been made to couple both simulator, only on rare occasions do these hybrid EMT-TS simulators couple two or more industry-adopted simulation tools.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to to develop and study the benefits and limitations of the Electromagnetic Transient – Transient Stability co-simulation based on PowerFactory and PSS/E, both of which are among the most extensively used simulation tools in industry and academia alike. With regards to the objective, the EMT-TS co-simulation using PowerFactory and PSS/E has been developed. Then, several tests are performed to evaluate the function of each composing part of the EMT-TS co-simulation, and to test the integration between all its component. Next, The developed co-simulation is applied to study cases and the results are compared to a monolithic EMT simulation to evaluate its accuracy and execution time. Furthermore, the effect of TS and EMT time step to the accuracy and execution time of EMT-TS co-simulation have also been investigated.<br/><br/>The study case results show that the developed EMT-TS co-simulation has not been beneficial yet in terms of accuracy and execution time. Although the active power result shows a similar tendency with the monolithic EMT result, the difference between both are visible. The difference between both are more prominent in the reactive power result. The total execution time of the developed co-simulation in the study cases are in the range of 23-24 minutes, significantly larger than the total execution time obtained from the monolithic EMT simulation which is around of 12s. Also, it is found that reducing the TS time step from 0.02 s to 0.01 s slightly increases the total simulation time from 23 to 26 minutes. However, it does not contribute a significant improvement on the accuracy of the developed EMT-TS co-simulation. The result obtained from reducing the EMT time step to $ 25 \mu s$ is the same with the result obtained using $ 50 \mu s$ EMT time step. Moreover, the reduction of the EMT time step significantly increases the total simulation time from 23 to 42 minutes.

As a result, off-grid DC system is expected to answer the need of electricity in these areas.<br/><br/>Solar Home System (SHS) as one of the practical implementation of off-grid DC system has been used widely due to the low operating cost of PV panel which requires no fuel to operate. Besides that, this system offers more modularity rather than conventional power generator due to the absence of frequency and reactive power parameter in the static component. Decentralized control for energy management between component is preferred rather than centralized, so it does not require additional communication lines. Moreover, it allows each component to work independently when there is a failure or disturbance in the distribution lines. Equal power balance for multiple batteries is maintained by the additional controller in each local battery converter. Thus, the batteries rate of charge and discharge will be adjusted on their capacity.<br/><br/>Optimization of the individual SHS is conducted by interconnecting them as an attempt to form a low voltage DC off-grid network. It enables power-sharing mechanism to happen within connected houses. Additional power converters are required to provide bi-directional power flow within coupled houses, and decentralized secondary control needs to be introduced to give an equal independence level between these houses. Direct interconnection on the same voltage level allows the system to be simply coupled through cables, yet the current in the interconnection cable could increase sharply according to the sum of total connected SHS. On the other hand, interconnection in higher voltage level requires additional bi-directional converter between SHS and interconnection cables.

By doing so, it aims to establish the effectiveness of bend-twist coupling as a tool for passive load alleviation in small wind turbines.

The cross-sectional stiffness analysis is conducted using BECAS for a range of fibre layup angles in both carbon-fibre and glass-fibre blades. Carbon outperformed glass for all fibre angles with regard to the amount of coupling seen in the crosssections. Apart from flapwise bend-twist coupling, other secondary torsion couplings are also present. A load response study is carried out for varying positive fibre layup angles in both carbon-fibre and glass-fibre blades, under steady wind conditions for the operational wind speed range. An increase in the flapwise blade tip displacement and a reduction in the flapwise bending loads with increasing fibrelayup angles is observed for both glass-fibre and carbon-fibre blades. The HAWTOpt2 aero-structural design tool using OpenMDAO as its core is utilised to implement the optimisation. The spanwise fibre layup angle and laminate thickness distribution are the only design variables that were allowed to be manipulated by the optimiser. The objective function is comprised of two different individual objective functions weighed according to the situation. The optimisation cases failed due to inaccurate gradients of the objective function and constraints. Due to time constraints the manufacturing of the blade and, static load and wind tunnel testing were not carried out.","Bend-twist coupling; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization; Small wind turbine; Aeroelastic tailoring; OpenMDAO; HAWTOpt2; Material coupling; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Topology optimization is a strong approach for generating optimal designs which cannot be obtained using conventional optimization methods. Improving structural characteristics by changing the internal topology of a design domain has been fascinating scientists and engineers for years. Topology optimization can be described as a distribution of a given amount of material in a specified design domain, which is subjected to certain loading and boundary conditions. This domain can then be optimized to minimize specified objectives, for example compliance. For static problems, topology optimization is extensively used. The distribution of material, void and solid regions, can be used to solve several problems within the mechanical domain. However, this method of optimization is also used to optimize structures with respect to their resonant dynamics.<br/><br/>Design of actuator placement is used to determine the most optimal actuator layout for a given objective, for example reducing responses. Combined with topology optimization, both design variables can influence each other, and be optimized towards the wanted behavior. This is done in a static domain. When material is removed, the force layout is updated, which influences the material distribution again. It is shown that the combination of these design variables in the optimization process, contributes to a better result; weight reduction can be achieved, while large deformations are preserved.<br/><br/>Design of actuator placement, combined with topology optimization is also implemented in a dynamic domain. Since topology changes result in frequency response changes, the force placement is more sensitive. On the other hand, forces can be placed in a smart way, to ensure some mode shapes are not excited, whereas others are. By enabling positive and negative forces these forces can even be used to counteract or minimize certain modal responses. When implementing for example a harmonic excitation, the weight and total force can be linked together, to ensure accelerations are feasible. A weight reduction can thus lead to force reduction, which on its turn leads to less deformations. Especially in the high-precision industry, smart placement of actuators, including weight reduction can be very helpful. The combination of these phenomena could provide a new insight in creating accurate wafer stages.<br","topology; optimization; actuator; placement; motion; systems; design; supports; load; load placement; eigenmodes; eigenfrequency; stefan; broxterman; tudelft; msc; pme; precision; mechanisms; compliant; case; wafer; stage; harmonic; excitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

Solar energy is considered one of the most promising solutions to reduce CO2 emissions from building-related energy demands. Building-integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) have acquired special interest due to their dual purpose of generating clean energy and act as a protective envelope for the building itself. Even though the BIPV market is expanding, there are challenges that these systems must face. Partial shading conditions, high operating temperatures, and mechanical loads during installation are non-ideal conditions that are difficult to avoid in BIPV systems. Thin-film technology in solar cells has become popular for BIPV applications due to its light weight and pleasing appearance. Thin-film manufacturers claim a better performance under shading conditions and high temperatures in comparison with conventional crystalline silicon technology; however, the reliability of this technology it is not certain.<br/> <br/>In this research project, crystalline silicon and thin-film photovoltaic modules were submit- ted to shading stress and high operating temperatures that simulate real conditions in order to compare their performance and reliability. Furthermore, response to physical stress typical during the installation of these panels was conducted. Higher performance under partial shading conditions was demonstrated for thin-film modules; however, the reverse bias caused by partial shading caused irreversible damage heat spots in the shaded areas. Some of these heat spots instantaneously caused an irreversible damage in the thin-film modules leading to an output power loss. As a result, it was demonstrated that crystalline silicon has a better reliability under shade conditions than thin-film. Photovoltaic modules with glass-foil configuration suffered intensive damage under mechanical loads, while glass-glass did not show any kind of damage. Additionally, the temperature coefficient measurement exhibited uncertainties that are related to the solar simulator spectrum utilized for the experimental setup.","BIPV; Thin-film; Shunt defects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This probe is a manoeuvrable subsurface system for clean in situ analysis and sampling, developed at FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences since 2008, that is now part of a bigger DLR collaborative initiative, called Enceladus Explorer (EnEx). It combines melting with a hollow rotating ice screw and it now presents a cross sectional area of 80mm x 80mm.<br/><br/>A Raman spectrometer is a promising non-destructive technique that allows to identify both mineral and biological compounds with a minimum amount of sample, by measuring the inelastic scattering of light. In order to achieve an appropriate design for the instrument, the project followed a systems engineering approach. <br/>The first step was the derivation of the requirements related to the technical constraints dictated by the miniaturised design of the probe and to the performances that allow the spectrometer to detect potential biosignatures.<br/><br/>The design process was carried out by successive choices so as to propose a final configuration, developed as a CAD model in the software CATIA™. The instrument performs its measurements through a sapphire window in the IceMole probe, looking directly into the ice. It excites the sample with a laser wavelength of 532nm transmitted via a dichroic beamsplitter. The scattered light is collected by a long-pass edge filter and a 30° off-axis parabolic mirror that focuses the light into a collimator. The light is then delivered to a CCD spectrometer via an optical fibre. The spectrometer is able to measure a spectral range of 546.9-700nm with an accuracy of at least 0.4nm, combination of the characteristics of the optical components. The final result is a Raman spectrometer design modelled by the use of off-the-shelf components, selected through systems engineering trade-offs. The final dimensions of the instrument are 65mm x 65mm x 150mm, with a mass of about 1.1kg.<br/><br/>The outcome of this thesis will have to be verified and validated in order to ensure the correct working of the system, the compliance with the derived requirements and the validity of the use of this instrument to satisfy the customers’ needs and expectations.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In order to limit the impacts of climate change, there is a pressing need to accelerate the development and implementation of sustainable transport technologies and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This research provides an in-depth investigation into the impact of zero-emission vehicles on freight transport flows in terms of the reduction of GHG emissions.<br/>An initial step towards the reduction of GHG emissions has been the introduction of the carbon footprint as a form of measurement, which refers to the total amount of CO2 and other GHGs emitted over the entire lifecycle of a product or service. This CO2 footprint is typically measured in terms of tons of CO2. The emissions produced by freight transport are expected to grow more significantly than those of passenger transport. The methods adopted to combat GHG emissions and their results can vary, but the rise of GHG accounting has prompted a greater number of companies to set goals in terms of reducing their emissions.<br/>The minimization of costs and improved performance in terms of time have traditionally been the main priorities in most logistics systems. Efficiency-oriented logistics systems have led to a high degree of dependence on the truck-only system. Therefore, this research focuses on an electric truck that has the same functionalities of a conventional truck, but has an electric drive train, which results in decreased range and more downtime. The approach adopted in this study is to first develop a broad overview of transportation methods by means of reading articles, reports, and web pages; in addition, interviews are conducted with stakeholders. Thereafter, the second section focuses on the development of operational and financial models. The costs incurred and CO2 emissions produced per container when using a conventional vehicle, an electric truck, and an electric waterborne automated guided vehicle (AGV) system are analyzed.<br/>In the academic study of transportation, there is a large body of studies that identify shippers’ preferences with respect to various aspects of transportation, such as cost, quality, and speed. The overall purpose of of the model developed in this research is to investigate the feasibility of achieving zero-emission freight transport during the pre-haulage stage. This model is constructed in order to investigate which transport modality minimizes CO2 emissions and cost per ton/km from the perspective of pre-haulage contractor companies. The costs include fuel, infrastructure, and investment. In addition, the model measures the decrease in CO2 emissions associated with a shift from a fuel engine to an electric drive train.<br/>The results of the different scenarios with regard to the performance of each transport method are investigated by means of simulations performed using the Simio software. The scenarios are designed with the intention of determining the relationships between the various parameters and variables used in this system, such as throughput, battery range, charging time, vehicle capacity (in terms of the number of containers carried), and transport network. The scenario simulations indicate that there are clear reversal points when it comes to charging time and throughput. The performance in those scenarios that feature high throughput and short distance between the source and sink mainly depends on the charging time of the vehicles, rather than their range. In this case, the vehicles could be charged during the unloading process. Nowadays, making various assumptions, operating a conventional diesel truck costs approximately €350,000 less per year than an electric vehicle when it comes to a short-lane scenario with a yearly throughput of 45,000 containers.. <br/>Turning to the waterborne AGV, this innovative transport modality is heavily dependent on geographical constraints; in other words, it depends on whether it is possible to handle goods on waterways. From an academic perspective, this research contributes to the notions that such an innovative transport modality requires intensive development in terms of its performance and detailed elaboration on the design improvements of the conceptual vehicle. Subsequently, it can be concluded that the electric truck is closer to full implementation in a real-world operating environment.<br/>This report features both a business case and an operational logistics simulation. This research indicates that an understanding of the connections between the business models discussed in this thesis and the operational logistics simulation are useful when attempting to design a zero-emission freight transportation system. The define, measure, analyze, design, and verify (DMADV) framework is adopted in this study. The findings of this research are valuable for shippers and other logistics service operators who realize that significant steps need to be taken toward zero-emission freight transport.<br","Simulation; Container Transport; Electric Vehicles; Business Model; Emissions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-30","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

However, as (Kim et al., 2011) and (Bellamy &amp; Basole, 2013) recognized, both perspectives fail to capture the complex and dynamic nature of supply networks. Therefore, it provides managers tools that are based on nonrealistic assumptions. Despite the attention given in the literature to the activity to optimize the supply base the acknowledgement of its strategic importance in the supply management practices, frameworks for carrying out the process to optimize the supply base are rare (Talluri &amp; Narasimhan, 2005). Moreover, the existing frameworks fail to illustrate the complex and dynamic nature of the Supply Networks that encloses the process of supply base optimization (e.g Kraljic, 1983; Luo, Wu, Rosenberg, &amp; Barnes, 2009; Ogden &amp; Carter, 2008; Sarkar &amp; Mohapatra, 2006). Therefore, the academia has not provided managers a representative mental model of the complexities implicated in the process to optimize the supply base nor how to manage them. For this reason, this thesis attempts to fill this gap by exploring what the system level perspective offers to the literature in the field of supply base optimization. In order to fill this gap, three case studies were conducted with three initiatives to optimize the supply base in Royal Philips. This thesis proposes a theoretical framework to visualize and evaluate the landscape of the supply base optimization. This framework characterizes three different networks involved in the optimization of the supply base and proposed to evaluate the landscape based the three fundamental themes: Network structure, dynamics and strategy. The outcome of the research is the creation of propositions to clarify the process that a firm undergoes when optimizing the supply base. The first contribution of this research is to provide a new definition of supply base opti-mization from a network perspective. Based on the input from the experts and the analysis of documentation of the conventions, the definition of supply base optimization is as follows: “Supply base optimization is an ongoing process that aims to have the right number of suppliers with the right capabilities and right performance in order to meet current and future business needs” The second contribution of this thesis is a theoretical framework that serves one main purpose: To provide guidance to analyze the process to optimize the supply base from a network-level perspective, providing researchers a more realistic mental map of the supply network to analyze its processes. On the other hand, the analysis of the data collected in the firm, namely the interviews and the documentation of each convention, lead us to the third contribution of this research, which is the creation of a process to optimize the supply base. This process takes a network level perspective and acknowledges the interactions of the different actors at each network.","supply base optimization; supply networks; SCM; supply management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Closed-form expressions are derived for the equivalent layer reactance that includes the higher-order interaction between shifted layers.

However, covering part of the body influences the thermal balance due to restricting the heat loss capacity. This is especially the case for the head due of the lack of vasoconstriction response in the head’s skin. This project focussed on improving thermal comfort and perception when wearing a helmet in warm environments or during physical exercise. The main problem statement was: accumulation of heat underneath the helmet resulting in a rise in head skin temperature, decreased thermal comfort and exercise performance. There are five heat loss pathways in order for the human body to lose excess heat: conduction, radiation, and convection complemented with evaporation and respiration. Smith &amp; Havenith (2011) identified the forehead, side of the head and neck as areas of high sweat rate, here evaporative heat loss has high potential for providing cooling. Fanger’s (1970) four conditions state that skin temperature and skin wettedness are the main factors determining a person’s whole body thermal comfort. The emphasis was placed on convective (airflow) and evaporative heat transfer as main cooling pathways. Also, active cooling was found to be necessary to provide enough cooling for the head according to Strijk’s (2008) model. The new Fantilated helmet features active cooling through ventilation, a pyramid structured padding embedded with micro channels and an absorbing biomaterial. The Fantilated helmet was prototyped to validate the design and the cooling principle. To test the active cooling system a thermal head manikin with thermal sensors on its surface was covered with a wet cloth to analyse the temperature changes on the head’s surface. The full set-up was placed on a scale to analyse the decrease in weight caused by evaporation. The active ventilation of the Fantilated helmet rendered positive results in terms of reducing the temperature and an increase in the evaporation rate. Both the decrease in weight and temperature suggest that the active cooling system of the Fantilated helmet will aid in improving thermal comfort. The Fantilated helmet that was used in this test was not optimal, also, the pyramid structured padding and the absorbing biomaterial were not present in the final prototype (and therefore not tested). Possibly, the final product/design could render even better results than the one used in this test. In conclusion, the Fantilated helmet is effective in decreasing the surface temperature of the head and improving the evaporation from the head’s surface. However, testing was done on a thermal head manikin and not on actual humans. Further development is recommended and testing on actual users is necessary in order to validate all aspects of the design.","Head; Cooling; Helmet; Helmet liner; Thermal comfort; Thermal analysis; Biomimicry; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Countries in the EU discard an estimated 89 million tons of food every year. Worse, the food waste will increase to about 126 million tons in 2020 if we do not take action (European Union Committee, 2014). Moreover, most countries are burying food waste in the landfills. This manner of disposal produces methane gas because of the high water content of wasted food, and even contaminates soil and water that we are relying on to live (Osteen, C., Gottlieb, J., &amp; Vasavada, U., 2012). As solutions from food-related organizations and the government, many public campaigns and strict regulations have been carried out to decrease food waste at the production and consumption levels for years.This graduation project started from the global interest: the reduction in food waste. Specifically, the project aims at the consumption level. The reason is that twice or three times more food waste is produced at the consumption level than at the other three stages, which are production, processing and distribution (European Court of Auditors, 2016). During this project, the five design phases were executed for six months.To investigate the reasons in-depth, this project researched and analyzed the consumer’s behaviours towards food. For this study, face-to-face interviews and Food Diary surveys were conducted based on the research questions. The user research data was analysed in several directions.Through the user research, it was apparently found that vegetables were discarded in the home every week and the situation should be improved to reduce vegetable waste. The results of the in-depth user research were interpreted in a design statement to create some design ideas. The ideas were estimated by the four criteria which are feasibility, usability, aesthetics and effectiveness, and one out of five ideas was chosen as the final design concept which names Veggie-Table. As the project completion, the concept development and evaluation were conducted. In summarize, a final design proposal was made that the product not only inspires users to cook a meal using vegetables, but also helps them to not neglect any leftover vegetables in the refrigerator. This is due to the fact that the Veggie-Table is an integrated system for vegetable storage and preparation.","sustainable consumption; food waste reduction; vegetable combination; vegetable management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Increasing traffic demands and the forthcoming use of drones in non-segregated air space poses novel evaluation challenges to TCAS. Important limitations of existing TCAS models are: that their model is specified through their computer code only, that uncertainties are not or only partially captured, and the difficulty in incorporating model changes in interactions with novel airspace users. These findings motivated the development of an agent-based modelling and simulation approach that takes various uncertainties well into account.<br/> <br/>The core development consists of a mathematical model of TCAS II specifications according to the internationally accepted operational performance standards of TCAS II and airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS). This model has been completed with other agents and their interactions, has been implemented in MATLAB, and has been validated against EUROCONTROL’s deterministic TCAS simulation model InCAS.<br/> <br/>The novel TCAS model considers the following uncertainties: errors in relative position measurements, errors in own rate of climb/descent estimates; variation in pilot response time; probability of reception of an interrogation response; variation in TCAS computation cycle. To assess the effect of these uncertainties on TCAS operations, several air traffic encounter scenarios are considered. For each scenario, rare event Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted. The results of the simulations show that the considered uncertainties may have a significant impact on the safety improvement by TCAS that often deviates from prior expectations. For example, the simulation results show that uncertainties may induce mid-air collisions in scenarios where continuation of the original aircraft flights would not have resulted in a mid-air collision.

In order efficiently generate and evaluate orbits for such missions, use can be made of the spherical shaping method proposed by Novak. When inclinations larger than 15 degrees are present however, the error in the ΔV found by this method increases significantly. It was found that the spherical shaping method’s applicability and accuracy at high orbital inclinations can be improved through the development of a more accurate elevation shaping function. The purpose of this MSc thesis was therefore to do research on the development and implementation of such a function.<br/><br/>Using a number of test cases, three potential methods to obtaining a more accurate elevation shaping function were evaluated. These methods included the usage of spherical triangles, Fourier series and an alternative function that was obtained during the development. By evaluating the ability of various functions to describe the unperturbed and perturbed orbits included in the test cases, a new elevation shaping function was found. This shaping function was based on the aforementioned alternative function obtained during the development.<br/><br/>The accuracy of the new elevation shaping function was tested using a number of cases.

However, various reports seem to prove that this assumption is no longer valid. Almost always, the adverse impacts of innovation endorse that innovation is no longer a sole province of innovators. In many areas, innovations interact with stakeholders from multiple backgrounds. In order to allow a ‘better society with a better innovation’, scholars then raise a concern to take into account an ethical perspective in the innovation processes. Several frameworks have been offered to fulfill such demands. However, it seems that these prior concepts find little fit with the current challenges that society faces. This then drives the emergence of a new innovation approach, namely responsible innovation.<br/><br/>However, current conceptions of responsible innovation suffer from a failure to take a quantitative assessment into account. Regrettably, this failure becomes a shortcoming of current rationale in the responsible innovation arena. Of particular concern is the absence of a scale to measure a level of individual behavior in regards to the responsible innovation concept, namely a responsible innovation scale. At this moment, this scale is arguably a necessity in the business context because it allows the innovators to measure how responsible they are while undertaking their jobs.<br/><br/>In order to develop such a scale, a survey was firstly administered to 244 respondents. Subsequently, the response was examined using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). Stability of factor structure that was derived from EFA was then assessed using coefficient comparability in a large amount of random half sample. The most stable factor structure was subsequently validated using multiple statistical analytic methods. The finding showed that such measurement tool can be operationalized using eight questions.

(mentor); Abbink, David (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The aging society puts an increasingly heavy demand on the health care system. Elderly often have difficulties in mobility, reducing opportunities for exercise and social interaction that activities like running errands or shopping normally offer. This thesis proposes a novel concept for an assistive motorised shopping trolley, called Pull-E. Based on interview results with elderly (n=40) the Pull-E should be able to carry heavy loads (~20 kg) and still move easily and lightly while pulled over flat ground, curbs, and even stairs; and should ideally also be able to move autonomously, without being pulled. It should therefore have capabilities to balance itself, climb the stairs, carry items, and resist<br/>perturbations.<br/>First, a small proof-of-concept of the Pull-E was built, using tri-wheels which are separately powered by motors, that allow assistive stair-climbing when the Pull-E is pulled horizontally.<br/>In order to balance itself the tilt angle of the trolley needs to be measured. Therefore, the Pull-E was equipped with a gyroscope and an accelerometer. From this prototype one of the most challenging aspects emerged: stabilising the trolley.<br/>The next step was to choose a suitable control system. Since humans can adapt to the<br/>movement of other humans, climb the stairs, and resist perturbations of other humans, the<br/>human inspired control theories have been investigated.<br/>Based on the literature search the risk-aware control was the most promising one. In case<br/>of risk-aware control a value function is provided to the system, by which it can avoid the<br/>undesirable states. By using a value function it does not require the calculation of exact<br/>trajectories and therefore, it becomes computationally more efficient, than the other human<br/>inspired control methods. In addition it learns and adjusts its control parameters by which<br/>it can adapt to different situations.<br/>In order to test its efficacy, it was implemented and tested in a simulation of the Pull-E,<br/>where a planar projection of the tri-wheeled actuated trolley was dynamically simulated.<br/>Force inputs could act on the trolley by using the mouse, as well as pre-determined sinusoids<br/>acting on its centre of mass. The simulation showed the risk-aware control method already<br/>resulted in instabilities when no perturbations affected the system. So far, the risk-aware control method was tested only for zero order systems. Therefore an adaptation of the riskaware<br/>control method was made to allow the 2nd order system, by including angular velocities<br/>in the state and modifying the value function. This control method is able to balance the<br/>assistive trolley for forces that cause lower angular perturbations than 15 degrees.<br/>In the future this control method needs to be improved to become more robust against<br/>perturbation. The prototype needs to be rebuilt with stronger motors, and the control system<br/>needs to be tested on the prototype. Finally, this prototype will be evaluated when human is<br/>in the loop.<br/>To conclude, Pull-E can facilitate elderly’s longer independence, but still a lot of work needs<br/>to be done before it becomes a viable product.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

In the geothermal field, thermal microfractures can contribute to increase the permeability and produce more steam to the surface. We exposed basaltic andesite and andesite rocks from Tangkuban Perahu (Indonesia), a granite from Benin (West Africa), a basalt from the Eifel (Germany) and a basalt rock from Reynifsjara (Iceland) to temperatures of 200, 300, 400 and 500°C before cooling them rapidly by placing them in cold 20°C water. Initially, most of the sample rocks show less than 1% of porosity, excluding andesite Tangkuban Perahu (~6%) and basalt Reynisfjara (~14%), and permeability for all rocks is below detectable value (2.6 mD by Ruska gas permeameter for specified core geometry). In the geothermal field scenario, it indicates the pores were not connected and the steam may not easily flow through the rock. After the heating stage and thermal cooling, significantly increased values of porosity are observed in most of the rocks. However, only the two high porosity rocks gained permeability; the andesite Tangkuban Perahu (7-11 mD) and basalt Reynisfjara (4.45 mD). The changes in Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and ultimate compressive strength of the various samples were also determined by using an unconfined Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) apparatus in which both heat treated and non-heat treated samples were placed. The results show the rock strength decreases with increasing thermal shock. Similarly, we see a decrease in both Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio with increasing thermal shock. To recognize the thermal shock effect visually, the samples were imaged using a micro-CT scan before and after heating treatment. The resolution of the CT scanner was 30 μm at best when the whole sample is scanned. It is noticed that the porosity increases after the heating experiment. Additional mini-cores (~10 mm x 8 mm) from the whole core are also scanned at 14 μm resolution. The scans showed the porosity on the outside part of the cores is up to 10 times higher than the inner part. In Indonesia, the geothermal reservoir temperature varies from 200-300oC. By injecting cold water from the surface at a high rate, the water temperature remains low and can thus create the thermal shock that opens up existing fractures and forms new ones. In that way, it can increase fluid path ways around the well bore and along existing natural fractures.","thermal shock; microfractures; ultimate compressive strength; Young’s modulus; Poisson’s ratio; Brittleness Index (BI); micro-CT scan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","","-6.758444, 107.613694"

Rizos in the towing tank, 3ME,TUDelft in 2016. The concept of the experiment is shown in the figure 1. A cylindrical container is partially filled with water. A small cylindrical oscillator with flexible bottom is placed in the container. The oscillator is driven harmonically by a motor. During the experiment, the deflection of the flexible bottom, the motion of the free surface and the driven force were monitored and recorded. The figure 2 is the photo of the experiment. In order to better understand Rizos’ experiment, a series of researches are conducted in the Section Ship Hydromechanics, which includes analytical simulation and several numerical simulations with different methods. A linear algorithm is developed in this thesis, which applies implicit, monolithic (solving the fluid domain and structure domain simultaneously) and one-step (without iteration) methods. The model of the numerical simulation is shown in the figure 3, a small cylinder with flexible bottom is placed in the big cylindrical container. The two cylinders are partially filled with water and the still water levels are the same. The inner cylinder does not moves up and down as a whole. The oscillation of the whole system is the result of the initial wave elevation in the fluid domain and/or the initial deflection in the structure domain. The result of the numerical simulation is shown in the figure 4. The effect of added mass for a structure submerged in water results in that smaller eigen frequency of the structural vibration. The structure interacts with the ambient fluid, especially the free surface. For a pre-defined initial condition, the influence of the free surface results in the mode dispersion. The numerical periods of this FSI system agrees with the analytical periods. Significant numerical dissipation exists in the 1st order time integration techniques. Thus, the second order implicit Adam Moulton method, i.e., the trapezoidal rule, is implemented to improve the algorithm. in this way, the numerical dissipation is decreased drastically (5% less dissipation after 10 periods) without increasing the computational costs.","fluid-structure interaction; Numerical modelling; Linear model; Monolithic algorithm; one-step process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The need of the improvement of security mechanisms for IoT devices and platforms is more evident since more related attacks have been seen on Internet ([46]).

The new strategy introduces a user-centred mindset in developing new innovative products and services. In other words, the customer needs are researched and products are designed according to those needs. Consequently, KLM focuses on creating customer intimacy. <br/><br/>The customer satisfaction is measured by the Net Promoter Scores (NPS) index. KLM’s goal is to gradually raise this index from current score of 43 (2017) to 50 by 2020. In order to achieve that goal, KLM identified certain gaps in their customer’s journey experience to focus on and improve them. One of the identified gaps is the disruption handling. <br/><br/>Disruption is anything that alters the planning of the passenger. This might be a cancellation of a flight, a small delay of 10 minutes or a mass disruption due to weather circumstances. 38% of KLM’s passengers experience a disruption. Many quantitative researches conducted by KLM have shown that the disruption handling influences the NPS index dramatically (Delay NPS score of 2-16 is 16). Consequently, good disruption handling is very important for increasing the popularity of KLM and achieving its goal to “become the most customer-centric, innovative and efficient European network carrier”. <br/><br/>A very important customer need, defined by the aforementioned customer journey research, is the receiving of pro-active information when a disruption occurs. Additionally, KLM has already identified four factors that its customers need; passengers need consistent, relevant and personalised information at the right time. KLM offers several notifications from many different communication channels. However, KLM customer insights department receives many complaints about the disruption handling. <br/><br/>Also, there is no research or guidelines on how and what pro-active information should be received in order to fulfil KLM’s vision for customers: “KLM Cares for me by making me feel touched and recognised as an individual. I can feel that KLM is easy to deal with whenever a disruption occurs”. <br/>The passengers that are influenced more by the disruptions are the frequent travellers, since they experience disruptions more often. Furthermore, usually those travellers are flying for business reasons. KLM believes that if there is a solution fulfilling their needs, then the same solution will likely solve the problem of the regular passengers as well. Thus, the focus is on the frequent travellers flying for business reasons. <br/><br/>In order to identify the passengers’ real needs during disruptions, a user research was conducted with KLM passengers. This research revealed that the passengers not only need information timely, accurate, relevant and personal but also transparent. Furthermore, it revealed that the main concern of the target group is to keep their schedule without changes, as much as possible. Last but not least, the delays are more frustrating disruptions than cancelled flights, because of their ambiguous nature and especially the delays that occur at the gates prior to the departure. As a result of the user research, this thesis focuses on the delays occurring at the gate, on the concern of the passengers that is in which level the schedule is influenced and includes transparent information.<br/><br/>After three iterations with prototypes and small user tests KLM passengers, the created solution is a communication system, called “My Delay”, integrated in the KLM mobile application. It aims to make the passengers feel in control of the situation, less angry and assist them to make the most of their time.<br/><br/>In order to fulfil the passenger’s concern about the change of his/her schedule, an alarm philosophy was created which is based on which actions the passenger should take in order to make his/her travel as smooth as possible. Four levels of urgency were identified. The lower level of urgency concerns situations where the delay is small and/or it does not change the passenger’s schedule. The next level of urgency concerns situations that the schedule is slightly altered but with no dramatic changes. The high level of urgency concerns situations in which the schedule of the passenger is totally disrupted. Finally, the highest level of urgency includes situations that are harmful for the life of the passenger, such as terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>All the aforementioned the levels of urgency are depicted in the communication system with differences in notification sounds, colours, information and instructions. Each level has an emotional goal that needs to be derived from the passenger. In the lower level the passenger needs to feel calm, in the medium level intrigued, in the high level active and in the last highly active.<br/><br/>The way the message is communicated to the passenger and the compensational additional features are based on the theory of management studies “delivery of bad news”. The message prioritise the information presenting firstly the fact and its basic details, secondly the change of the schedule and the next step of the passenger, thirdly the reason of the delay and the solution and fourthly the further steps the passenger can take. In that way, KLM shows that takes the responsibility to inform honestly the passengers and help them to make the most of their time. <br/><br/>Finally, evaluation user tests were conducted with KLM passengers, testing the perceived criticality of the messages and the derived emotions from the passengers. The results were very positive. The participants were pleased with the message and the amount and kind of information, understanding the criticality of each situation. It is worth mentioning the fact that the result of the NPS of the user test was 55, which is a huge difference from the current score during delays, which it is 16(NPS 2016). Of course, there are some limitations in the user tests and this number should not be considered as the one in real situations. However, this index offers the confidence that a communication system like this will increase the satisfaction levels of the passengers when a delay at the gate occurs.","interaction design; disruption handling; alarm philosophy; KLM; delayed flights","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The cornerstone of continuous integration is the testing step, since it is supposed to protect the system from changes that might disrupt correct behavior. Mutation testing is a method that checks the fault finding capability of a test suite. Current CI settings do not implement a step that checks how thorough the test suite is. <br/><br/>Therefore, the goal of this thesis has been to explore how mutation testing can be applied to changes under analysis in a continuous integration setting. Since there is no infrastructure to support this, in order to conduct our study we developed OPi+, a prototype tool for experimenting the infrastructure required for a continuous mutation testing approach. Using real-world systems for analysis, we give initial evidence of the continuous mutation testing usefulness in terms of costs and benefits when applied to realistic software changes. The empirical study is based on analysis performed on the entire commit history of the popular open source Java Maven systems. <br/><br/>Through our study we defined 5 types of outcomes together with a continuous mutation testing behavior flow and additional analysis that streamlines current mutation testing practices. <br/>We showed not only that mutation testing in a CI environment requires significantly fewer resources but they are also within the limits required by a CI pipeline. Through our study we also identify unmutable code for which we propose appropriate unimplemented operator set. We also study the evolution of surviving mutants with regards to their impact on the systems` technical debt. <br/><br/>In our study, we showed initial evidence that mutation testing can successfully be made compatible with a CI environment. We therefore propose a few ideas that could possibly further streamline continuous mutation testing.<br/><br","mutation testing continuous integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is safe to assume that neither of these ambitions will be reached in time on Texel. Because technical limitations are not necessarily the reason for this, the question why is studied through theories of governance of change. This thesis has two goals. The first goal is to create an analytical framework to analyze processes of governance of change in socio-technical systems. The second is to apply this framework on the socio-technical energy- and water systems on Texel in order to learn about how the governance of change has contributed to the current state of these systems, compared to Texel's ambitions.<br/><br/>What was learned from Texel is that the successfulness of strategies in the governance of change depends on the nature and context of the system. For example: mobilizing people to found energy cooperation TexelEnergie was successful because the energy market in place allowed an opportunity for such an initiative to work. Secondly, the Texel Core Values could be successfully utilized to shift the direction of change from windmills and bio- fermentation to solar energy and energy savings, because the decentralized nature of the system allowed social actors to guide change on their own terms, based on the cultural values of Texel. In contrast, in the water system these strategies would not work because the drinking water market is closed and regulated by governmental actors, meaning that there is no opportunity present for societal actors to mobilize and start producing their own drinking water. In that regard, legitimacy for change is absent since they depend on the support of drinking water company PWN, which is merely concerned with providing a reliable drinking water infrastructure and is legally bound to provide this in the most cost-effective and safe way possible. Hence, they are not interested in changing the existing centralized drinking water system towards a system where drinking water is produced on the island, simply because it is desired by Texel. <br/><br/>This thesis covered a dual case study where the governance of change in the socio-technical energy and water systems on Texel was analyzed. Generalization from single case studies is a controversial topic and requires extrapolation that can never be fully justified because findings are always embedded within a context. In this study, the findings from the previous section are embedded in a specific context that is unique to Texel. Because of this it would be premature to express any generalistic and legitimate conclusions about governance of change in socio-technical systems based on the findings of these case studies alone. Such claims warrant similar analysis of other socio-technical systems, preferably also water and energy systems but in different settings (settings here referring to different locations or communities). This is proposed as topics for future research.<br","Governance of Change; Texel; Strategies; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It can be used as the energy source as well as the storage facility. At some stage, both listed applications require injection of fluid or gas into the subsurface porous media.

For the same reason, it is becoming a popular kind of steel among the automobile industry. It is important to study the bainite transformations to have an explicit knowledge about the same and to design bainitic steels accordingly based on the application which has to be satisfied. This requirement has led to an immense research on the bainitic steels in the recent past. One of the aspects which is studied recently is the behaviour of the transformation kinetics of bainite during the isothermal treatments. Factors like, austenite grain size, chemical composition (Si, Mn and C) and the presence of prior athermal martensite have been found to affect the transformation kinetics of bainite. The presence of prior athermal martensite (PM) has been reported to have an accelerating effect on the transformation kinetics of bainite by few of the authors. The two reasons given for the acceleration by two different school of thoughts are: 1.) due to the creation of additional potential nucleation sites from the martensite-austenite (’-) interfaces with the presence of prior athermal martensite (PM) and 2.) due to the strain induced (through dislocations) in the austenite matrix with the presence of PM. Therefore, further investigations are required to concrete the mechanism responsible for the acceleration. On the other hand, carbon content has been reported to have a decelerating effect on the kinetics of bainite formation due to the reduction in the driving force (based on the thermal stability of austenite). Thus, the effect due to the presence of PM and the effect due to the carbon content have opposite influence on the kinetics. It is important to study the effect of PM on the bainite transformation kinetics for steels with different compositions in order to understand if the alloying elements also have an effect on the kinetics. Having said that the carbon content has an effect on the kinetics, it will be interesting to study the effect of carbon content on the kinetics along with the presence of PM. <br/><br/>The primary goal of the current research is to examine the effect of prior athermal martensite (PM) on the kinetics of bainite transformation in a medium carbon steel (0.57 wt% C). In order to investigate the effect of carbon content, the current study will be compared with the research by A. Navarro-López et al. 1 which was on a low carbon steel (0.2 wt% C). There is clear evidence from the results of the current study that there is a competition between the decelerating effect of carbon content and the accelerating effect of PM at the beginning of the isothermal transformation. The results show that the carbon content has a significant role on the intensity of the acceleration effect due to the presence of prior athermal martensite.","prior athermal martensite; bainitic ferrite; austenite decomposition; isothermal treatments; bainite transformation kinetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-29","","","","","",""

Thus, a battery withstable behaviour, longer lifetime and less maintenance as well as a lower price is highly desired in SHSs. Withthe narrow choices on economical commercial battery technologies, there is another approach to improve thebattery behaviour in SHSs.This thesis is aiming at exploring a solution from usage perspective to maintain the battery behaviour in long-term, in SHSs. In order to achieve the goal, a tool and a method were proposed to provide a practical solutionfor battery performance preservation in SHSs.In this study, two battery technologies which are commonly applied in SHSs were explored: the LiFePO 4battery and the Valve Regulated Lead-acid batteryFirstly, an accurate battery dynamic model based on the electrical equivalent circuit was constructed for bothbattery technologies separately. Series of experiments were performed to obtain the relevant parameters. This model was built for low current applications, which is lower than 1 C, typically suitable for SHS applications.This model was on battery cell level and with a great accuracy with a &lt; 2% errorSecondly, a performance based battery lifetime prediction model was built, and the battery capacity wasselected as the index of the ageing process. The modelling was achieved by applying a new concept, which isthe rate of normalised capacity fading, with respect to capacity throughput. Another series of experiments wereoperated for the exploration of the relationship between stress factors and the rate of battery ageing. Theexperimental data is the foundation of the battery lifetime model.Thirdly, a usage guideline for each battery technology was proposed by analysing the lifetime test data. Thenone practical usage guideline application method was simulated. The application of the usage guideline has anoticeable improvement in the battery behaviour in long term scale.In conclusion, the modelling of the battery including both dynamic behaviour as well as lifetime predictionprovides a tool for future exploration. With this tool, the design and sizing of the battery storage system, as wellas the management of appropriate battery usage in SHS would be easier.

This hampers any downstream analysis, such as allele specific expression analysis, gene association studies or population genetics. Current haplotype assembly methods focus on phasing single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and are limited in their ability to deal with larger and structural variants.<br/><br/>The third generation sequencing platforms, like the PacBio RS II or the Oxford Nanopore, make long read sequencing affordable. In this work we explore a novel method using long reads and an assembly graph to phase haplotypes.

Predictions for the automation equipment except for the film removal tool where able to be obtained through literature and interviews with experts in the industry. Due to the lack of available literature information fitting this specific application, on the protective film removal process, a large proportion of this project was dedicated to the development of this tool. In contrast to previous developments, this project uses shock cooling as a solution to detach the protective film from the prepreg.<br/>Implementation of a P&amp;P cell concept was further investigated by the ability of the robot to reach all equipment without affecting the work flow throughout the Rondal workshop.

In order to align the manual and the automation process effectively, common mechanized process steps have been integrated for the use of both approaches.<br/>The effectiveness of the chosen automation system was demonstrated by analysing cost and time statistics of the on-site process, as well as observations of a computer-assisted process simulation. As a result, lead time saving of up to 5 work days per product type as well as labour time reduction of up to 50% were determined. However, the economic analysis showed that the investment into the P&amp;P automation system is not feasible given the current volume of production.

Tall wind turbines require measurements above typical measurement mast height. As tall measurement masts are expensive and cumbersome to install, wind measurements at hub height are scarce. Currently, the use of lidars in wind measurement campaigns is increasing. Lidars provide wind measurements over the full wind turbine rotor, but lidars are not always available for an extended period. This thesis investigates the possibility of applying the measure-correlate-predict (MCP) method to short-term lidar measurements in order to extrapolate wind shear statistics.<br/><br/>The first step was to compare the wind shear derived from lidar measurements with wind shear derived from mast measurements because the instruments have a different measurement principle.

However, given current progress, this represents an oversight when approaching the energy transition – in particular, due to the large proportion of the urban population living in cities smaller than 500,000 people. As a result, the main question of this study is: What are good practices for Dutch SMCs with populations between 50,000-250,000 and are there demonstrable effects linking them to achieving climate targets? In this thesis, I analyzed good practices to achieve climate mitigation targets from 13 Dutch municipalities and assessed what correlations are possible linking good practice to emissions reductions using both quantitative and qualitative indicators. I found that there are several good practices available to local governments implemented. Furthermore, the governance mode of these good practices reflected mainly ‘governing by enabling’, however it was found that within municipal climate documents that other forms of governance were also prevalent and widely used. Finally, it was found that current monitoring data is insufficient to link those implemented good practices to municipal emissions reductions.","Local Climate Action; Climate Mitigation; Good Practice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-15","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The main research question was to find out if the lifetime of the irrigation system can be extended. Production process was investigated from various angles in search of causes and patterns of solution flow blockages due to calcium sulfate precipitation which was identified as the main reason of clogging. Large number of process data was statistically analyzed. Clear correlation between the PLS temperature and calcium concentration in the solution was drawn and it was found that it is far different from any other research presented. Calcium solubility was experimentally tested – solution was cooled down to approx. 4 °C and agitated daily. Results were unclear, however, on average, calcium concentration decreased by approx. 100 mg/L. The ambiguity of the initial solubility trials led to designing a new experiment. Investigation of the system pointed out critical points and allowed for the formulation of clogging control strategy. Primary calcium sources were found within the ore and metals recovery plant; sulfate is produced during bioleaching process and added to the solution with sulfuric acid – pH control. Forced precipitation of gypsum was proposed as the most viable solution. Conceptual precipitation pond was proposed based on seeded batch crystallization of gypsum. Moreover, clogging was found more prominent in areas with lower pressure head thus redesigning of the irrigation system was suggested along with implementing pulsating pressure. The outcomes of this study set a new direction for the company to counter calcium precipitation problem.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","63°58'30.6""N 28°00'31.4""E"

Hence, necessitating more in-depth hydrodynamic analyses. Increasing size and weight of these floating structures together with industry demands have led to unsuitability of existing models – which make use of rigid body (no hydroelasticity) assumptions. This, in addition to other reservations about current practices, has led to the need for more realistic formulations of the interaction between fluids and our offshore structures, taking hydroelasticity into account. Extreme wave impacts, which are responsible for severe damage of offshore structures, have for a long period been only studied with experimental methods, as non-linear nature of the complex wave kinematics make solutions not straightforward. More recent advancements have seen the development of numerical techniques and programs, based on the Navier-Stokes equations, to better understand extreme waves and impacts on offshore structures.<br/><br/>This thesis focuses on the topic of experimental validation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in ComMotion – an advancement in the ComFLOW program (an improved Volume of Fluid (iVOF) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code) to capture motion of flexible structures in the presence of free surface effects and a two-way coupling between the fluid and the structure. This has led to the need to provide reliable data for validation purposes. The research is conducted in continuation of the studies carried out by Rizos (2016) in which an electromagnetic drive linear motor produced noise and variable amplitude enforcement obtained in the analyzed results, amidst other uncertainties in the measurement techniques used. The current methodology principally makes use of a different motion technique – rotary to linear motion to obtain more reliable data.<br/><br/>Firstly, rotary to linear motion was chosen (motivated from the internal combustion engine of an automobile) and then verified computationally with analytical derivations. The experiments were then designed, with the initial step being to verify the said linear motion. A sensitivity of the motion signal to weights in the system was carried out. Further, the experiment designed made use of a latex rubber membrane, applied with a clamped boundary condition at the bottom of a partially-filled rigid cylindrical structure. Tension existing in the membrane, due to water columns above it, was analytically obtained, as complete knowledge of system parameters was crucial. Linear oscillatory motion at the end of the converted rotary motion was applied to the fluid-structure system. Motion signals were obtained – rigid body measurements, to subtract them from the membrane motion measurements obtained. Motion measurements were acquired with laser triangulation displacement devices and a force transducer was used to monitor applied forces in the plunger during the experiments. The output of the transducer can offer validation data to the FSI solver.<br/><br/>Membrane measurements were taken at half radius at a 30° step over a 180° span, and at the centre. This was in a bid to capture maximum deflections of the membrane, as interest was to obtain the coupled frequency mode shape. Finally, the obtained membrane motion data were analysed to prove their reliability, and to draw conclusions from them. Volume (of liquid), frequency and polar dependence analyses were carried out. Recommendations were subsequently outlined, for future research.","fluid-structure interaction; Experimental study; ComFLOW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

A more important reason is the country’s pre-crisis economic stagnation which had started long before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and which had put Italy in a relatively disadvantageous position when the crisis happened. To investigate this secular stagnation of economic growth in the Italian case, this study looks into potential output growth as determined by the growth in Total Factor Productivity, or TFP growth. This report first scrutinizes the concept of TFP growth and shows that it can be defined in three ways: (i) as a “residual”, following Solow’s work; (ii) as weighted average factor productivity growth; and (iii) and as weighted average factor payment growth. We utilize “shift-share” analysis to dissemble labor productivity growth into two components: “within-“ and “between-sector” labor productivity growth. Last, we construct economic model of secular stagnation of TFP growth in the Italian economy. We use all three definitions and show that that aggregate Italian TFP growth has been stagnating since the country’s peak growth in 1973. Our findings show that Italian economy has been suffering predominantly by the secular stagnation in its within-sector labor productivity. By analyzing the evidence on the country’s long-run real wage between dynamic and stagnant sectors, we find that real wage growth rates have been declining across the board as well. Thus, we find no support for Italy of the “cost disease” that Baumol predicted, i.e. the rise in the relative price of the services, the sector that is stagnant in terms of productivity growth. Using 2SLS regression analysis, our economic model shows that real wage growth and final demand growth can partly define the phenomenon of secular stagnation of TFP growth in the Italian economy.","Economic output; stagnation; secular stagnation; labor productivity; total factor productivity; wage growth; demand growth; union density; employment protection; investement; research and development; EU KLEMS; two-stage linear regression; Baumol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Sexual reproductive health is one of these health areas in which the public health sector is not meeting the growing demand and it is defined as unmet need for family planning. To address this need, international agencies have been operating in the developing world with the aim of making sexual reproductive health services accessible to everyone while assuring good quality. Health franchising is a healthcare service delivery model that is operated by international NGOs and private sector in these regions. As a type of social franchising, health franchising uses commercial franchising mechanisms in order to generate social welfare. The business model of health franchising is based on creating a network of franchisees, utilizing the existing private clinics while providing them with subsidized commodities, training, monitoring, promotion of the network and incentives. In return, the franchisees are promising to stay loyal to the franchisor’s standards and periodically report their performance. Although health-franchising programs have been active and constantly expanding their operations, there are limited studies on the business model and its cost effectiveness. This study aims to explore health franchising, the business model, performance and cost effectiveness in comparison to other healthcare service delivery models in the developing world. For this purpose, a cost effectiveness analysis is conducted on the operations of a health franchising program to calculate the input/output ratio in terms of cost per health impact generated. The value adding mechanisms and impact of health franchising are further discussed through interviews. Findings are interpreted into a set of practical recommendations and an experiment blueprint for a standardized evaluation of health franchising programs. Findings from the case of PSI Myanmar suggest that the cost effectiveness ratio of health franchising is within the limits of similar health service delivery models in the developing world. Apart from its cost-effectiveness, there are other factors such as quality, perception of comfort from the patients and the robust supply chain that make this business model successful in the context it operates.","health franchising; sexual reproductive health; family planning; developing countries; cost effectiveness analysis; Myanmar; social franchising","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The latter theory includes roughness at all length scales as well as long range elastic interactions. However, it is exact only at full contact conditions, which are often met by rubbers but not by metals. With metals in mind, we here use Green’s function molecular dynamics (GFMD) simulations to assess the validity of Persson’s theory at small loads, therefore small contact areas. GFMD is a boundary-value method which allows for ultra fine discretization of rough surfaces since it is computationally very efficient, and treats interfacial contact using interatomic potentials. To date, the GFMD method was only used in 3-D for modelling the normal loading of rough elastic semi-infinite incompressible (Poisson's ratio = 0.5) solids. In this work we extend GFMD in order to model both normal and tangential loading of rough solids with finite height and generic elastic properties. GFMD is then used to numerically calculate the proportionality constant κ between the area of real contact ar and nominal pressure p for the contact between a compressible linear elastic solid and a rough rigid punch. The numerically calculated value of the proportionality constant k is then extrapolated to the thermodynamic, fractal and continuum (TFC) limit. Results are then compared with that of the other analytical models.","GFMD; continuum limit; fractal limit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","","",""

(mentor); Alijani, F. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","A common structural design verification is to conduct modal analysis and to ensure that the vibration modes of the structure do not get harmonically excited during operation. Since the modal frequencies are dependent on the mass and stiffness properties of the structure, they are an influencing factor in the design optimization. Modal frequencies are obtainable using eigenvalue analysis after linearization approximations in the restoring force terms of the governing equation of motion. While this approximation is valid for lower loads, it is not acceptable for strong nonlinear vibrations. A measurable shift in the modal frequency is observable when the amplitude of vibrations is in the order of the thickness of the vibrating structure. This phenomenon is more pronounced in thin walled and flexible structures where the vibration amplitudes can exceed the linear threshold relatively more easily. <br/><br/>A credible approach in computation of nonlinear modes is the utilization of parametric continuation schemes for generating nonlinear frequency-amplitude response. However, utilization of this scheme with a large degree of freedom model is a computationally intensive approach which necessitate the development of reduced order models. A model reduction method in the finite element framework, termed as Hamiltonian Reduced Order Model (ROM), has been recently developed at Delft University of Technology. The present study is conducted for the experimental validation of the ROM. Governing equations of motion of a stiffened plate have been derived using the Hamiltonian ROM and the nonlinear frequency response has been generated using a continuation scheme. For validation, experiments have been conducted using the Laser Doppler Vibrometer to obtain similar frequency response curves. A comparison of the numerical and the experimental results shows excellent agreement. Furthermore, accurate numerical response is obtainable using only a single degree of freedom in the reduced order model which proves the effectiveness of the Hamiltonian ROM. The results also demonstrate the necessity of a nonlinear damping model for obtaining comparable results.<br","nonlinear modes; reduced order model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This was the central question in this research. It is found that the design of the contract is basically abandoned. The contract is designed to have few inter-organizational relations, issues should be solved between counterparts which can each call upon their own organization. In practice there is a network of relations between Fluor and IREM. The organization has been divided into 5 clusters, based on which employees are expected to be most interrelated according to the contract’s design. These people (from the same clusters) are in practice, however, not most interrelated which underpins the conclusion, based on the number of ties, that a network structure is in place and that the design mentioned above is abandoned. An other conclusion is that the open communication factors (responsiveness, effectiveness and energy) could be improved between the construction- and office-cluster, within the construction-cluster (3 persons in particular) and one person in the preparation-cluster. After analyzing the perceptions about the collaboration between Fluor and IREM at these improvement areas, several trends have been identified. It has been found that people who consider collaborative practices and relational attitudes to be few or low, often respond slower when issues arise, have a lower conversation effectiveness and drain energy from their interlocutor. A trend has also been observed between their perception of teamworking quality and their responsiveness and effectiveness. The direction of this trend can however not be determined based on this research’s data, it could be self-enforcing. Based on the above mentioned conclusions, recommendations can be made on how to improve the collaboration between the general contractor and subcontractor. The above mentioned result have been gathered by conducting a valued social network analysis (SNA) and executing (and thereby testing) the relational capability (RECAP) tool of Suprapto (2016) in a setting between general contractor and subcontractor. Based on the results of the RECAP tool, it couldn’t be concluded that there are no significant differences between the clusters’ perceptions on collaboration. This, and the conclusion that the cluster structure is abandoned, lead to the conclusion that effort to increase collaboration, project performance and likelihood of relationship continuity, should be directed on company level.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

In common practice, engineers perform deterministic analyses according to design standards as Eurocode 7, where the uncertainties are taken into account through partial factors for loads and soil properties to attain certain specified target reliabilities. Forcomplexsoilstructureinteractionproblems, partialfactormethodis difficult to adopt, as the design standards consider geotechnical standards with singlefailuremechanism. ThisisespeciallyproblematicforUltimateLimitstatedesigns where both stiffness and strength properties are dominant. With the advent of limit state design philosophy in Eurocodes, the use of reliability methods in Finite Element Analysis for complex situations has become more and more of interest. Reliability analyses allow to explicitly define the single uncertainties in the model by using an appropriate probabilistic distribution for each source of uncertainty. The reliability index and the probability of failure with respect to a predefined condition are calculated. The problem with using reliability based probabilistic design is the absence of simple computational approaches that can be easily implemented. MonteCarlosimulationsarecommonly usedto solvesoil structureinteraction problems. For a large and complex soil-structure interaction problem, it is computationally intensive to complete even a single run. This practical disadvantage can be solved only by a computationally efficient method. A special purpose application to perform probabilistic analysis in PLAXIS 2D, called PROBANA has been recently developed at Plaxis B.V. PROBANA performs direct probabilistic calculations in the finite element framework, using First Order Reliability Method or Monte Carlo Method. In this thesis, PROBANA (FORM) is used to perform reliability analysis for three benchmarks, and the results from PROBANA – FORM are compared with Point Estimate Method (PEM) and other stochastic Methods. The results from FORM are found to be comparable with that of PEM. It is concludedthatPEMislessaccurateduetoassumptionsmadebyPEMintheunderlying output distribution and FORM is more accurate and practical as it is computationally less intensive compared to other stochastic methods such as the Monte Carlo analysis. An extensive comparison of the reliability based method with Eurocode design method shows possibilities to implement reliability methods with EC7. One such approach is proposed, and demonstrated with the benchmarks.","Reliability; ULS; Probabilisitic analysis; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better understand the effects of cyclic loading on the strength of sea ice, cyclic loading tests have been conducted at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). In addition, the corresponding ice behaviour was modelled based on Cole (1995), thereby describing the viscoelastic response of saline ice subjected to a cyclic stress. The aim of this study was to design and execute a reproducible experimental campaign for saline ice subjected to a cyclic compression, and to model the stress-strain relationship of the ice. Specifically, the effects of frequency and displacement amplitude were studied.<br/>The laboratory-grown saline ice was frozen from a mixture of sea water and fresh water with a salinity of approximately 8. The structure was classified as S2 columnar ice through inspection of thin sections. The specimens were retrieved from horizontal and vertical cylindrical cores. The porosities of the specimens ranged from 22 to 34 ppt and the salinities from 2 to 4. The experiments were performed by applying a sinusoidal varying uniaxial displacement of one piston of the loading frame using a stepper engine. An initial compressive load (equivalent to 1 MPa) was reached by applying a constant strain rate.<br/>The model uses kinematics to describe the ice behaviour, which is explained by the line defaults in the ice lattice, so-called dislocations. The input parameters of the model are the central relaxation time of dislocation relaxation, the dislocation density and an empirically derived distribution factor. The model results were given by the amplitude and phase lag of the steady-state stress response for an applied sinusoidal strain.<br/>The experimental campaign proved to be reproducible and demonstrated the stress response of saline ice subjected to a cyclic compression well. However, some improvements of the experiments are recommended; most importantly, a higher resolution of the strain sensors and more stringent displacement control, such that the input strain can be defined. The results from the experiments furthermore showed a dependence of the energy dissipation on the loading frequencies, as well as a considerable influence of stress relaxation on specifically the first cycle of the tests.<br/>To compare the tests and the model, the strain signal was filtered to remove the influence of the strain sensor location. The parameter used to compare the experimental results to the model was the loss compliance, which describes the energy dissipation per load cycle and is derived from the area per loop of the stress-strain curve. A discernible trend was an apparent increase in the loss compliance for an increasing frequency or per consecutive test, which may be caused by an increase of the dislocation density. <br/>In conclusion, the experimental method provides a successful experimental campaign that demonstrates the energy dissipation per cycle. The model provides solid results for the steady-state response of saline ice subjected to cyclic compression.<br/><br","cyclic compression; sea ice; dislocations; experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This is transition is currently being led by making the energy sector more sustainable by shifting to renewable energy sources from fossil fuel sources at a steady pace. However, there seems to be increasing recognition that the steady pace may not be fast enough. Therefore, there are many cities, countries, organizations that are coming out in support of a 100% renewable energy transition. There is sufficient attention given to this the endeavour of transitioning in developed nations and major developing nations. However, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have historically lagged behind in proceeding with this transition even though they are arguably going to be the most severely affected by the inaction. Majority of SIDS energy comes from imported oil products. As we speak there are islands disappearing because of sea level rise. That said islands present an interesting geographical scope to analyse for an energy transition because of their unique challenges. These challenges stem from their isolated location and small size; which leads to high energy prices, lack of economy of scale and this is worsened by their potential vulnerability to environmental catastrophes. In recent years, however, there has been more attention given to SIDS and their issues. This is marked by Fiji being the President of COP23, and the COP23 paying special attention to SIDS. Following this recent surge in attention, many islands have set ambitious targets to pursue for the transition yet their execution has been bleak. It is astonishing that even though islands have the most renewable energy potential they have made limited progress, literature very widely states that the lack of economy of scale, technical knowledge and expertise, political will and lack of human capacity are leading causes and all of this leads to a larger risk perception leading to lack of investments. However the literature on islands transitioning is concentrated on either on a combination of technological, economical or societal issues and is geographically concentrated on the Pacific and Mediterranean islands.","Backcasting; Quick Scan; Curacao; Grenada; Caribbean; 100% Renewable Energy; PESTEL; Energy Transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore very important to develop a robust simulation model that captures the flow of various components present in different phases and the associated thermodynamic and chemical interactions. A compositional formulation is a reliable option for understanding these complex subsurface processes. However, this type of model has a great computational cost, since the number of equations (nc) that needs to be solved in each grid block increases proportionally with the number of components employed.<br/>The solution of the multicomponent multiphase flow problem is obtained by solving the associated nonlinear governing equation describing the conservation of mass, thereby determining the pressure (P) and compositional changes (Z) of the system. On the other hand, an Equation of state (EoS) model is employed to describe the phase behavior of the system, which in turn is accomplished in two stages: Phase stability test - to identify the existence of number of phase in a particular grid cell, and Flash calculation - to determine the split fraction of components amongst the phases present. The aforesaid procedure is referred as the standard EoS based approach to solve compositional problem and they are generally arduous.<br/>In previous works, a compositional-space parameterization approach was proposed to speed up the phase-behavior calculations by replacing the flash calculation with interpolations in the parameter space of the problem. The phase behavior of gas-injection processes is predominantly controlled by the properties of the two key tie-lines that extend through the initial and the injection compositions, and hence it is convenient to parameterize the problem based on these two tie-lines. It has also been proven that the projection of composition solution onto the full tie-line space is invariant to the hydrodynamic property of the compositional system.<br/>Here we utilize this technique to develop a multiscale reconstruction of compositional transport. Two types of prolongation operators are defined based on the local saturation history, with each having different computational complexities. In the first stage, a fine scale prolongation operator is implemented on a modified conservation equation with the objective of reconstructing the leading and trailing shock positions in space. Once the position of shocks are identified, the solution lying in the regions outside the shock can be solved on a coarse-scale mesh, since the structure of the transport solution outside of the two-phase region is relatively simple. Later, the fine scale projection of this coarse solution is carried out using the constant prolongation operator. The solution for nc components lying in between leading and trailing shocks is reconstructed by solving just two equations. The proposed reconstruction strategy results in coarsening of the compositional problem, both in space and representation. By this way, the simulation time is appreciably reduced by several folds without significant loss in accuracy of the results. Also, the proposed multiscale technique is evaluated by comparing them with a suitable upscaling methodology, since they are generally characterized by an affable framework of implementation and one of the most widely sought out ways to enhance computational efficiency.","reservoir simulation; composition; Nonlinear Equations; Numerical Mathematics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

The Innovation Management and Mobility team within the Research and Advanced Engineering department in Aachen is seeking and learning to adopt new approaches to research and design. Service innovation is proposed as a user-centered design methodology to help the team develop mobility solutions. Within Ford, service innovation is a multi-disciplinary design approach focused on creating and developing mobility solutions from a holistic user perspective. A multi-disciplinary design approach Service innovation is a design approach in which designers are able to facilitate and execute the process. They can help to bridge research, design and engineering by inviting all stakeholders in the process. Creating mobility solutions Service innovation is an approach that balances user, technology and business aspects of a concept to create a valuable and feasible solution.

This helped the team to put users more central in their innovation efforts. A service innovation toolkit. The created toolkit helps the team to structure the innovation process and apply the methodology in a diverse set of projects. A manual is designed as reference guide for the methodology, methods and tools and the templates and posters are designed to help facilitate the innovation process in specific projects. This helps Ford put users more central in their innovation efforts and create valuable and meaningful solutions for real people. <b>Recommendations: </b>To further develop the user-centered mindset within Ford, I propose to introduce other departments to service innovation and the user-centered design methodology.

This can be extremely complicated, especially for industries like the healthcare industry involving multiple stakeholders, a wide supply chain and producing technology for a very specific use. These are just some of the reasons why the healthcare industry lags behind other industry fields when it comes to sustainable development. Within the healthcare industry supply chain, the medical device manufacturers play the major role when it comes to determine the impacts medical systems have on ecosystem and society. Indeed, by providing innovative sustainable solutions they can contribute to social welfare, healthcare and environmental protection from degradation. Therefore, the scope of this research will be limited to explore the inter dependencies between the medical device manufacturers and sustainable development. To this end, a maturity model will be designed as a practical tool to assess the level of sustainability maturity of the medical device organisations’ supply chain. The maturity model will be designed in such a way to favour a better understanding of the concept of Sustainable Supply Chain Management, offering a detailed overview of sustainability aspects and bottom-line indicators.

In the coming years, the use of orthopaedic implants is expected to increase and subsequently the need to encounter the problems of poor osseointegration and implant-associated infection (IAI) is augmented. The unsuccessful implantation of an orthopaedic or dental implant has a considerable economic impact on the healthcare system and at the same time downgrades the quality of the patient’s life. Thus, the development of multifunctional surfaces that promote osseointegration and, at the same time, prevent IAI is needed. In addition, the advances in additively manufacturing techniques such as selective laser melting (SLM) enables the fabrication of customised implants with mechanical properties matching those of native bone tissue. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the synthesis of multifunctional surfaces on additively manufactured Ti6Al4V implants by the incorporation of strontium and silver nanoparticles (Ag NP).<br/><br/>Methods. Porous Ti6Al4V implants were designed and synthesised by the additive manufacturing process SLM. Thereafter, a titanium oxide layer was formed on the surface of the implants by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) with electrolytes loaded with different concentrations of strontium and Ag NP in order to assess the effect of strontium on the biological performance and biomaterial properties. The surface morphology was analysed by scanning electron and optical microscopy, the chemical composition by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and the phase composition by X‑ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the strontium and silver ion release were studied up to 1 month by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The response of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) on the multifunctional surfaces was evaluated by the metabolic and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Furthermore, the leachable antibacterial properties were assessed against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).<br/><br/>Results. The surface of additively manufactured titanium implants was modified by PEO resulting in a TiO2 layer with interconnected porosity in which strontium in different concentrations and Ag NP were incorporated. The presence of strontium and Ag NP was confirmed by EDS and the release of strontium and silver ions after 1 month by ICP-OES. Additionally, XRD analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyapatite and strontium calcium phosphate phases. Furthermore, the addition of strontium revealed a biphasic effect on the metabolic and ALP activity of hMSCs. At lower concentration, the metabolic and ALP activity were hindered, while at high concentration no beneficial effect was observed. The antibacterial leaching activity test showed that the inhibition area was enlarged after the incorporation of strontium.<br/><br/>Conclusions. The surface of porous additively manufactured implants was successfully modified by PEO incorporating strontium and Ag NP. Furthermore, the weight percentage of strontium incorporated in the TiO2 layer was proportional to strontium concentration in the electrolyte while strontium phases formed at higher strontium concentrations. Moreover, the antibacterial properties were not hindered by the addition of strontium. Although the results did not show an enhancement of the biological performance in terms of biocompatibility and osteogenic activity, further research about the optimal concentration of strontium could improve the biological performance of additively manufactured implants.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-28","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The working practice changes and entails an increasing interaction of humans with technology. At the same time, from across society actors exert growing pressure on organisations to uphold accountability and other social values. Industry 4.0 rises concerns over the organisation's current ability to support employee well-being. Here, well-being refers to the quality of an employee's working experience. In addition to an adequate physical and cognitive workload when performing tasks, factors influencing well-being include continuous competency development, synchronisation of one's work with that of colleagues, and recognition of one's contribution to the purpose of the organisation. Responsible Innovation, as a lens to improve the innovation process and anticipate social concerns such as that of well-being, remains appropriate for decision-making in governmental and academic settings. However, its use in industry is underrepresented and still unfamiliar to managers. This thesis project is conducted in collaboration with Nokia Solutions \&amp; Networks. The project explores how can Responsible Innovation benefit the employee well-being in the Transformation 4.0 of the associated company? The project follows a Trailing Research approach. This is similar to action-research, but it is executed in only one cycle and its goal is not to trigger change. The organisation does not have the explicit request to address a problem. Instead, it commissions this study in order to explore possible impact of Industry 4.0 on their current mode of operations. Therefore, the student-researcher trails the transformation inside the organisation during a 5-month research stay. Change brought by the design, execution, and evaluation of new digitisation projects is followed closely. From interviews to 9 practitioners across Human Resources, Change Management, Leadership \&amp; Talent, Demand Planning and Manufacturing groups, next to documentation analysis and contextual observation, a single case study with two embedded units of analysis---Business and Factory---is created. The analysis results in the 9 Areas of Inquiry. These suggest a need to review current efforts in the organisation. The areas include a review: on traditional learning pillars; on the visibility of subject-experts across units and on current reward schemes; on the opportunity for rank-and-file to increase their outward-looking capability; on the way how groups capture and share lessons and how the impact of sharing is measured; on the understanding and monitoring of various forms of leadership; on the opportunity for the central change management group to transfer value to project groups in lower-levels; on employees' perception of the role of the continuous improvement function and how its methodologies are being transferred to the daily work of project groups; on the anticipation activities of more abstract future requirements for new tools; and on the mapping the evolving and diverse motivations of employees. Responsible Innovation brings its value by acting as a lens through which the aforementioned areas should be studied. This thesis recommends a first step to explore these areas.

These can be used to evaluate activities and adapt future ones. This is recommended as an extension of the manager's tool-set in decision-making pertaining to change.

A pipe rack is a steel structure which is constructed to efficiently place and support multiple levels of pipelines for industrial plants such as refinery plants, chemical plants or power plants.<br/><br/>The Modular Execution Strategy aims at relocating parts of fabrication and assembly activities of a pipe rack construction to potentially low cost locations at which the conditions for fabrication and assembly activities are more favorable. The pre-assembled pipe racks will be transported to the onshore installation site by a vessel, which results in sea-transport design requirements (due to vessel motions) in addition to the in-place design.<br/> <br/>Three options of different configuration for MES were considered. The first option is to transport only upper parts of the pipe racks without their bottom columns and assemble the bottom columns at the installation site. The second option is to transport the complete pipe racks including bottom columns which are stiffened by temporary bracings. The last option is to transport complete pipe racks with strengthened columns having a larger profile dimensions.<br/><br/>In order to consider various sizes of pipe racks, 27-representative configurations of pipe racks of the project were selected. These pipe racks were designed to withstand in-place loadings and sea-transport loadings with a quasi-static analysis method. The in-place loadings are weight of pipe lines and wind force. The sea-transport loadings are forces due to motions of a vessel and critical sea-transport loadings come from roll + heave and pitch + heave. Quantities of steel for each option were found after completion of the design. Subsequently, the quantities were translated into steel work cost which includes procurement, fabrication, assembly and installation costs of steel work.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, it was found that considering the quantities and costs of steel work for the project, option 1 (transport the pipe racks without columns) is the most cost effective solution. If pinned supports are used at the vessel deck, which are more favorable for the company, it was calculated that option 1 requires, on average, 15% and 30% less cost than option 2 and option 3 respectively. For clamped supported conditions, option 1 still requires 15% less cost than both option 2 and option 3.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it was demonstrated by performing a resonance check and a dynamic analysis for a tall two-dimensional frame, that a quasi-static analysis method could be used to assess the sea-transport loadings. It was found that there is very low possibility of resonance and only low dynamic amplification. <br/><br/>In this thesis, the focus has been on differences in the structural configurations. Other aspects, some of which may be difficult to express in cost terms such as logistical difficulty, safety/risk, and project schedule, were not taken into account. Therefore, in order to verify the attractiveness of each option in more detail, it is suggested to also make a complete assessment of those mentioned aspects.<br","Steel Structure; Sea-transport; Pipe Rack; Modular Construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data show that humanitarian organizations spend a consistent amount of their budgets for logistics and supply chain-related activities. Although their supply chains present a potential for improvement, humanitarian organizations often lack the internal skills and expertise to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of logistics operations. The existing literature dealing with the improvement of humanitarian logistics mostly focuses on the perspective of humanitarian organizations. This thesis looks at the system from a novel perspective, taking logistics consultants as its primary unit of analysis. The departure point of this research is the idea that consulting projects constitute a mean for solving logistics issues. Given this goal, logistics consultants often struggle with the management and measurement of their service performance. HELP Logistics, a foundation operating in this sector, has been facing this situation, driving the need for a solution. Available literature on logistics consulting provides some frameworks to evaluate the performance of interventions, but to date, there is no study that addresses this issue for the humanitarian space. This research aims to fill this gap, analysing and measuring the impact of consulting services on the logistics performance of humanitarian organizations. To do so, the action research (AR) approach is adopted. This methodology is suitable to investigate and encourage changes within organizations. Four main stages can be distinguished in AR: (i) identification of research questions; (ii) gathering of information to answer the questions; (iii) analysis and interpretation of information; (iv) sharing of results with participants. Findings elaborate on the challenges and best practices in relation to the impact of logistics consulting in the humanitarian sector. The research output is a conceptual framework for impact creation through logistics consulting for humanitarian organizations, supported by a set of relevant key performance indicators (KPIs). These results contribute to the existing scientific knowledge on the issue, while providing tools that can be applied by interested practitioners.","logistics consulting; humanitarian logistics; performance management; performance measurement; conceptual framework; key performance indicators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainty in soil can be attributed to its inherent variability, as well as sources of error encountered while estimating the magnitude of its properties. The modelling of these uncertainties will produce more meaningful solutions when evaluating stability. This is especially relevant when quantifying the probability and risk associated with a rare event of failure.<br/><br/>An uncertainty framework is implemented in this report to evaluate improbable slope failure. A slope stability program using a modified subset simulation approach is expanded to account for cross-correlation between cohesion, friction angle and unit weight of soil. The mean of the three soil properties and their correlation coefficients are treated as random variables in the analysis. A parametric study is performed to evaluate the influence of the mean and correlation coefficients of these properties on the probability of failure. The influence of randomising these properties is also evaluated in the analysis. The implemented method is applied for a practical slope example, based on values reported in literature for the expected variability in the mentioned soil properties. <br/><br/>Results demonstrate that modelling the mean of C, phi and gamma as a random variable leads to a significant increase in the probability of failure for a slope. While treating the correlation coefficients as random in the analysis will lead to very little changes in the outcome, some generated correlation matrices may lead to a notable decrease in probability of failure. The stability of the slope is heavily influenced by the input parameters used in the analysis. Furthermore, a proper choice for coefficient of variation of each property and the horizontal and vertical scales of fluctuation is necessary to avoid inaccurate results in the analysis. Other inputs investigated include the type of distribution for each soil property and the range of possible values for their means. Different distribution types are tested in the analysis to identify which of these properly model the variability in the parameter.<br/><br/>By evaluating generated samples within each subset level, it is evident that a combination of low mean values for C and positive correlation between phi and gamma is required for failure at low probability of failure levels. Although the influence of set means of C, phi and gamma on the calculated probability of failure is similar, the same conclusion cannot be made when the means of the properties are random. At low probability of failure levels, the outcome is very sensitive to changes in the minimum possible value for C and less to changes in phi and gamma. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the mode of failure may be overestimated when analysing stability by reducing the strength of the slope. Shallow failures are encountered when slope is failing under a strength reduction factor of 1, which is a more likely mode of failure in spatially variable soil.","Slope Stability; Subset Simulation; Improbable; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome this, different active learning methodologies have been used in the past. Active learning keeps the students busy and engaged throughout the lecture. It breaks the lecture into certain time intervals by intermixing breaks, demonstrations and questions after each interval. For using active learning, clickers and laptops are commonly used in higher education classroom. Most experiments in higher education classroom studying different characteristics of students like learning performance and attention, use clickers and laptop. But, most of these experiments are in a controlled setting, not scalable and compromise the privacy of students. We overcome these problems in an active learning setup in the higher education classroom where we use a web-mediated teaching tool called ASQ. ASQ is a web application that helps to give presentation in a classroom where the presenter has control over the flow of the presentation. ASQ also allows the presenter to interleave the presentation with questions, videos and other interactive JavaScript components. Anyone can anonymously join a presentation in ASQ using a web browser. ASQ tracks the activity of every student interaction by generating event logs each second. In the previous work using ASQ, it has been shown that these logs could be used to infer the attention level of students in the classroom. The goal of this thesis is to gather insights about the fine-grained study behaviour of students in a higher education classroom by analyzing these event logs.<br/><br/>We investigate (i) the effect of lecture elements (like the difficulty, relative positioning and spacing of questions; and duration of discussion in the slides) on study behaviour (like attention level, performance and reaction time while answering questions) of students; (ii) the relationship that might exist between attention percentage of students and their participation in the in-class questions; (iii) if students are taking external help when answering questions during the lecture and the relationship that might exist between their tendency to take external help with the difficulty of questions. We conduct our study in a classroom of around 300 students, for 15 lectures in the Web and Database Technology course at TU Delft taught by 2 instructors.

However, we do not find significant effect of difficulty of questions on performance and reaction time of students while answering these questions. We also find significant effect that students with more attention percentage participate more in the in-class questions.

This is the reason why many companies and universities migrate their network to SDN, there will be more SDN network in the future. Yet SDN network mainly depends on the controller in the control plane. Hence, SDN controller robustness becomes an important issue, because a controller failure will result to a network outage.<br/><br/>OpenFlow is arguably the standard protocol for SDN network. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the robustness of the OpenFlow control plane. Several open source controllers such as OpenMul, Floodlight, Opendaylight, and ONOS have multiple controllers framework to tackle a controller failure. They provide failover mechanism, when there is a controller failure, a backup controller can take over to control the network. In this thesis a benchmark is conducted to measure how long the failover time of those open source controllers. Unfortunately their failover time is in order of seconds, which is way higher than 50ms, the acceptable standard of carrier-grade recovery time.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a solution that can improve SDN robustness: A Controller Robustness and Distribution Framework (ACRoDiF). ACRoDiF is compatible with several open source OpenFlow controllers such as Ryu, OpenMul, Floodlight, Opendaylight, and ONOS. ACRoDiF provides failover mechanism that has lower failover time than in the open source controllers: 76ms. It can also eliminate failover time completely if using two active primary controllers.","SDN; OpenFlow; controller robustnest; distributed controllers; controller failover","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, some open challenges stand: Why the performance of an algorithm on different data sets can vary quite a lot? Which property of the data set influences the accuracy of the algorithms? In this thesis, we introduce methodologies to investigate the impact of user-item interactions properties on the accuracy of classical collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms. Firstly, we propose to characterize U-I matrix properties from three domains: network topology, spectrum and information domains. Furthermore, we design several network modification algorithms to systematically modify basic topology properties of a given U-Imatrix to create more U-Imatrices. Meanwhile, the properties of the spectrum and information domains are also changed as topological features are modified. We finally evaluated several classical collaborative filtering algorithms on a large number of U-I matrices and explore which properties in the three domains can influence or better explain the accuracy of the algorithms. We find that the effect of U-I matrix properties on the accuracy of recommendation algorithms is approximately consistent across various data sets. We identify two properties from the network topology and information domain respectively that could better explain the accuracy of algorithms. Understanding how U-I matrix properties affect the accuracy of algorithms has practical significance. The recommender system designers can estimate and explain the accuracy of their recommender systems and are inspired in the design of policies to orient the user item interactions such that the accuracy of their recommendation algorithms could be improved.","Recommender System; Collaborative Filtering; Weighted Bipartite Graph; U-I Matrix Property","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The final DP steel microstructures are formed during continuous heating to intercritical temperatures, then isothermal holding and quenching to form a mix of ferrite and martensite. Final martensite content, morphology and spatial distribution depends on the austenite formed during the isothermal holding. The austenite formation is affected by the progress of ferrite recrystallization during continuous heating. Therefore, it is important to understand the process of ferrite recrystallization.<br/>This thesis aims to study the effect of Si and Mn, which are common alloying elements in steels, on the ferrite recrystallization. The present study extensively uses in-situ 2D X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to investigate the ferrite recrystallization kinetics. This technique is faster and records more data than the other conventional methods used to study the kinetics of recrystallization until now. This study introduces a method to quantify the recrystallized grains using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Backscattered Electron Detector (BED). This method results in faster analysis of microstructure. The microstructure analysis helped in quantifying the grain growth, its dimensions and type of nucleation. Afterwards, those have been used as input parameters for modified non-isothermal JMAK model. This model is used to obtain the kinetic parameters from the experimental in-situ 2D XRD results by model fitting. The parameters obtained are: rate constant, activation energy and Avrami exponent. In all the cases, the microstructure analysis show site-saturated nucleation and predominantly 2D grain growth. The model fitting reveals that most nucleation cases show site-saturation. The density of nucleation sites is dependent on the pearlite content of the alloys. The boundaries between deformed pearlite and ferrite being the preferred nucleation sites. In some cases, the recrystallization nuclei are also seen at the boundaries between the ferrite grains which correspond to areas with micro-segregation of Mn. <br/>Presence of Mn is leading to an increase recrystallization start temperatures. The solute drag effect of Mn is quite high. Similarly, Si is also retarding the recrystallization. The retardation effect of Si is not as significant as Mn. The solute drag effect seems to be dependent on the velocity of the grain boundaries and consequently, on progress of recrystallization. In presence of Mn, the Si is able to interact with the moving grain boundaries. This points to co-segregation effect between Mn and Si. This effect was found to be strongest for 1:1 Si to Mn atomic fractions, where the lowest growth rates were observed. <br/>KEYWORDS: DP steels, ferrite recrystallization, solute drag effect, in-situ 2D XRD, recrystallization kinetics, SEM, JMAK model, activation energy, co-segregation.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed risk-based security assessment (RBSA) methodology based on Monte-Carlo sampling is employed to investigate the security of the system and to quantify the expected system risk. It is shown that the market optimal HVDC power set-points may result in unnecessarily high risk when subjected to the unavoidable uncertainty of inputs<br/>(fluctuations in load and RES) inherent to day-ahead forecasting. A detailed comparison of market optimal versus security optimal HVDC power set-point is presented. It is proposed to properly adapt the HVDC set-points with respect to the actual operating situation, which can be quite different from the day-ahead point forecast. Moreover, it is shown that by being able to adapt HVDC set-points in realtime operation, further more serious and more costly remedial actions such as active re-dispatch and load shedding, can be avoided. Furthermore, a study with two HVDC transmission lines is performed to show the necessity of coordinated control of the HVDC lines, and how this can reduce the stress in the network by acting as a tool to shift generation.","HVDC technology; RBSA; Monte-Carlo; Remedial actions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The need for such models is steadily rising due to the rapid development of automated driving, as these models allow efficient design and development of the control algorithms and functions. Chalmers Revere Lab supplements research in the field of automated driving and collision avoidance. The lab maintains two test vehicles, a passenger car (Volvo XC90) and a heavy duty truck (6x4 Volvo FH16). The models provided by Volvo are confidential, complicated for implementation as reference models and do not share the same control interface as the test vehicles. The objective of this work is to develop well documented generic and complete open-source models that represent Revere's test vehicles.<br/>The thesis aims to develop three model units per test vehicle. The three model units are a control interface model, a quick simulation model for online prediction and an advanced model for offline simulation prior to track testing. In addition to model development, an investigation has been made on the level of modelling details suitable for automated driving for non-critical highway and city driving on dry asphalt. For instance, a clutch model was implemented to capture the behaviour of starting from a standstill for the test vehicle equipped with an automated manual transmission. The models were developed using Modelica, an object-oriented modelling tool, and Matlab/Simulink. Furthermore, a suitable model architecture was proposed for simulation of automated driving functions.<br/>To assess the validity of the models, the simulation results were compared against experimental data. Data was collected using open-loop test maneuvers and manual driving tests. The simulation results highlight the differences between the simple and advanced model and their accuracy with respect to experimental data. As a use-case, the XC90 advanced model was simulated with a GPS-based autonomous navigation controller. Validation with experimental data showed that the vehicle model is suitable for the development of control algorithms. The simple model is faster than real-time making it suitable for online prediction and the advanced model is real-time capable which was verified with real-time toolbox on Simulink. As a suggestion for future work, the tire model can be improved to handle low-speed parking scenario and a trailer-dolly combination can be added to the tractor model for studies on combination vehicles.","Vehicle models; Control Interface; Open-source; Full simulation vehicle models; Modelica; Experimental validation; Solid and Fluid Mechanics; Engineering Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes INCA suitable for real-time control allocation in FCS. This incremental reformulation of the control allocation problem is based on a Jacobian model of the control effectors, and relies on angular acceleration measurements to reduce model dependency. In addition, real-time measurements of the actuator positions mitigate typical problems related to couplings between control allocators and actuator dynamics. In this paper, LCA- and INCA-based nonlinear FCS are designed for the Innovative Control Effectors (ICE) aircraft, a highly maneuverable tailless aircraft with 13 highly nonlinear, interacting and axis-coupled control effectors. Real-time simulation results showed that INCA dramatically improves tracking and control allocation performance with respect to LCA methods, thus improving maneuverability and exploiting the full potential of innovative control effector suites.

(mentor); van Beers, Cees (mentor); de Vries, G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Worldwide, organisations are establishing joint ventures to overcome market trends and size-specific challenges. Smaller sized organisations lack financial resources to introduce their innovation to the market, while larger sized organisations trouble with renewing their core business models. Consequently, more and more joint ventures are established between dissimilar sized organisations to combine resources and knowledge. However, these asymmetric joint ventures are subject to specific opportunistic behaviour which is promoted by a power imbalance between the partners. <br/><br/>Opportunistic behaviour may harm the performance of a joint venture and may even jeopardise the survivability of an organisation. In an asymmetric joint venture it is likely that the larger sized organisation will accumulate the majority of bargaining power by which the smaller sized organisation is put at risk. Therefore this research is conducted to assess how opportunistic behaviour emerges through a power imbalance. And eventually how this affects the overall performance of an asymmetric joint venture. Next, it is expected that when opportunistic behaviour emerges, that it will decrease cooperative behaviour and thus will affect the trust between the partners. <br/><br/>Data was retrieved by combining the SDC Platinum alliance database with the Orbis financial database to identify asymmetric joint ventures which have been established worldwide in the last ten years. From these asymmetric joint ventures, only the joint ventures operating in the manufacturing division were contacted, because these are characterised by product innovations to stay competitive. By doing several internet searches per asymmetric joint venture, contact information could be retrieved of executives knowledgeable of these joint ventures. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data about the asymmetric joint ventures. In total 77 completed surveys were collected.<br/><br/>The results of this research show that the amount of financial resources and expertise brought to the joint venture will determine the bargaining power of each partner. The majority of bargaining power is in most cases accumulated by the larger partner and is based on the financial investments made to the joint venture. The powerful party may use its bargaining power to alter the strategic direction of the joint venture in her favour, as bargaining power was found to be negatively correlated with goal congruence. Next, the relationship between goal congruence and joint venture performance was found to be fully mediated by trust. This suggests that opportunistic behaviour needs time to get recognised by the disadvantaged partner since it is disguised.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that roughly 70% of the joint ventures worldwide were found to be asymmetric and achieve less performance than symmetric alliances, the current literature is barely addressing the characteristics that influence the performance of asymmetric joint ventures. This research, however, addressed some of these characteristics by examining the relationship between power imbalance and opportunistic behaviour in asymmetric joint ventures.<br/>The practical relevance of this study is that the bargaining power of the larger partner may be limited by the smaller partner by significantly contributing in expertise to the joint venture. Next, smaller partners should be aware of different sized absorptive capacities, through which the larger partner may outlearn them and identify private opportunities that may promote opportunistic behaviour. Lastly, this research showed that trust is a critical factor in achieving high performance in asymmetric joint ventures. However, building a relationship in an asymmetric setting might be a challenging task due to the unfamiliarity between the dissimilar sized organisations.<br","Asymmetric; Joint Ventures; Power imbalance; Opportunistic behaviour; Trust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

As long as no triggering occurs, inputs that have been computed at the previous MPC update are used. The triggering mechanism uses the trajectories from the MPC to calculate bounds on the error between each actual state and predicted state, for all instants up to the horizon. When all individual errors are inside their respective bounds at some instant, violation at the next instant still results in an MPC problem that is (1) guaranteed to have a feasible solution and (2) for which an upper bound for the objective function value is given that is lower than the value at the previous instant. These two properties result in stability of the closed loop system. <br/><br/>Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to approaches that solve similar problems that can be found in literature, the proposed approach differs in the need for weaker assumptions and/or in the maximization of the bounds on the error signal.

(mentor); Regazzoni, Francesco (graduation committee); Jackson, Carl (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In today's digital life, security and encryption are becoming more and more important. As random number generators are a fundamental block of security and encryption, it is crucial to guarantee that these devices operate securely. Random numbers are usually generated in two ways; pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) and true random random number generators (TRNGs). PRNGs output a sequence based on a seed and a mathematical function. The deterministic nature of pseudo RNG devices can result in the PRNG not being applicable for all protocols, in which case TRNGs are needed. Almost all strong cryptography requires TRNGs to generate keys. The difference is that these devices instead rely on real world physics in order to generate a random number. The TRNG implementation explored in this thesis makes use of the quantum mechanical properties of photons. TRNGs making use of this principle of elementary quantum mechanical decision making are called quantum random number generators (QRNGs). This source of entropy provided by photons can be extracted by utilizing SPADs. QRNG devices based on SPADs have been made before in different ways, however there are still large grounds undiscovered when concerning SPAD based designs. As SPAD based QRNGs can be completely produced using CMOS technology, a world of possibilities open, including integration with already existing designs. Different aspects of SPAD QRNG designs will be discussed in this thesis; size, speed, hybrid designs and QRNG test-benching. The first part of the exploration focuses on creating an as small as possible QRNG. This resulted in a QRNG design which is as small as just one flip-flop and one SPAD, which is the smallest QRNG at the time of writing to the authors knowledge. Simulations show that the device is able to run up to 25 Mb/s using a SPAD with low deadtime. This device has been produced using 140nm technology by STMicroelectronics. The second part of the exploration, delves into how fast a SPAD based QRNG can be. The main goals here were to make the fastest possible QRNG with good scalability characteristics. This resulted in a design proposition based on the difference in the time of flight of two photons. This design is simulated using Matlab, and can reach 70 Mb/s per SPAD-duo depending on the deadtime of the SPAD used. When using a SPAD with a deadtime of 1us, the scaled up design needs only 16% of the SPADS needed by a state-of-the-art SPAD based QRNG design based on simulations. The amount of SPADs needed however schales almost linearly with a lower deadtime, having the potential to need only a fraction of the SPADs needed by the state-of-the-art in order to reach the same speeds. Then the concept of hybrid devices is explored, making use of a combination of PRNG and QRNG systems. The first hybrid design proposed is a design in which a very small QRNG is used to generate the key for multiple secure PRNG systems. The PRNG system used in this design is a trivium stream cypher. The design is completely written in VHDL except for the external QRNG. It then has been compiled and simulated using ModelSim, again using 140nm technology by STMicroelectronics. This resulted in a design which is able to reach speeds of 640 Gb/s, while using a total area of 99936 um2. The second hybrid device proposes a LFSR based design, which makes use of multiple very small QRNG devices to influence the function that the LFSR implements in order to increase the security. The last part of the exploration explores how it can be made easier and faster to test QRNG designs in an early design stage more accurately. As the source of entropy is quantum, the only risk of affecting the randomness is purely in which form the data of the photons is processed. By creating a chip which is able to extract the time of flight and the exact location of where the photon hit, testing potential QRNG devices can already be done in an early design stage with real-time data. A part of the chip that measures the time of flight of the photons arriving, has been designed in 40nm technology by STMicroelectronics. This part is a novel counter based on the principle of Gray counting, and is simulated extensively using extracted layout simulations. These simulations show that the device is able to run at speeds up to 3.6 GHz.","Quantum; Random number generator; SPAD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","","","","","",""

Over a span of nearly 50 years, various methods, including numerical and analytical have been employed for analysis of the high gradient stresses which sometimes exist to an extent of a singularity. The analysis of such free edge stresses is found to be computationally expensive. However, since the interlaminar stresses have been found to play a role in initiating delamination in composite laminates, it becomes imperative to get an estimate of the interlaminar stresses near the free edge to be able to predict delamination initiation through suitable criteria.<br/><br/>The abrupt material discontinuity between dissimilar layers in a homogeneously modelled laminate is believed to be a reason for the appearance of high gradients or singularities theoretically. The mitigation of material discontinuities at such interfaces could be done by modelling the laminate heterogeneously so that the interface is modelled by matrix material and hence, a discontinuity of material could be avoided. This idea of modelling the layers of laminate with explicit definition of fibre and matrix materials has inspired the thesis project with a view to investigate the difference in free edge stresses between the two models and to further draw a correlation between the stresses from the two models to predict delamination initiation.<br/><br/>In previously published literature, the use of average interlaminar stresses up to a certain characteristic distance from the free edge through criterion for delamination initiation prediction is reported. Further it is also found that a single averaging distance can be proposed for a combination of laminates made of the same material. This encourages the idea of determination of averaging distance for a material and find its application on a laminate susceptible to delamination initiation. In the course of the current work, a correlation is proposed between the stresses of homogeneous and heterogeneous model [0/90]s cross-ply laminate of equivalent stiffness made of T300/934 material to determine the averaging distance and apply the determined averaging distance on [±25/90]s laminate to predict delamination initiation due to high gradient free edge stresses. <br/><br/>An averaging distance of 0.125 mm is determined for [±25/90]s laminate made of T300/934 material to find average stresses for incorporation into criterion for delamination initiation. It is found that the determined averaging distance predicts delamination initiation successfully for experimentally reported delamination initiation strain range for the [±25/90]s laminate. Further, the convergence of average of high gradient interlaminar stress is found to be computationally more efficient than the convergence of high gradient interlaminar stress themselves. This indicates that use of average of high gradient interlaminar stresses is an efficient means for predicting free edge stress induced delamination initiation.","fibre reinforced composite; cross-ply laminate; free-edge effect; delamination initiation; heterogeneous laminate; homogenisation; interlaminar stresses; averaging distance; periodic boundary condition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The elevator cable is modelled as an axially moving string, with length given by l(t) = l0 + 1/2 at2, with a the acceleration and t the time. The cable is sinusoidally excited at the top and fixed at the bottom. It is assumed that the axial acceleration is small compared to the transversal acceleration, that the cable mass is small compared to the car mass, and that the excitation amplitude is small compared to the length of the cable. Using these estimations, the solution for the transversal displacement u is approximated up to O(ε) with ε a small parameter. The elevator cable goes through a cascade of autoresonances: the eigenfrequencies of the cable are varying because the cable length is varying, and at several times an eigenfrequency matches the excitation frequency. These are the resonance times, and they have been found as t+ = (2/εa1l0)1/2arccos((Ωl0/χk)1/2), with t+ a measure of oscillation of t, Ω the angular excitation frequency, l0 the initial length, χk the eigenfrequency of mode k and εa1 = a.

This idea stems from the intertwined triangle of government, business, and society, where the psychological needs of the citizens are most underestimated. The citizen-centred focus on city identity creation within a post-disaster rebuild situation is an under-researched topic, especially connected to the focus on coping with a collective trauma. This thesis is pioneering in integrating these topics on a city scale.<br/><br/>The research<br/>The objective of this thesis is to develop grounds to empower the disaster-struck citizens in their need to rebuild their city and their future, and to create ownership to give this rebuild a sustainable start and future from a citizen-centred perspective. This objective of the research leads to the following main research question: <br/><br/>“How can a theoretical backbone for the creation of -a citizen-centred rebuilding initiative that aims to produce a vision for a city in a post-disaster situation- be developed?”<br/><br/>The methods <br/>The main research question is answered by deductive study combining both literature and case study. The City Identity Framework, CIF for short, consist of a combination of theory on disaster, trauma, city identity creation, collaboration and participation. Aceh (Indonesia), Christchurch (New Zealand), Napier (New Zealand), and Rotterdam (the Netherlands) are the studied post-disaster cities functioning as case studies. These cases were selected for 1) the well documented nature of the cases concerning the rebuild process and the role of the citizen within this process, 2) the difference in Zeitgeist and therefore collaborative approach, 3) comparability of regions including one outlier to add perspective, and 4) the level of impact of the disaster on both the city and the citizens. <br/><br/>CIF<br/>This research results in the theoretical backbone for a citizen-centred rebuilding initiative that aims to produce a vision for a city in a post-disaster situation. Within this thesis 56 guidelines were developed, which are clustered in the following ten themes: 1) empowerment, 2) collective memory, 3) citizen and stakeholder inclusion, 4) resilience, 5) social and societal structures, 6) self-organise, 7) social cohesion, 8) ownership, 9) Soul of the City, and 10) citizen-centred. This thesis and more specific these clusters function as the basis and give input for the development of a practical tool for initiating a citizen-centred rebuilding initiative.

However, uncertainties still exist regarding how the distribution of carbon to various locations inside martensite contributes to the development of its observed microstructure and high strength. The strengthening mechanisms depend on carbon content and process parameters,but are also inter-related. The current work is an attempt to address the existing uncertainties regarding the relation between martensite dislocation density, prior austenite grain size (PAGS) and the manner in which total carbon is distributed into martensite interstitial sites and segregations near dislocations.Two steel alloys with different carbon content were selected to study, having following composition in wt.%: 0.3C-3.6Mn-1.5Si and 0.6C-3.5Mn-1.5Si. Alloys were heat treated in dilatometer to obtain martensite with different prior austenite grain sizes (PAGS). Microstructure characterization was performed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) &amp; Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) and strength was evaluated by hardness measurements. It was found that the main factor influencing the carbon distribution in martensite is the martensite dislocation density, but the magnitude of its influence depends upon PAGS and alloy composition. In 0.3 wt.% C alloy, dislocation density decreases with increasing PAGS, as a result carbon atoms migrating towards dislocations during cooling also decrease, leaving higher number of carbon atoms at interstitial sites. However in 0.6 wt.% C alloy, such trend is not observed. On increasing the total carbon content in the alloy, very small increase in interstitial carbon content of martensite is observed if the PAGs are large. An increase in hardness was observed when the samples were introduced in liquid nitrogen, even in those cases where contribution from all strengthening mechanisms remained almost the same. This was unexpected and is most probably due to the relaxation of residual stresses and formations of carbon clusters at cryogenic temperature. In the end, an extension to already existing model is proposed to connect several microstructural features together in order to explain how they interact and evolve to give rise to observed strength of martensite.","Martensite; Carbon; Dislocations; Hardness; Segregation; Precipitates; Lath Martensite; Interstitial; PAGS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under popular products, there are normally hundreds or even thousands of reviews left by the previous customers. These reviews help potential buyers understand the products better and make the purchase decision. However, most shopping websites only give an overview score (e.g. 3 star out of 5) of a product besides the reviews, which does not provide enough information for people to understand different aspects of the product. For example, if the users want to know more about the ``picture quality'' aspect of a camera product, they need to read the reviews. However, by reading the top ranked reviews or some random reviews, they may get biased information. Professional people may have high demands in ``picture quality'' while the top ranked reviews may be amateurs who are easy to get satisfied. However, it is tedious for the users to read all of the reviews to get the right information. Moreover, customers tend to have different opinions on one product, but the current shopping websites do not cluster the reviews which share similar opinions together and present it to the users. Instead, they ignore the conflicted opinions in the reviews by simply averaging the scores given by all the reviewers. <br/><br/>Under this circumstance, this thesis proposes to research questions: is it possible to automatically extract aspects of online products which are also consistent with the manual modeling of products in this domain? Is it possible to build a system to aggregate opinions on online products from reviews, which actually can help users understand the products faster? To answer the two research questions, it is necessary to build a prototype system which can extract information and describe different aspects of a product to help users understand the product. This thesis first develops such a system. The system is divided into three steps, aspect detection, sentiment analysis and reviews clustering. In brief, the system first determines which aspects should be used to describe the products, and then calculates people's sentiment towards these aspects, in the end the system clusters reviews which share similar opinions together. To answer the research questions, two evaluations of the system are conducted in the end, which shows the system has big potential in helping users understanding online shopping products.","opinion mining; aspect-based sentiment analysis; opinion clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In doing so it is aimed to provide a setting where children can behave in ways that may not normally be stimulated. playing with a rebellious toy is meant to help children to explore the boundaries of how they can behave and the consequences that might derive from that, in a safe and playful way. The concept of rebellious play was introduced in the paper ‘Rebel by Design’ (Gielen &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2013). BlockMe is a first attempt to methodically study an intentionally designed rebellious toy. The BlockMe prototype toy that resulted from this vision consists of a building block set that allows for quick creation of child-sized tower structures. Two of these blocks were made interactive and acted as a sort of time-bomb. these interactive blocks would respond to loud sounds, waking the block up. Subsequently it gets progressively more agitated over time. When the interactive block reaches a certain level of ‘agitation’ it starts to vigorously shake, causing the construction to collapse. Before this happens the block can also be calmed and ‘subdued’ by gently touching and stroking it. By doing so the construction can be saved. By offering these opposite play schemes the concepts plays on a perceived struggle between the inherent joy of creating something, but also the excitement of eventually destroying what was built. Offering these two possibilities is meant to provide an incentive to switch from one to the other when the urge arises to do so. It acts as an incentive for children to balance their individual desires with group expectations. This should result in a potentially difficult decision to make: do you (selfishly) act by reacting on these urges, or do you continue to be in service of the group and conform by doing what is expected of you? A study was conducted to put the BlockMe prototype to the test. To do so observations were conducted at a primary school, where four play sessions were organized. A total of 47 children, both boys and girls aged from 8-10 years old, participated in the study in groups of varying sizes. From the observations there were 38 relevant play situations identified. Only 4 of which were determined to have happened because of the prototype. It seems therefore clear that play with the prototype did not lead to any structural rebellious behavior. Fundamentally, it seems that the opposite possibilities for play that BlockMe is supposed to provide, do not actually manifest themselves as such in the prototype that was trailed. Seeing as this is the main mechanism that is supposed to trigger rebelliousness and conflict, the general perceived absence of these opposite possibilities in the prototype may provide an explanation for the lack of intended rebelliousness","rebelliousness; children; play; interplay; interactive toys","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This question leads to other matters, such as why is it important for a project leader to adapt the project plan to the context? Firstly, suppose a firm in a market and the executives of the company plan to grow the organization through innovation projects. Then, the executives need to select the project leader based on the personality of the project manager candidates because the project manager’s personalities influence the project success (Müller &amp; Turner, 2007). This step indicates the necessity of analyzing the personality of the project manager candidates. Subsequently, the project manager must create a project plan. In drafting the project plan, the project manager needs to make several decisions depending upon the context because nowadays, firms need to adjust their business decisions depending on contextual factors (Ortt &amp; Van der Duin, 2008). Thus, this step indicates the importance of adapting the project plan to the context. Nevertheless, those practical problems are not resolved yet because no literature connects between the decisions in making a project plan, the contextual factors, and the project leader’s personalities. Literature reviews and experiments are conducted in this study. Firstly, the literature reviews summarize the theory explaining the decisions in making a project plan, the contextual factors, and the project leader’s personalities as well as generate some hypotheses. Secondly, the experiment, aiming to test the hypotheses, asks the TPM TU Delft student to fill out the questionnaires. Then, the 162 valid data were analyzed to form three groups of variables: (a) project plan variables, comprising 37 variables; (b) contextual factor variables, encompassing 2 variables; and (c) project leader’s personality variables, entailing 29 variables. Furthermore, the relationships between the project plan variables and the contextual factors are investigated using analysis of variances. Next, the relationships between the project plan variables and the project leader’s personalities are examined using regression. Lastly, the relationships between the project plan variables and the contextual factors controlling for the project manager’s personalities are analyzed using analysis of covariances. The results show that two contextual factors have influences on the decisions in making a project plan. Likewise, two out of three project leader’s personality variables have effects on the decisions in creating a project plan and moderate the connection between the contextual factors and the decisions in making a project plan. This study has both scientific relevance and practical relevance. In scientific relevance, this study provides newly developed scale measuring the decisions in making a project plan. Likewise, this research brings up the application of the contextual factors theory to the project management as well as the application of the people’s personality theories to the project management. On the other hand, in managerial practice, this research can be a guidance for the executives to appoint a project manager based on the personalities of the project manager candidates and for the appointed project manager to create a project plan depending on the contextual factors.","Project Management; Innovation; Contextual Factors; personality assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Given a set of trajectories T, a TOD algorithm outputs a subset of T, of which trajectories are different from mostof the other trajectories in some aspect(s). These trajectories, namely outliers, can indicate important or interesting information and are thus worthnoticing. TOD techniques can be used for surveillance security, accidentdiscovery, and many other purposes. Many of the existing TOD algorithms consider only spatial trajectoryoutliers. They can detect trajectories that follow an abnormal route ordirection. While some existing algorithms are capable of detecting outliersin temporal aspects, like trajectories with abnormal time duration or speed,they have their own weaknesses. For example, they can be computationallyexpensive, or fail to detect important types of outliers. In this work, we aimto overcome these shortcomings of previous TOD algorithms. A novel grid-based TOD algorithm is proposed that is capable of detectingtemporal-spatial outliers including density, direction, duration, and speedoutliers with accuracy as well as fast calculation. The algorithm performsthe following three main steps: (i) it calculates density, direction, duration,and speed features of all trajectories in the input set T; (ii) it transformsfeature information of trajectories into grid information; (iii) it examineseach trajectory grid cell by grid cell. Following these three steps, outlyingtrajectories are extracted. By conducting experiments on several data setsincluding both simulated and real ones, the algorithm is shown to be efficientin detecting density, direction, duration, and speed outliers. It outperformsstate-of-the-art TOD algorithms in various aspects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Literature was analysed and field research is done in order to get this deeper understanding.<br/><br/>Field study 1 showed the perspectives of patients on ‘self-management’ and what elements it exists of.

In other words, the entire road pavement share a uniform thickness design regardless how many lanes there are. However, due to traffic regulations and driving habits, the traffic flow most probably does not distribute evenly on a multi-lane road. Modern pavement design methods usually choose the lane that bears the heaviest traffic load as the design lane to determine the thickness design of the entire pavement. Hence there could be a certain over-design in the less trafficked lanes. This study aims to propose and evaluate a new structural design for flexible pavement by reducing the thickness of asphalt layers of the lightly trafficked lanes.<br/>The traffic data of a real motorway in the Netherlands was analysed, based on which a new pavement structural design of a 3-lane road was established. Two finite element models, for both original and new designs, were established in CAPA-3D to calculate the stress and strain responses under different traffic load combinations. Following the Dutch design method the fatigue and deformation performance predictions of the two pavement designs were executed and compared. The results showed that the new design indeed improve the material cost-efficiency without compromising the performance of the pavement structure.<br/>Taking advantage of the finite element models, a real-life simulation was also applied. The strain output of the simulation was used to calculate the rutting depth following the American design method. Both calculated rutting depth and the deformation output of the real-time simulation supported the earlier conclusions. An extra simulation of truck platooning was briefly executed and discussed as well.<br/>Furthermore, the construction and maintenance feasibilities of the new design were explored. It was proved that the new design can be constructed by the existing equipment and machines. The current maintenance methods and procedures can also be applied to the new design.","Pavement; Structural design; Finite Element Analysis; road construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This basic principle of cooking food is the same over the world. However the difference lies within the execution of the cooking process. In the Netherlands we are accustomed to cooking inside in a kitchen on a gas or electric stove. When the weather conditions permits, families gather outside to grill food on a barbecue. This is completely different when looking at other parts of the world. In many African countries it is still the women’s job to provide food for the family. Depending on their living conditions, most women cook outside on portable wood or charcoal stoves. This use of traditional stoves causes a significant amount of air pollution due to the incomplete combustion of fuel. Evenings and inclement weather will cause the cooking/stove to be brought inside, further increasing health risks.<br/><br/>For many cookstove companies this was one of the main drivers behind the design of improved cookstoves. Despite their efforts to improve the current situation, on the long term the users often resumed to use the traditional stoves (World Health Organization, 2014). It was seen that the focus has been too much on the reduction of the polluting emissions and fuel consumption. Reaching the targets has become more important that the needs and habits of the users of these stoves. The identification and understanding of these needs is an essential step in the adaptation process.<br/> <br/>Prakti, a cookstove company in the Southern part of India has been successfully implementing a good understanding of the context into the design of their cookstoves. Majority of Prakti’s existing stoves are wood based as this fuel is predominant in the countries (India, Nepal and Bangladesh) Prakti distributes most of its stoves. At the start of this master thesis Prakti expressed the desire to fit the a newly developed technology in a new product for the African market. When taking into account the recent and continuing urbanization in African cities, a new improved charcoal stove was a fair addition to the existing product portfolio. Prakti had developed a new combustion technology based on charcoal that should result in a reduction of emissions (indoor air pollution) and a reduction of the fuel consumption. <br/>At the beginning of the project Uganda and Ghana were chosen as the target countries. Making use of the Context Variation by Design approach an elaborated research was done. Over the course of two months desktop research was done about Uganda and an in-depth field research was done in Ghana to understand the needs. For both countries the cooking habits, rituals and the cooking power (to cook the most common dishes) were identified. These insights were compared and the similarities and differences between the countries were pinpointed. These were used as the main input for the design criteria.<br/><br/>The design process was initiated in Delft by incorporating rituals and habits for the direction of the cookstove development. This was finished before going to Prakti in India. At Prakti’s laboratory the emphasis was on the optimization of the combustion technology to suit the identified power needs and CO emissions. Upon returning from India the optimization of Prakti’s technique (the interior of the stove) was integrated with the exterior design of the selected concept. This prototype was made in Prakti’s workshop. During the construction of the concept improvements were identified to be able to make a solid final design.<br/><br/>The final product is Prakti’s newest charcoal stove: the CharcHole. This charcoal stove is specially designed to suit the needs of women living in urban and peri-urban Uganda and Ghana while exerting less harmful CO and saving on charcoal. The stove accommodates the pans these women use, refuelling is done from the top of the stove and ash removal can easily be done whilst cooking. When the gas extension is purchased, the women can also tailor the stove to fit their fuel preferences during the year.<br/><br/>The design is not ready to be implemented as of yet. A number of recommendations are made to ensure a successful product, of which the most important ones are to test the stove with the intended users in Uganda and Ghana. Secondly the CO emissions need to be reduced by improving Prakti’s technology through more experiments. Lastly the proposed gas extension should be evaluated with the users to confirm the demand for this extension.","cookstove; charcoal; design; Uganda; Ghana; base of the pyramid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The assignment was commissioned by Eneco Group, with the aim to increase the adoption of the electric car among private consumers. <br/><br/>Problem definition<br/>Over past decades, the electric car has received an increasing amount of interest. Especially for environmental reasons, the electric car is considered a promising alternative for the conventional fuel car. Currently, business consumers are the main users of the electric car. However, with the advantages of the electric car becoming clearer, the adoption among consumers is predicted to rise. Eneco E-Mobility has chosen to invest in electric mobility and has developed into a significant party in the market of electric car charge services. Eneco E-Mobility wants to prepare for the upcoming consumer market by creating user centered services that stimulate adoption of the electric car. This is the origin of this graduation project. The aim is to help Eneco to get an understanding of the consumer perspective on electric cars and to develop a service that stimulates adoption among private consumers.<br/><br/>To do so, the project was divided in three stages. The first stage gave insight in the challenges of the electric car market, consisting of a company analysis, a market analysis, a trend analysis and extensive qualitative consumer research. In the second stage, the insights of the first stage were combined into a design direction. The third and last phase developed the design further, presenting the service in form and function, with distribution channels, a business model and a promotion strategy. Below, the results are summarised.<br/><br/>Vision on solution<br/>The first part of the design brief was an understanding of the consumer needs. Interviews with eleven potential consumers led to the development of three Purchase Drivers: profiles that represent the main purchase motivators for electric cars among consumers. The prominent reasons can be divided in three categories: environmental, financial and technological. The Purchase Drivers show the relationship between the reason to purchase an electric car and additional services consumers would be interested in. Accordingly, the Drivers summarise the most important consumer needs in a comprehensive manner, giving Eneco E-Mobility the understanding they wished for. The Drivers can be directly applied in product development and marketing communication: they should all be considered to make sure the widest range of consumers is addressed. With the Purchase Drivers, Eneco can make sure their offer is relevant and fits the prominent motives of their consumers. <br/><br/>Apart from the understanding of consumer needs presented in the Drivers, the research shows that two main issues play a role in the consideration for an electric car. One: consumers fear the range is not enough to let them enjoy their car as they are used to. Two: consumers see potential advantages the electric car may have, the environmental, financial and technical factors that were presented in the Purchase Drivers, but there is no way to specify the extent of these benefits for their situation. The available information on electric car purchase remains very general, leaving consumers unaware of the exact financial, environmental or technological gain. The combination of the unknown impact of the range and the haziness of the benefits impedes the purchase decision of the consumers. It makes them stick to the familiar fuel-powered car. The two factors are both linked to the compatibility of the electric car: the extent to which consumers can estimate what an electric car means for their life. Roger’s theory states an improvement in compatibility significantly stimulates adoption of an innovation, in this case, electric cars (Rogers, 2010). A focus on those issues is also perfectly in line with the strategy of Eneco E-Mobility, that searches the answer to needs of consumers. <br/>Thus, to accelerate the adoption of electric cars, the emerging market needs a powerful tool that helps consumers to assess the effect of the range on their mobility and the extent of the sustainability and cost gains. These consumers can be found where they already inform themselves on electric cars: car dealers and lease companies. Altogether, the design direction is formulated in the following positioning statement:<br/><br/>Eneco E-Mobility will offer a transparent pre-sale tool that gives a personal overview of the benefits and costs of the electric car for their lease and car dealing partners. To do so, the service analyses the car use of the consumer to give insight in nearby charge facilities and the impact of the range on their mobility. Simultaneously, the service provides an overview of the savings in costs and for the environment and a sneak peek at future innovations. <br/><br/>Solution<br/>The service materializes in an online platform called EV Inzicht (see Figure 1). Consumers insert information about their car and car use: type of ownership, distances they drive, et cetera. This data is then processed to a personal overview specifying the impact of an electric car for four topics: impact, finances, sustainability and technology. The impact shows the implications of the electric car for the routes of the consumer, with the effect on travel time and the location of chargers. The financial overview presents a breakeven point and return on investment (see Figure 2). The environmental overview determines CO2 emission savings and lastly, the technologic overview presents innovations Eneco works on. Al together, this overview specifies the costs and benefits of the electric car for the consumer’s personal situation. This enables a balanced decision that fits their personal motives. The tool is honest by using data from practice, like the actual range, and transparent by citing sources for the information. <br/>EV Inzicht answers perfectly to the request of Eneco E-Mobility. It enables them to improve the information flow towards the consumer, emphasizing the benefits of the electric car. The consumer oriented strategy is continued by the incorporation of the Purchase Drivers, addressing the most important consumer needs. The service gives Eneco E-Mobility the opportunity to collect data about their potential consumer base, enabling tailored marketing campaigns. Since a collaboration with the distribution channels is already in place, it allows Eneco E-Mobility to strengthen the relationship with their partners, showing that electric car sales are considered a mutual responsibility. A close relationship with their partners fortifies Eneco’s market position relative to competitors. Simultaneously, the business model makes sure that EV Inzicht either leads to increased profit from the sale to the partners or from new leads for charge station installation. Most importantly, EV Inzicht promotes electric driving, accelerating the adoption of the electric car and thereby enlarging the potential consumer base of Eneco E-Mobility. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the Purchase Drivers provide an understanding of the relation between purchase motivation and consumer needs. The Drivers help Eneco E-Mobility to address the motives of the widest consumer base, ensuring relevance of their offer. The developed service, EV Inzicht, simplifies the purchase process of the electric car, aiding consumers’ purchase decision with the incorporation of individual needs. This stimulates the sale of the electric car, enlarging Eneco E-Mobility’s consumer base and boosting their sales.","consumer adoption; electric cars; adoption of innovation; sustainability; service development; user profiles; electric vehicles; Eneco Group; sustainable awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Only when there are cracks in the dike or a particular bridge is not accessible due to for example a broken pillar, we realize how critical these infrastructures are for our society and economy. These infrastructures are not build to last forever and they are susceptible to breakdowns, especially as some are reaching the end of their technical lifespan. Building new infrastructures is simply not an option, as this is often financially and logistically not feasible. Getting as much as possible out of the remaining technical lifespan of such critical infrastructures is then down to employing innovative maintenance strategies, such as risk and opportunity based asset management, as is being done in the ROBAMCI project, initiated by Deltares. Management and maintenance of infrastructures already takes place in a multi-actor environment. Adding systematic approaches on top of this multi-actor environment requires maintenance managers to further integrate their decision making processes. However, analysis have shown that there is a clear lack of this integrated decision making. Literature has further shown that this could be as a result of a lack of information sharing between organizations. Improving inter-organizational information sharing, however first requires further understandings. This research project is done with the goal to achieve that understanding. A case-study in the context of ROBAMCI was used to study this concpt in a practical environment. The asset in this case was a sea-lock complex located in Delfzijl, which not only performs functions for shipping, but also has various other direct and indirect functions, influencing for example local nature, economy and regional water management. Theoretical knowledge, gained from literature studies, was then used to interpret the data from in-depth interviews with employees of identified organizations. The empirical findings, interpreted through various sources of literature showed that there is a wide array of factors influencing inter-organizational information sharing in the case-study. Among the most mentioned and expected were trust, competing interests/self-interests and legislations &amp; policies. Organizations also add value to the importance of personal physical interactions and even though the information sharing takes place between actors of one national government, concern for information misuse is also seen as a potential barrier for information sharing. The data has also led to the formation of some factor-relations, we see e.g. that trust forms a positive causal relation with not only information sharing itself, but also has a negative causal relation with concerns of the quality of the information. Data also makes it clear that there is an interrelation between the 3 levels of information sharing. These findings, backed by theory have led to the identification of 2 general fundamentals that can be taken into account when trying to further understand information sharing. The first one focuses on trust and legislations, whereas the second one addresses on the embeddedness of the information sharing levels. Conclusively it can be said that inter-organizational information sharing helps to make more efficient and effective decisions for the management and maintenance of assets. There are many factors that can either positively or negatively influence information sharing. It is recommended that through further studying factor relations their importance can be determined. This can also help to reduce the high number of factors and frameworks. For ROBAMCI it is recommended to use the results of this research as input for a maturity analysis focusing on the inter-organizational information management of organizations in the sector.","information sharing; inter-organizational information sharing; knowledge exchange; public sector; Asset Management; risk based asset management; critical infrastructure; management & maintenance; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Risk and Opportunity Based Asset Management for Critical Infrastructures (ROBAMCI)",""

With the use of lab-on-chip devices, we are capable of carrying out experiments that include several functions on a single chip. Despite a lot of progress in the miniaturization of these devices, the peripheral systems which control the microfluidic functionalities like valves and pumps, remain bulky, making the microfluidic devices less portable. Conducting polymers are potential candidates that show promise to solve this issue and make the microfluidic devices portable. They are a class of polymer materials with intrinsic conductive properties and the ability to be formed and deformed at a low applied electric potential. <br/>This thesis presents the different aspects of the conceptualisation and creation of the actuator for an all polymer conducting polymer microfluidic valve. The proposed system uses the widely studied multi-layer bending beam actuator, commonly used as an artificial muscle or soft actuator. The actuation of the all polymer system is the result of the different expansion rates during an electrochemical reaction.<br/>The system consist of three polymer layers. The first layer is the flexible base layer that also functions as a fluid barrier in the microfluidic system. The second layer is the electrode material that is used as an electrode in both the fabrication and actuation of the expanding layer.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","A highly miniaturised reaction wheel was developed for Delft University of Technology’s PocketQube (PQ) mission as topic of this thesis project. Delfi-PQ, a picosatellite, aims to demonstrate a reliable core bus platform for PocketQubes with a form factor of 5x5x5 [cm] and one or more payload(s). PocketQubes hold the potential to reduce the cost of access to space and disrupt traditional space applications by providing cost effective global coverage. Three-axis stabilisation supports advanced capabilities such as Earth observation, high data rate transfers and propulsive manoeuvres. Precise attitude control requires reaction wheels with accurate speed control and low vibration levels. Power and volume requirements, however, drive a simple and compact design. Presently, no suitably miniaturised reaction wheel exists in the world. Therefore, a reaction wheel is developed specifically for the PocketQube mission. Due to a strict power requirement the research in this thesis focuses on characterising the power consumption of the reaction wheel. <br/><br/>Based on orbital disturbances and the operational context of the Delfi-PQ mission, requirements for the reaction wheel were derived. A suitable electric motor was selected and conclusions from a preliminary design were used to create a detailed design of a single reaction wheel. A simple flywheel is attached to a brushless electric motor and secured in a pressurised housing to protect the bearing lubrication from the vacuum of space. An in-depth model of the motor was created in Simulink and validated through functional testing of the motor. Model results were used to estimate control electronics power consumption. The housing of the reaction wheel was tested for its ability to seal off the motor and flywheel under atmospheric pressure. Then, the motor with flywheel was subjected to vibrations representative of the launch environment and functional testing of the reaction wheel including operational scenarios was performed. Furthermore, a micro-vibration test bench was developed in parallel to characterise the disturbances produced by the wheel. Based on conclusions, recommendations for improving a proposed design for a complete three-wheel assembly were derived.<br/><br/>With a mass of about 8 [g], average power consumption of around 15 [mW] and size of 20x20x12 [mm] the engineering model has been developed successfully. The reaction wheel can provide at least a torque of 2.7*10^-7 Nm over its full speed range and has a (one way) momentum storage of 1.1*10^-4 Nms. This is sufficient for attitude stabilisation and ground station tracking on a triple-unit PocketQube in a Low Earth Orbit with an altitude of above 360 [km]. The motor with flywheel uses about 35% more power than the motor alone. This is due to an imbalance of the flywheel which leads to more mechanical friction, although additional effects are present. Disturbances created by the wheel constrain Earth observation scenarios are speeds over 4000 [RPM]. A proposed three-wheel design was created that further pushes the boundaries of miniaturisation with dimensions of 31x31x22 [mm] including control electronics. Future developments should focus on developing control electronics, improving the vacuum seal of the housing and most importantly, the balance of the flywheel.","Reaction Wheel; PocketQube; Miniaturisation; Disturbances; Microvibrations; BLDC motor; Delfi-Program; Delfi-PQ","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Delfi-PocketQube",""

The industries thrive on efficient function of the PM machines. These machines are prone to electro-mechanical faults due to environmental conditions and maintenance. Out of all these faults, stator internal faults are concerning as they can lead to insulation failures which may take around 30 seconds to expand and lead to a fire on ships, or on wind turbines. These type of faults develop gradually, which gives the opportunity to control the fault currents before they reach dangerous levels. Rolls Royce Marine AS is also working to tackle this problem for their hybrid propulsion shaft generator. DNVGL requires the generator to be made electrically dead during such event and the long-term propulsion should not be affected. During such conditions, WTs are either turned off or field weakening is used to develop a fault tolerant control (FTC) by the help of power electronics for the WT. FTC helps the machine not to be turned off completely, but less power is generated during fault conditions. An alternative efficient field weakening method using a Dual Rotor PMSM was suggested for both the applications. The DR-PMSM has two rotors instead of one, with identical surface mounted magnets on both rotors. One of these rotors has the capacity to rotate with respect to the other, in order to reduce the flux or completely short the flux path by misalignment of rotors. The machine stator is exactly like the conventional PMSM. The machine is capable of reducing the induced emf to zero by field weakening. <br/><br/>In this thesis a transient 3D finite element model is presented to test the credibility of the machine. A 2D FEM of a conventional PMSM was also built to check the validity of the machine. It is seen that torque is a function of the active length of the machine, and if a gap is introduced between the rotors then the total length of the machine must be increased. Also, axial flux component which induces eddy currents in the stator teeth was studied. By modeling anisotropy in the stator iron, certain hot spots could be seen in the middle part of the stator. The forces that were in the shifting mechanism were studied and it was concluded that machine cogging can be reduced to reduce the effect of these forces. A machine prototype was also built which confirms the field weakening capability of the machine. <br/><br/>The DR-PMSM works like a conventional PMSM but with flux weakening capabilities and can be implemented on marine and wind turbine applications for these type of fault conditions.","FEM; FEM analysis; PMSM; stator faults; field weakening; COMSOL Multiphysics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such large-scale integration of renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the grid, will have drastic effects on the electricity grid structure, system operations and the functioning of the electricity market itself. In order to tackle the intermittency challenges posed by RES, smarter operating processes are essential. This requires accurate simulation tools and an efficient exchange of information between the energy players in Europe (TSOs, DSOs and other private generators). The Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) was developed to support data exchanges between these energy players. The CGMES based Common Information Model (CGMES-CIM) files contain all the information about the grid under study including the powerflow values. The current version of CGMES-CIM supports full interoperability with respect to steady state simulations but is quite challenging to use for dynamic simulations. Open-Instance Power System Library (OpenIPSL), which is a Modelica based power system library, seems to be one of the possible solutions that can overcome the interoperability issue with respect to dynamic simulations. This thesis focuses on extending the OpenIPSL with PowerFactory based models and provides a proof of concept to automatically initialize the Modelica grid model using CGMES-CIM. OpenModelica, an open-source Modelica simulation environment is used in this project to carry out dynamic studies on a modified Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) grid model. In order to perform dynamic studies, the Modelica grid model first needs to be populated with powerflow values. OpenModelica does not include powerflow option and therefore, powerflow solution needs to be obtained from another simulation tool and the values need to be subsequently loaded into OpenModelica to perform dynamic simulations; this process is called Initialization. Thus, to overcome the challenges with initialization of Modelica models, this thesis presents a proof of concept that directly utilizes the CGMES-CIM files for initialization of Modelica based grid models. The interfacing process between CIM and Modelica based grid model is<br/>done using Python.<br/>To test the concept, Modelica based dynamic simulations were carried out and compared with reference results (signal records obtained through time domain simulations) from PowerFactory. For this purpose, several PowerFactory based Modelica models were developed and validated, extending the OpenIPSL. These models were subsequently used to create and validate a modified BPA grid model, which serves as a test case. This thesis also proposes a method to directly convert CGMES-CIM files to Modelica files. This conversion helps achieve<br/>complete automation of dynamic simulations in a Modelica environment.

(mentor); Høidalen, Hans Kristian (mentor); Wang, Jianping (mentor); Li, Youyi (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (degree granting institution)","2017","The wide scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the distribution networks (LV/MV) over the last few decades has resulted in new challenges for the protection system. This thesis work explores the possibility to overcome challenges associated with overcurrent protection schemes, which are conventionally employed for distribution networks, by utilizing communication-based protection techniques, which are widely used in protection of HV transmission network. These techniques include piloted directional protection techniques based on conventional methods and transient signals. Moreover, current-based line differential protection is also investigated. <br/>The individual algorithms for all these protection schemes used by relay manufacturers (including ABB, Siemens and SEL) are developed and tested. The test network, system parameters and performance criteria are developed in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment, whereas the individual algorithms are developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The system and performance parameters are carefully designed to reciprocate the performance of the modern distribution networks with weak sources replicating the performance of DERs during faults. Up to this point, the fault clearing time has not been critical for these networks but the integration of DERs has resulted in the additional requirement to fulfill the critical clearing time of each generator, therefore relay operating time is also considered in this study. However, the impacts of some real world imperfections including harmonics, measurement inaccuracies, communication noise and data loss etc. are ignored.<br/>Different relay manufacturers propose using sequence components for different fault types. A directional algorithm combining the principles of all the conventional techniques based on different symmetrical components has been developed and tested. This algorithm responds to both the balanced and unbalanced faults, while overcoming the limitations of each individual technique. The test cases incorporate the weak network conditions in order to see the dependability of the protection functions.<br/>The operating principles of investigated transient-based directional algorithms are fundamentally different. Therefore, each method is extensively tested and the results are compared. These techniques, also called ultra-high-speed directional methods, claim to fulfill the minimum operating time requirements without compromising the security or dependability of operation. Moreover, some less-explored but highly effective algorithms are also tested, which would be ideal in this case including current-only transient-based directional algorithms.<br/>Line differential schemes based on dual slope current or charge comparison techniques are vulnerable to capacitive currents and saturation of CTs but their performance is ideal for weak networks, due to its selectivity as a unit protection. These schemes are included in the study to compare the performance with directional-based pilot protection schemes. The assessment is performed in both the current plane (operating and restraint current) and the polar plane for comparison.<br/>Each of the tested algorithms has some inherent shortcomings. The ultimate goal is to identify these restrictions and suggest methods either to overcome them or to make relevant modifications. The communication-based limitations are investigated for each of the tested algorithm to assess the practicality of application, while the economic impacts of additional hardware to determine fault direction in the distribution network are also considered. <br/>The above substantial assessment of all the piloted protection schemes to determine their feasibility for the protection of modern distribution networks has not been performed previously, which puts a rather unique perspective to this study.<br","Piloted protection; Distribution Network; Wind Energy; Distributed Energy Resources; Protection of Future Networks; ABB; Transient-based directional protection; line differential protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The HHS, or The Hague University of Applied Sciences in Delft, was the most sustainable building for the years 2011-2012. Naturally, the building also incorporated features and capabilities which can help an engineer to study methods of making a smart building, better. <br/>Using sensor driven data from stored databases in the building, optimization and analysis tools have been developed for the building, at the room level. These analyses are automated into the toolbox for any given room of the building, with minor changes. The goal is to help an expert analyze the room in a quick and efficient manner. <br/>Using the indoor/outdoor climate data, occupancy related profiles, and internal heat loads, the model can also generate predictive patterns and determine the explanatory power of each of these variables on the thermal energy demand of a room. To do this, the Toolbox is designed with two predictive modeling techniques, unique in their own ways. The first being a Multivariate Linear Regression model, that allows for estimation of thermal demean based on a linear thermal balance equation of the room. This is followed by the use of Artificial Neural Networks, to dive deep into the intricacies of the complex data of a room, especially in the case of a highly controlled indoor climate of a room. The goal here was to understand the predictive capacity of these techniques over a) real time data, and b) over the data belonging to a room and not the entire building. <br/>Finally, looking outwards to optimizing energy demands of buildings, this Toolbox, aims at estimating quick wins that can be gathered from a smart building, to reduce energy demand further and tend the building towards nearly zero energy in the future. <br","sustainable consumption; building performance optimization; Neural Networks; Sensor data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Installaties2020",""

The Triple Bottom Line of social, economic and environmental sustainability are the fundamentals for the criteria on which the alternatives have been evaluated. Also, constraints of the systems in which the transport packaging must function in have been established. The criteria are important aspects like environmental impact, costs, food safety, ergonomics and logistics performance. Weights have been identified to show the relative importance of the criteria. The identification of the importance of the weights has been done by conducting a questionnaire to actors in the food delivery supply chain of PostNL. The method which has been used for the determination of the weights is called the Best-Worst Method (BWM). The alternatives have been assessed on the criteria and compared to each other. This has been done conducting a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA). The scoring of the alternatives on the criteria has been done using interviews, questionnaires, calculations models and experiments.

Thus, the design of the product is decided by satisfying the aforementioned criteria. However, when the whole supply chain is under study, the process is not so straightforward and the related science field is Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). In this master thesis the effects of the food industry specific supply chain sustainability criteria on the package design will be investigated. With a thorough literature review those criteria are going to be identified, while with interviews data about the current package alternatives of certain products will be collected. With these inputs a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem is formulated and will be solved with the use of the Best-Worst Method (BWM). On the one hand, the BWM achieves the ranking of the supply chain sustainability criteria by estimating their respective weights and on the other hand the selection of the optimal design among the alternatives. The implementation of the analysis took place for three selected products of the Kraft Heinz Company; the Heinz Tomato Ketchup, the Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise and the Heinz Beans. The preferences of the supply chain members of these selected products were documented and the optimal package designs were selected. It has to be underlined that equal importance was given to the weights of the six different supply chain members and the three dimensions of sustainability. The dispenser Sauce – O – Mat was selected as optimal for the sauces, while the Can for the beans. It was proved through what-if scenarios that modifying the weights that that decision-maker assigns to the preferences of the supply chain members and the importance of the dimensions of sustainability has an effect on the selection of the optimal design. In the end, a decision-making tool was created that improves the selection process of package alternatives in the food packaging industry.","Sustainability; Sustainable Supply Chain Management; Sustainable Packaging; Food Packaging Industry; Multi Criteria Decision-Making; Best-Worst Method; SSCM; MCDM; BWM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-24","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To cater the volatile demand of power supply, most of the gas turbines have to be flexible to changing loads. Closer the load is to full load, more is the impact on gas turbine emissions. In order to mitigate the effects of emission rise, a shift towards emission reduction techniques are being adopted. Of the available options, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is a promising option for good part load performance and emission reduction. EGR is a technique to reduce the flame temperature by recirculating the products of combustion into air intake and replacing part of the oxygen content with inert constituents such as CO2. This leads to reduced NOx emissions and increased CO2 content at the exhaust for effective carbon capture. Despite these advantages, the introduction of an oxygen-depleted oxidizer leads to changes in combustion behaviour giving rise to flame stability issues. In this thesis, a chemical kinetic model to predict emissions in a lean premixed combustor coupled with EGR, is built using chemical reactor networks (CRN). A CRN model was developed by splitting the whole combustor volume approximately in half before and after the recirculation zone. The first half was further partitioned into the flame reactor and the recirculation reactor. The flame reactor volume<br/>is set based on the chemical time scale approach. This approach quantifies the flame zone volume based on the difference in reaction kinetics for different oxidizers. The model was also validated with results from the literature for various flame cases with similar flow fields and was in good agreement with the data. Various chemical mechanisms and their emission prediction ability are investigated. GRI-Mech 3.0 is found to accurately predict the emissions for a given set of operating conditions. The effect of change in oxidizer composition with different amounts of CO2 is investigated. As a consequence of O2 starvation in the oxidizer, NOx formation is inhibited and CO levels are escalated.<br/>At the same flame temperature, NOx levels reduced by a maximum of 40%, whereas the CO levels rose simultaneously as hgh as 50%. A parametric study on varying the combustor pressure indicated a rise in NOx levels and drop in CO levels with increase in pressure. The pressure rise augmented the NOx formed through thermal pathway and lead to the rise in NOx beyond 1800 K. On the other hand, CO2 dissociation to CO is suppressed by the rise of pressure, hence decreasing its magnitude. The impact of using wet EGR is investigated and compared with results of dry EGR. It is observed that NOx reduction is enhanced by 5-10%. Whereas the CO levels is escalated by 10-20%. The combined kinetic effect of CO2 and thermal effect of H2O is found to be reason for the change in emissions. This indicates an enhancement in combustion reactivity. Hydrogen injection raised the NOx levels by 5-10% and the CO levels dropped by a maximum of 12.5%. CO level suppression was a clear indication of the augmented flame stability and was found to be achieved with a slight compromise on NOx levels. Additionally, the effect of premixer efficiency is tested by discretizing the volume as parallel reactors with varying equivalence ratio inputs. Due to decreased premixing, unmixedness leads to various rich and lean pockets inside the combustor. This is a reason evident rise in both NOx and CO levels with decreasing premixer efficiency.","Gas Turbines; Chemical Reactor Network; Exhaust Gas Recirculation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Sustainable Process & Energy Technology","",""

Due to the decreased number of available nurses, the workload for the nurses at hospitals has increased. For this reason, it is important to level the number of required beds at the holding and recovery department. By doing so, the workload can be reduced, beds will be available for emergency surgeries, less surgeries will be cancelled due to the lack of beds and less staff will be needed. <br/>The thesis starts with introducing an analytic calculation of the number of required beds at the holding and recovery department. These calculations consider a stochastic length of stay (LOS) distribution for each surgery type. Making use of the analytic calculation and the stochastic length of stay, several solution methods are developed. The first solution method includes a formulation of the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). The exact calculation of the number of required beds is not linear, so the objective function is simplified. The ILP minimises the number of expected beds. <br/>The other solution methods uses the start and end times of each surgery. These start and end times are spread using two algorithms called Fixed Goal Values and Flexible Goal Values.<br/>Data from an Academic Medical Centre in the Netherlands is used to determine the LOS distributions and to find solutions for the ILP and the algorithms.

This system is based on the popular mel frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCC) features and a Gaussian mixture model(GMM) classifier. The primary contribution of this thesis is an extension to the standard MFCC based features. While it’s known that system performance is strongly dependent on the window size used in the calculation of the MFCCs, we pose that limiting the feature extraction to a single window size limits performance. In this work we examine simultaneously using MFCC features obtained from different window sizes. Using this method we show a significant increase in performance over a baseline system using the standard MFCC features.Besides this we introduce features based on the self-similarity matrix. While these measures are normally primarily used for visualization and structure detection we show significant differences in the distributions of obtained similarity values and attempt to use this for classification. While the obtained performance doesn’t show a significant increase compared to the baseline system the class based feature distribution differences suggest the method warrants further study.Finally we examine methods of adapting GMM classifiers for the instrument recognition task along the lines of different learning strategies. Here we examine the problem as a case of multiple instance learning, semi-supervised learning and learning in the presence of label noise.Finally we give suggestions for further examination of the MFCC extension, improvements of the self-similarity features and instrument recognition dataset creation.","machine learning; MFCC; Self-similarity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the depletion of light oils in reservoirs, it becomes economically favourable to harvest heavy crude oils to contribute to meeting the ever growing energy demand. A suitable candidate for the transportation of these very viscous oil is by means of core-annular flow. Core-annular flow is a flow regime of liquid-liquid two-phase flow, where a low viscous fluid in the annulus (water) is used to lubricate a high viscous fluid in the core (oil). The pressure drop is considerably reduced compared to single phase oil flow at the same oil flow rate.<br/><br/>In this study the influence of the oil viscosity on oil-water core-annular flow through a horizontal pipe is investigated experimentally. The fixed oil flow rate is set at 0.35 l/s at which the watercut is varied between 9% and 25% and the oil kinematic viscosity is altered by heating up the oil in a range from 3000 cSt at 20 °C to 400 cSt at 50 °C. Pressure drop measurements for stable core-annular flow are recorded with an electronic pressure transducer and are scaled with the calculated pressure drop of single phase oil flow. <br/><br/>Results for the scaled pressure drop at room temperature are compared to results by Ingen Housz et al. It is concluded that for increasing oil-water viscosity ratio, the scaled pressure drop decreases. At the highest considered viscosity ratio, the scaled pressure drop is almost independent of the watercut. Two models to predict the pressure drop (by Brauner and by Bannwart) are evaluated and deviations between the models and measurements are discussed. Visualisation by means of high-speed camera is applied, where a mirror is placed on top of the visualisation section to capture the front and top view simultaneously. For decreasing oil viscosity, the oil-water interface shows a more irregular wave pattern with shorter wave lengths.","Multiphase flow; Core-annular flow; Experimental study; Oil-water; Viscosity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Folkersma, M.A.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","With growing energy demands and a need to switch to a sustainable source of energy key stakeholders are considering the use of high altitude wind energy systems. TU Delft and its start up company kitepower are key stakeholders investigating the commercial viability of this technology. With this goal the research group has developed several kite systems capable of accessing high altitude winds. It is believed that the low investment cost and high performance of kites could lead to a lower cost of energy. Concepts currently being considered involve a leading edge inflatable (LEI) kite that is controlled by an on-board control unit and is connected to a ground-based generator. Once the kite is deployed to the required altitude it enters a power generation stage where it is flown in a figure eight routine. This routine is controlled by the on-board control unit that pulls on tethers that are connected to the tip of the kite. This process is followed by a retraction phase where the kite is pulled back in. The goal of the system is to maximize energy production in the generation phase while limiting the energy consumed in the retraction phase. It is critical to assess and improve the kite design and its performance at all stages of operation such that the net power production can be maximized. While significant advancements have been made into the performance for normal flight there is a lack of research on the aerodynamic performance when there is control input to initiate a turn. The shape of the kite and the high angle of attack at which the kite is flown results in complex flow behavior involving separation, flow vortices, flow reattachment etc. This poses several challenges to maintain accuracy. A computational approach involving a steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier Stoke (RANS) simulation is believed to be a computationally viable mode of analysis to capture the flow behavior. This thesis details the approach used to improve results attained using this method and understand the influence of deformations associated with control inputs on the aerodynamic performance of the kite. A control input is simulated using a finite element model (FEM) with the Abaqus software by reducing the length of the right steering and increasing the length of the left steering line by 0.5 m. This results in the right side reducing its curvature and being pulled towards the kite control unit (KCU). Whilst on the left side the bridle lines are less tensed, leading to an increase in curvature. The turning performance is governed by the offset and variations in magnitudes of forces. Meshes are generated that attempts to minimize geometry alterations whilst still maintaining high quality. The influence of boundary layer parameters are investigated. A trade-off is made where the influence of key parameters on accuracy and computational time is evaluated; where applicable improvements are made. Both the global as well as the local parameters of the kite in normal as well as turning orientation are analyzed. The results show that control induced deformations lead to a percentage reduction in the lift, whilst the effect on the drag is minimal. It is further seen that the kite initiates stall at an angle of approximately 40 degrees. The stall behavior is initiated at the mid-span of the kite and gradually moves to the tip. The turning performance is measured by looking at the yaw moment. The magnitude of this parameter is linked to the offset and magnitude in force vectors at the tip. Due to the delayed stall at the tips, it is observed that the yaw moment increases beyond 40 degrees. Accuracy issues using this method were seen when performing a validation study on a profile similar to that of the kite. These issues could be due to limitations of the method or potential errors in the reference study. It is recommended to reevaluate the validation study before using this method for detailed flow analysis. It is concluded, that in order to fully trust the relevance of the results, one would have to have to conduct a validation study.

On that note, LVDC microgrids have become an attractive option for efficient integration and distribution of high-quality power to commercial, residential and data center facilities as well as in propulsion and automotive power systems. However, the lack of standards, guidelines and practical experience are among the main reasons for holding the large scale integration of DC at the low-voltage distribution level back. The main challenge to be tackled in order for low-voltage DC grids to emerge from small DC nano- and micro-grids to a full scale DC distribution grid is the development of economically feasible, safe and reliable protection equipment and techniques. In the context of this thesis a fault detection and location method for ultra-fast fault selective current interruption is being proposed without the need of any additional control and/or communication requirements. In order to experimentally validate the proposed fault selective protection (FSP) algorithm a bi-directional 400V/20A solid-state circuit breaker prototype has been developed and tested utilizing a full short-circuit protection scheme with additional inrush-current limiting control functionality for grid start-up.","Solid-state protection; Fault detection; DC circuit breakers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-22","","","","","",""

While MPM has been proven to be useful in slope stability, foundation and seabed ploughing modelling, the application of boundary conditions is still a challenge,<br/>because the location of the boundary is unknown in MPM. <br/><br/>Boundary conditions have currently been applied to fixed boundaries with a known location. These conditions can be applied directly onto the background grid. In this thesis the concept of applying boundary conditions to the background grid has been expanded to boundaries, which do not coincide with the background grid. This technique can thus also be used for moving boundary conditions. Therefore, the research question of this thesis is: Can boundary conditions on moving boundaries be appropriately applied to the background mesh of an MPM in slope stability problems?<br/><br/>The location of the boundary is not defined by current versions of MPM. Thus an edge detection method was constructed to locate the boundary based on the information provided by MPM. The Volume of Fluid method (VOF) and the Surface Marker Method (SMM), two edge detection methods used in fluid dynamics, have been tested. Moreover, a new implementation of the Level Set Method has been developed in this thesis, which uses a composite Bézier curve to define the boundary. The method has been called the Proximity Field Method (PFM). PFM locates the boundary based on the distance towards a material point, VOF uses the volume of material at a location to determine the location of boundaries and SMM places fake material points at the initial boundary to track it.<br/><br/>The accuracy of VOF proved to be too small for the application of boundary conditions. SMM gave a better representation of the boundary at small strains in comparison to PFM. However, the main advantage of MPM is the possibility of large strain modelling, which SMM could not handle. PFM was able to handle these larger strains and was therefore chosen as the basis for the application of boundary conditions.<br/><br/>PFM’s representation of the boundary was improved to be useful in the application of boundary conditions. Smoothing of the surface together with an equal spacing of the material points in the initial condition have improved the representation of the boundary. Moreover, the computation cost had to be reduced, because it was too high after the initial implementation. <br/><br/>Finally, PFM has been used to apply a surface traction to MPM. The surface traction must be distributed from the boundary to the nodes of the background grid. This technique has been tested by applying a load to the top of a soil slope. As intended, the load is transferred to the background grid and changes according to the location of the boundary. As expected, the deformation of the slope is increased due to the application of the load. So, the concept of applying boundary conditions on moving boundaries to the background grid has been proven to work. <br","Material Point Method; Boundary conditions; Proximity Field Method; Slope stability; MPM; PFM; Edge detection; composite Bézier curve; Level Set Method; Surface traction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The main challenge in realizing novel systems is to process light information in such a way that new insights are discovered. There are typically two ways to measure and process light: through photodiodes, which are cheap, but offer little information; or through cameras, which offer much information, but are expensive and create privacy issues. There is however a third type of sensor that has not been investigated much in lighting systems: color sensors. Color sensors can be viewed as a middle-of-the-road approach between photodiodes and cameras. Color sensors are inexpensive, yet provide more information than simple photodiodes.<br/>This thesis proposes two novel color sensor-based methods to enable (i) a dynamic tunable lighting system and (ii) a light-based indoor tracking system. The former allows retailers to present their merchandise in an appealing way to their customers (by adapting the light in their shops based on the products' colors). The latter makes it possible to track objects by exploiting solely their exterior color (without modulating the light source or requiring objects to carry optical receivers). Our experiments indicate that the methods we propose are able to handle the complex lighting conditions one would encounter in realizing a dynamic tunable lighting system. Furthermore, our results prove that indoor tracking of objects is possible, given that objects are sufficiently distinct in their color. The accuracy of correctly identifying, and thus tracking an object is found to be 91.4%.","Color Detection; Color Sensor; Color Temperature; Automatic tunable white lighting; Passive Sensing; Indoor Tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-30","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

For quanum processors, promising qubits seem to be NV-centres in diamond. Such processor is divided into processing units (PUs), each comprising an NV-centre with several carbon spin qubits, and they are interconnected with each other by optical links. The qubits within a PU can be modelled as nodes in a star graph and the optical connections as connections between the centres of the star graphs, such that the centres with their interconnections form a complete graph. We call the overall graph a fully connected star graph. In order to execute a quantum circuit, multiple pairs of qubits should be brought together in PUs at different times, which requires planning. Sorting the qubits is done via swaps. A swap within a PU can be performed easily, however, swapping between different PUs is done by teleportation, which is much more costly. Therefore, we neglect the costs of swaps within PUs. Parallellisation of swaps between PUs is done in a step. The less steps are used, the faster the quantum circuit is executed. In practice, as we are interested in fast computations, we often want to minimize the number of steps. The following problem is addressed. Given a current distribution of the qubits over the nodes in the fully connected star graph, and given a wanted, permuted distribution, minimize the number of swaps and/or steps to route the qubits from the current to the wanted distribution. At the moment, no efficient algorithm exists to sort the qubits especially in fully connected star graphs. Efficient solutions are presented in the form of algorithms. It is shown that qubit moves in fully connected star graphs can be scheduled efficiently, such that the number of moves is minimized. Guide lines are given to minimize the execution time too.","sorting algorithm; star graph; quantum processor; routing; planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transition is a complex phenomenon and various parameters decide how a boundary layer undergoes transition to turbulence. For a hypersonic cone boundary layer, the linear stability theory predicts the second mode waves to be the most unstable instability wave. Hence studying the second mode wave development is crucial from the point of view of hypersonic boundary layer transition control. The second mode waves cause density fluctuations which enables these structures to be visualized in a schlieren image. This thesis applies the wavelet analysis to schlieren images to study the growth of the second mode waves in a hypersonic boundary layer. The wavelet analysis is a signal processing technique which allows to studywaves in frequency/wavelength spectrumwithout loss in temporal/spatial information unlike conventional techniques like the Fourier analysis. High speed schlieren visualization experiments were performed on a 7± half angle cone in the high enthalpy shock tunnel in Goettingen (HEG), and the images which successfully captured the instability waves were used for the present study. By applying the wavelet analysis to schlieren images the following is concluded 1) the second mode waves amplifies structures towards the boundary layer edge, 2) A linear wave packet has higher amplitudes concentrated at the leading edge, which gets redistributed towards the center first and then later to a uniformdistribution over the whole length of the wave packet, 3) the first harmonic of the second mode wave develops in regions of strong second mode growth, 4) analysis on the growth rates of the second mode fundamental and its first harmonic showed that in regions of harmonic growth there was fundamental wave decay and vice versa, implying a possible energy exchange between the two waves and 5) strong low frequency waves were also detected in the schlieren images, these waves were more dominant during transition while the second mode waves and its harmonics die. The results from the study sheds more light into the instability development in a hypersonic boundary layer in the following ways: 1) the property of the second mode waves to amplify structures near the boundary layer edge explains why early researchers observed these waves close to the boundary layer edge, 2) linear wave packets with higher amplitudes concentrated at the leading edge of the wave packet, which was predicted from DNS simulations has been experimentally verified, 3) interaction between the fundamental wave and its first harmonic is shown by analysis on the spatial growth rates and 4) the strong presence of low frequency structures during boundary layer transition shows the second mode instability is not the only dominant instability for the hypersonic cone boundary layer under adiabatic wall conditions, as predicted by the linear stability theory.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For the new Jakarta underground rail network, imminent extension of the North-South Line Phase 1 (NSL-P1) tunnel heads towards the northern part of city. One of the engineering challenges that exist in the area is the substantial amount of reported surface settlement over the years, which is indicated by the continuous sea wall improvement project and the increase of flooded area. The recent GPS survey reported an average subsidence rate of 5 centimeters per year and could reach a maximum of 15 centimeters per year on several hotspots in North Jakarta.<br/>Being an underground structure, the rail tunnel would be affected by the settling environment and the reciprocity can be expected. Operational interruptions of the tunnel could occur in the future as a product of differential structural displacement. On the other hand, alterations in settlement rate or pattern must also be anticipated. The aforementioned reciprocity underlines the importance of structural and geotechnical assessments in the area. The assessment then can be used as a reference to determine and improve the safety level of the tunnel as well as the surrounding infrastructures.<br/>The study was commenced with the investigation of prevalent driving factors of Jakarta land subsidence from the preceding researches. The initial stage of the study elaborated the concepts used in the analysis, including geotechnical data interpretation, soil consolidation and creep, numerical model formulation, and past studies regarding the loads on bored tunnels.<br/>A segment of proposed North-South Line Phase 2 (NSL-P2) tunnel was selected for this study. The selection was motivated by the the amount of available geotechnical information and the severity of differential land subsidence in the respective area. Longitudinal and cross-sectional two-dimensional numerical model of the selected segment were developed in Plaxis 2D, based on the combination of in-situ soil tests and the outcome of earlier studies about Jakarta geotechnical characteristics. Into the model, four time-dependent groundwater level scenarios were assigned to simulate the surface settlement. As the research emphasizes on the long-term settlement, a 100-year study period was chosen and started in the year 2000.<br/>Given that the NSL-P2 tunnel design has not been confirmed at the time of writing, the numerical study adopted an identical design to the NSL-P1 tunnel. A 6.65-m diameter concrete tunnel was added into the model at an average depth of 15-m. From the longitudinal numerical analysis, total structural displacement in time and additional longitudinal forces were obtained. Subsequently, further analysis was performed on the cross-section, in the transverse direction, which displayed most settlement at the end of the analysis period. At the cross-sectional perspective, the development of forces as well as soil stress around the tunnel ring due to settlement and structural deformation were acquired.<br/>Finally, this study reached a general conclusion which explains that the land subsidence in Jakarta posed non-governing additional loads to the future NSL-P2 tunnel. A majority of the total surface settlement was caused by the consolidation and compression of the upper soil layers. However, special attention must be paid to the station-tunnel interface as substantial differential settlement could take place. To minimize further issues, several design recommendations are provided at the end of the research.","Tunnelling; Jakarta; Settlement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found manganese to be a suitable substituent of lead and the upper limit for these mixed metal perovskites after geometrical calculations as well as experimental verification is found to be around 30%. Though the mixed metal compositions maintain the tetragonal crystal structure of lead based perovskites, a secondary crystalline phase is observed with increased lead substitution. Efforts are made to identify its composition and to remove it by optimizing the thermal treatment as well as the ratio between the other precursors. The optimized recipe for 30% lead substituted showed phase purity as well as good optical and electronic properties. Detailed compositional analysis revealed that, unlike MAPbI3 synthesized using chloride based precursors, in these mixed metal compositions chlorine is also incorporated in the films containing manganese especially near the substrate interface. This suggests that the smaller metal cation has an affinity for the smaller halide anion and that it plays a key role in the initiation of nucleation in such mixed metal (Pb:Mn) compositions. Finally, solar cells were made as a proof of concept incorporating these mixed metal perovskites and devices with up to 1.45% PCE were obtained.","Perovskite; mixed-metal; optoelectronic properties; TRMC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-25","","","","","",""

Using a dataset from the CVPR ChaLearn competition, we build a model predicting Big Five personality trait scores and invite to Interview score of vloggers, explicitly targeting explainability of the system output to humans without the technical background. We use human-explainable features as input, and linear models for the systems building blocks of our layered architecture to ensure a transparent system. This multimodal layered architecture model is an enhancement to our initial submission model to the ChaLearn competition. Six multimodal feature representations are constructed to capture facial expression, movement, speaking pattern, and linguistic usage. Each of these representations is treated individually before the late fusion technique to combine each prediction. For each, correlation analysis is done to get the relation between input features and the predicted traits by considering the significance level of Pearson's correlation coefficient. This way, we split each representation into two feature set; full feature set and subset of a high significance level of features. Three regression techniques are fitted to these two datasets per representation to get the best possible model for each. Then, the six predictions are combined on the second layer of regression to ensure the fair weighting. Our layered regression architecture ensures us to have the best possible model for each representation to make a better overall accuracy. As a result, our enhanced model outperform our initial ChaLearn competition submission model and other systems in the competition. Despite our simple linear model that has lower accuracy than the more complex model on the same competition, we have a strength of the more interpretable model and report description.","personality assessment; regression models; multimodal; video resume; linear model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, the power yield of a wind farm can ﬂuctuate largely over time, which originates from ﬂuctuating wind speed magnitudes. Convection of air, turbulence, humidity and radiation of heat are processes in the atmospheric boundary layer, the lowest region of the troposphere above Earth’s surface, that are responsible for these ﬂuctuations. This region is characterized by a diurnal cycle in which two examinable cases can be found, namely the convective boundary layer (CBL) case during the daytime period and the stable boundary layer (SBL) case during the nighttime period of the diurnal cycle. In the SBL case, the earlier mentioned physical processes result in a cool surface layer and relatively little turbulence is present, whereas in the CBL case a relatively warm surface layer and high turbulence level are present. The Dutch Atmospheric Large Eddy Simulation (DALES) model is used in which wind turbines are implemented with the help of former TU Delft master student P.A. van Dorp. With DALES, a simulation is performed for each case and the output data of the two simulations are analysed and compared to ﬁnd the optimal case in terms of total power yield of a conﬁguration of two wind turbines with the second fully in the wake produced by the one in front. An arbitrary distance of 600m between the wind turbines is chosen, which corresponds to 7.5 times the diameter length of the wind turbines, and a hub height of 80m is chosen. First, the simulations are validated by examining the turbulent kinetic energy proﬁles. Then, the wind speed proﬁles over the domain are analysed, corresponding to the turbulent kinetic energy proﬁles and showing that the average wind speed at hub height for the SBL case is larger than for the CBL case. Furthermore, the wake proﬁles behind the turbines are displayed and compared for the two cases, showing little difference. Finally, the total power yield of this speciﬁc wind turbine conﬁguration is calculated. With an average power yield of 1.71MW for the SBL case compared to 0.90MW for the CBL case, the SBL case is shown to be the optimal atmospheric boundary layer case in terms of power production for this speciﬁc wind turbine conﬁguration.<br","Atmospheric Stratification; Offshore Wind Farm; Power Production; Sustainable Energy; Turbulence; Boundary Layers; DALES; Wake Profiles","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

This interactive network of things targeted for medical applications, is expected to generate market opportunities for patients and businesses by offering real time patient data and remote patient monitoring. The integration of this technology depends on autonomous operation of the modules and sustainable powering of these devices which has proven to be one of its most challenging aspects. <br/>Harvesting energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, besides vibration and heat have been examined closely by research community over the past years. However, the limitations of these sources inside buildings, where solar and wind energy are not always sufficient, shifted the scientific and commercial focus to Wireless Power Transmission. This technology, despite its challenging nature, is becoming very popular because it overcomes the lack of different power sources inside buildings and provides user friendly powering method for battery-less sensor modules.<br/>This thesis aims to investigate various antenna-rectifier topologies, also known as rectennas, and analyze the challenges that arise when harvesting low levels of radio frequency (RF) power. The initial part of this project focuses on the components that constitute a basic RF energy harvester. A system like this consists of an antenna which captures a fraction of the transmitted signal, attached to a rectifier which converts the RF signal into DC power. The development of analytical models and conducted lab measurements will identify the behavior of the rectifying circuit. In order to maximize the power transferred between the antenna and the rectifier, a matching infrastructure is necessary. Harvesting topologies with commercially available components and a matching network will be designed and manufactured along with custom antenna designs that match directly the input impedance of the rectifier. These novice antenna configurations decrease the size and cost of the system as well as improve the power conversion efficiency. Additionally, a power management integrated circuit will be introduced right after the rectifier to buffer the harvested DC power and provide protection for the sensor.

Treatment of wastewater and the resulting sludge is crucial for human health and ecosystem conservation. Furthermore, water supply and treatment is an energy intensive sector where the electricity consumption is projected to increase by more than 80% in the next 25 years.<br/><br/>Sludge treatment is one of the few processes in the water sector where energy can be recovered. And with the environmental issues faced by the sludge treatment sector, it becomes essential to not only optimize the energy recovery but also to holistically analyze environmental impacts of sludge treatment technologies. Thus helping to reduce the human and environmental impact to a minimum. In this report, the current sludge treatment chain in the Netherlands was environmentally analyzed along with two promising technologies, plasma gasification and supercritical water gasification for sewage sludge treatment using lifecycle assessment methodology. The end use of the produced syngas in a gas engine and solid oxide fuel cell was also modeled to find their maximum energy generation potential which is also technologically feasible. Furthermore, impact of anaerobic digestion of sludge in combination with the mentioned technologies was also studied resulting in a total of 9 systems. Literature review and macro modeling of the mentioned systems are used to determine the inputs and outputs over their entire lifecycle. Results from this study show that under the modeled conditions, supercritical water gasification has the potential to considerably reduce environmental impacts since it performed better than other thermochemical conversion technologies in all impact categories. This was primarily due to high energy recovery and relatively clean syngas produced. Furthermore, anaerobic digestion still produced the highest net energy per ton of sludge processed without requiring secondary fuel input. Due to large amount of energy required for drying sewage sludge and material intensive fluegas<br/>cleaning, plasma gasification did not offer promising results for sewage sludge treatment. It can still however offer substantial benefits over incineration especially for waste treatment of feedstock with lower moisture content. Solid oxide fuel cell was the environmentally preferred option over gas engine for electricity generation from syngas due to low nitrous oxide emissions combined with higher energy recovery. Results in literature have shown safe short<br/>term combination of gasifier-solid oxide fuel cell. However, uncertainties with the respect to its long term reliability still remain. Energy generation volatility with respect to the scale of anaerobic digestion and feedstock properties for supercritical water gasification performance present two possible sources of<br/>uncertainties to the above results. The electricity generation from anaerobic digestion is only economically feasible for capacities of 30,000 population equivalents or higher. Whereas, energy generation and consequently the environmental performance of supercritical water gasification is highly dependent on dry solids content. However, with considerable effort going into research and process optimization, this uncertainty can be eliminated soon.","sewage sludge; lifecycle assessment; supercritical water gasficiation; plasma gasification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

One of the most efficient and feasible electricity solutions is via solar energy. Multiple companies are offering such off-grid solutions in India and other developing countries. These companies face several barriers during the implementation process which has dampened the diffusion of the products provided by them. The need for a sustainable business model is felt in this sector to scale up the market. The objective of this research is to augment the diffusion of solar home systems for rural electrification in India. This is done by doing an extensive literature study, case study interviews and field study in India on barriers faced and strategies employed in the market and identification of the business model elements. This thesis presents us an enriched list of barriers and strategies and a detailed analysis of the linkage between strategies and the elements of the business model canvas. The BMC is used as an analysis tool to understand the effect of strategies explicitly and is expressed in the form of a matrix where the implications of strategies on the business model canvas are identified for each element. <br/>The contribution of this research to science is the linkage between strategies and the business model canvas elements. The implications of strategies on the business model canvas are identified for each element. Another scientific contribution of this research is the adaptation of Ortt et al. framework which can now be used for the diffusion of solar home systems in a developing country like India whereas the original Ortt et al. framework can be utilized only for dissemination of high-tech products in the developed nations. The future scope of research in this field has multiple dimensions to offer. Firstly, the relationship between barriers, strategies and business model elements can be further explored where the strategy definition can be enriched. Secondly, a qualitative and quantitative analysis can be performed on the strategy-BMC linkage matrix. This will give a richer meaning to the implications. Thirdly, a comprehensive business model can be generated by building the elements based on the strategy-BMC implications.<br","solar home system; barrier; strategy; business model canvas; strategy-BMC linkage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","28.7041, 77.1025"

His development is complemented in this work with a novel spray model. The improved spray modelling allows the treatment of droplet evaporation in the context of FGM without limiting the complexity of the chemical mechanism.

Based on a qualitative study, we collect data on developers’ practices to handle security requirements of IoT medical applications, and the context of development. Developers’ practices to manage security requirements are compared with recommended practices of the security requirements engineering field. Besides, factors that influence developer’s practices are identified. The results show that small companies do not have a distinctive process to handle security requirements. Moreover, practices, as described by the field of security requirements engineering, are partially adopted. Differences occur because of incorrect assumptions regarding developers’ motivations to address security, methods that do not match development approaches, and the dynamic nature of security.

With increased product diversity and complexity, a scarcity and obsolescence of spare parts is making repair increasingly difficult and economically unviable. The result is an accelerated turnover of manufactured goods, which are more often replaced than repaired. As products are discarded, embedded materials and energy are wasted.<br/>Alternatively, in a proposed Circular Economy, repair is one of the most efficient strategies of product recovery, retaining as much of the manufactured product as possible whilst restoring its functionality. This makes repair a very effective strategy for sustainability, reducing energy and material waste through product life extension. <br/>An opportunity to revive the habit of repair was found in using 3D printing to produce spare parts for the repair job. This project was initiated to explore the application of 3D printing in this manner, to gain insights and exploring the possibilities with currently available means.<br/>The rise of digital manufacturing and 3D printing accessible to consumers has spawned the ‘Maker Movement’; people making their own physical objects, in a DIY ethic. By enabling ‘Makers’ to create their own spare parts, using 3D printing, a first step in the revival of repair is set. <br/>All three aspects of human, technology and business are incorporated in this project, together leading to a viable strategy for sustainability through design. By incorporating Makers in the role of the repairer and introducing 3D modelling and printing technologies, Repair using 3D printing is found to be a viable concept. <br/>Through an iterative process of practical case study experiments, a complete process of reproducing a viable substitute from an original part is developed. Various repair attempts on actual case subjects are done to explore several methods and options, gaining insights in the parameters and boundary conditions of repair using 3D printing. Resulting from this, a series of written guides and supportive tools are designed and published on popular online Maker platforms. The entire process is covered in the project poster, which includes QR-code links to the tools and guides.<br/>The reproduction process covers three main obstacles: setting requirements for the new part, creating a 3D model and 3D printing it. The major challenge in this project was to enable inexperienced users to do so, using only common materials and equipment. The resulting process involves the decomposition of the original part to set requirements, after which it is measured and CAD modelled, or 3D scanned. For the latter, a 3D printable rotating platform is designed, that supports a photogrammetry-based 3D scanning procedure. Furthermore, two questionnaire-like tools are developed to advise users in the critical decisions of which 3D modelling strategy to apply in the particular case, and what material to 3D print it in.<br/>The repair using 3D printing principle is successfully applied to several case studies, resulting in insights and guidelines for future application. A first step in a widespread adoption of this concept is set by providing Makers with a set of guides and tools to reproduce spare parts on their own.

In recent years, due to the surge in the integration of renewable energy resources via power electronic interfaces, distribution networks are evolving from passive networks to modern active networks. This means that their characteristics are time varying following the operating condition of renewable energy sources. Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) is a specially designed hardware and software integrated computer system used to study Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) Phenomena in power systems. As the name implies, it can perform power system simulations at computational speeds equal to real-time operation. However, modelling of detailed distribution networks in RTDS would require many hardware resources. The goal of this thesis is to develop an equivalent dynamic load model for the stability analysis of transmission networks in RTDS, which should not only enhance RTDS’s capability of simulating large power systems, but more importantly, improve the accuracy of model distribution networks. Most studies about transmission systems do not require a full representation of distribution networks. However, the dynamic behaviour of distribution networks still needs to be preserved. Therefore, the dynamic equivalent parameters of distribution networks must be sufficient to ensure an accurate representation for the analysis of transmission networks. In this thesis, the identification and optimization of parameters are done using Mean Variance Mapping Optimisation (MVMO), a unique heuristic optimisation technique. The IEEE 34-Bus distribution system is used as a reference model for data collection and is developed in RSCAD, the RTDS software. An external grid is used to represent the transmission system wherein, several disturbances are simulated in order to compare the responses of the reference detailed model and the dynamic equivalent model. Furthermore, the validity of the developed DE load model is confirmed by comparing its behaviour to disturbances that were not<br/>implemented during the parameter optimization process.","Load modelling; RTDS; MVMO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bidding right amount of power is an important issue for the electricity power producers. This issue is very relevant for a wind power producer due to the inherent nature of wind. Wind is characterised by uncertainty and volatility. This study proposes hybrid approaches that use the meteorological forecast of wind power and statistical models to improve the accuracy of the wind power forecast over meteorological forecast. The statistical methods used in the study are linear regression model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour. The production data of ten wind farms in a portfolio, meteorological forecasts of the ten wind farms, total production of the portfolio and meteorological forecast of total production were collected for 532 days for every hour. These data were used to train and test the hybrid models. These hybrid models are then compared empirically with the meteorological forecasts. It is found that, for the data used for the study, hybrid model using artificial neural network performs the best but only slightly over the linear regression model. Followed by artificial neural network and linear regression model is support vector machine. Followed by support vector machine is K-Nearest Neighbour model.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Helicopters are complex and expensive aircraft with a level of technology that is immature compared to fixed- wing counterparts. Helicopters suffer from vibratory loads stemming from the main rotor and exhibit control and stability problems in the low-speed flight regime. Operating a helicopter near the limits of its flight envelope may result in unacceptable high structural loads which adversely affects wear and tear of drive train components. Conservative safety regulations lead to high operating cost where a significant part can be attributed to maintenance. Manufacturers and operators therefore strive to make helicopters more capable and reliable in an effort to reduce operating cost. Structural load alleviation offers an attractive option to achieve this goal by reducing component damage accumulation and subsequent required maintenance.<br/><br/>This thesis investigates structural load alleviation in the tail rotor drive train of the UH-60 Black Hawk. The Black Hawk provides a compelling case for load alleviation research because of its ever growing operational weight and resulting increase of drive train load levels. Furthermore, the lifetime of the UH-60 is to be extended so that it will fly for many years to come. Current research and applications of rotorcraft structural load alleviation focus on the main rotor but less attention is given to tail rotor drive train components. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by investigating manoeuvres that result in critical dynamic loads in the UH-60 tail rotor drive train. A survey of pertinent literature and interviews with helicopter pilots indicate that pedal inputs for left-hand turns in hover lead to high dynamic loads in the UH-60 tail rotor drive train.<br/><br/>A flight simulation model is constructed that offers the novel capability to predict dynamic loads in tail rotor drive shafts. This model consists of an available high fidelity engine model and existing rotor models coupled by a multi body dynamics tail rotor drive train model with properties that are based on component measurements and CAD drawings. Experiments are conducted to determine the relation between manoeuvre aggressiveness and dynamic loads in tail rotor drive shafts. Based on the results a manoeuvre load alleviation control strategy is devised to reduce dynamic loads while ensuring applicable Level 1 handling quality requirements. Application of this control strategy will decrease dynamic loads during left-hand yaw manoeuvres in hover. Furthermore, the results highlight what reduction in loads can be achieved for varying levels of manoeuvre aggressiveness. These findings may aid in the design of flight control systems that incorporate tail rotor drive train load alleviation objectives.","UH-60; TRDT; Handling Qualities; Structural Load Alleviation; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In recent years, the concept of high entropy alloys (HEAs) has gained increasing attention due to their unique compositions, microstructures and properties. High entropy alloys are defined as solid-solution alloys with 5 or more principal elements in equal or nearly equal atomic fractions with the elemental concentrations ranging from 5 – 35at%. This new class of materials are considered to be potential alternatives to the conventional materials which are currently being used in the different fields such as structural, nuclear, automotive and aerospace industries.<br/>In this study, the determination of phases and microstructural properties of FeNiCrCo and FeNiCrCoAl high entropy alloys with nearly equi-atomic concentrations and their influence on the hardness of the material after undergoing different thermo-mechanical treatments was studied. The combination of different techniques such as, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) were used to determine the phases present in the alloy systems for different experimental conditions. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to observe the microstructural evolution in the material. Vickers hardness tester is used to determine the hardness values.<br/>FeNiCrCo high entropy alloy system was found out to be a single-phase FCC system for all experimental conditions whereas FeNiCrCoAl contains a mixture of BCC, FCC and Sigma phases. The hardness values were correlated to the phases present and the microstructural properties of the alloy. This study provides an overview of the behavior of these alloy systems from intermediate to high temperature range for two different starting conditions, as cast and hot rolled. This work can be considered as a first step to fully understanding the potential of these high entropy alloy systems to serve as potential alternatives to the conventional alloys currently used.","High Entropy Alloys","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Many regions in the world depend heavily on expensive desalinated water for fresh water consumption, in particular tropical areas. Current mainstream desalination technologies (Reverse Osmosis and Multi-Stage Flash Evaporation) are quite energy intensive and thus costly. Today’s challenge is to design a desalination system that could run with local available renewable energy and provide affordable fresh water, even in the most arid environments. A potential fresh water production method that differs from mainstream technologies is Ocean Thermal Water Production (OTWP). This method makes use of high temperature and high relative humidity air in the tropics and condenses it against a cooled fresh water loop in a packed bed column. The system is expected to deliver fresh water at a competitive level once built at a larger scale. This master thesis project improves a previously researched OTWP model and validates the model by testing its output values against experiments done using an experimental setup at the TU Delft P&amp;E laboratory. Taking into account the previous work done during the thesis of van der Drift [49] and Lopez [30], the theoretical background for building an OTWP model has been further described and expanded in this thesis. Three different direct contact condensation theories have been thoroughly examined. The first two theories suggest that heat and mass in the DCD are transferred through a constant laminar film on the packing [38] [1] [4]. The third theory is an add on to the laminar film model, and suggests that heat and mass is also transferred through the creation and dynamics of small droplets within packings [34]. The model and its 4 main submodels are fine-tuned to be able to reproduce the thermodynamics occurring in the experimental setup. The model is tested under different steady state conditions using experiments, to provide insight on the model’s robustness and reliability. The final improved simulation model is used to present conclusions on heat transfer, mass transfer and water production rates for the experimental setup. A brief economic analysis of the system is performed to arrive at an energy price of water for the OTWP experimental system. Although the final energy price for the OTWP setup is quite unfavorable, 14 kWh/m3 as opposed to 2-3.5 kWh/m3 for current desalination systems, tips to improve a possible future pilot facility are proposed. Here high yield and low cost are key requirements, and the design of a future pilot facility needs to be optimized using these two pillars.","Atmospheric water extraction; Ocean thermal water production; Direct contact condenser; fresh water production; psychrometrics; experiment; model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Sustainable Process & Energy Technology","",""

Especially when you are a child and you cannot fully understand or imagine what is going to happen to you. A clinical environment that contains ‘scary’ looking medical equipment does not make you feel at ease. On the contrary, this can be experienced as confronting and can create anxiety. This master thesis focuses on improving the treatment experience of children that visit the Reinier de Graaf hospital. <br/><br/>The research that was done during this project gives insight in to the aspect that have a negative and positive influence on the experiences that children currently have when visiting the hospital for treatment. It shows that, at the children’s department of Reinier de Graaf, the medical staff already provides good support to children and their parents, by preparing them for and guiding them through treatment with care. This ensures a reduction in the initial stress and anxiety experienced by the child. However, the medical appearance of their treatment room causes the child and its parents to feel uncomfortable. The high amount of negative stimuli that is present in the treatment room, caused by the medical equipment, reinforces the initial stress of the child. This is in conflict with the effect that the medical staff tries to achieve and negates their efforts. In this master thesis a solution to this problem is explored, which resulted in the concept of Treatment Tales. <br/><br/>Treatment Tales transform a visit to the treatment room into an engaging and lively experience for children and their parents. This is achieved by turning the room into a fantasy world that comes to life during their time in the room. It is visualized with an illustration on the wall, which becomes dynamic with the use of projection and audio fragments of calming nature sounds. A short tale is printed to introduce the story behind the dynamic illustration. This tale can be read to the child before or during the treatment.<br/><br/>Treatment Tales makes children and their parents feel more comfortable before and during the procedure and reduces their level of stress and anxiety. The ultimate goal is to improve the treatment experience and to decrease risk of traumatic experiences. This is achieved by creating a friendlier atmosphere in the treatment room, by providing a distraction for the children, and by providing opportunities for the parents and the other people in the room to be engaged. <br/><br/>Altogether these components provide a system that creates a layered experience by providing visual, audio, physical, and interactive distractions. This is desired, as the research that was done within this project has shown that a layered and dynamic experience captures the attention for a longer period of time. Additionally, it provides a solution that stays interesting for children that visit the hospital on a regular base, because the animations and the stories can be easily changed and updated. Overall, Treatment Tales provide an easily implemented and effective solution to transform a clinical treatment room to a child-friendly environment.","Design; Pediatric care; Child-friendly; Experience; Hospital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

It is a new mode of transportation where vehicles travel in a low-pressure tube to minimise air friction. Hardt Global Mobility is one of the companies developing this new transportation system. One of the main challenges for Hardt is to attain a highly efficient system that also provides a pleasant passenger experience. To this end, this project aims at designing a passenger-centered embarking and disembarking process for Hardt’s hyperloop system, including a relevant passenger environment both in the station and in the vehicle. <br/>The project follows the method Vision in Product Design (ViP). Literature study on pedestrian flow, interview on crowd behaviours and a field study on (dis)-embarking efficiency contribute to insights on (dis)embarking in the past and current context. An observational study and interviews on passengers’ behaviour with their belongings have been carried out in different modes of transportation. Key values for passengers concerning the luggage are discovered. Afterwards, a future vision of global public travel in 2027 is mapped by extensive literature research. Four possible categories of future public travellers are defined as chaser, passionater, criticizer and adapter. The mission of the project is to let criticizers adapt to the unexpected. <br/>With various ideation techniques, four concepts are presented. The Shift concept is chosen to be elaborated further. It is a concept that divides the passenger compartments from luggage space and influences the (dis)embarking flow by the positioning of doors. Multiple doors on both sides of the vehicle allow passengers to embark and drop the hold luggage on one side and disembark and pick up the luggage on the other side.<br/>An iterative testing process is performed to evaluate 12 aspects of the design in terms of concept performance, user experience and feasibilities. By keeping the valid aspects and reshaping the invalid aspects, a final design is presented. Comparing to the traditional (dis)embarking process, the design saves 40% of the time for vehicles to stay on the platform and 50% of the (dis)embarking time for each passenger. A concept video is shown to 13 passengers at Schiphol Plaza for final evaluation. They liked the simple and clear overall process, the efficient and transparent passenger flow and the smooth and safe luggage system. Boarding tolerance, luggage connection for transfer passengers, the height of the luggage belts and preventing luggage from being stuck can be improved.<br/>Recommendations on the other touch points for hyperloop passengers are listed, including guiding passengers to platforms and doors, the interior, facilities for passengers with reduced mobility, the emergency exit and the door-to-door potential of the hyperloop concept.","hyperloop; passenger flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

A case study was conducted on a favourable area, calculating various cost and CO2 reduction scenarios based on simulated wind speeds.<br/><br/>The DOT type turbine can provide electricity, which costs 23 to 44 US$/MWh. Compared to a 1-MW diesel generator, in the best-case scenario, a wind farm generating 25 MW per hour, can save $4200/hour. Overall, implementing the DOT at the right location, can 1) remove polluting diesel generators from mining operations, 2) save energy costs up to $4200/hour and 3) reduce CO2 emissions up to 770 kilograms per MW per hour.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The Westervelt equation is a wave equation that describes the propagation of a nonlinear plane wave. The goal was to use a first order finite element method and a second order finite element method to solve the Westervelt equation, research the difference between these methods and known solutions and simulate the effect of certain changes in parameters. First we developed an understanding of the nonlinear wave propagation by analyzing the Burgers equation, which is an approximation to the Westervelt equation without attenuation term in another coordinate system. This analysis explains the influence of nonlinearity on the frequency spectrum of the solution. By looking at the derivation of the Westervelt equation changes in wave form during propagation are explained. <br/>We used our own finite element method to make implementations in Matlab to solve the linear wave equation, the Westervelt equation without attenuation term and the complete Westervelt equation. To deduce the implementations, we assumed that our unknown solution was a linear combination of first order basis functions. We then wrote the term of the equations into these linear combination and paraphrased them as matrix vector multiplications. Finally, a backwards differential method was used to solves these matrix vector multiplications iteratively in time.<br/>We compared the solutions of the linear wave equation using FEM to the known analytic solution and compared the solutions of the Westervelt equation without attenuation term to the solution of the Burgers equation. The finite element method cannot not be completely accurate because it depends on a mesh size that is not infinitely small. This means we always use an approximation in space. There is also an error in time, because we use backwards difference scheme to solve the equation iteratively in time. To approve accuracy we should put research into an adaptive mesh, where we choose a mesh with a lot more points around the peaks. <br/>The difference between the first and second basis functions of the finite element method was for the linear wave equation only caused by the small phase shift of the solutions. For the Westervelt equation with and without attenuation term the difference was larger, because of the effect of the nonlinear term on the Westervelt equation. The nonlinearity caused the slope of the wave to steepen when going from a maximum to a minimum. This effect eventually caused the formation of shock waves. The attenuation term inhibited the effect of the nonlinearity on the form of the wave during propagation and thus made the slope of the wave less steep. As a result, no shock waves were formed. The formation of shock waves was immediately clear, when we looked at the solutions at two times the shock wave distance. We concluded from this that the finite element method is not usable after shock waves are formed. We have also shown the frequency spectrum of the solutions and saw the transfer of energy to higher harmonics for the solutions that depended on nonlinearity. The attenuation term damped the transfer of energy and indeed in the spectra we saw less peaks in the higher harmonics. Lastly, we discussed a sudden change in velocity of the wave and calculated the amplitude of the reflected and transmitted wave. We simulated these waves with our implementation in Matlab and concluded that the theory about reflection and transmission agrees with our simulations.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In line with the open innovation paradigm, which states that firms can and should use both internal and external ideas and paths to market, corporates are now actively engaging with startups to deal with these rapidly changing conditions. Recently, an increase is also witnessed in the types of corporate-startup engagement that are available to corporates to create, interact with, collaborate with, invest in or acquire startups. History however shows that corporate- startup engagement is by no means easy. In the past, many engagement mechanisms such as corporate venturing have been widely adopted and soon abandoned. The lack of setting and pursuing clear objectives and failure to establish a link between startup engagement and overall corporate strategy are considered important reasons for the lack of long-term success. This research contributes to the strategic use of corporate-startup engagement by corporate management by exploring the relation between corporate strategy and the concepts of open innovation, corporate venturing and corporate-startup engagement. A new framework has been developed linking open innovation (with corporate-startup engagement as its subset) to corporate strategy and the innovation ecosystem.","corporate-startup engagement; startup; corporate innovation; open innovation; emergent strategy; autonomous strategy; innovation ecosystem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The wind turbines are located in a remote and harsh environment, and are subject to heavy cyclic loading, which may cause fatigue in the support structures. Periodic inspections are required to assess the structural health of the wind turbines. Acoustic Emission Monitoring is the technique of acquiring and processing of the high-frequency sound waves emitted during crack growth. Accurate processing of these signals can lead to detection and localization of fatigue cracks, and further reduction of the need for costly periodic inspections. The factors that determine the coverage area of acoustic emission sensor nodes are source signal strength, attenuation of signal in the medium, and onsite noise level. Together with a cost benefits analysis, this leads to insight into the feasibility of this technique for offshore wind turbines. Investigation of the attenuation is done using a higher-order Spectral Element Method with the input acquired from experiments. The signal that is detected at the sensor has to have sufficiently higher intensity than the surrounding noise. The most severe sources of noise are rain drops hitting the water surrounding the turbine, for which a setup is used in the laboratory, and noise from rotating equipment, for which a measurement has been performed at an on shore wind turbine. The localization accuracy of 5 – 10 percent was shown to be achievable in a laboratory setup. With the coverage area determined, a monitoring strategy for a single wind turbine is proposed, as well as how an acoustic emission monitoring system can be efficiently implemented at a larger scale for a wind farm. It is concluded that acoustic emission monitoring is generally feasible for this application, yet further testing is required in order to decrease the uncertainties and to demonstrate the capabilities to potential operators.","Structural Health Monitoring; Acoustic Emission; Wind Turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-08-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

The experiments revealed that it is possible to deposit graphene locally on the top and sidewalls of MEMS structures.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Nowadays, there is growing consensus, among policy makers and market participants, that Demand Response (DR) is a critical resource for achieving increasing competitiveness and more efficient operation in the electricity system, as well as greater sustainability in the society. When there will be more intermittent energy sources like solar and wind energy in the Dutch electricity system, DR can be one of the cost-efficient solutions for ensuring the security of supply. It is predicted by CE Delft that the need for peak power will increase by 30% in the Netherlands, until 2023.DR is the change in the electricity consumption patterns by the customers in reaction to price signals or to specific requests, with the aims of providing flexibility to the electricity system and meanwhile benefiting from doing so. DR can contribute to system balancing, by the physical influence of load shedding and load shifting. Load shifting involves either shifting electricity use during peak times, or increasing electricity use during off peak times. Load shedding means that the power consumption is irrevocably reduced, which for the industry means lost production. It is found that although most Dutch non-domestic companies are interested in DR, they haven’t investigated much in their DR potential yet. A lot of companies currently see no business cases in DR, because of the current oversupply in flexible energy sources and low electricity prices. Most importantly, some energy consumers (e.g: iron &amp; steel industry, telecommunication industry) have inflexible processes to secure their core business. It is also found that most DR resources come from Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In the Netherlands, first movers among the Dutch non-domestic consumers could be cold stores, water management companies, and greenhouse farmers, due to their flexible consumption processes. However, they perceive huge barriers to implement DR, mainly market complexity, market entry access and transaction costs. A typology of DR programmes in different market segments is summaries in this thesis report, according to previous literatures. However, it is necessary to specify the DR programmes in more detailed levels for practical use in specific national market. In the Dutch electricity market, ETPA and Senfal are two interesting stakeholders who act as enablers to facilitate (automatic) DR behaviour. ETPA as a low-threshold trading platform, serves as a market place to trade DR resources in the electricity short-term markets. They provide bidding portfolios to reduce the market complexity, require the minimum bidding volume of 0.5MW to open more market entry access and offer relatively low membership fee for lowing the transaction costs to SMEs. Meanwhile, Senfal provides knowledge support to consumers, by using intelligent software to optimize their consumption according to the electricity prices. Senfal also represents the typical business mode of Dutch independent aggregators, who cooperation with energy suppliers and provide DR services. The complex barriers need cooperation among market stakeholders to work out with the reliable and cost-beneficial market solutions. TenneT, the Dutch Transmission System Operator (TSO) with regulated tasks, is pro-actively investigating in future solutions, engaging with all the market stakeholders.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","As the complexity of high-tech systems continuously increases, engineers look for possibilities to reduce time and cost of the development of these systems. Architecture-based design enables a front-loaded design process with knowledge reuse. By enabling the automatic synthesis of simulation models, different configurations of an architecture can be realized and simulated efficiently. Current practices are found in the automotive and aerospace industry where architecture-based design is used for the automatic synthesis of multi-physics simulation models. In this way, different architecture options and simulation model variations can be efficiently investigated early in the development process. Multi-body simulations are also frequently used in the conceptual design of complex mechatronic systems. However a suitable methodology to synthesize their simulation models is lacking.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a methodology is developed that makes three necessary improvements to an existing approach that can synthesize only multi-physics models. Firstly, the existing approach assumed that the order of synthesis of the architecture was irrelevant. However, the use of modular and independent simulation models breaks associative links. Therefore, an additional sorting algorithm needs to be introduced during the synthesis of the architecture. An initial successful attempt is made by adding an implementation of Kahn's algorithm. A second addition of the thesis is the definition of a formalized modelling process for modular multi-body simulation models. The formalized process guarantees that the interfaces between simulation models will always work. It also simplifies the modelling approach which leads to the third improvement: clarity of design intent. A procedure was developed and automated that takes away the burden of creating interfaces between simulation models. Consequently, the modeller can focus fully on creating robust models with clear design intent.<br/><br/>The developed methodology is verified with a case study on the conceptual design of a trailing-edge high-lift system. An architecture is defined and parameterized multi-body simulation models are created that realize the components of the architecture. Besides the components that actuate the flap, such as gearboxes, shafts and a motor, four different deployment mechanism types are modelled. The parameterized geometry of the simulation models adapts automatically in order to provide the correct flap trajectory and to form a consistent simulation model. A tool synthesizes automatically all architecture configurations. Interface forces and moments between bodies can be inspected directly and the required actuation torque is found. The sizing of the components is not performed.<br/><br/>The methodology is evaluated for knowledge reuse. For the case-study, this leads from 41\% up to 92\% of reuse of simulation models. However, before these results can be generalized, a trade-off needs to be made from case to case between the time that is saved by the automatic synthesis of simulation models and the time it takes to create the architecture and the compatible simulation models. It can be concluded that the developed methodology enables an architecture-based design approach for complex multi-body simulation models. Furthermore, the methodology is advantageous compared to a traditional design process where all system configurations have to be modelled and analyzed individually.<br","architecture-based design; knowledge-based engineering; multi-body simulation; high-lift device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To assess the influence of handling qualities on training effectiveness, a set of evaluation criteria has been established. These evaluation criteria have been assessed using a series of CS-VLA certification flight tests, supplemented with a DATCOM analysis. The evaluation showed that the BS115 performed adequate in terms of stability and roll performance. However, control forces were found to be unsatisfactory for both the elevator and ailerons.

The detection and quantification of a pathological tremor are essential for diagnosis and therapy. The goal of this research is to detect the frequency of the pathological tremor. Instead of detecting tremors by using a specific medical device, we propose a new architecture jointly using a state-of-the-art pose estimation method and periodicity detection technology to identify pathological tremors from a video. In our approach, an advanced deep neural network is deployed for human pose estimation. A pixel-wise method for frequency estimation is designed to spatially integrate the spectral information of pixels to refine an estimate. <br/><br/>Compared with conventional methods, our method offers significant convenience for both patients and medical staff. Our approach does not need a specific device. Thus it eliminates the error caused by the additional mass of the sensor. The procedure of the test is simple for non-technical staff so that the method decreases the possible operational error.<br/><br/>Each module is evaluated on a real dataset by a series of experiments. Compared with a classic 1D surrogate signal method, our pixel-wise method has a smaller error and deviation on both synthetic videos and real videos. The architecture is finally evaluated on patient videos and shows a promising result. For 21 periodic videos, 13 of our frequency estimations have an absolute error lower than 1 Hz.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

An extensive framework is developed that describes characteristics of different mathematical synchromodal optimisation problems on the tactical-operational levels.<br/><br/>Three different problems are defined using this framework. Solution methods for these three problems are developed in this thesis, with a focus on low computation times so as to facilitate decision-support and real-time flexibility, and a focus on generality so as to make the methods applicable throughout different organisation structures.<br/><br/>In the first problem, it is assumed that the transportation vehicles have fixed time tables and one only has to decide on a container-to-mode assignment, so by what modality-paths all containers reach their destination against minimal total cost. The containers have release times and deadlines. A model that also allows soft due dates is developed. Moreover, the option of using trucks or other ‘infinite resources’ to help fulfil requests is added. With appropriate graph reductions, this problem can be solved to optimality in little time by solving<br/>the minimum cost multi-commodity flow problem on an appropriate space-time network.<br/><br/>In the second problem, the goal is the same but almost any element can be stochastic: for instance, travel times and container release times could be given a discrete probability distribution rather than a fixed value. Rigorous definitions are formulated to capture the generalities in this stochasticity. Multistage stochastic optimisation and Markov Decision Processes are illustrated, but advised against for their computing time: instead, Expected Future Iteration<br/>and 70%-Pessimistic Future Iteration are developed and shown to yield near-optimal results in a small amount of time in the simulated environment.<br/><br/>In the final problem, there are no stochastic elements, but the decision-maker is given control over the vehicle time tables in addition to the control over container-to-mode assignments. This problem is argued to be a departure from classical optimisation problems, but shown to still be strongly NP-hard. An integer linear program is developed to solve the problem, but<br/>the results show that it scales too poorly to solve problems of ‘real life size’ in an appropriate amount of time for decision support. The Greedy Gain heuristic and Compatibility Clustering heuristic are developed: they solve much more limited sub-problems with the ILP, but unfortunately, even these sub-problems require too much computational effort at the wished instance size.<br/><br/>A number of topics for future research are formulated, giving concrete advice on how to solve the second problem more robustly and how to solve the third problem more quickly.","synchromodal; transport; routing; optimal; general","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

To make better decisions based on this data, a system is required that takes operational data and translates it to useful information, accessible in the offce and on the ship through online dashboards. Ultimately, better informed decision making should lead to cost minimisation in the areas of fuel consumption and maintenance. In this research a Ship Performance Monitoring System (SPM System) for operational data of Spliethoff's vessels was developed, after which data analysis was performed with the goal to minimise<br/>operational cost of the vessels.<br/>The SPM System was developed using a Rapid Prototyping methodology. By conducting decision support analysis, data requirements analysis and user requirements analysis, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the system were established and coupled to endusers.<br/>In general, one can state that when developing new information systems, end-user involvement is key. If end-users are not involved from the start, interest will be low, resulting in limited added value.<br/>Using the SPM System, data analysis was performed targeting a number of key questions with regards to fuel efficiency, maintenance and ship operation.<br/>Firstly, from the data analysis it can be concluded that for a Spliethoff S-Type vessel the most fuel efficient speed is 14 knots, both in laden and unladen condition. It is recommended to implement this speed for all voyages where the schedule allows it. Accurate implementation of this speed optimum could result in bunker cost savings of up to 10% over a voyage.<br/>Regarding engine efficiency, the specific fuel consumption (SFC) of the main engines of all three vessels is worse than the specifications given by the engine manufacturer. This is according to expectation, given the fact that manufacturers specifications are attained at different conditions.

In the data analysis different trends are found regarding fouling. Therefore is is recommended to prolong the measuring period to at least a year before drawing any conclusions. If after a year a fuel consumption increase in the region of 5% is measured, it is advised to increase hull cleaning frequency to once every year. Regardless of any measured fouling increase, it is recommended to inspect the hull of all vessels at least twice a year to increase knowledge of fouling.<br/>A ship's crew is of large in uence on the operational cost of a ship. Consequently,<br/>more intensive collaboration between office and ship on the vessel's operation is suggested, using data in a supporting role.

Implementing a newer correction method for wave added resistance will also enhance the system significantly. Thirdly, it is recommended to reduce dependence on manually entered data to a minimum, due to the inherent inaccuracy of manual input. Finally, matching data quality of all different data sources will increase the precision of the system.

Approximately 20% of these new patients are operated with curative intent. This surgical treatment, called pancreaticoduodenectomy leads to a five-year survival rate of 5-10%. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) is a complex surgical procedure that pancreas surgeons have only started to adopt. In the Netherlands, the four pioneering hospitals in laparoscopic pancreatic surgery (Catharina Ziekenhuis (CTZ), Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis (JBZ), Amsterdam Medisch Centrum (AMC) and Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (OLVG)) are still in the beginning of their learning curve. An early assessment of their operative technique could provide deep insight in the differences of the operative method between the hospitals. This is an experimental study to evaluate the LPD procedure with the aim to improve the operative techniques of the four pioneering hospitals in the Netherlands. In each of the four hospitals, the steps of the LPD procedure were defined based on the operation report. For each step of the procedure the risks and risk scores were identified. This was done with a multidisciplinary team per hospital according to the hazard analysis of the Health Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA). In consultation with one surgeon of each of the four hospitals, the risks were converged to relevant risks s according to the adapted decision tree of the HFMEA method. The similar steps of the four hospitals were linked to each other to create an overview of the differences and similarities in process and risks. Finally, risk types and the corresponding causes were identified based on the relevant risks. In all included hospitals, relevant risks were found (CTZ: n = 10, JBZ: n = 16, AMC: n = 3 and OLVG: n = 13). The process steps which contained relevant risks by more than one surgical teams were (1) performing Kocher maneuver and exposing ligament of Treitz, (2) cholecystectomy, (3) mobilising portal vein, superior mesenteric vein and artery, (4) transection gastroduodenal artery, (5) pancreatojejunostomy (PJ), (6) hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) and (7) gastrojejunostomy (GJ). Eight out of 41 relevant risks were accepted by the surgeon of the corresponding hospital (no further action is warranted to diminish the risk). The remaining relevant risks were bleeding (n = 23), HJ failure (n = 4), PJ failure (n = 3) and GJ failure (n = 3). The prevalent reason for bleeding was unable to view or identify anatomical structures of the patient (33%). HJ and PJ failure originated from patient’s habitus and iatrogenic/operative technique. GJ failure originated from iatrogenic/operative technique solely. The HFMEA method provided an overview of the practiced operative methods during the LPD procedure for each of the included hospitals with detailed information of the surgical steps. There are clear differences in the order of several surgical steps between the four hospitals. This information could be used by the surgeons to learn from each other by sharing their considerations and knowledge about specific process steps. <br","Surgical procedure; laparoscopic surgery; Pancreas surgery; HFMEA; Assessment; laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","","","","","",""

With both positive and negative outcomes, the European Commission (EC) had a long learning process where different regulatory measures were introduced and modified according to the results obtained. Despite the fact regional mobile usage has been increasing since the first attempt on regulation, roaming has been limited by other factors such as wholesale and retail prices.<br/><br/>While Europe faces challenges related to political extremism, large refugee influxes, economic stagnation, and scepticism related to European integration, the EC aimed for a tangible policy that could show the benefits of the supra-national body to the citizens. After different economic analyses commissioned by the EU showed a feasible possibility of eliminating roaming surcharges, a new step was proposed. Since mid-June 2017, mobile phone users across the European Economic Area (EEA) started experiencing a new European Union (EU) policy related to the roaming usage. The Roaming Like At Home (RLAH) policy became a milestone in the European political process towards a Digital Single Market. Mobile users were benefitted by avoiding roaming surcharges when travelling across countries of the EEA, while telecom operators were limited in the maximum prices they could charge to other foreign operators for the wholesale market. Operators were protected by fixed price caps and a Fair Use Policy (FUP) aimed to avoid abuses from users, as the differences between domestic markets across Europe are still large.<br/><br/>The EC based the decision in a market failure of the roaming market, which needed regulation to be solved. By analysing the behaviour of the market, the prices across the Union, among other factors, the EC believed that the RLAH policy would be a correct regulatory approach to solve the market failure, while promoting a Digital Single Market across countries. However, the justification was based merely in economic values, usually obtained from a Neo-classical (NCE) or New Institutional (NIE) economic perspective. The social values behind the policy were not explicitly considered in the analysis and were not used as justification for the decision process.<br/><br/>As different journalists, organizations and influential persons argue that the EU has become a technocratic body where the voice of Europeans is not heard, it becomes paramount to understand what is behind the European policies and if the social values are being implicitly considered by the stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. Thus, this thesis aims to answer the following research question: “How can we assess the societal values related to the implementation of the Roaming Like At Home (RLAH) policy of the European Union for the case of the Netherlands?”<br/><br/>The report initially develops a deep analysis on the different steps and motivations of the EC related to the policy, especially in the regulations from 2007 and onwards. It aims to understand the reasons behind the regulations, and concludes that both NCE and NIE are not enough to justify the intervention, using Original Institutional Economics (OIE) for it. A discussion on the public and social values is followed, where specific definitions are used to determine what are the most important social values to be considered within the policy. With the help of experts, a short list of ten values is obtained. <br/><br/>A stakeholder analysis is used to determine which are the actors involved in the policy, including those supra-national bodies, domestic and international lobby groups, telecom operators and regulatory bodies. By using the Best-Worst Method (BWM), a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method which allows to determine hierarchies between non-measurable criteria, the short list of values is used as criteria for surveys performed to those stakeholders willing to answer. In order to determine the position of the Dutch population, as this report scope is limited to the Netherlands, a combination of three stakeholders is used to determine the hierarchy of the social values: the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Consumentenbond and the Bedrijfstelecommunicatie Grootgebruikers (BTG).<br/><br/>The results of the report show alignment between the hierarchy of values of the EC and the Dutch people’s representatives, but strong differences between the latter and the regulators and telecom representatives. Although the stakeholder analysis does show alignment regarding publicly-available interests of some of the stakeholders, such as economic values, the intangible interests seen in the results of the hierarchy demonstrate a different guiding compass for each organization. <br/><br/>The thesis also shows how the actual approach for the determination of the value of a policy is not considering the intangible values that are behind any human person or organization. It is proposed to promote thinking in “humane” markets, rather than perfect markets, and to consider non-measurable criteria to assess the final value of a policy. It also questions whether the policy values can be separated from the individual values, as there is a close relation between them; thus, avoiding considering the individual value perspective of citizens could lead to future problems in the values a policy defends.<br/><br/>As the research faces different limitations, several future steps are proposed. Firstly, it is proposed to analyse whether the results obtained can be discussed with those representatives of the Dutch population in the parliament by comparing their expectations with the answers obtained in the BWM, aiming to analyse the representativeness of political decision-makers towards this policy. Secondly, the research also proposes using the results of the value hierarchy, and attempting to create a Willingness To Pay for values, as some of the considered ones could be measurable in an utilitarian perspective. A third proposal refers to analyse how the hierarchy of values of the policy differs across the domestic markets in Europe by using theories in transplantation of policy, aiming to overcome the geographical limitation of this thesis. Finally, a different theoretical approach could be used with the capability theory, focusing the criteria to be used in the future capabilities of the population, rather than the functionings.","roaming; RLAH; mobile; values; social values; regulation; EU; European Union; Netherlands; policy; BWM; Best-Worst Method; MCDA; stakeholder analysis; telecommunications","en","master thesis","","","","","","The thesis report mentioned that Mr. Sergio De Cola has been Consultant for the ITU.

For SCWG both the temperature and pressure of the medium are increased beyond the critical point of water (373.95⁰C and 220.64 bar). The supercritical water acts as an active reactant and increases the conversion efficiency. Moreover, energy-intensive drying of the feedstock can be omitted since wet biomass can be directly introduced to the process. An important issue related with the wet waste feed is upstream pumpability due to clogging in the pipelines. To understand this behaviour a detailed analysis of the physical parameters responsible for the pumpability of feedstock is imperative. These parameters involve particle size distribution (PSD), dry matter (DM), viscosity and homogeneity. The aim of this research was to identify the physical (rheological) properties of two feedstocks, secondary and digested sludge, and to propose a pre-treatment which could improve system performance. To identify the physical (rheological) properties experiments have been performed in the domain of rheological methods. The PSD has been determined via laser diffraction with the Microtrac S3500. The rheology has been analysed with the Anton Paar rotational rheometer. The effects of particle size, DM content, temperature and shear rate on the shear stress and viscosity have been investigated. The acquired data provided essential information on suitable pre-treatment methods for feedstock preparation. The results revealed that the PSD of secondary and digested sludge was below the maximum tolerated particle size for most pumping systems. The rheology data indicated shear thinning behaviour of the sludge, since viscosity decreased upon increased shear rate. Higher temperatures were also found to decrease viscosity and shear stress of the sludge. For commercial application, the low DM concentrations of secondary sludge (4-6 wt%) and digested sludge (3-4 wt%) need to be further increased. Addition of polymers is discouraged, since it limits pumpability. Secondary sludge (&lt; 5wt% DM) showed a logarithmic correlation between viscosity and DM. Consequently, when DM content is further increased the viscosity will become the limiting factor for pumpability. The issue of pumpability limited by the sludge viscosity could be overcome by performing a pre-treatment with a continuously stirred tank at elevated temperatures. The viscosity is decreased when the fluid is constantly in motion and temperature will further lower the viscosity.","supercritical water gasficiation; rheology; sewage sludge; biomass; pumpability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-22","","","","","",""

Users of the platform will search for a holiday destination just as they normally do, but when they have found a potential location they can easily save it on Tripick. In this way, they will have a collection of potential destinations from different providers at the end of their search. The platform is separated from the websites of the providers and when people want to book, it will be done through the website of the original provider. From the internal and external analysis some main insights are derived which are combined into a final positioning for Tripick, namely ‘Tripick is your personal online travel assistant for group holidays’. Tripick consists of two main USP´s to differentiate itself from competitors. First Tripick as an assistant, in which Tripick will assist on a wider range of aspects of the holiday than competitors do, by not limiting it to the search for an accommodation but also on other aspects of the holiday. Second, the focus on the group process instead of individuals or pairs. The big idea has been set up which captures the brand message of Tripick, namely ‘Your group guide to sparkling holidays’. This is translated into a design language which has an overall appearance of simplicity, pleasure and trust. The colours that will be used are white, green, orange and yellow. Furthermore, straight forms will be used with rounded elements and when possible symmetry will be strived for. The tone of voice will be informal and personal with an inspiring and supportive character. During the ideation the functions of Tripick are designed. Besides the main functions, saving, sharing and rating of accommodations, some sub functions have been designed. These are personalised filters, a travel overview, a cost overview, saving of transportation and activities, different chats and the option to view the site of the tour operator within Tripick. In order to make money with Tripick the business model Leverage customer data will be used. First party data gathered from Tripick will be sold to tour operators. With this data, tour operators can keep the availability of saved accommodations up to date but they can also provide special offers to persuade the customer to book their accommodation instead of accommodations of other tour operators that are saved on Tripick. Tripick will be launched in December 2017, because then people will start searching for their summer holiday. The launch event and the promotion strategy consists of multiple activities, but the main focus will be on social media, especially Facebook. The attraction of tour operators for the business model will start in December 2018, because first enough data must be collected to be able to offer a complete dataset.","Strategy; Design; Online; platform; Tripick","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Rotor angle stability studies using real time digital simulation requires the use of data mining to obtain an insight about the coherency of the system with the variation of the time series data. However, the limitations of the simulation systems as well as the magnitude of the models can lead into difficult study scenarios. By modeling the power systems in real time simulators, electrical studies can be performed faster than with conventional offline simulators. In this thesis project, the Britain baseline system was modeled in the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) using as a starting point and initialization reference, the electrical power model developed for the simulator Power Factory. The model then was reduced using coherency analysis by clustering time-series-data. The same modeling considerations were applied for implementing future scenarios of the GB in the RTDS. For reduction purposes, three main areas describing the North, Central, and South parts of the system were considered in the GB model. The results show that while the area of study is considered constant the other two areas can be replaced by the coherent areas. Thus, less use of racks is required for analyzing the model in the simulator.

Based on a newly proposed performance metric, which normalizes the product of the minimum dislodging force in any direction and the average closing speed with the rated actuator power, a Statically Balanced Force Amplifier (SBFA) was selected as internal force mechanism. In addition to current state-of-the-art drives, which are able to switch between two transmission branches for either high-speed or high-force and overpower the motor because of static-load cancellation with dedicated locking mechanisms, an SBFA realizes a force reduction of approximately 95%. A concept for a drive is developed based on this strategy. By analyzing the three subfunctions of the drive: 1) sizing, 2) forcing and 3) switching between sizing and forcing, five design principles are derived. The SBFA is analyzed under the non-ideal conditions as occur in a gripper drive: a finite object stiffness and a position error in the size adjustment. A topology selection is conducted, which resulted in a concept for a drive consisting of an SBFA with a movable frame and a differential that resolves the motor input in a forcing and sizing branch. The timing of the switching is controlled by an additional non-linear threshold spring and an endstop is implemented to bypass the main spring during switching. An actual prototype for the implementation in the Delft Hand 3 is designed and realized. The mechanism has a cylindrical housing with a diameter of 64 mm and a length of 78.5 mm and weights approximately 460 grams. Experiments are conducted which validate the working principle, i.e. the ability to perform sizing, forcing and switching, of the developed prototype. The maximum output torque is 1.073 Nm. For 5 emulated object sizes, an average torque reduction of 91.5 % is measured. This prototype validates the feasibility to combine an SBFA, NBDM and two different transmission branches. Future work is required to further improve the functionality and asses the performance of the drive.","Statically Balanced Force Amplifier; Clutched Elastic Actuator; Gripper Drive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

The work required for a task is generally just a tiny fraction of the total energy consumed. Most energy wastefully dissipated. Design of the 2 degree of freedom (DoF) Plugless Robot Arm shows that clever design can reduce these energy losses to a tiny remaining fraction. The Plugless Arm is designed to perform a pick-and-place task displacing packages of 1 kg over a vertical distance of 1 m and some additional horizontal distance in a way that is capable of powering the full system.<br/><br/>Maximum energy recovery is achieved by the design of springs in parallel to the actuators such that minimal actuator currents lead to minimal electric heat losses. This requires simultaneous optimisation of the trajectory and the parallel elastic elements. In a Cartesian configuration a novel method is tested which allows for implicit optimisation of an elastic element without additional parameterisation. The optimal parallel spring characteristic can be expressed as a pure function of the trajectory if the system dynamics are defined as a function of position instead of time.<br/><br/>Afterwards the analytical optimal spring is replaced by a mechanism of low mechanical complexity showing similar energy characteristics. The mechanism is translated to a polar equivalent for the 2 DoF arm and optimised together with the trajectory of the arm. The optimal nominal trajectory is followed under undisturbed conditions when applying a pre-computed feedforward control signal to the actuators of the arm. Additional local optimal linear state feedback control is computed by means of Differential Dynamic Programming. All optimisation is done offline. Performance of the controller under disturbed conditions is tested in terms of accuracy as well as energy consumption.<br/><br/>The system achieves a nominal energy retrieval of 3.64 J per cycle of 2.5 s, which is sufficient to power a light controller, the necessary sensors and a special energy efficient gripper. Some energy is left which can be used by the controller to recover from disturbances which extract energy from the system. The controller is also able to recover additional energy from disturbances which add energy to the system.<br/><br/>The implementation of the controller is further optimised to achieve minimal computational energy consumption and memory requirements. By selective reduction of the control law, considerable data reduction is achieved with negligible impact on the controller performance.","robotics; energy efficiency; control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

However, for many of these ships, the detailed design of these systems is put off until the later stages of the design. For most ships, this will create no problems. However, for those complex vessels for which the system design dictates and drives the size and performance of the vessel, changes in a later design stage can be difficult and costly. For these complex ships (e.g. naval ships, pipe-laying vessels, etc), more focus should be spent on system design earlier in the ship design process.<br/><br/>A important aspect of the system design is determining and designing the system topology (e.g. how components within a distributed system are connected). To achieve this, the ongoing PhD research of de Vos [2017] created the ""Ship Distributed Systems Automatic Topology Generator"" (SDS-ATG) tool. This tool combines the fundamentals of network theory and marine engineering to automatically generate a multitude of ship distributed system topology concepts. A genetic algorithm is then used to optimize these topologies with respect to system performance and cost. The performance objective can be related to the vulnerability (or robustness) of the found system topologies.<br/><br/>This MSc thesis focusses on the investigation and development of a vulnerability assessment method, based on network theory, that can be used to assess the generated ship distributed system topologies. The assessment method will be used to better define the performance of a system design, based on the vulnerability of system topologies in early stage design.<br/><br/>To create the method proposed within this thesis, it is necessary to evaluate the created SDS-ATG tool, as well as vulnerability prediction methods and metrics available from literature (and used in other fields). Next, the newly developed vulnerability assessment method is discussed. This discussion is based on the assumptions made to define the method, the steps taken within the method, and the advantages and disadvantages of the method. Finally, the new vulnerability assessment method is verified using hand calculations, and the results of a practical system design test-case are used to show the improvements that can be made with regards to the vulnerability of the system topology design.<br/><br/>To conclude, the developed vulnerability assessment method is seen to greatly increase the capability of the SDS-ATG tool as an eraly stage design tool.<br","Ship design; System design; Vulnerability; Network Theory; Optimization; Resilience; Reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

In the current study we adopt a user-centric approach to apply and experiment with gamification for enterprise crowdsourcing purposes. Through a qualitative study, we highlight the importance of the competitive and collaborative social dynamics within the enterprise. By engaging 75 and 26 employees in a mobile crowdsourcing application across two large multinational enterprises, we showcase the effectiveness of competitiveness towards higher levels of engagement and quality of contributions.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","There has been a quick shift on the way organizations look at the IT value proposition. If in the past decades it was considered a cost-reduction driver, now CIOs view it as a new source of novelty and innovativeness - key factors to respond to changes in the economic, social, and technological environments. IT vendors are required not only to support various IT functions, but also to enhance business value through the internal development of cutting-edge applications and breakthrough services. In addition, CIOs are increasing the number of strategic collaborations as to take advantage of the vendors’ innovation capabilities. This is in line with the Open Innovation paradigm, which has been successfully applied in many domains but whose benefits are still unreap in the IT field.<br/>These trends rise several complications, due to the various challenges that innovation-oriented inter-firm collaborations imply from a managerial perspective. Specifically, it has been argued that inter-firm alignment is a fundamental element to successfully initiate IT innovation partnerships. However, little guidance is available concerning the management of the first phases of such collaborations.<br/>To address this problem, this study explores the vendor-client relationship from three different but complementary perspectives (e.g., organizational, contractual and social), which have been identified as the main dimensions to be considered in the study of inter-firm collaborations and whose alignment between firm is necessary to build successful innovation partnerships. As such, this research proposes a conceptual model where the organizational, social and contractual dimensions represent the independent variables and where inter-firm alignment represents the dependent variable. Furthermore, our model incorporates two additional elements, namely vendor size and relationship age, which represent the moderator variables and influence the abovementioned relationship.<br/>This qualitative study has been carried out in the working setting of AirFrance-KLM Group, a world leader in the airline service industry. Through the analysis on embedded case study consisting of three study cases, it has been possible to capture the three different facets of vendor-client collaborations and identify those elements and conditions critical to achieve inter-firm alignment during the formation of innovation partnerships with strategic IT vendors.<br/>The findings of this research suggest that while all three dimensions need to be addressed during the initial phases of a strategic partnership oriented to innovation activities, the interrelations between social and contractual dimensions and between social and organizational dimensions required a more careful consideration. In regards to the intertwine between social and contractual dimensions, the results indicate that during the early stage of a joint innovation project in the IT environment, a governance based on relational and behavioural elements tends to substitute formal governance, due to a fluidity of goals, requirements and expectations. In regards to the linkages between organizational and social elements, the findings suggest that shared and well-defined organizational practises are critical to foster inter-firm social interactions and support the development of trust and commitment. Interpersonal exchange and mutual understanding are likely to increase when the governance of the collaboration is less centralized and formalized, as well as when more autonomy is given to its members and an integrative work structure exists.<br/>Drawn from the analysis of the moderator variables, Vendor Size turned out to have a great influence in achieving inter-firm alignment. Difference sizes represented an important element that had to be taken into account in aligning the various facets of the collaboration. A smaller vendor requires less effort in building a positive social context, as well as in achieving organizational coordination. On the other hand, it requires more resources to assess its real long-term value and contribution. A larger vendor is characterized by more layered and complex structures, and thus necessitates higher efforts to align processes and actions. However, it also provides a larger sets of skills and capabilities, as well as more industry knowledge and experienced people. In regards to the second moderator, Relationship Age greatly influenced the causal relationship: a longer relationship allowed to avoid complex contractual agreements. On the other hand, a lack of previous joint experience necessitated a higher initial efforts to build trust and assess each other commitment. Conversely, the findings suggest also that long-lasting business relations do not necessarily support initial inter-firm alignment in innovative vendor-client collaborations. Specifically, the study cases provide evidence that also the type of content exchange and the focus of previous business relations may also represent another moderating factor in achieving inter-firm alignment.<br/>Furthermore, this Thesis provides a set of actions to be undertaken to achieve inter-firm alignment by covering the three different dimensions of vendor-client collaborations.<br/>Follow-up research could further support the findings through more quantitative approaches, as well as provide additional insights on the dyad relational and contractual governance, as well as on those organizational factors and practises that enhance the relational and social elements necessary to foster inter-firm alignment.<br/><br/>Key words: IT Service Industry, Open Innovation, IT Relationship Management, IT Collaborations, Airline Service Industry, AirFrance-KLM","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The world of Computational science has witnessed an exponential expansion of sophisticated numerical algorithms in the last few decades mainly to understand minute details and solve complex physical problems. It has established itself as the third pillar of science after theory and experimentation and has managed to gain immense popularity as a mainstream research work among academicians and scientists working in entirely different fields. The Computational Sciences has brought together Mathematicians and Computer Scientists to work in close collaboration on the variety of interdisciplinary research problems. The principal challenge to achieve high performance for computational researchers in near about every front is data traversal, data placement, and memory access pattern which mostly influences floating point performance and energy efficiency. The Data traversal is the soul of high-performance computing. Indeed it is the backbone; the way data travels to the CPU from main memory mainly influences the performance of particular computational kernel on specific machine architecture. The majority of modern computing devices are designed to deliver high performance if data traversal can utilize maximum bandwidth to main memory (DRAM) and make efficient use of hierarchical memory structure. Thus, a hardware optimal data access pattern should be designed to take advantage of the underlying hardware to scale and achieve performance, and that forms the central theme of this work. The more important point here is, expensive hardware or massive computational infrastructure does not naturally invoke high-performance computing but implementation of hardware auxiliary mathematical ideas, cache efficient data traversal strategies, sensible use of parallel programming paradigms and energy aware management of computational resources on machines ranging from very grass-root level primary NUMA system to entire million core server stack does. In this master's thesis, we will first focus on investigating the impact of data traversal patterns on the performance of several micro-benchmarks on Non-Uniform Memory Access machine, and in the second part, we will implement Morton-order Space Filling Curve to improve cache utilization for two numerical methods and analyze performance impact.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","This thesis aims at analyzing the energy flexibility (EF) potential of building structural thermal energy storage (STES) by the implementation of active demand response (ADR) and providing a representative recommendation for building renovation and operation. The objective building type is existing Dutch single-family houses built between 1965 and 1974 which need to be renovated in the (near) future.<br/>Firstly, ADR-event is used to activate the energy flexibility of STES by increasing the setpoint temperature of heat emission system. In order to quantitatively evaluate the energy flexibility potential, three indicators are defined: available storage capacity, storage efficiency, and effective storage capacity, which are time-dependent and closely related to dynamic boundary condition including occupant behavior and weather condition. With the ADR-event of 4 hours and the temperature increase of 2℃, the maximum available storage capacity is around 25 kW which is equivalent to a storage tank with the volume of 1070L with the assumption that the temperature is increased by 20℃ in a hot water storage tank. <br/>Secondly, in building renovation phase, after replacing boilers to heat pumps and implementing PV system to create the interaction between the heating system and the electricity system for ADR-event, the impacts of different building design parameters on energy flexibility are assessed and energy flexibility potential of 15 building renovation options are quantified. The results demonstrate that with the improvement of building renovation level, for example, increasing insulation level or airtightness, the available storage capacity decreases significantly while the storage efficiency shows a better performance in the mild renovation level. Additionally, building with external insulation presents a high available storage capacity while a low storage efficiency. Furthermore, the renovation option with usual renovated external insulation level and 0.4ACH infiltration rate can be recommended to the users or house agencies considering the exploitation of building structural energy flexibility, offering the highest typical effective storage capacity and acceptable robustness to dynamic boundary condition. <br/>Finally, from the operation perspective, appropriate use of STES can increase the penetration of renewable and reduce CO2 emission and operation cost. ADR-event is not beneficial under low PV production condition while 2 pm is regarded as the most profitable and environmentally-friendly ADR-event starting time for all building renovation options with high PV production. As for the future-oriented operation scenario which is with real-time electricity price and without net metering, energy flexibility plays a more crucial role in saving operation cost. Therefore, when starting ADR-event at 2 pm in the building with usual renovated external insulation level and 0.4ACH infiltration rate, the average reduction of CO2 emission and operation cost can both reach 9%.","Energy flexibility; Structural thermal energy storage; Active demand response; Building renovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The recent advancements in inertial sensors technology and its promising results in motion tracking, catch the expert’s eyes to these new horizons in sports engineering. In baseball, which is the interest of this study, almost 90% of the pitchers got injured once a year due to wrong training and pitching techniques. Screening and real-time feedback to players would help them to improve their training procedures and safely increase their pitching performance. <br/>In the last decades many researches have been carried out on employing this new tool in field measurements, instead of the common marker-based motion tracking with their complexity for the in field measurements. Although it is promising that inertial sensors are the future of motion tracking systems in this area, there are still many technical issues like, IMU sensors measurement limit, drift and bias. Besides in human motion tracking which involves multiple IMU sensors, coinciding the sensors and defining a global coordinate system requires substantial concerns. <br/>This study focuses on developing a valid motion tracking method for the baseball pitchers, having a marker-based motion capture measurement as the reference. In order to be able to do this first of all the two systems was needed to be synchronized and at the same time be able to record the same motion. Secondly, the measurements should be defined in the same coordinate system. For this purpose, a simple functional calibration method has been developed and applied on both systems. This method is validated against a previous method (Seel, Schauer et al. 2012). Finally, The kinematic results are estimated at joint and segment’s angles, velocities and accelerations levels. The joint and segment’s angles computed by IMU sensors are validated based on marker-based measurements. The sensitivity of IMU-based measurements in estimating the angular velocity and acceleration of movements with different rate of movements (slow vs. fast) is investigated. It has been observed that for baseball pitching applications, IUM sensors with less mass and wider range of measurements are required. <br/>In order to compare the dynamics of the human body, a scalable anthropometric model from the literature is used to define the mass and inertia properties of the segments. An inverse dynamics method is used to compute the kinetics energy and finally the power flow in the segments and joints. Again, all these results from the IMU measurements are compared with the Marker-based method. The advantages and disadvantages of the IMU according to these results are discussed to establish a practical protocol for future measurements and data analysis. One of the major issues in the dynamic analysis is that for translating the velocity from IMU to human body, the measurement protocol needs to provide a known starting and ending velocity. This is done by starting and ending the measurements from a standing position. <br/>The method of this project can be used in baseball pitching motion tracking using the suggested protocol improvements and more advanced IMU sensors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Energy benchmarking, a common practice of evaluating the building performance has been used to relate the values of the efficiency index of similar buildings and set new ones. In order to assess how the new specific energy consumption targets can be achieved, energy modelling has been performed to identify measures that can be integrated at the building level, and are directed toward the highest energy intensive areas within building operations. <br/>In the process, a selection of 47 retail spaces has been used, with an efficiency index related to the floor areas that have annual values between 48 kWh/m2 and 383 kWh/m2. Performing energy benchmarking, the weight of these values has been assessed, in relation to a selection of multiple energy markers that are best performers from various dimensions. Building simulations on store operating parameters indicated the importance of energy saving measures, such as ventilation control systems, as there is a spike registered in energy consumption if ventilation rates do not match the building occupancy levels. As the local hot climate conditions have been found to have a significant influence on the building energy performance, the building design has been assessed to identify weak areas responsible for heat gains and in consequence of an increased need for cooling. The research found that for “big-box” retailers the roof is the building component that can be used to decrease the cooling load. Energy savings have been registered for passive cooling techniques using radiative processes for existing locations, while sustainable building design, can update the standard flat roof and provide further functions such as increase daylight access and energy production. <br/>For the facilities where the energy consumption has been calculated, the results indicate lower annual energy consumption values compared to the actual energy use. Furthermore, when evaluating the actual energy consumption and the best practice targets set of each particular climate, it can be observed that energy savings can be achieved, with values with average savings of 32%. Connecting the findings of the two steps, a comprehensive list of recommendations has been created, with measures for non-food retail space operation, aimed at increasing the annual energy performance of this building type. The recommendations cover key aspects of operating the building at optimum energy levels, and the proposed measures are directed toward energy efficiency technologies and energy management practices. It is noted that a high level of actions is focused towards the staff and their behaviour, as the building occupants are a key factor in achieving good levels of energy performance. The recommendations are directed towards proper management of equipment and correct or optimisation in settings, but also measure to come in support of the employees, such as awareness campaigns and staff training on how to properly operate technologies such as the Energy Management System. <br","Sustainability; Industrial ecology; Energy Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

This helps us to get more insight into the pitching motion and its biomechanical interactions and may also help in reducing the injury risk and increasing pitching velocity. Currently, there are three problems that impede proper simulations: the lack of proper kinematic recordings, the fact that maximum force of the model could be too limited and the extreme character of the motion.<br/>An experimental study was performed to create a dataset including upper limb kinematics and PCSA scaling factors to scale maximum force in the DSEM. An acromion cluster was used to track the scapula. PCSA scaling factors ranged from 1.11 to 2.02.<br/>Following the experimental study, a case study was performed simulating this dataset in the DSEM. During simulation, the main problem arose in the optimization of the clavicle and scapula angles relative to the thorax, because the optimized angles contained large jumps, which are not realistic. This impeded proper simulation, because the jumps in muscle length caused both unsolved frames in the kinematics as well as in the dynamic model. Using a soft constraint instead of a hard constraint reduced these jumps and allowed for a complete solution in the kinematic model and an increase in the number of frames solved by the dynamic model. PCSA scaling also increased the number of frames solved by the dynamic model, however still unsolved frames were present, even after extreme scaling. Because of a change in range of motion as reported for pitchers, optimum muscle length might be different. This has a large impact in the model. If this would be the case, scaling optimum muscle length is recommended. In addition, segment scaling used in combination with using the soft constraint is recommended to improve the match between input angles and optimized angles, while still being compatible to the model. <br/>To study the motion, the kinematic model of the DSEM was used to estimate muscle length and velocity for all muscles during the pitching motion. Comparing these values to the force-velocity and the active force-length relationship showed whether muscles were limited by one or both of these relationships to produce force. This was the case for the teres minor, triceps (all three heads), infraspinatus, anconeus and serratus anterior. The triceps showed a ‘stretch effect’, meaning shortening in the acceleration phase preceded by lengthening in the cocking phase. This means that there is a possibility for elastic energy to be stored for this muscle.","Biomechanics; Musculoskeletal modeling; Shoulder; Experimental study; Simulation study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The constituent materials are readily available and hence are cheap in most areas. So it serves as an economically viable building material. Though, its load bearing capacity under compression is high, it does not perform well under tensile forces, cyclic and lateral loads. In the Netherlands, specifically around the Groningen area, where natural gas is being extracted from the 1960s, masonry structures are currently prone to artificial seismic excitation due to excessive gas extraction and the resulting soil liquefaction. Such residential buildings having stood there for about a 100 years are being affected by these seismic vibrations and have developed cracks which can prove detrimental to both life and property if unchecked. To this end, Nederlandse Aardolie Matschappij (NAM) has spearheaded a research group along with TUDelft, ARUP and others to get a thorough insight into the strength and durability aspects of these existing buildings. Since there are different configurations and types of structures, it has been divided into several typologies. Further research, using shake table tests, has also been taken up at the TUDelft Stevin lab using these different typologies and/or scaled models. This project deals with the study of type T3a detached type villa, which is asymmetric in plan. This structure consists of clay brick masonry walls and timber floors and beams. Effectively, the current thesis project is a blind prediction on the strength and behaviour aspects of this particular structure. For the same, the structure is modelled and analysed using Finite Element application DIANA 9.6. Firstly, modelling of the structure is done according to macro-modelling technique with smeared cracking. Shell elements are used for walls and floors, and beam elements for timber beams. It is noted here that all the non-linearities have been focused only on the masonry part. Linear static checks and Eigenvalue checks are carried out. The time-history record was provided by the supervisor. Variational studies were performed on the structure to check their influence on the seismic resistance. These variations are - model without roof and with the roof part, the latter modelled under fair assumptions. Different type of beam end connections, seismic excitation along different directions of the structure were also included. Finally, as a check, monotonic mass-proportional pushover analyses were conducted. The results show that the given input signal at 0.16g scaling is not able to inflict serious damage, hence higher scaling is used. It is observed that the seismic resistance of the structure is higher along the X-direction of the structure than in Y-direction. Influence of beam ends on the seismic resistance is not significant. However, coupling between floors has been observed, by comparing their displacements at multiple time instants. The presence of roof part has a significant influence on the (box) behaviour of the structure, due to increase in overburden load. The pushover curves validate the time-history analyses by forming an envelope over the hysteresis curves from the latter. All the beams are provided along the X-direction of the structure, which provides significant stiffness to out-of-plane walls (X-direction excitation). It is also interesting to find that the same wall (IP1) undergoes maximum cracking for analyses along either X or Y directions. The pushover curves are in agreement with the hysteresis curves from time-history analyses which proves the validity of the results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, such an electric shock can cause catastrophic damage in mechanical systems. The small spark that is seen to 'jump' through the air is actually the portion of the air that became electrically conductive, which is formally described as electrical breakdown. The breakdown of air is characterized by the formation of a large amount of free electrons, which are the result of ionization of the air under the influence of a static electric field.<br/><br/>To mitigate the risk of electrostatic breakdown in large scale systems, Paschen's law is generally used to predict these breakdown conditions. Such conditions include the voltage, distance and gas pressure. In MEMS and NEMS, significant deviations in breakdown voltage are seen which are attributed to an increase of secondary electron emission, caused by the high electric fields that are present in such systems. It has also been shown that the geometry of such systems can influence breakdown.<br/><br/>To achieve a better understanding of both the deviations from the classical theory and the effects of geometry, a Particle-in-Cell method has been implemented in Python. The computational method aims to capture the two-dimensional nature of this effect, to determine the vulnerability of given two dimensional topologies to electrostatic breakdown, and provide a computationally efficient risk assessment tool that can be used in the design phase of said systems.<br/>The model has been validated by simulating various conditions that have also been investigated experimentally, and it has been shown that these results correspond. Since the model is not subject to the difficulties of experimental work, it can in the future be used to investigate various relations that attempt to describe the increase of secondary emission, and arbitrary topologies can be analysed to determine specific areas that are at high risk of breakdown.<br","Electric discharge; Breakdown; MEMS; NEMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-08-22","","","","","",""

GLDD came up with an idea to develop a working model that can estimate spillage when using a cutter suction dredger (CSD) for cutting soft material like sand. The main reason for this is because not every material that is cut from the seabed contributes to production. A part of the material is lost since it doesn’t enter the suction mouth and contributes to spillage. Spillage can be defined in a number of ways. GLDD defines spillage as “the difference in elevation between the maximum depth at which the dredge cuts (cutting depth) and the depth obtained after dredging (after dredging depth)”. Theoretically, spillage is defined as “the material that is displaced from the seabed which does not enter the suction pipe and thus does not contribute to production”. The aim of this thesis is to identify and describe the types of spillage that occur while dredging soft material like sand and to use this information to create a numerical model that estimates spillage. Four types of spillage are found, namely; soil that disintegrates and is directed away from the cutter head (Type-1), soil that enters the cutter head but not the suction mouth (Type-2), soil that does not enter the cutter head when cutting large bank heights (Type-3) and breaching of the bank after the cutter head has passed (Type-4). The numerical model focuses only on Type-2 spillage. The foundation of the model is based on the theory that the cutter head of a CSD behaves like a combination of an axial and centrifugal pump with an inflow present near the nose and an outflow present near the cutter ring. For simplicity, the cutter head is divided into two slices with the top slice (2) having an inflow and the bottom slice (1) having an outflow. It is assumed that the outflow from the bottom slice circulates back to the top slice and re-enters the cutter head. Equations for pressure and flow are derived from the pump affinity laws for each slice. A constant, β, is a parameter that influences the flow and an initial value is assumed which is later calibrated. Using the concept of the continuity equation, an implicit equation for the height of the bottom slice (w1) is found. In the model, spillage percentage is defined as the ratio of the circulating flow to the total outgoing flow. Real life data from The Texas (GLDD) is used in the model. The constant β is calibrated using spillage values obtained from hydrographic surveys. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the various operational parameters of the dredge as well as on β. To study the influence of β on the relationship between the operational parameters and spillage, a number of β-values are used to plot data. For the validation of the model, the spillage value obtained from the model is compared with the spillage values obtained from the hydrographic surveys. As the spillage is in close proximation with values observed in the industry, the model is said to be working as intended. In order to further validate the model, the results obtained from the model are compared with the results obtained from experiments performed by Marco den Burger and the results are almost similar. Thus, it can be concluded that although the model is simple, it is able to provide realistic values of spillage.","Dredging; spillage; sand; cutter suction dredger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-21","","","","","",""

There is some research available on generator designs for wave energy converters but the Symphony is a unique case, so a new research needed to be conducted. Several generator types can be used in the Symphony. Compared to an induction and switched reluctance generator, the iron-cored permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) seems a good choice because it is efficient and reliable. A disadvantage, however, is that, in the case of the Symphony, the iron losses are relatively high at partial loads. An air-cored PMSG does not have this problem since it has no iron losses at all. A drawback of the air-cored PMSG is that it needs more permanent magnetic material, which is expensive. Finally, it was decided to test and compare the iron-cored radial flux PMSG and the air-cored axial flux PMSG on both performance and costs. For both generator types, an analytical model was built which puts out the efficiency and material cost. To find the best generator geometries for the case of the Symphony, an optimization procedure was created which minimizes both material costs and losses. It was found that an axial flux air-cored PMSG is both cheaper and more efficient than a radial flux iron-cored PMSG.

In order to develop the model, an extensive literature review was conducted on project planning and also on the impact of project uncertainties on project planning. Following this, interviews were conducted within the company to understand the current practice of project planning within the organization. A total of five major issues with planning were identified. These were: scope changes, project delays, lack of governance, complexity and project escalations. A model was developed to tackle these issues with project planning.

As the knowledge regarding the subject within the company was of insufficient, Delft University of Technology was contacted to extend the knowledge, and lay the foundation of a future sustainability strategy for the company. The outcome of this project is a sustainability strategy (BeSafe &amp; Sustainable) and a sample case demonstrating how this strategy could be implanted. The project has three main phases; During the analysis phase, insights are gathered to uncover possibilities to add value to the company through sustainability. The analysis covers the context of company, its products and their footprint, and the market the company is operating in. Different stakeholders that influence, are affected by, or are influenced by any way the company is operating are then investigated. Apart from the customer, which has a major influence on the demand and used of the product, the environment and society are two important stakeholders. To finalise this phase, the sustainability strategies of multiple companies were analysed to see how other they strategise their efforts to be sustainable. In the synthesis phase, the insights gathered during the analysis are combined, with input from the New Product Development of BeSafe, using the value mapping tool by Bocken et al. (2013). The value map helps to gives an overview of the values captured, and helps to generated value opportunities based on missed, destroyed and wasted values. Based on the analysis and the value map, a sustainability strategy for BeSafe is developed. ‘BeSafe &amp; Sustainable’ covers; safety provided by products; the use of materials and energy; the ability of employees to deploy change within the company; how design could help to BeSafe become more sustainable; the involvement of partner; adaption of the business model; and transparency about sustainability efforts. In the sustainability roadmap, an overview is given of possible goals and actions that the company should pursue to follow the set strategy. To illustrate how the implementation of the sustainability strategy could be done, a sample case was performed. The case shows how an existing lease service could be adjusted to fit the new strategy. Analysis of the existing lease model uncovered that the logistics and refurbishment of seats could be optimised. Therefor recommendations are given to update the design of a baby seat to better fit the refurbishment process and allow for extended product lifetime and better recycling of materials. The sample case is closed off with a product packaging redesign. In the present system, products are retrieved using a plastic bag. Due to this form of packing, the products get damaged during transport, thereby reducing the ability to refurbish the product. To reduce the impact of transportation on the product, the packaging of the toddler seat, which is send to the customer to replace a used baby seat, is adjusted in such a way it can be used to retrieve the baby seat, increasing the possibility of the seat to be used again refurbishment.","child safety seats; sustainability strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

To ensure the stability of the power system in a scenario with high penetration of power electronic converters, the dynamics and stability characteristics of these devices have to be comprehensively studied. This is especially important for bulk converters — with capacities in the hundreds of megawatts range — such as high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems.<br/><br/>Small-signal analysis is extensively used in power system stability studies. The calculation of the system eigenvalues provides insights regarding the dynamic behavior and the nature of the interactions within the system. However, generating a small-signal representation of power electronic converters is known to be problematic, due to the switched operation of such converters and their complex control structures. Nevertheless, usage of modular multilevel converters (MMC) in HVDC systems is rapidly increasing. This creates the need for extensive studies regarding its dynamic behavior. Due to the MMC unique submodule-based topology, special actions have to be taken if the stability of the converter is to be analyzed.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a small-signal model of a generic MMC was developed by linearizing all the converter plant and control equations, to analyze the converter stability. Averaging was used to eliminate nonlinearities brought forth by the converter switching actions.<br/><br/>The main contributions of this thesis are the application of classic linear-time invariant theory to a time-varying system by linearizing the full converter model at different points in time, and the application of modal analysis methods to the MMC.<br/><br/>The small-signal model was verified against a large-signal one, both developed in Matlab/Simulink. Additionally, the system eigenvalues obtained analytically and numerically —using Matlab/MuPaD and Simulink Control Design Toolbox, respectively — were benchmarked. After obtaining the system state-space matrix, its transfer functions were used to estimate the input impedance of the MMC in the frequency domain. Using the linearized system matrix and an optimization algorithm, namely MVMO, the locations of the converter eigenvalues were optimized by finding a new set of controller gains. Finally, calculating the converter eigenvalues, understanding the effects of these eigenvalues on the system variables and applying advanced tools to tune the controllers of the MMC, and possibly also its main circuit parameters, may aid system designers in controller design and parametrization studies.","Small-signal stability; Modular multilevel converter; Optimization; Small-signal modelling; Voltage-source converter; Eigenvalue analysis; Modal analysis; Participation factors; MMC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This is made specifically in the context of products as services, using as the case of study the Pay-per-Use washing-machine service by startup company HOMIE. The machine is connected to HOMIE’s database through a tracker that sends the data of users’ consumption so that they are charged accordingly.<br/><br/>However, product-as-services rely on the service provider as the main actor for product circulation. The product use per use, as an intensive resource consumption part of the lifecycle, and its relationship with users’ decisions is not therein contemplated. So, for this project, design strategies for sustainable behavior are included in the development of this product service system (PSS) as a complementary concept to Circular Economy. <br/><br/>This study found out that smart products have a special relation with sustainable behavior strategies, since connectivity enables in great extent the design of eco-interactions, which can be used to reduce the environmental impact during the use phase. Additionally, IoT is considered itself a source of value creation, which can be used in development of service features that, by means of connectivity, solve issues that were not tackled before. Thus, more attractive value propositions can be created. <br/><br/>The findings mentioned above were translated in a design for the case of study. For it, a human-centered and iterative approach was central for the problem finding and concept development.

From all oil and gas operations, Topside Installation Processes (TIP) are the only offshore activity that counters one of the golden safety rules, “do not stand or walk under suspended loads” (Peuscher &amp; Groeneweg, 2012). As a consequence, marine companies are seeking to improve these processes through different technological solutions (Heerema Marine Contractors, 2014). TIP generally consist on the lifting of a heavy module, topside, and its placement on a fixed structure on the sea, jacket (Hee et al., 2007). Traditional positioning tools such as bumpers and guides are not suitable for these type of processes given the heaviness and big dimensions of topsides (Heerema Marine Contractors, 2017). As a consequence, part of the vessel crew is located on the jacket, under the suspended topside, to guide the positioning processes (Breidablikk, 2010). TIP imply the presence of crew members under a suspended load, which is contrary to oil and gas companies’ safety policy. The offshore industry is currently investigating ways to circumvent having personnel on the jacket during topside installations (Heerema Marine Contractors, 2014). The implementation of a camera-based augmented reality positioning tracking system could fulfil the current safety requirements. The use of augmented reality as a positioning tool is a completely new technology that has never been used before in this domain. This research explores the potential expected benefits of the use of an Augmented Reality Positioning System (ARPS) during Offshore Topside Installation Processes (OTIP). This research also investigates the system’s usefulness and the users’ system perception on its usability in OTIP. Moreover, it explores the implications and factors that should be considered in order to successfully implement the ARPS in this type of processes. The research is based on a case that relates to the first augmented reality positioning system for topside installation processes, that is being developed by TWNKLS and Heerema Marine Contractors.

The conclusions include discussion about the benefits, usability and implications of ARPS in OTIP, and recommendations for the ARPS developing companies and for future research.

A distribution network is not only crucial before sales but also after sales because regardless of the initial quality of product, malfunctions occur. These malfunctions need to be repaired by replacing defective parts, which are delivered through after sales distribution network and all activities, carried out from the report of the malfunction until the product is up and running, are called after sales services. The replacement parts are called service parts or spare parts and this thesis project focuses on the distribution network design for delivery of these items. Customer surveys point out that high quality after sales services has become a criterion for selecting supplier companies. A shorter response time to failures and availability of service parts in the storage are given importance. Because after sales services became a field that companies can differentiate themselves from the competitors, practitioners have an increasing interest on establishing the optimal distribution network design to meet customer expectations while being cost-competitive.<br/><br/>The researchers have addressed service parts distribution with a strong focus on inventory management. However, distribution network design involves more decisions such as number of facilities, facility locations, allocation of customer demand to these facilities, and storage capacities. In addition, the managerial aspects and strategies for service parts logistics in business case studies are derived from electronic, automotive and aviation industries. Considering these, there is a knowledge gap about distribution network design for service parts in healthcare industry.

Targeted drug delivery, ablations, stents, implants, and remote sensing applications are among the envisioned applications. One of the biggest challenges in the design of these devices is the propulsion actuator. Within this thesis, Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) is proposed for the design of a distributed actuator. This smart material consists of a polymer backbone that is permeable to cations, whilst being impermeable to anions. When an electric potential is applied over the thin platinum electrodes, the cations migrate towards the negative electrode, while the anions remain fixed. This results in an expansion near the negative electrode, due to the higher concentration. Simultaneously, the material contracts at the positive electrode. On the macro level, this results in a large bending deformation of<br/>the IPMC strip. Using an improved video processing algorithm, the curvature of a strip of IPMC is investigated. By analyzing the dynamic response in fluids of varying viscosity, it is shown that IPMC behaves well in low-Reynolds environments. Thereby, IPMC is shown to be a feasible actuator at microscale, where viscous forces dominate inertial forces. Next, a novel swelling based model in Comsol is proposed. Since it accurately shows the deformation shape, is easily adaptable, and has fast computation times, it is highly suitable for engineering purposes. Finally, a methodology is proposed for designing IPMC based bending tail actuators. Segmented IPMC is kinematically modeled with a constant curvature assumption. Using a nested optimization algorithm, the segmentation is designed for optimally attaining a desired wave shape. The traveling wave behavior is confirmed through the Comsol model. Hopefully, this work provides a basis for future work to build on, thereby giving new direction to the development of microrobots for medical purposes.","IPMC; curvature; camera; viscosity; Comsol; hygroscopic swelling; segmented IPMC; beating tail; swimming microrobots; kinematic modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this research is to find out what effects autonomous driving can have on the traffic flows. This research uses microscopic traffic simulation to experiment with different scenarios in which autonomous driving can be introduced on the Dutch road. The effect that have been found did not indicate major changes. An autonomous lane ensures that autonomous vehicles can drive optimally at the cost of more lane changes on the regular lanes. The cooperative automatic car benefits the average speed on the road and helps decreasing the travel loss time. However, the effect of cooperative driving on the traffic demand should be taken into consideration.

The HVDC technology has provided an efficient way to integrate different renewable sources successfully to fulfil the electrical power requirements. The integration involves incorporating different types of machines with different mechanisms and technologies. At peak load operating conditions, the electro–mechanical modes of oscillations exist between different parts of the system, which possess serious threat to the operations leading to widespread blackouts. These modes depend on various factors like, loading conditions, weak tie–lines, type of faults, topology of the system and generators.

This new topology is usually known as alternate arm converter. For the simulation developing MATLAB/Simulink software is used. With the MATLAB/Simulink software the model of alternate arm converter is developed from the scratch. Firstly the simple one-phase average mathematical model is developed and implemented in the simulation. Then the balancing control between the arms voltages is implemented in the one-phase model. The simple one-phase with a simplified control model is evaluated. Then the three-phase model is created in the same MATLAB/Simulink software. Firstly the three-phase model is evaluated as working in the island mode, which means that it is working alone, not connected to the grid. The improved control is implemented in this 3-phase model in order to increase the performance of the converter. The 3-phase model with improved control model is connected to the grid by using MATLAB/Simulink software. The grid connection is simulated with the voltage sources and phase locked loop control. The phase locked loop constantly adjust the voltage in order to lock onto the phase and frequency. Furthermore it is extract a voltage angle for the used dq0 transformation, which simplifies control. The grid connected model is simulated and evaluated. After this evaluation the MATLAB/Simulink simulation model of the alternate arm converter, together with control is connected in the point to point scheme. The point to point scheme represents the energy transmission from the one point to another or in the different case it can also transmit the energy in the other side. The point to point system is represented in the MATLAB/Simulink model, together with additional droop control, which controls the DC voltage accordingly to the active power. If the active power reaches the maximum value the DC voltage decreases accordingly to the drop value and the way around. The six study cases are simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink software, with the point to point connection. In the first case the operation points are evaluated of the system and the behaviour of the AC voltages, AC currents, DC voltage, arm voltages, arm currents and circulating currents are observed in the terminal 1 and terminal 2, which is AC/DC and DC/AC converters, respectively. The second study case is aimed to inspect the DC side capacitance effect to the DC voltage. In this study case is evaluated that by increasing the DC side capacitance the DC voltage ripple reduces, therefore the AC currents with less harmonic distortions are presented. The third case shows the droop control behaviour for the different drop values. When the drop value is increasing the gain value of the droop control decreases and the smaller deviation of the active power is presented. The forth, fifth and sixth cases arise, because of the problem confronted during the operating point case simulations. The voltages between the upper and lower arms in some of the operating points are not balanced. This issue creates an arm voltage balancing problem, which in the forth study case is solving by increasing overlap time. The observation is made, that by increasing overlap time the balance between the arm voltages becomes better, but the alternate arm converter are forced to approach and change the topology to modular multilevel converter, when the 10 ms is reached in this case. The fifth study case investigates the cell capacitance effect for the arm voltage balance. In this case was found that increasing or decreasing the cell capacitance in the submodules, do not fix the arm voltage balancing problem. This approach makes voltage balance between the arms even worse. The last study case introduces the case of the arm voltage balance technique by using third harmonic current flow together with 1 ms overlap time. This study case requires a minor changes in the point to point system. The results of this technique are evaluated and it shows that this type of the balancing technique is the best technique of the voltage balancing between the arms in this system of the point to point connection.","DC/DC converter; DC grid; Modeling; AAC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Along the way towards large-scale diffusion, firms can apply niche strategies as a deliberate and temporary choice to cope with internal and/or external factors that have become barriers hampering diffusion. Although it seems clear that certain barriers can be overcome by certain niche strategies, a clear means of assessing technology diffusion in view of those factors such to be able to identify circumstances that allow/require to adopt another niche strategy to continue to diffuse, remains underexplored. Accordingly, this research defines a set of indicators to assess contextual and contemporary factors potentially hampering diffusion of a radical innovation throughout the diffusion period. This set of indicators can then function as a trigger for commercial firms to rationally revisit their niche strategies according to the ever-changing internal/external environment during the often erratic path of technology diffusion, such to pursue large-scale diffusion. A case study will be conducted by analysing two urban farming organizations in the Netherlands, with urban farming being a yet-to-diffuse radical innovation aiming for fresh and sustainable food supply in urban areas. A non-static conceptual model and method of use are constituted that includes factors, indicators and triggers to rationally assess the business environment on diffusion hampering factors/barriers, and to select niche strategies accordingly.<br/><br/><br/><br","niche strategies; diffusion; indicators; radical innovation; niche","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The technology’s promises of complete disintermediation and enhanced process visibility turned supply chain and logistics into a fertile ground for a blockchain potential implementation. Despite these high expectations, both practitioners and researchers still struggle in identifying the blockchain real benefits to the industry. Moreover, the several private projects and start-ups offering blockchain solutions, which are blossoming in the logistics environment, are threatening the role of the Port of Rotterdam and Portbase as the port inter-organizational information system. Commissioned by Smartport, this research aims to identify the potential blockchain uses on port logistics as well as their relative impact. Therefore, the functionality offered by the current market applications are categorized into four business cases, which identify different uses of the blockchain. These blockchain business cases are subsequently analyzed under six different points of view in order to evaluate the expected benefit that the major stakeholder expect to gain from the technology implementation. Finally, the impact of these business cases is tested on the business model components of the current port information system, Portbase, to identify the disruptive power of the technology. To face the potential issue of disintermediation; a set of solutions have been developed for Portbase on how to adapt its business model in case of a blockchain implementation. This strong conceptualization of the blockchain technology helps the main logistic stakeholders to understand and discuss the potential application of blockchain technology on port logistics, and it provides a much-needed basis for further scientific research. Further development of this conceptualization is needed to structure the ongoing blockchain discussions in both scientific literature and practice.","Blockchain; Port Logistics; Inter-organizational Information system; IT solutions for logistics; Reintermediation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","","51.875014, 4.404611"

(mentor); de Vriend, J.W. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Accessibility of offshore structures is strongly affected by local weather and wave conditions. During rough wave climates, vessel motions prevent people to be transferred safely from and to an offshore structure. To increase accessibility, Ampelmann developed a motion compensating gangway system. The system uses a 6 DoF motion sensor to measure the vessel motions in order to compensate for them. This motion sensor has a sufficient accuracy to compensate the Ampelmann, but it has some drawbacks. The motion sensor is expensive - it is the most expensive part of the whole Ampelmann - and the sensor is on the blacklists of many boarder securities since the accuracy is high enough to guide a missile.<br/><br/>Due to these drawbacks, it is interesting for Ampelmann to investigate alternative sensors. During onshore tests the currently used motion sensor is compared with an alternative. It was found that the rotations were measured accurately by both sensors, but that the transla- tion measurement was significantly worse with the alternative motion sensor. Through these findings, the focus of this research is on estimating the translations. Also, in literature was found that using multiple sensors improves the performance of the measurement. This research investigates using multiple inertial measurement sensors for estimating the translations.<br/><br/>Noisy acceleration measurements are simulated to replicate real IMU measurements up to five IMUs. A mass-spring-damper model is used to generate a excited sine, which represents a wave. Through a Kalman filter with a Wiener model the translations are estimated from the accelerations. A pullback method is introduced, where a virtual zero measurement is added to compensate for the drift introduced when double integrating accelerations. Five different fusion techniques are investigated and compared. Through the VAF and the average error the performances of the methods are compared. The direct fusion method performed the worst. The best results for the average error were found when using the post-prediction fusion method with 3 IMUs. The best results for the VAF were found using the post-correction fusion method with 2 IMUs. Also real ship motions that were measurement offshore were transformed into one acceleration measurement, which were used in the direct fusion method and the averaging fusion method (since there is only one measurement available). Both methods gave the exact same results.<br/><br/>The different fusion techniques are also applied on real IMU measurements on a test setup. The test setup is a translational sled on a rails. One IMU is used to get real data measure- ments. Rotating this IMU with repect to the translational movement of the sled allows us to get two measurements of the IMU. Again the direct fusion method performed the worst. The best results were found when using the post-prediction fusion method with 3 IMUs.<br/><br/>When comparing the simulations and the real tests with the several fusion methods, the same trend is found in both the VAF and the average error. When using the post-prediciton fusion method or the post-correction fusion method an almost similar VAF is found in both simulation and test. Though the average error for each method was significantly smaller in simulation than found in tests.<br/><br/>Based on the outcome of the simulations and the tests it can be concluded that two fusion methods are found to give good results for estimating translations from low-cost IMUs. These methods use a Kalman filter with a Wiener model. Also, a pullback method is used to compensate for drift. Before implementing this motion sensor into the Ampelmann system, further research should be done on the performance of the methods on real ship motions.","IMU sensor fusion; fusion methods; multiple IMUs; Wiener model; Estimating translations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Flex-to-rigid (F2R) is a technology platform for the fabrication of miniature partially flexible sensor systems for minimally invasive medical instruments. Because of the flexibility, these sensor systems can be wrapped around cylindrical medical instruments such as catheters or guidewires. F2R is a postprocessing technology whereby flexible interconnects, consisting of an AlCu routing layer sandwiched between two layers of flexible polyimide, are fabricated on a silicon wafer. This is followed by a separation step whereby individual elements are singulated by Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) and Reactive Ion Etching (RIE). The F2R fabrication is based on standard IC fabrication technology, which allows the devices to scale down so that all kind of sensing functionalities and electronics can be integrated into the tip of a catheter. <br/><br/>This thesis focuses on the improvement of the F2R technology. One of the objectives was to increase the density of the devices. By patterning the metal interconnects by RIE, instead of wet etching, very high density interconnects are fabricated. Corrosion-free interconnects down to 0.8 μm width were fabricated using this new developed process. Furthermore, the vias between the two metal layers in F2R were improved. Small pitch vias down to 3 μm diameter were fabricated by etching small tapered holes in the polyimide layer and sputtering metal in these contact holes. <br/><br/>Because of the in-body application of F2R, a perfect adhesion between the several layers is required. The polyimide-polyimide adhesion is known to be troublesome. Therefore, improving the adhesion of this interface was explored in this work. A perfect adhesion was obtained by a novel method which combines a thin layer of SiC and SiO2 into an adhesion improvement layer between the polyimides.<br/><br/>The developed fabrication processes, high density interconnects, small pitch vias and the adhesion improvement, were integrated into the F2R process flow. Test devices, consisting of a silicon island with bond-pads and test structures and a flexible part with meandering interconnects, were fabricated using this improved process flow. Bending tests showed that bending radii of the flexible interconnects down to 10 μm are achievable while not damaging the interconnects. This extreme flexibility is required to wrap a high density imaging system around a guidewire to fabricate a 360 μm diameterF2R IVUS catheter. An analysis is presented that describes the relation between the geometry of the F2R technology and how such a device can be folded around a cylindrical instrument. It is found that using the same F2R technology, such a system can be scaled down to a smaller diameter relatively straightforward.","Flexible electronics; MEMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-21","","","","","",""

The growing availability of data from mining equipment and mining operations enables the use of data analytics to achieve that goal. This thesis explores the potential of data analytics and machine learning to increase equipment utilization through the means of a case study on an underground South African diamond mine. To identify and quantify the potential of data analytics for operational improvement a benchmarking analysis of the operation was done using operational equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a measure. The outcome of this indicated that there was significant value to be unlocked if unplanned breakdowns were mitigated and unscheduled maintenance could be moved into scheduled maintenance. This led to believe that there was a solid case for breakdown prediction based on equipment sensor data using advanced analytical techniques. Data availability and quality made that the proof-of-model was initiated for one 10 ton loader with the target components for breakdown prediction being the engine, transmission and brakes. After extensive data cleaning and preparation various machine learning algorithms adopted from various non-mining disciplines were used for training predictive models. The best result was yielded using support vector machines (SVM) showing a very high accuracy (&gt;80%) with little misclassifications. Random forests and anomaly detection were also tried but the unbalanced and noisy nature of the data made for the performance of these models not leading to satisfactory levels. The results of this modelling exercise combined with the OEE analysis give enough confidence to accept the hypothesis that there is good potential for application of advanced analytics to increase the operational effectiveness of underground mining equipment.","OEE; Operational Equipment Effectiveness; Machine Learning; Failure Prediction; Predictive Maintenance; Mining; Underground Mining; LHD; Loader; Continuous Improvement; Random Forest; Support Vector Machines; Unbalanced Data; R; SMOTE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-21","","","","","",""

For both regions, Balloon Effect scenario increases the environmental burden in almost all the categories evaluated. The socioeconomic analysis reveals that for the Catatumbo region farmers, successful implementation of the policy implies a reduction on their income .For coca-growing farmers of Putumayo-Caquetá region, Policy Success scenario has a positive impact on the income and job generation, while Conservative and Balloon Effect reduce the profit.

A special equipment called termination is designed to tackle down the problems from cable ends. The main functional part of a termination is a piece of rubber with a cone shape. This rubber cone has a semi-conductive layer which is connected with ground potential. By doing this, the cone smoothens the concentric equipotential lines at the cable end, so the electric field stress there can be decreased. The cone in the termination is called stress cone. However, insulation degradation on the termination stress cone due to water contamination is often found in its operation. This, in the end, will cause operation failures in the power network. This research aims to investigate the influences brought by water contamination on the stress cone, and discuss possibilities of detecting the presence of water content by using electrical methods. By using 3D FEM simulations, the changes of electric field distribution, especially the filed along the oil-rubber interface, were studied.

In case of a tumour extending lateral to the pelvic wall or more than 0.5 cm from the vaginal surface, current applicators are not sufficient to irradiate the target area. Therefore, the use of extra free-hand needles is required. Free-hand placement of interstitial needles is operator/experience dependent. The goal of this study is to develop a device that is able to irradiate the tumour in case of lower vaginal involvement or distal parametrial extension. Based on the design criteria, a new concept has been developed. The concept is a personalised 3D-printed vaginal template with curved channels based on the MRI scan from the patient. Channel curvature constraints were examined by conducting an experiment with a separate 3D-printed template. The effects of two different needle tips (round and sharp) and 12 different curvatures (radius = 20 - 75 mm, with increments of 5 mm) on the required insertion force have been examined. A 3D-printed template with different curvatures has been suspended in a 10 m\% gelatin phantom. Needles were inserted with an obturator at a speed of 5 mm/s, using a linear stage. Axial forces were measured. The data was processed and compared with a subjective user experiment of manual insertions. To examine technical feasibility of the concept, two relevant cases of cancer were used to create personalised applicators. The accuracy of the needle tip placement with these templates has been tested. No differences have been found in maximum required insertion force for a round and sharp needle tip while passing through a template with different curvatures and while puncturing tissue. For the different curvatures, significant differences in axial force have been found for curvatures with radii $\leq$ 50 mm. Buckling behaviour occurred for radii $\leq$ 35 mm. The user experiment indicates a threshold value of 35 mm for the minimum radius for a round and sharp needle that is still comfortable to insert. Two relevant cases of vaginal cancer were successfully translated into personalised applicators. The mean accuracy of the needle tip placement was 3.9 mm. All values were &lt; 8 mm. The curvature constraints have been used to verify that the target area can be reached. A personalised 3D-printed template with curvature constraints has been proposed as an improved method for the practice of brachytherapy in case of cervical cancer with distal parametrial extension or lower vaginal involvement. Further development and research are required to optimise the concept and verify clinical feasibility.","brachytherapy; cervical cancer; additive manufacturing; applicator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

At the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, electromagnetic energy is applied from a circular shaped applicator that is placed around the patient’s head or neck.

Yet, students seem to be unable to translate their digital designs of creative concepts for physical products for their design projects effectively. Often they do not reach a prototype that can communicate their concepts and test its usability, feasibility and aesthetics, thus leaving out the option to iterate and optimize their designs. This is because they lack the right knowledge and skills earlier on in their design process.<br/>The aim of this graduation project is to improve the ability for students to make more iterations in the hope that they will be able to make physical prototypes that they can quickly test so they can reach a solutions to their design problems and that other students can learn from.

The goal in this thesis was to come to a solution by first analyzing the other three components. <br/><br/>First an analysis is performed to come to a fundamental distinction between two parts (i.e. corporate and innovation) of ING’s organization. This is done based on the theory of ambidexterity which states that for a company to be successful, it needs to be thrive in both exploitation of current business models and the exploration of new ones. A big difference between the two organizational parts is found in the journey an employee goes through. The exploitation part of the organization sees employees going through a linear journey climbing the corporate ladder while those in exploration go through more of a continuous process of joining and rejoining projects. <br/><br/>Following on this the challenge in this thesis ,performance management for innovation (i.e. exploration), is analyzed. To do this, a performance management framework is created.<br/>By combining the performance management framework with the employee innovation journey, a matrix of micro challenges is established. These micro challenges are quantitatively tested to come to a challenge of focus of this thesis which is: “unclarity about what happens if-and when a venture ends”. It is then tested how this challenge affects the people working in ING’s internal ventures. The people working in these ventures mostly influenced are determined to be intrapreneurs. The challenge of unclarity creates an uncertainty regarding their own position with them. This uncertainty leads to them not performing optimally towards the end of their corporate venture’s acceleration and thus is likely to inhibit this process <br/>In order to create a solution for this, a design vision is composed:<br/><br/>To design a solution that allows intrapreneurs working in internal corporate ventures to perform optimally by taking some of their perceived uncertainty away.<br/><br/>Through a synthesis, it is determined that the best way to take some uncertainty away is by providing these intrapreneurs with an opportunity. This opportunity should consist of two perspectives: opportunity to ‘explore’ and to ‘manifest’. Based on this, a framework of three boundary phases is conceived to create a concept on. This concept is developed through multiple brainstorms and eventually tested through validation with experts from five different fields. Key-takeaways from the concept validation are used to iterate the concept towards a solution. This solution, called PRIDE, intends to create a community of intrapreneurs. This community should function as both a poule of capable intrapreneurs for ING as well as a social group of them exchanging knowledge and experiences. PRIDE is established by a program consisting of three elements: onboarding, community building and innovation mobility. Facilitating this program is a digital community of intrapreneurs integrated into ING’s portfolio application. Through this, possible journey of an intrapreneur through this program could be established. PRIDE is to be implemented over a period of more than three years based on ING’s innovation strategy.<br","innovation management; corporate venturing; intrapreneurs; community building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Commonly used reinforcement learning agents can be seen to have deteriorating performances at increasing frequencies, as they are unable to correctly learn the ordering of expected returns for actions that are applied. We call this the disappearing reinforcements problem. Moreover, truly multi-task reinforcement learning is only possible when agents are able to operate across frequencies, as different platforms operate at different frequencies. Most algorithms from control theory working on similar tasks, on the other hand, show improved performances when their operating frequencies are increased. This suggests that addressing disappearing reinforcements should enable reinforcement learning agents to have improved performance and generalization ability across timescales and tasks.<br/><br/>In this project, we show that disappearing reinforcements is an effect seen independent of the function approximator used in reinforcement learning, and is instead of a more fundamental nature. We explore both theoretically and empirically the relationship between agents and their performances at increasing frequencies. We show that two specific types of agents from literature address the problem, and we benchmark the agents' performances with novel benchmarking measures inspired from control theory. Finally, we create a novel agent we call the dueling advantage learner, by combining both approaches from the state-of-the-art. We then benchmark the different agents across frequencies and tasks, and our agent is seen to outperform each of the individual approaches on the majority of the tasks.","Reinforcement Learning; Control; Sampling; control systems; Q-Learning; Deep neural networks; Machine Learning; artificial intelligence; Autonomous; learning by doing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-08-31","","","","","",""

At this moment, a lot of research into automated vehicles is carried out. The City of Amsterdam wants to know what impact AVs can have on traffic safety in their city. Most studies focus on the technology of the vehicle itself and its impact on society. An increasing number of studies is focussing on the human aspects, although most of these researches focus on the driver, while questions remain unanswered on vulnerable road users. At this moment, it is challenging to gain insights in the system of interaction. Due to the still-evolving technology of AVs, the impact on traffic safety cannot be accurately predicted. City of Amsterdam want to start pilots to test AVs on the public roads in order to gain insight in te system of a safe mutual interaction between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users.<br/><br/>First, the system of interaction needs to be known. Using the methodology of Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM), the determinants and behaviour of the system is identified. FCM is a fairly new method in the field of transport planning, but showed potential for this specific research in which scientific data is limited. The original approach to develop a FCM model is adapted. Therefore, the time it took to develop a conceptual FCM model during a workshop could have been limited and disadvantages of one strategy is balanced or mitigated with the advantages of other stragegies. This research is therefore also assessing if FCM can be a useful method in the field of transport planning.<br/><br/>The FCM model that describes that system of interaction is developed via a literature study and subsequent workshop. This resulted in a model of 21 determinants with 72 connections or relationships. Computations showed that the most important (key) determinants were the following concepts: Safe crossing behaviour, VRU friendly road design, AV friendly road design, Intelligent infrastructure and Identification and recognition. These key determinants, who each describe an idea of something formed by mentally combining all its characteristics or particulars, are considered most important in the system of interaction and should therefore be first be researched in pilots.<br/><br/>The results of the workshop and computations provide a first glance at the system and results. Interviews provided extensive state-of-the-art knowledge on the key determinants. The findings from the interviews are translated into an advice for the City of Amsterdam te develop and execute pilots. These pilots should be able to answer the most important and relevant research questions on the safe mutual interaction between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users in the urban environment.<br/><br/>FCM is found to be useful in the field of transport planning for specific case in which scientific research is limited, with a lack of quantitative data, but available qualitative data from professionals and where human behaviour plays an important role. For the still developing technology of automated driving systems, the method can be useful for as long as quantitative data is not available. As soon as such data is available, other methods are found to be more useful.","Automated vehicles; Vulnerable Road User; Determinants; Interactions; Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping; Urban Environment; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","52.3616815, 4.9077197"

We chose an existing English-language QA system and adapted it to work with Dutch content. An interaction manager was developed for handling the interaction between the system and users. Finally, the system was configured so that it could be interacted with via the Nao robot. The system was then evaluated via two experimental studies. First a quantitative evaluation without users was carried out, evaluating the performance of the system using a collection of test questions. Secondly, a field study with users was done. We took the robot to a day care center where children could ask it questions and assessed the effects of these interactive Q\&amp;A sessions. Results from the quantitative evaluation highlighted slow answering times as the main shortcoming, while recall (70%) and precision (50%) scores were more competitive. The field study showed that even though the occasional repetitiveness and lack of speed were picked up on by users, this did little to curb their enthusiasm. Interaction was smooth, users were interested in many topics the system supported and they continued interacting with it despite the occasional mishap. Overall, the results indicate that, with some speedup, the delivered QA system would be a suitable choice for answering questions about the mentioned topics.","Question Answering; Natural Language Processing; Information Retrieval; Robots; Human-automation interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","RoboTutor",""

The company analysis and market analysis showed that Euretos has an unique positioning compared to its competitors. The Euretos knowledge platform has a large knowledge database which can be used to accelerate the research process and to better understand the complex mechanisms of diseases. The database size and quality which lead to unique knowledge exploration and expansion combined with the relative low price compared to competitors in the same product form category, gives Euretos a strong positioning. The usability of Euretos knowledge platform offered the opportunity to differentiate from the competitors, while also creating the possibility to appeal to a larger group of users. For increased usability, the main points of improvement are increased level of trust from the user in the shown results, more possibilities for collaboration with other researchers and a intuitive, simple, clear, consistent and predictable user interface.<br/>The relation map tool was one of these essential features with the most user interaction. Therefore the relation map tool was chosen to be further developed for this project. The relation map tool offers researchers to visually construct disease mechanisms in a model. By adding phenotypes, diseases, proteins and other concepts as dots on a canvas and creating links between these dots to represent relations supported by papers, a model is constructed to represent specific mechanisms. The small user test study for user validation indicated that the basic needs of the targeted users were fulfilled. The relation map tool was accepted by the participants as a model exploration and model construction tool. Therefore, it can be said that overall the relation map tool is found to be an appropriate solution to perform research, construct models of disease mechanisms and to collaborate with other researchers. <br","big data; global aging; Euretos; drug development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In our method, a soft distance constraint is designed to promise that unclear boundaries in locations with poor image quality can be detected. Due to our distance constraint, evolution speed of level set function around boundaries can be limited effectively, so that it is much easier for unclear boundaries to be detected. Our method is applied to segment MRI CINE left ventricle (LV) data and MRI SPACE left atrium (LA) data. The accuracy of our method is analyzed by quantitative evaluation methods, which reports that Endocardial average perpendicular distance (APD) and Epicardial APD for LA and LV data are both below or around 1 mm, and the dice similarity coefficients (DSC) are all around 0.95. The evaluation results are within a desirable range. Our method has an excellent performance in both segmenting LA and LV data.

A precise control over nucleation and its kinetics is important for both research and industries. Thus, alternative methods are sought after to extend the toolbox for controlling nucleation. In the 1990's, Non-Photochemical Laser Induced Nucleation (NPLIN) was suggested as a promising method to alter the nucleation kinetics. Since then, several reports have demonstrated that NPLIN dramatically reduces the nucleation induction time and controls polymorphism of various fine chemicals relevant for industrial practice. Although different hypotheses have been proposed in literature to explain the experimental observations, the mechanism behind NPLIN is still unknown.<br/><br/>The objective of this work is to extend the mechanistic understanding of NPLIN. This has been approached by qualitatively studying the effect of different factors on the nucleation efficiency of the non-photochemical process using unfocused pulsed laser in aqueous supersaturated solution of KCl. The factors investigated include wavelength, peak intensity, supersaturation, mixing, and impurity level of the solution. Each of these parameters are studied using high number of samples (80-100) to generate a robust set of results and to avoid the stochastic nature of nucleation.<br/><br/>In a separate series of experiments, an acoustic wave was detected in the solution due to the non-linear interaction of the unfocused laser with the system by measuring the pressure signal with a piezo-electric transducer placed just below the air-liquid interface. Further experiments were executed to understand the nature of the acoustic wave and its influence on NPLIN. The results show that laser could induce nucleation at significantly low peak intensities, much below the previously reported intensity threshold in literature. It is also observed that NPLIN shows a strong dependence on peak intensity, supersaturation, impurity level, and mixing of the solution while the dependence on wavelength was found to be weak. Furthermore, the acoustic wave experiments show that the laser induced pressure fluctuations do not affect the nucleation efficiency of the process. Overall, the results suggest that several mechanisms play a role during laser induced nucleation. To summarize, the research provides a robust analysis of different factors that can influence NPLIN. The results can be further utilized to enhance the understanding and applicability of the process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-01","","","","","",""

A promising technology among these is the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). It electrochemically converts chemical energy into electricity. This process is highly efficient and several types of fuel are suitable. Furthermore, the SOFC operates at a high temperature, thus producing high quality excess heat which can be converted into electricity in a thermodynamic power cycle to increase the efficiency. Commonly this is done by a directly coupled gas turbine (GT).<br/>The supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) Brayton cycle has recently received attention for its potential as a next generation power cycle. It combines the advantages of the steam Rankine cycle and air Brayton cycle. So far, two heat sources are mainly considered for this cycle: Nuclear and concentrated solar power (CSP).<br/><br/>The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of integrating a SOFC with a sCOs Brayton cycle. A thermodynamic model of the SOFC- sCOኼ Brayton cycle hybrid system (SSHS) is developed to explore and analyze different concepts that effect the integration of both systems. Methane is converted to syngas in an indirect internal reforming (IIR) setup. The steam required for this process is either fed by a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) or supplied by recirculating<br/>anodic exhaust gas. Both options are considered. Recirculating the exhaust of the cathode is another options that is explored and analyzed. Two sCO2 cycle setups are analyzed in combination with the SOFC system: A simple recuperative<br/>cycle and a recompression cycle. <br/>Different setups of the SSHS are compared on efficiency, complexity of the system and size of the exchangers. For comparison, a directly coupled solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)- GT hybrid system is considered as well.<br/><br/>It is found that the recompression cycle in combination with SOFC system is more efficient than the simple recuperative cycle but significantly increases the complexity of the heat exchanger network, recirculating cathodic air decreases the size of the heat exchangers and increases the efficiency and supplying steam through a HRSG decreases the efficiency. Compared to a directly coupled SOFC-GT system the SSHS is a significantly more complex system. However, it does not require a pressurized SOFC since the sCO2 Brayton cycle is indirectly coupled<br/>to the SOFC. The most efficient setup of the SSHS, combining the recompression cycle with cathode recirculation, has a higher LHV efficiency than the directly coupled SOFC- GT hybrid system, 66.58% over 62.38%. This setup of the SSHS is rather complex though. Other setups of the SSHS show efficiencies similar to that of the directly coupled SOFC- GT hybrid system.<br/>A promising result, but the practical feasibility of the SSHS is something that should be carefullyconsidered in future research and practice.","solid oxide fuel fuel; sCO2 Brayton cycle; SOFC; Hybrid System; Energy; Energy Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, Wilfred (mentor); van der Meer, Frans (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) are becoming a more commonly used building material in many civil engineering applications including locks. One quality of FRPs is the fact that it has a high strength to weight ratio. By applying FRPs in rolling lock gate design, the self-weight of the gate could be significantly reduced. This in turn could lead to less wear-and-tear to the support carriages, mechanical parts and rails. Self-weight is also an important factor in the stability of a rolling lock gate. A minimum weight is required to counter the moment caused by horizontal loads during opening and closing. If FRPs were to be applied in rolling lock gates an optimization of lightweight versus stability will be required. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the technical feasibility of the FRP rolling lock gate and how the gates design is affected by the stability criteria. Also, the question remains if the FRP design can compete with traditional materials, for example steel.<br/>To quantify the problem a case study was chosen: New Lock Terneuzen. A rolling lock gate is set to be constructed to improve the connection between Ghent-Terneuzen. The rolling gates will be very large, with a span of 55 m and a height of approximately 26 m. <br/>Initially, the rolling gate is designed with a box shape. The global dimensions of the box gate are determined with a hand calculation based on the boundary conditions and design input from the chosen case study. Basic strength, deflection and stability checks are performed. The box gate is dimensioned in both FRP and steel. The following dimensions are found for the FRP box gate: Width of 8.96 m, with retaining plates: skin:280 mm, core: 200 mm and webs: skin: 200 mm, core: 200 mm. <br/>The dimensions found with the hand calculation serve as input for a 3D model of the design. The model is created with Scia Engineer. With this software the gate is checked with finite element analysis. Some additional checks, fatigue and creep, are performed.<br/>The box gate model is adjusted to resemble the gate during movement. This is achieved by changing the supports, leaving the top right corner unsupported. In addition to a 3D stability check of the designed box gate, the width between the supports, representing the carriage width, is varied (from 0.5 to 12 m) and the impact on the stability is evaluated. This impact is quantified by the required dead weight to guarantee stability.<br/>All the results are used to come up with potential improvements or alternatives to the box gate design. The main objective being a gate with increased stability, which is again quantified by the overweight required. A number of ideas are discussed, where optimizing the shape of the gate is explored further. <br/>It is found that the required dead weight to achieve stability increased for all evaluated shapes. The main reason is the distribution of the stabilizing moment, which is split up in a horizontal and vertical component. The shape changes result in an shift from horizontal to vertical, which in turn results in more dead weight required to meet the stability criteria.<br/>The application of FRP in rolling gate design is technically feasible. However from a stability point of view it’s questionable if FRP is the better choice over traditional materials. In the chosen case study, the amount dead weight required to fulfil the stability criteria is significant, and the lightweight quality of FRP cannot be fully taken advantage of. Laminates are designed much thicker when compared to the dimensions required to meet strength and deflection criteria. In other words, material is added primarily for the sake of adding weight.<br/><br/>Reducing the required dead weight was proven to be much harder than anticipated. Even though <br/>a wide base gives a larger arm for the vertical couple, which would lead to a smaller force at an equal moment, the required weight is not necessarily reduced. The applied loads, shape of the gate, location of supports and deflections all affect the distribution of loads over the supports, both horizontal and vertical, of the gate. In a structure of this scale, even small differences can have a significant impact on the stability of the gate and the dead weight required to achieve this stability. The required dead weight to meet the stability criteria must be brought down in order for FRP to be a viable option. <br","Rolling lock gate; FRP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pollution due to a large variety of activities of different nature make that water quality monitoring is of high importance (Thanda Thatoe Nwe Win, Bogaard, &amp; Van de Giesen, 2015). For monitoring and modelling the water quality, information about the mixing of tracers trough the river is needed, which can be quantified with the use of dispersion coefficients. Little research has been done about the Ayeyarwady River in general considered its size and importance. Very limited data about the mixing of tracers and the parameters needed to estimate the mixing of tracers was available. This research focuses on the situation around the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin confluence in the first week of February 2017 (dry season). Hence, there is a very different situation during for example wet season. For the water quality, mainly the mixing in the longitudinal direction (direction of the main river flow) is of interest, which can be quantified by a longitudinal dispersion coefficient (Kx). First relevant parameters for estimating Kx were identified based on the theory. This appeared to be the discharge, roughness and bathymetry. Besides, Kx has to be calibrated by floater experiments. To get better insight into the magnitude of these parameters, flow velocity and depth measurements (needed for estimating the discharge, roughness and bathymetry) and floater experiments have been done during a week of fieldwork in the area. Due to loss, theft and destruction of floaters, less data was collected than planed. To get further insight in the mixing of tracers, a numerical model was made in the software Delft3D based on data collected during the fieldwork. Based on the combined results of the theory, measurements done during the fieldwork and the Delft3D model, it is expected that the magnitude of Kx in the Ayeyarwady River is somewhere in between 50-500 m2/s (best estimate: Kx~300 m2/s), although this has to be confirmed by further research. When the found value is compared with values found for other bigger rivers this value for Kx appears to be somewhat on the low side. From the Delft3D model runs follows that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the Chindwin River is higher than in the Ayeyarwady, possibly even a factor 10. Besides, insight in the effect of the different parameters on the dispersion was obtained, contributing to a better understanding of processes causing the mixing of tracers in the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers. Estimating the highly sensitive longitudinal dispersion coefficient (Kx) appeared to be challenging, mostly due to the remote and highly dynamic character of the area. To make a better estimate of Kx, the uncertainty in the parameters needed (discharge, roughness, bathymetry and spreading of floaters for calibration) has to be reduced. Although some modelling options in Delft3D could be tried to narrow the range of these parameters, the best option to reduce this uncertainty is collecting more (high quality) data in the field.","Myanmar; Ayeyarwady River; Dispersion; Delft3D; Confluence","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21.466510, 95.285375"

A liquidity buffer could help to mitigate this risk.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a framework for intraday liquidity risk management within ABN AMRO Bank, while taking different priorities of transactions into account. We examine the use of extreme value theory (EVT) and propose two metrics to capture the risk: the univariate and multivariate risk metric.

This pilot project was constructed in 2011 along the Delfland coast, which is historically prone to erosion. Since its construction, the Sand Engine is intensively being monitored to track the morphological development.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is therefore to assess how the morphology of the Sand Engine is evolving over time and how this evolution contributes to the sediment budgets of the Delfland coast. In this thesis the first five years of morphological evolution of Sand Engine and its surroundings are investigated.<br/><br/>A data analysis is performed on bi-monthly bathymetry measurements, covering the first five years of morphodynamic evolution of the Sand Engine and the surrounding coastal cell. The high temporal and spatial resolution in both alongshore and cross-shore direction, provided the opportunity to perform research in great detail and precision.<br/><br/>Volume changes and sediment transports are successfully derived. Sediments are redistributed in both alongshore and cross-shore direction over the coastal cell. The accretive areas slowly extend alongshore while the erosive part of the Sand Engine remains in the same position. The Sand Engine has a positive net contribution to the sediment budget of 5.8km of coast after 5 years, which is an extension of 3.2km. 4.2Mm^3 of the initially nourished volume of 17.5Mm^3, has been redistributed after 5 years.<br/><br/>A Gaussian curve is fitted to several iso-lines of constant altitude to describe the plan-form adjustment of the Sand Engine at different altitudes. The Gaussian parameters are useful in accurately describing the spatio-temporal behaviour. Yet large differences in adjustment rates are found over the altitude. The decrease in cross-shore extent is fastest around 0m+NAP, and decreases to near zero at -8m+NAP.<br/><br/>Cross-shore profile behaviour is investigated by inspection of the temporal evolution of characteristic cross-sections in accretive and erosive locations along the Sand Engine. Erosive and accretive profiles behave considerably different. The profiles are adjusting rapidly and bed-level activity varies considerably over the altitude, with a maximum morphological activity in the intertidal zone, rapidly decreasing with increasing depth. <br/><br/>The results show that the Sand Engine spreads alongshore and feeds the adjacent coastal sections in the five years after construction. A mega feeder nourishment is therefore capable of supplying sediments to the adjacent coast.<br/>The first year morphodynamic response was much stronger than in any subsequent year. The current results therefore give an improved view on the long-term development of the Sand Engine.","Sand Engine; Sand Motor; Zandmotor; Sediment transport; Sediment budget; Coastal Engineering; Coastal profile; data-driven; Morphodynamics; Morphology; Delfland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","52.0530530, 4.18420108"

Hydraulic forcing from extreme events is a large risk around the global coastlines, the risk being complicated by the increased human presence along the coasts.<br/>The knowledge that vegetation can be used as a coastal protection measure is not something new. The benefits of vegetation have been seen throughout history and are being researched on till date. If we know to a certain confidence what the wave heights are at the shoreline, coastal defence structures, used as a hybrid protection measure, can be designed accordingly. Not much research has been done on the wave behaviour on shallow foreshores.<br/>Localised studies have been previously done on tropical vegetated coasts, but there is a lack of efficient and accurate analysis on a large scale. As we bring more clarity on how waves transform and attenuate in a typically vegetated coast, some questions get answered, and some more questions arise, which also happened during the research done for this thesis.<br/>Observed data, be it laboratory or field, is very crucial in validating numerical models. A laboratory experiment was done in the TU Delft Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics flume, for a complete vegetation-free profile, where the surface elevations were observed for different wavemaker input conditions.<br/>A lot of numerical models have been developed that predict wave transformation and dissipation through vegetated foreshores. However, these models lack validation from observed data. This thesis first focuses on understanding the wave transformation for two unique (and mainly theoretical) wave conditions: a regular sinusoidal wave and a bichromatic wave. It was checked if the transformation is reflected in the models – SWAN and SWASH, which they did.<br/>The research proceeded on to validating the models by comparing the wave heights observed in the laboratory experiment versus when the models were inputted with the same conditions, including inputting the observed data into the models. When the laboratory conditions were replicated, the SWASH results obtained correlated quite well with what was observed in the laboratory. The same was not true in the case of SWAN.<br/>When a spectral analysis was done for the observed data, a presence of very low frequencies (VLF) as well as some minor higher frequencies was noticed. To check its effect, if any, on the model results, they were filtered out. Both the original and filtered data was inputted into the models. The difference in the foreshore region was more distinct in the filtered case, i.e., making a bichromatic elevation input purer resulted in more pronounced undulations in the wave heights than what was predicted in the unfiltered data. This result does not fit well with the existing knowledge on wave dissipation processes. It is widely known that the presence of VLFs and higher frequencies are the driving mechanisms that result in the undulations in the foreshore region, but the predicted results were exactly opposite to this knowledge.<br/>What can be thought of from the anomaly is that the presence of various frequencies (that is, waves with different periods) counteract each other’s effects and make the undulating wave heights milder, but when the signal is made purely bichromatic, it leads to more distinct undulations. This proposition is also backed by the similar SWASH results for the laboratory condition-replicating theoretical inputs. This anomaly needs further investigation.<br/>Another interesting observation was that the changes happening in the offshore region did not affect the results in the foreshore region, for varying parameters in SWAN.<br/>SWASH can be concluded as a better model for predicting wave heights, especially in the foreshore region. SWAN could not predict the fluctuations in the wave heights. Obtaining the wave heights at the shoreline with SWAN, and designing a dike with those results, for example, will lead to disastrous consequences, as SWAN underestimates the wave heights.<br/>The study is limited by the consideration of hydrodynamics only, and by the many simplifications made to simulate the conditions. One of the recommendations formulated is to obtain field data and to make a similar comparison with the models to corroborate (or correct) the observations made.<br/>This study tried to see the correlation between the models and observed data in the laboratory, for simple (and somewhat purely theoretical) cases. It is, nonetheless, a starting point for more complicated cases, the basis for which can be laid on this study.","CoMEM; SWAN; SWASH; Shallow Foreshores; Wave Transformations; Bichromatic Wave; Energy Spectrum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

Usually resulting in an incorrect prediction of boundary layer characteristics. In this study, a hybrid RANS/LES model was developed for transitional boundary layer flows. The transitional kkL-omega turbulence model was combined with the RANS/LES blending function from the framework of the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES). Initial simulations predicted a transition location that agreed with experimental data. However, development of turbulent structures were delayed. Therefore, velocity fluctuations were added to the flow at the location of transition. The intensity of the velocity fluctuations were based on the modelled kinetic energy that is present in the pretransitional boundary layer. The addition of the velocity fluctuations, accelerated the development of turbulence and reduced the classical grey area problem. Flat-plate simulations with different free-stream turbulent intensities all predicted a transition location that agrees with experimental data. The predicted skin-friction in the transitional boundary layer improved with decreasing free-stream turbulence levels. Simulation of a flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil predicted a skin-friction distribution and trailing edge displacement thickness that was superior compared to an existing non-transitional hybrid RANS/LES model. Predicted skin-friction values of a DU91W250 wind turbine airfoil agreed with the kkL-omega RANS results. Right after transition, the kinetic energy of the boundary layer was underpredicted in both simulations. This problem might be solved when the introduced velocity fluctuations more accurately represent the turbulent structures of the pretransitional boundary layer.","transitional; IDDES; hybrid; modelling; laminar; turbulent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Possible applications include search and rescue, surveillance, supply of food and medicines in emergency situations and object manipulation in construction and transportation. An interesting subproblem of load transportation is the control of the position of a cable suspended load. The challenge is in the fact that the quadrotor-load system is highly nonlinear and under-actuated. The load cannot be controlled directly and has a natural swing at the end of each quadrotor movement.<br/>The goal of this thesis is to present a nonlinear geometric control approach, investigate its possibilities and limitations to track the position of a cable suspended load. The focus lies on the quadrotor-load subsystem where the cable tension is non-zero, which is analogous to modeling a rigid link between the quadrotor and load.<br/>After introducing the basic concepts, an introduction is given on geometric mechanics. This differential geometric based approach is used to model and control the system, based on the geometric properties of the system dynamics. It is shown how the configuration of the quadrotor-load system can be described on smooth nonlinear geometric configuration spaces, and analyzed with the principles of differential geometry. This allows for modeling in an unambiguous coordinate-free dynamic fashion, while avoiding the problem of singularities that would occur on local charts.<br/>Next, the geometric properties are utilized to define tracking error functions on these same spaces, making it possible to design almost-globally defined nonlinear geometric controllers.<br/>A backstepping approach is applied to generate a cascaded structure with multiple nonlinear geometric controllers, allowing control of several flight modes that are responsible for the control of 1) quadrotor attitude, 2) load attitude and 3) load position.<br/>Finally, simulations demonstrate the stability and abilities of the nonlinear geometric controller. A Linear Quadratic Regulator is derived to compare both of the control performances.<br/>The tracking performances of both controllers are discussed for three different experiments.<br/>From the results of the experiments can be concluded that the nonlinear control design allows control of multiple states with the final objective of controlling the load position. The nonlinear geometric approach proves effective in load position tracking of complex trajectories and<br/>fast maneuvers, while maintaining stability of the closed-loop system.<br","Quadrotor; Cable-suspended load; Nonlinear Geometric Control; Load position control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under changing market conditions and uncertainty, executives too often fail to foresee strategic options that lead to superior company performance. One reason for this is that executives tend to rely on deductive/inductive logic in order to reduce the risk associated with decision making under uncertainty. Deductive/inductive logic relies on general rules or prior observations. This means, rules or observations must be known prior to the decision. However, during early-stage innovation and strategic planning, future conditions are usually unknown. Therefore, it is unlikely that one will have made all observations necessary for such an explanation. As a consequence, executives often become risk averse and make predictable decision errors.<br/>In order to successfully foresee strategic options—despite changing market conditions and uncertainty—executives need to change their approach and particularly the reasoning they apply. In the area of design and concept selection, scholars promote the use of abductive reasoning. This type of logic forms plausible hypotheses about future outcomes and events instead of deducing/inducing what is known from the past. When using abductive reasoning, thinking becomes more future orientated, and the potential of yet-not-existent concepts and outcomes can be better recognized despite the present uncertainty. This is important not only for design and concept selection, but also for other processes such as strategy development.<br/>Building on prior studies and literature from the field of cognition, strategizing, opportunity recognition, design and abductive reasoning, I hypothesized that abductive reasoning should positively influence company performance. Under the umbrella of a larger research project funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC), I conducted a study investigating this link both qualitatively and quantitatively. The research was conducted at the University of Sydney in cooperation with Delft University of Technology under supervision of Dr. Massimo Garbuio, Dr. Boris Eisenbart and Prof. Andy Dong, and with Prof. Petra Badke-Schaub as chair of the graduation committee.<br/>The study is based on secondary data of 30 US companies in the Software and Development Industry that went public on the US-stock market (NASDAQ) in the period between 2013 and 2014. The data was derived online via the US Securities and Exchange commission database. For the assessment of abductive reasoning, a framework was developed that expands existing frameworks used for the assessment of (abductive) reasoning during concept selection. Financial data were acquired via COMPUSTAT.<br/>Results of the study confirm that abductive reasoning leads indeed to significantly greater company growth performance. Furthermore, abductive reasoning positively influences company profitability when used in conjunction with deductive/inductive logic, and was found to 1) introduce new business or revenue models 2) identify market segments 3) define a product or service offering, 4) invent technical solutions 5) revise and form beliefs/missions, and 6) explain observations such as (market) behavior.<br/>Qualitative analysis suggests that specific observations made prior to or during early-stage venturing—referred to as observation sets—stimulate abductive reasoning. Three different categories of these observation sets were identified: analogy, anomaly and paradox. Observations about technological developments are suggested to enable innovation, i.e. the technical component of a new venture idea, while demographical and organizational observations are often the source of new strategic options.<br/>Up to this point, the most commonly accepted view has been that strategic decisions are made rationally. Therefore scholars advise the use of tools which rely on deductive and inductive logic to assess and create strategic options. Results of the presented research, however, suggests that companies should instead make an effort to complement their strategy development with abductive reasoning approaches. In this paper, the results are discussed, managerial implications and contributions to literature are presented, and future research is suggested.","Abductive reasoning; Performance; Growth; Strategy; Venture creation; Cognition; Business model innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Consequently, the processes underlying motor recovery are a hot research topic. Electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) are two modalities that can be used to find functional and structural predictors for this motor recovery, respectively. Specifically, EEG measures the sources of activity (dipoles) in the brain while dMRI provides estimates of the properties of white matter (WM) tracts such as the fiber orientation. The estimated fiber orientations can be used to reconstruct WM connections in the brain by performing fiber tractography.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we aim to introduce a framework for model selection and probabilistic tractography with parsimonious model selection. Practically, we use a range of multi-tensor models to cope with regions with multiple fiber populations. Furthermore, our probabilistic tractography uses the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound to capture the uncertainty in the fiber orientations. We mitigate the effect of overfitting by using a model selection method that incorporates the ICOMP-TKLD criterion to determine the most appropriate tensor model in each voxel. Ultimately, this framework can be applied to data from stroke patients and combined with functional regions obtained from EEG.<br/><br/>We assessed the performance of the model selection method by investigating the influence of b-value and noise on the ability to detect crossing fibers in the fibercup phantom and human data. In the phantom, our model selection reconstructed all the crossings for the b-value combination of 1500 and \SI{2000}{\s\per\mm\squared} and at a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) comparable to clinical acquisitions. Moreover, our model selection method was able to identify the crossing of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract in the human data.<br/><br/>A range of step sizes and curvature thresholds was used to investigate the sensitivity of our tractography to its input parameters. In general, a smaller step size and lower curvature thresholds resulted in more deterministic behavior, while a larger step sizes and higher curvature thresholds led to more probabilistic behavior and deeper propagation into the gray matter in human data. <br/><br/>We compared the performance of our framework and the open source diffusion MRI toolkit Camino on the fibercup phantom and healthy control data. In this comparison, our framework performed better in curved bundles and reconstructed more lateral projections of the corpus callosum.<br/><br/>Lastly, we explored the subdivision of the brain into modules for stroke patients and healthy controls, by combining our framework with sources obtained from EEG. Fewer modules were found in the patient group, which might be attributed to a change in structural connections after stroke.<br/><br/>Altogether, we have shown that our framework was able to select the appropriate diffusion models in crossing fiber regions and track across these crossings both in a phantom and human data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that it is feasible to combine our framework with source locations obtained from EEG.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Diffusion tensor; Tractography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models require the slurry concentration in the suction arm of a trailing suction hopper dredge (TSHD) as an input. Currently this concentration is estimated based on results of previous projects. To aid in the estimation of the slurry concentration a model that calculates the in situ production and slurry concentration has to be developed.<br/><br/>During this research a model was developed that calculates in situ production by iteratively finding equilibrium between the actuator moments and the cutting moments around a draghead visor hinge. The slurry concentration is then calculated using the in situ production and a function describing the relationship between slurry concentration and dredge pump flow based on data of an existing TSHD.An extension to existing cutting theory was made to model the effects of the presence of water jets in the cutting teeth of the draghead. In this extension water jets were modeled as a pressure source which provides water to reduce the pore under pressures that cause cutting forces.The production model was evaluated by performing sensitivity analyses. In general the course of the production as a function of the trailing speed that was found could be described as a linear increase followed by a steep drop in production after which production started increasing again at a lower rate. It was found that it was mainly the geometry of the draghead that caused this steep drop. Another finding is that the production at operational trailing speeds (1 to 2 knots) is only of a realistic order of magnitude (between 36 and 125 m^3/min in this case) when still in the linear increase.<br/><br/>The conclusions that were drawn during the development of the model and the sensitivity analyses are that the TSHD draghead production might actually be best described as a linear function of the trailing speed and that the angle of internal friction of the sand is the parameter with the largest influence on the production.

This study addresses the clinical need for in-silico modelling to estimate the effect of left ventricular reconstruction through Revivent Myocardial Anchoring System on the function and geometry of the residual left ventricle. The planning tool developed in this study corrects for slice misalignment produced due to breathing motion and patient movement during Cardiac MR image acquisition. The extent and the location of the scar are identified on the contrast enhanced Cardiac MR images and subsequently used to classify the left ventricular short axis contour points into scarred and healthy segments. The reconstruction surgery is simulated by estimating each short axis contour of the residual LV as a circle obtained from the healthy segment. Functional analysis consisted of comparing the simulated residual left ventricular volumes at end-diastolic and end-systolic phase, stroke volume and ejection fraction with the baseline characteristics. Geometrical analysis consisted of quantifying the occlusion of the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract by the plicated scar and comparing the curvedness values of the residual LV with two geometrical models - Modified Simpson’s Model and Biplane Ellipsoid model. The required functional end-points are met for all four patients. A more localized approach is required for the geometrical analysis. The presented approach shows promising results but needs to be clinically validated by comparing with a larger database of post surgical scans to obtain higher accuracy and a more comprehensive understanding of the surgery.<br","Surgical ventricular reconstruction; Planning tool; Ischemic Cardiomyopathy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

To understand kinetics of enzymatic reactions, there is a need to understand how the diffusional encounters of enzyme and substrate proceed in an environment<br/>that is confined and crowded simultaneously. The project carried out in this thesis is the first step towards achieving the ultimate goal of studying biochemical reactions in native cellular environment - Understanding diffusion in confinement. Despite multiple investigations of diffusion of analytes in confinement, there exists a research gap. There is inconsistency in the interpretation of the results and in the dependence of diffusion properties of analytes of different sizes in channels of different dimensions. Hence, to bridge the research gap, the main goal of this thesis project was to find the diffusion coefficient of 100 nm polystyrene beads in microchannel (200 µm wide and 4.5 µm high) and nanochannel (5 or 10 µm wide and 300 nm high). The Brownian motion of particles was observed using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. A preliminary study first confirmed the reliability and optimization of the particle tracking method of finding diffusion coefficient. Diffusion coefficient of the particles determined experimentally in microchannel (bulk system) was in agreement with the theoretical estimate and statistically significant. Experiments in the nanochannel revealed a reduction in the particle diffusion coefficient of about ∼52% compared to bulk, due to interactions with the confining depth<br/>(300 nm) of nanochannel. An interesting behaviour was also exhibited by particles diffusing close to the side wall along the width of nanochannels, which was not confining (5 or 10 µm). The diffusion coefficient in such a case reduced by around ∼90% relative to bulk. The reduction in both cases can be mainly attributed to hydrodynamic interactions. The experimental investigations of diffusion coefficient carried out in this study were in agreement with long standing theoretical predictions. However, the research gap could not be fully expelled.<br","diffusion; nanochannel; confinement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-31","","","","","",""

(mentor); Bauer, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The past few decades have seen a revival of the interest in wireless power transfer (WPT) long after the first experiments dating as far back as Nikolai Tesla in the 19th century. The rise of the autonomous electronic devices like medical implants, or portable devices like mobile phones, have motivated the search for wireless power charging systems. The growing interest in electric vehicles has helped this surge in research, with WPT promising to be a faster, more practical, vandalism-free charging method. One main problem with WPT systems is their low tolerance to misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver, affecting their efficiency. Another issue is the danger of being obstructed by foreign (metallic) or live objects, heating them to unsafe levels.<br/>This thesis investigates a possible solution for both problems in WPT by suggesting a modular primary design, rather than a singular transmitter. The different transmitter coils can be turned on and off if sufficiently aligned with the receiver, and not obstructed by parasitic objects.<br/>The thesis starts by introducing WPT and offering theoretical background information. The optimal coil geometry is investigated for this thesis, and found to be in agreement with literature as a square coil. An example is then studied for the design of a 1m2 square area segmented into 16 identical coils, with a proposed circuitry for connecting the coils, as well as controlling them. The studied coils are single, one-turn, air-cored coils. The possible values of the equivalent total inductance of the primary are computed for all the combinations of activated coils producing 5020 unique values. A capacitor bank design is then proposed to match all the possibilities. With the help of some operating frequency lenience around resonance of 1.8% of the resonance frequency, the designed capacitor matrix is able to answer all 5020 inductance possibilities with as few as 19 capacitors. A flowchart mapping the design process is offered.<br/>The misalignment tolerance of the new design is analyzed, and is found to be superior to that of a conventional coil. The enhanced response to foreign and live objects is intrinsic to the modular design, and so is the safer magnetic influence on the surroundings, due to the smaller, more-concentrated operating coils.<br/>The Finite Element Methods (FEM) verification of the results showed discrepancies in the behaviors due to the failure of the developed analytical models to grasp the underlying physics of the repulsed magnetic fluxes. This behavior is important in studying the behavior of adjacent inductors, and further FEM and/or experimental verification of the results is encouraged. Further suggestions are made for future works to optimize the design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A promising solution to this problem would be the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to useful products, using the surplus of electricity from renewable sources. This would be a way of storing this excess of electricity in chemical bonds. However, this has not reached high efficiency and selectivity needed for establishing its use. For this process, the CO2 is usually dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte. This thesis proposes the new approach, using Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) which would capture a higher concentration of CO2 helping to make the whole process more efficient. However, not all salt mixtures reach the eutectic point and therefore, the solvents formed are a low-transition temperature mixtures (LTTMs) of the selected salts.<br/><br/>Experimental work was performed to find out if these solvents can be used for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. Non-reported LTTMs were synthetized; they were formed with mixtures of the hydrogen bond donor citric acid (CA), fructose (F) and diethanolamine (DEA) with the hydrogen bond acceptor tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBA-Cl) and different quantities of water, which was found necessary to carry out electrochemistry since the solvents formed were too viscous, and this water has an important effect in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 as proton source and charge carrier.<br/><br/>These solvents were characterized electrochemically, performing studies to find out on which metallic surface they behave better (wider working potential window, low degree of decomposition and adsorption) and how different water quantities affect this process. These studies were performed using cyclic voltammetry. From this, it was seen that the solvents are more stable during electrochemical process in presence of copper. Moreover, the solvent formed by DEA:TBA-Cl:H2O in the molar proportions 1:1:1,375 was found to have interesting features that resemble CO2 reduction. As result, this solvent was further analysed using electrochemical in-situ Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in surface-enhanced attenuated total reflectance configuration. With this, it was seen that the carbon dioxide was captured by the solvent and that there are visible changes when applying potential. Remarkably, the data shows the formation of a dimer OCCO on the Cu electrode surface, stabilized by the solvent. <br/><br/>This project shows for the first time the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in LTTMs, evaluating different solvents, metals and water quantities.

They have the advantages that they are light-weight, do not corrode and theoretically require little maintenance during their lifespan. Originally they were used to construct reinforcement, cables and small bridges but more and more they are finding uses for larger scale structures. One of these newer applications is in lock gates.<br/><br/>Locks are structures which are responsible for enabling water based transport while also retaining high water where necessary and are critical links in the water defence system of a region. Their gates also have a relatively large risk of collision due to the amount of moving vessels passing through them. In order to safely construct these lock gates from FRP laminates it is important that their response to such collision loads is well understood. This is the focus of this study with the aim to construct a model to help better understand the collision scenario.<br/><br/>To make the theory concrete a case study is done on the lock gates of Sluis III which is situated in the Wilhelminakanaal in Tilburg. These gates are, at the time of writing, the largest FRP lock gates in the world. With the down stream gates being 13.9 by 6.3 meters. The event in which a Class III vessel collides with these gates will be examined in detail.<br/><br/>The collision is schematised as a one dimensional collision using a series of springs and dampers to obtain understanding of the general collision behaviour. From this model it is concluded that the application of a load from the ship’s engine or taking elastic deformations of the ships bow into account has negligible influence of the results (in the order of 2%), simplifying the calculations considerably. This simple model is later advanced in three ways: Two numerical finite element models are used to determine the structural response of the gate elements on a global and local scale and a more advanced analytical model is made to account for non-elastic deformation in the ship’s bow. The gate’s structure consists of multiple overlapping laminates which together form the skins of the gate. The numerical model is set up in two ways, one of which is used to determine the overall response of the gate element and the other to focus on the interlaminar resin layer in the skins. The results show that it is of importance to apply the load in a realistic manner as the results may vary widely depending on bow shape and point of impact. The approximation suggested in the Dutch codes in which the load is applied as a distributed load of a 0.5m2 areas proved to be inaccurate. For this reason a dynamic LS-Dyna calculation is run using a rigid model of the ships bow to apply the load. The outcome of this analysis shows minor damage to the gate over a large area around to point of impact, but the stresses remain under the failure limit of the laminates except for the internal flanges directly under the impact. These flanges will fail, but this will not threaten the water retention of the gate. The stresses in the resin layer also remain under their critical limit. It can be concluded that the gate satisfies the requirements but significant repairs will be necessary to restore it to a fully operational state.<br/><br/>The expanded analytical model is based on the fact that the force between the bow and the gate is larger than the failure load of the bow itself. The failure which will then take place will dissipate large portions of energy (in the order of 50%) making the current approach, in which this does not take place, highly conservative. The model suggested here is a segmented failure model in which parts of the ship bow fail completely once their failure load in reached. The results of this model are dependent on a series of inputs based on the ships structure and the damping during collision, but for all input values within their expected regions it shows a significant reduction in the amount of the energy that must be retained by the gate as well as a decreased sensitivity to the, hard to predict, damping factor. This model shows potential to reduce material usage for lock gates in which collision<br/>are considered governing. With further refinement this model could be used during the design of future lock gates to come to a cheaper design. Experimental data would serve an important purpose during this refinement.","FRP; Collision; Locks; ANSYS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some shreds of pottery seem to confirm that the objects found were originating from the Middle Iron Age.1 Some of the objects were egg-shaped and hollow, with a small opening on the tip. The objects did awaken the thought that they might have been used as molds for melting metal. In this report the egg-shaped crucibles, or now called ‘eggs’ are further investigated. The crucibles are examined by X-ray micro-CT scans and XRF analyses. The micro-CT scans are viewed and processed by Avizo 9.3. Results show that the eggs consist out of a half shell which is wrapped into a second shell. The second shell was still soft when wrapping, and therefore the metal scraps laid down inside the lower shell left some imprints within the outer shell. Also some highly attenuating materials can be found on the scans. This indicates the presence of metals as well as metal oxides or minerals with a high atomic number. In three eggs a large quantity of highly attenuating materials is found. In two of those eggs, these materials are seepage of metal that has been molten. In the other egg it is more likely to be a mineral, since the material is surrounding vesicles formed during the heating of the eggs. The XRF data showed that the objects are made out of clay. Some glassy looking parts on the outside of the eggs turned out to be precipitated quartz. The main metal that has been molten was found to be bronze, since high amounts of copper and tin were found. <br","metal recycling; archaeology; XRF; X-ray micro-CT","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In this system, photons inside a cavity interact with a macroscopic harmonic oscillator through the radiation pressure force. Depending on the type of structure, opto-mechanical systems can be used in, for example, precision sensing, including force and acceleration measurements, testing fundamental physics such as quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale and the link between quantum physics and gravity. Also, it potentially plays an important role in quantum information, where optical photons can be used to transmit quantum information in a long range and the mechanical oscillation is used to couple to other types of local qubits where quantum information is processed.<br/><br/>Previously, many of the aforementioned applications have been demonstrated and are shown it to be a promising system. The mechanical oscillator has been cooled down to close to its ground state. Furthermore, for the opto-mechanical system with high quality oscillator, the macroscopic harmonic oscillator is possible to be cooled down to its quantum ground state from room temperature, opening up a new regime where quantum experiments on massive objects can be done at room temperature. Moreover, non-classical states between photons and the harmonic oscillator have been achieved, making it close to real applications in quantum information and approaching the testing and realizing quantum entanglement of large objects. In an opto-mechanical system, there are different structures. Two examples, which are both of great interested, are the Fabry-Pérot cavity with photonic crystal and the nanobeam. In a Fabry-Pérot cavity, which is the prototype of most of the cavity opto-mechanics system, there are two reflectors. One is fixed, and another one acts as an harmonic oscillator. To enlarge the interaction, the oscillating reflector is made of thin photonic crystal slab. For the nanobeam cavity, the mechanical resonator is the nanobeam itself, and it also forms a cavity where the optical field is trapped inside. This two systems have their own strengths and drawbacks, which are suitable for different applications.<br/><br/>In this work, both types are explored. In the Fabry-Pérot cavity, the set-up is usually bulky. Is it possible to make the footprint of the whole set-up smaller such that it can be integrated into a chip? If the answer is yes, it would be a great boost to its sensing application where easy-to-use devices are usually needed. Moreover, for the photonic crystal, is there a limitation on its thickness? Previously, in our group, we have noticed that the reflectivity of a photonic crystal drops sharply if the thickness is reduced, though the simulation still yields a reflectivity close to unity. The results of these two problems are presented in chapter 3 and chapter 4, respectively. The results for the nanobeam cavity are shown in chapter 5. Designs are proposed, aiming at increasing the photon-phonon coupling while keeping the photon decay rate unchanged.","Optomechanics; Photonic crystal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of these patients, 80% needs to exercise in order to rehabilitate from their complaint. However, a large problem arises since 50-70% of the patients do not do as they are instructed. This project focuses on creating a business viable solution, aiming to increase the amount that patients exercise.<br/><br/>This project originated from problems that the researcher experienced, personally as a patient. A first step to a solution was sought within the Ready to Start up course (Q2, 2016). The project continued as an entrepreneurial graduation in collaboration with Rik Burger, a TU Delft alumnus. Rik Burger had developed a technology to improve the exercise execution quality. This formed the starting point of this project.<br/><br/>The project has taken an integral approach by focusing on the aspects of: human (desirability), business (viability), technology (feasibility) and society (responsibility). Extensive desk research regarding the market, literature study and qualitative research, have been conducted. Altogether: 50 patients were surveyed and 9 patients, 25 therapists, 2 care purchasers (Dutch: zorginkoper), 2 financial chiefs of two large healthcare institutions and 1 paramedical advisor of an insurance company were all interviewed.<br/><br/>Through literature study and qualitative research a model was established which depicts 17 means to increase the amount that patients exercise. After internal and external ideation, 13 different functionalities were sketched and proposed to patients. The 9 selected functionalities formed one concept, named UNIPHY, which was proposed to therapists. Through their feedback the concept was enhanced. Subsequently, a high fidelity prototype was created, which was once again proposed to therapists. <br/><br/>The problem of not exercising as recommended, has been identified as complex, and to be one of the elements that harms healthcare quality. The designed product service system has evolved into an integral approach towards the improvement of exercise therapy quality and thereby the amount that patients exercise. Through a patient application and therapist dashboard, UNIPHY offers digital tools (figure on the right) which enable remote: support, evaluation, and management. With the help of these tools, the product service system facilitates the physical rehabilitation process which is expected to become faster, safer and delightful. Through qualitative research, patients and therapists have indicated to expect an increase in quality and thereby compliance. <br/><br/>Using UNIPHY, it is expected that the quality of life for 1 million patients can be increased and that healthcare costs related to exercise therapy will be reduced. Both aspects are considered to be a benefit for the insurance companies as well as to Dutch society. Research has indicated that the therapy market is competitive and that therapists are underpaid, and are therefore in need for a differentiating service. With the help of UNIPHY, they are expected to be able to do so and thereby increase their market share. <br/><br/>However, regarding the design, several aspects of the product still need to be developed further. The usage of sub goals, which plays a large role in drastically reducing the amount of time spent by a therapist, requires more detail through usage of actual use cases. Furthermore, currently patients are still able to falsely register their physical activity. Although attempts are made to obstruct this, research will still be required to investigate its impact. Lastly, several aspects of the posture feedback functionality need to be developed further. This can be done once the required technology is developed further to realize feedback that is sufficiently accurate. <br/><br/>According to the first estimations, €75K seed funding will be required in order to take this project further. The process of attracting funding can be initiated as soon as the business plan is finalized. With seed funding at hand, the product should be evaluated as a whole with the help of a second generation prototype. Once this is positively evaluated, the UNIPHY minimum viable product (MVP) needs to be designed, tested for its usability and validated through a clinical trial. To do the latter, a healthcare institution partnership will be essential. After validation of the essence, it is expected that the concept can grow further. With the help of another round of funding, more functionalities can be included.","exercise therapy; rehabilitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This structure also removes constraints such as lattice matching for the two cells. Hence many different types of four terminal cells can be developed.<br/>In this work, high bandgap hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiO፱:H) thin film top cell was fabricated using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Three different types of c-Si cells namely, poly-Si, interdigitated back contact (IBC) and silicon heterojunction (SHJ (Hybrid)) were<br/>utilised as the bottom cells. This is the first instance where an a-SiO፱:H based cell has been used with c-Si cells in a four terminal application.<br/>Before actual fabrication, theoretical calculations using two parameters called as Response 4T and Spectral Response 4T were made to determine the optimal configuration as well as the efficiency enhancement for the four-terminal device. From this theoretical calculation, an efficiency gain of almost 4% can be obtained when an a-SiOx:H top cell is used with a poly-Si cell in four terminal<br/>configuration. Gain between 1% and 2% can be realised by utilising four terminal topology for IBC and SHJ (Hybrid) bottom cells. These gains in efficiency are in comparison to the efficiency of the bottom cell alone.<br/>A first of its kind- bifacial a-SiO፱:H cell with the efficiency of 6.60% (V<sub>oc</sub>:0.97 V, J<sub>sc</sub>:10.31 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and fill factor:0.66) was developed. Using this cell as the top cell four terminal devices were fabricated. A gain in efficiency of 0.46% was obtained for the four terminal device based on the poly-Si bottom cell.<br/>Further analysis of the four terminal devices using GenPro4 simulation tool was also performed. The analysis pointed to the reflection due to the top cell substrate glass as the limiting factor in improving the efficiency of the four terminal cell further. Parasitic absorption in the carrier selective layers of the<br/>thin film cell was another contributor to the losses. Through this work, the potential of four terminal device concept was analysed and actual development of the device was carried out. From the work done, future steps in improving the efficiency of the four terminal device were also deduced.<br/>Present work positively brought hope for further improvement in efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells.<br/><br","Four-Terminal Mechanically-Stacked Solar Cells; Hydrogenated Amorphous silicon Oxide; Crystalline Silicon; GenPro4","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Experience-based decision making by crew plays a key role in the safe and effective execution of maritime operations. For yachts and naval vessels, common operations can be identified as helicopter operations (take-off and landing), launch and recovery of small craft and (dis)embarkment to and from these small craft. All of these operations are limited by wave-induced ship motions.<br/><br/>For these operations, experience-based decision making does however not always guarantee that the operations are carried out in the most safe and effective manner possible. Also, the level of comfort as experienced by a yacht-owner or guests can be directly affected by this type of decision making. With this in mind, Feadship aims to develop a Feadship Comfort System (FCS), which can contribute to the decision making process. One of the elements of this system is ought to be a waveradar. The aim of this thesis is to describe how the waveradar can be included effectively in the FCS, and how it can be used for the above mentioned operations. <br/><br/>The waveradar is in basis a common navigation radar that can perform measurements of the surface elevation in the direct surrounding of a vessel. These measurements can be used to predict the ship's motions up to approximately two minutes ahead in time. With this, windows of opportunity can be distinguished when operations can be carried out best. These windows depend on the corresponding limiting criteria that are set on the ship's motions. A major issue is however that sea trials have shown that the roll prediction is inaccurate.<br/><br/>Due to this problem, two methods are evaluated in this thesis to improve the accuracy of the roll prediction. These methods are set up such that they are practical in use and can be applied directly to the deterministic wave predictions from the waveradar. The first method is scaling the response based on the roll motion history, whereas the second method is based on scaling the roll damping. The latter is effectively linearising the viscous contribution to the roll damping. <br/><br/>As no data from sea-trials is present to compare these methods, a benchmark calculation is carried out based on Cummins approach. In these time-domain calculations, a linear and non-linear roll damping coefficient are taken into account, which are based on a decay test that is available at De Voogt Naval Architects (DVNA). This follows from model tests performed by MARIN. <br/><br/>Comparing both methods to this benchmark calculation showed that the method of scaled damping resulted in the best approximation, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of (only) 33 %. Also, in terms of the behaviour of the motion envelope, this method showed the closest approximation of the two methods. It is found that the way in which both methods influence the RAO of the roll motion has a great influence on the results found. More suitable methods that should provide a better approximation are suggested from this, such as a frequency dependent scaling of the roll damping. This is however not discussed further. <br/><br/>With the method of scaled damping, the practical application of the waveradar within the FCS is evaluated. For the common operations of yachts and naval vessels, limiting criteria on ship motions are obtained from literature or stated by the author. The majority of these criteria are RMS values, for which a method is suggested to use them real-time. In this method, the most probable maxima are obtained from the RMS criteria, which are then applied as real-time criteria. This showed impractically large results, which showed that this method does not suffice.<br/><br/>From this conclusion it follows that the analysis of the practical application of the waveradar is only carried out for the (dis)embarkment of small craft. From this, design considerations for the FCS are obtained, from which the main result is that heading suggestion is one of the most important tasks that the system needs to be capable of.<br/><br/>Finally, a performance monitor has been evaluated for yachts at anchor. This performance monitor displays the predicted Comfort Rating (CR) real time, which can be used by the yachts crew to evaluate the current anchor location. This is a specific desire of Feadship and is developed next to the other operations. For this application, heading suggestion is also one of the most important tasks that the FCS needs to be capable of.<br","Deterministic wave prediction; Waveradar; Time domain calculations; Frequency domain calculations; Workability; Decision making; Roll damping; Motion prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Hydromechanics","",""

However, Bagging can be a slow technique, since its computational cost scales linearly with the size of the ensemble. We propose a Dropout-inspired method, BagDrop, as a solution to the problem of computationally high cost of Bagging. We conduct experiments on a regression problem with fully-connected Neural Networks. Our results show that BagDrop does well in terms of generalization performance and computational cost.

Modeling errors and uncertainty in the parameters cause controller performance to decrease, and, in some cases, can even destabilize the closed-loop system. This paper shows that, whilst H2 optimal control provides excellent nominal performance, perturbations in the plant cause significant degradation of robust performance. In an effort to increase the robustness, structured parametric uncertainty is accounted for in the model and used to design a μ-controller for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. To this end, the structure in which the uncertainty presents itself is derived from the partial differential equation and its discretization. This proves that μ-synthesis is feasible for active flow control applications, showing that robust performance can be maintained in the presence of perturbations in the plant and guaranteeing robust stability for an acceptable range of uncertainty. Future research should include mixed feedback-feedforward or aggregated actuator/sensor configurations, which could further increase robust performance and stability characteristics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Coastal zones are very important, since they are a source of valuable living and non-living resources for its population, and they also act as a natural protection against floods. Notably, the natural dynamics driven by the sea and the man-made actions on the land change them continuously. Consequently, the need for systematic coastal protection and management arises, for which coastal monitoring is of paramount necessity. The emergence of remote sensing in this field has been proven to have many advantages, especially due to the large coverage that it offers in a time- and cost-efficient way. Thus, the subject of this study is one of these remote sensing techniques, specifically the UAV Laser Scanning. UAV Laser Scanning has been introduced in the field of coastal monitoring quite recently, yet it has already proven to be a useful tool, outperforming the other methods used for the same purpose in a number of aspects. Its high accuracy and resolution coupled with flexibility and time efficiency make it a very promising technique. It works on the same principle as all the other laser scanning techniques. Its system components are a platform (drone), a laser scanner, a GNSS receiver and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The aerial system used in this study Alpha AL3-32, by Phoenix LiDAR Systems, in combination with a DJI Spreading Wings S1000 Octocopter. One of the main aims of this study was to investigate the error budget of that system and its impact on the positioning accuracy. The sources of error in such a system are its three main components as well as possible misalignments between these components, that cause bore-sight and lever-arm errors, coordinate system transformations and temporal interpolation issues. Herein, an error model was used for the determination of the quantitative impact of them on the positioning accuracy. Using the uncertainties of the instruments that Alpha AL3-32 consists of, the a priori positioning accuracy of the system was estimated equal to 2 cm. In addition, its dependency on the flight parameters was proven. The a posteriori positioning accuracy was derived by investigating a small flat dataset of the UAV Laser Scanning point cloud and was estimated to be 2 cm as well. From the same dataset, the precision was also computed as being equal to 4 cm. When it comes to the products of this technique, one of the main methods to analyse the morphological changes in coastal zones is by comparing Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from different epochs. Thus, the generation of accurate DTMs was the other important objective of this study. The standard procedure includes preparation of the dataset, noise removal and above ground analysis. After the ground-only dataset was derived, it was converted into a grid using interpolation, namely the Moving Average or Moving Planes method. The grid size of the DTM can go down to 5 cm. In addition, the RMSE between the UAV Laser Scanning only-ground point cloud and the derived DTM was computed equal to 4 cm, while the DTM accuracy in height was estimated equal to 8 cm by using an empirical formula based on the point density and the slope of the terrain. Considering the 3D coordinate accuracy that can be achieved with such a system as well as the DTM quality, UAV Laser Scanning was found to be an appropriate technique for coastal monitoring, presenting important advantages over other competing methods. It can reduce the time and cost of surveys at the coastal zones and at the same time maintain high resolution with its high point density.","UAV Laser Scanning; Coastal Monitoring; Error budget; Digital Terrain Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The World Stress Map (WSM) is the main source of present-day stress data in Western Europe and indicates a regional NW-SE maximum horizontal stress (SH) trend for the Netherlands. However, for more local studies the WSM lacks the required resolution. Therefore, the first objective of this research is to expand the Dutch Stress Map (DSM) database in which SH orientations are collected. As such, a better understanding can be obtained of the horizontal stress field with depth and the SH orientations that deviate from the regional trend. In addition, this research aims to characterize the in-situ stress regimes with depth in the Groningen field, using different one-dimensional stress models. <br/><br/>This research first highlights the importance of the stress state and indicates which in-situ stress information is currently lacking in the Netherlands. Moreover, it is shown how stress-induced borehole features serve as basis for the determination of horizontal stress directions. The datasets used to expand the DSM database are presented, after which an extensive analysis is performed on the collected SH orientations. Subsequently, the stress magnitudes are quantified by studying the sensitivity of the in-situ stress regime to different 1D stress models. Moreover, the workflow is described for developing a 3D geomechanical model, which can serve as basis for future studies.<br/><br/>The research shows that the DSM database is expanded with 86 new boreholes across the Dutch on- and offshore regions. The analysis of the database indicates a dominant NW-SE SH orientation, both spatially and with depth. In most stratigraphic groups, the SH direction falls within the range of 315° ±22.5°, although a larger degree of variation is observed in the post-salt stratigraphies. On a local scale, two case studies show that SH orientations, which deviate from the regional NW-SE trend, can be related to the presence of a salt structure and a normal fault. The 1D in-situ stress models all indicate a normal faulting stress regime at reservoir depth (Rotliegend) and deeper. In the interval between the reservoir and Earth’s surface, no unambiguous stress regime is identified as the regime is more sensitive to the different boundary conditions applied.<br","The Netherlands; World Stress Map; Horizontal stresses; Image logs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

This complex soil behavior is commonly related to case studies such as submarine flow slides.<br/>The main objective of this project is to use a finite element method (FEM) based on a Hypoplasticity (HP) framework to numerically simulate the experimental data obtained from the Static liquefaction tank facility of Delft University of Technology.

The absence of self-absorption and the large spectral overlap with the solar spectrum make it an attractive addition to current building-integrated photovoltaics development. Such Tm2+-doped materials have so far been limited to halides that are susceptible to decomposition when exposed to air, which compromises its stability and limits the application. The solutions to functionalize the characteristic Tm2+ photoluminescence properties are two-fold: by an alternative inorganic host (CaSi2O2N2) that is insensitive to moisture, or by using a protective barrier (silicone) that protects halides against decomposition upon exposure to air. The proposed alternative phosphor CaSi2O2N2:Tm is synthesized by solid-state reaction and its luminescent property is examined. The Tm dopant is found to exist in trivalent state (Tm3+) and no luminescence of Tm2+ is found in the material. Besides Tm2O3, different starting powders with other oxidation states (TmI2 and Tm metal powder) were tested to reduce Tm3+ ion to Tm2+ but no change has been observed. It is concluded that the high-lying Tm2+ 4f electronic ground state in CaSi2O2N2 is susceptible to oxidization by losing electrons to its conduction band and therefore unlikely to be stabilized with this synthesis method. The protective barrier approach applied to the NaCl:Tm2+ phosphors was realized by a polydiphenylsiloxane silicone encapsulant. The precursors and the phosphors are cured together in a lamination scheme between two pieces of glass. From the optical properties derived from its absorption and transmission spectra, it is concluded that the Tm2+ valence state of NaCl:Tm2+ is stable in the polymer with no sign of Tm3+ formation at all. While its production process and the relative amount of phosphor still need to be further optimized, a proof-of concept has been attained.","CaSi2O2N2; Powerwindow; thulium; phosphor-in-silicone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I take these park communities as the case study for the project and research what challenges they face. By creating a design that supports the community in dealing with these challenges, I aim to derive insights on how citizen communities can be supported by design. <br/><br/>The research on the current park context exposed the challenge of getting citizens involved in the park activities. By iteratively specifying and redefining the design goal, it was finally formulated to supporting the park user to become a park maker. <br/><br/>From ideation and design activities, the design of Park Makers was created based on the insights that were obtained on the park context. With this design, park users can match with other park users and propose ideas for the park. The design aims to improve the transparency of the park community and simultaneously manifest the different park users with their unique interests and motivations. <br/><br/>The design was evaluated with park users and the park community. Park Makers is strong in creating an overview of the various park users and the activities they execute in the park. The matching function would be especially of value to lonely citizens. The idea wall and propose idea functions invite citizens to concretize their ideas for the park in a simple manner. When proposing an idea, the rules of the park and the conditions the idea should meet must be clear from the start and need to be integrated in the platform. The implementation plan and costs should be detailed in a further developing phase.<br/><br/>The aim of the project was to research how citizen initiatives could be supported by design. The results from the evaluation research therefore were analysed again to extract guidelines on designing for a citizen participation community. The design of Park Makers enhances the flexible and non-committal characteristics of citizen initiatives and creates an overview of who is in the community and what activities are being organised. The differences of people in the community, for instance their personal interests or motivations to participate, should be facilitated and balanced with contributing to the common cause. <br/><br/>Citizens need to experience the three concepts in the community for them to continue participation. Citizens requires something in return for their work (mutual exchange), the feeling that all members are involved in organising the park (self-organisation) and finally that they are responsible for the park (shared ownership).<br/><br/>The guidelines for designing for citizen participation found in this project can be used to develop more concepts that demonstrate the application of the guidelines. These concepts can then again be evaluated to adjust the guidelines and to keep on improving the understanding of the behaviour, motivations and interests of people in a citizen participation context.","OpenDataLab Rotterdam; Open4Citizens; Community; Empowerment; Participation; Rotterdam; Self-management; Design Guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","Open4Citizens",""

This may lead to unnecessary tissue damage when gripping tissue in a laparascopic procedure, as shown in a prior literature study. The goal of this MSc thesis project is the implementation of haptic feedback in a prototype of a master-slave surgical system and a new laparoscopic gripping instrument that is currently under development. Both the master-slave system and the gripping instrument are collaborations between the TU Delft and the Leidse Instrumentmakers School. The master-slave setup is meant as a testing and demonstrating platform for robotic laparoscopic instrument prototypes. It uses the same instrument interface as the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). The Shaft-Actuated-Tip-Articulation-4-Flexors (SATA-4F) laparoscopic gripper prototype is meant as an alternative to the gripping instruments the da Vinci uses. <br/><br/>The SATA-4F instrument is outfitted with force sensors and the master-slave system is equipped with sensors and actuators.<br/>Different low-end force sensors are compared in terms of linearity, precision, hysteresis, drift and signal-to-noise ratio. A sensor is selected based on the results. Four concepts for implementing the sensors into the SATA-4F instrument are proposed and assessed. The selected concept is implemented. Three concepts for the master handle are also proposed and assessed. After the first prototype failed, a second one is produced. The second prototype has proven to function properly. <br/>System Identification techniques are used to analyze the system components. No models with a target score of 95% are found using the System Identification Toolbox. Three different control strategies are compared and one of them is selected. The Force-Reflection controller is programmed and the system is tested and evaluated. <br/><br/>A simple force-pulling task was designed, where subjects held synthetic tissue with the master-slave robot. A small DC motor mounted on a force measuring platform pulled at the tissue. The participants were tasked with holding the tissue in place, while minimizing grasping forces. Letting novices perform this task results in significantly lower mean maximum gripping forces when force feedback is switched on. However, the participants let go of the tissue more often as well. There were no visible significant learning effects. Reaction forces measured by a platform have no effect on the mean maximum gripping forces. There is also no visible relation between the failed trials and the reaction forces of these trials.<br/><br/>While writing this thesis and working on the project, other students have been working on the project as well. New designs have been made for both the mechanical parts of the master and the slave device. The SATA-4F instrument itself will also be redesigned. The goals presented in this thesis have largely been achieved. However, the master and slave devices need more work. While the mechanical parts of the master and the slave are being redesigned, the control loop and sampling frequency is too low. The 3D motion of both the master and the slave have been disabled because of this. While MATLAB and the LabJack have been extremely useful for designing and testing, it seems that MATLAB and a LabJack are not suitable for the control of a surgical robot. <br/><br/>The setup can now be used for testing and demonstrating prototype laparoscopic instruments. With the new master and slave components and significant other improvements, the setup can be used to compare different haptic feedback controllers as well. It can also be used to do more research in the field of robot-assisted surgery with respect to haptic feedback. If two robotic laparoscopic instruments with all degrees of freedom would be available, typical experiments such as knot-tying or suturing could be performed with and without force feedback to fully investigate the usefulness of the feedback. Of course, force feedback can be implemented in more, if not all degrees of freedom; aside from gripper forces, reaction forces and torques on the instrument itself can also be measured and fed back to a surgeon. This would allow for even more research in the field of robotic surgery with respect to feedback.<br","laparoscopic surgery; Telemanipulation; Robotics; haptic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The stability mechanisms are investigated by conducting two type of physical model tests. First, 23 dry pull-out tests are done to obtain insights into the aspects and mechanisms that influence the armour layer stability. At 8 locations per slope, blocks are pulled out to determine the force needed to extract an armour unit. Tests are done on a 3:4 slope with 2 pull-directions; under an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the slope and perpendicular to the slope. Concrete as well as plastic armour units are tested, both having a different surface roughness. The conclusions of the pull-out tests are verified by means of the second type of model tests; small scale physical hydraulic model tests in a 2D wave flume. In total, 10 tests are conducted; 6 tests with plastic armour units and 4 tests with concrete armour units. Each test starts with a run with a small significant wave height which is increased stepwise in each run until failure occurs. All test sections have a 3:4 slope and are subjected to waves with a 4% steepness. Additionally, the influence of the significant wave height step size for successive runs is investigated. The combination of both physical model tests results in recommendations for a change in design which is expected to lead to a higher stability of an armour layer with Xbloc<sup>+</sup> armour units.","breakwater; concrete armour unit; Xbloc+; Xbloc+ v1; uniform; stability; extraction; pull-out test; 2D model test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Musical signal enhancement is a separate issue from the well-studied speech enhancement problem due to the particularly wide range of signal characteristics encountered, and thus requires a very general approach. Because similar issues drive denoising advances in seismic signal processing, it is argued that an algorithm can be developed through<br/>a cross-disciplinary approach. Inspired by an enhancement method for seismic sections, noise reduction is achieved by applying a singular value decomposition-based image enhancement technique, known as eigenimage filtering, to the time-frequency representation of the musical signal. Classic eigenimage filtering approximates a full-rank matrix by its closest rank-deficient<br/>approximation; the preserved and discarded parts of the matrix correspond to the signal and noise subspaces, respectively. Under the assumption of a quasi-stationary signal, this technique is applied to the short-time Fourier transform of the signal. However, because the standard eigenimage filtering approach results in unwanted residual noise characteristics when applied in this domain, an adapted version of the technique is used. In this adaptation, all singular values are altered but none are set to zero, and the alteration is dependent on the singular values encountered.<br/>Therefore, the method is data-adaptive. Subjective and objective performance measures indicate that the method is capable of improving the quality of noisy recordings, and that its quality is competitive compared with an open-source noise reduction algorithm whilst having the advantages of automation and fewer user-defined parameters.","Noise; Audio; Music; Algorithm; Digital signal processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics","",""

These questions are as follows:<br/>• Which statistical models can be used to base the premiums on expected future liabilities?<br/>• Are there enough data available to predict future liabilities accurately enough?<br/>• How can the ’best’ model be chosen?<br/>• How can the models be implemented?<br/>• What are the results when using these models for the third-party car products?<br/>After a practical introduction about insurances in society, the thesis starts with theory that can be used to answer the research questions. This analysis showed that generalized linear models are very useful models for the pricing of non-life insurance products. However, there are some disadvantages to these models which could be avoided by other models, such as hierarchical generalized linear models.<br/><br/>We will explore several methods to determine if enough data is available to obtain credible enough estimates. One of these methods can be applied before implementing a generalized linear model.<br/><br/>Choosing the ’best’ model is a non-trivial subject. Several statistical tests to choose which risk factors should be included in the model and how they should be included are discussed. These include tests for adding risk factors as random or fixed effects, but also which definition of an risk factor should best be used. This includes whether they should be added as a variate, as a factor or added dynamically. In addition, several statistical methods to choose the distribution that has the ’best’ fit for the observations for both the number of claims and the losses are discussed. These include graphical comparison methods, but also hypothesis testing.<br/><br/>To answer the question how the models can be implemented, we will use the statistical programming language R. Algorithms that are used by some packages to calculate the estimates of the models are discussed, as well as several features of these algorithms. Codes are provided in the supplementary section of the thesis.<br/><br/>Next, a statistical analysis is performed for the third-party car products of the insurance company. The performed theoretical analysis is applied in practice on the available data, and unknowns were calculated. Then an analysis is performed to determine which distribution ‘best’ fits the number of claims and which distribution ‘best’ fits the losses. The data was subdivided into several risk factors, such as age and region, and was analyzed again. A generalized linear model with a Poisson and log-link assumption was implemented for the number of claims, and a generalized linear model with a Gamma and log-link assumption was implemented for the losses. How and if the risk factors should be added was evaluated using a bottom-up approach. Initially, the models were applied without allowing interaction between risk factors, and subsequently the models were applied again, this time allowing interaction between risk factors to determine if this improved the models.<br/><br/>Other models that may lead to a better fit for the data are also implemented. These include generalized linear mixed models, which do not assume that the observations are independent and assume a Normal distribution for the risk factors that are added as random effects. Also, a pure premium model in which the Tweedie family is used was applied.<br/><br/>The study showed that the preferred models to calculate the pure premium are a generalized linear model with Negative Binomial and log-link assumption for the number of claims and a generalized linear model with Gamma and log-link assumption for the losses. Due to overdispersion of the observations for the number of claims, the Negative Binomial proved to be a better choice of distribution leading to a better fit of the model for the number of claims. The Normal and Pareto distribution were too symmetric and too right-skewed for the observations, respectively. The pure premium model showed a worse fit, when compared to the model for the number of claims. Furthermore, the effect of the risk factors on the risk profile of a risk group were very clear when a two-stage regression approach was used. The hierarchical models were not better models, because the estimates were less accurate.<br/><br/>The results for the different models were then compared with the currently used pricing system of the company and the expected outcomes of the data analysis. This leads to recommendations for the insurance company, including recommendations for pricing in general but also specific recommendations for the pricing system of the third-party insurance product.<br/><br/>The full thesis contains confidential information, therefore, a public version was provided in which the insurance company is anonymous.

Similar results were found when comparing MRI to TTAF models. TTAF models differed from the GS models around the subtalar joint, mainly the tibialis anterior. Larger differences in kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activations were accompanied by changes to the most influential model parameters, in descending order of importance, these were: tendon slack length, moment arm length, and normalized muscle fiber length.

One key element to sustainable success in corporate venturing is the capacity of enterprises to sense and seize an opportunity to grow value through investment in innovation before market logics have been proven elsewhere. While improving innovative performance in terms of launching novel and commercially successful products and services remains the imperative aim of sustainable business venturing, history has taught us time and again that a substantial product innovation will be picked up and replicated by competitors very quickly, posing stark challenges to companies to repeat the innovation cycle quickly following the launch of a novel product. (Massa &amp; Tucci, 2013; Casprini, 2015). This thesis reports on the underlying premises that BMI is appropriate for fostering sustainable competitive advantage of businesses. Furthermore, the benefits and influences of abductive reasoning on leading managers’ decision making and reasoning during the process of BMI to create superior strategies and appendant corporate success are demonstrated in this thesis. Prior research at the University of Sydney, has shown the potential of novel forms of logical reasoning, in particular abductive reasoning, which is often considered as the kernel of innovative/creative design practice, Design Thinking (or ‘designerly ways of thinking’ more general), to support decision making in product innovation management (Dong et al., 2015; Mounarath et al., 2011). Cognitive strategies related to abductive reasoning, such as creativity, analogizing, mental simulation as well as well as pre-factual thought (Epstude et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2016; Ball and Christensen, 2009; Gavetti et al., 2005), have further been linked to success of entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial endeavours (Huang &amp; Pearce, 2015). After extensive literature research, it was determined that on paper, product innovation processes are very similar to BMI processes. Furthermore, it has been stated by Teece (2007) that a business model itself is a hypothesis about what customers want and how a company should confirm these needs and be paid for them. This suggests that the principles of abductive reasoning and generative sensing may similarly apply to business model innovation. This is to be examined during the empirical research. This empirical research, employed the semi-structured interview approach in which 15 leading top-managers were interviewed. In BMI visioning and strategizing is key and is therefore predestined to come from higher hierarchical levels in an organization, whereas PI is mainly promoted by individual designers, engineers etc. in a rather bottom-up process. This research specifically aims to find information about the decision process, the (logical) reasoning process of executives within the BMI process. The results presented in this thesis are derived from in-depth conversations with 15 experts on the topic of business model innovation. Within these conversations their approaches and motivations during the business model innovation process were discussed. The research goal was to find out if managers use instances of abductive reasoning during the BMI process and what the effect of this reasoning is on successful business venturing. The results of the empirical research show that most cases of successful BMI that were heard seem to involve some form of abductive reasoning and/or generative sensing mechanisms. Hence, there is a good likelihood of this being applicable on a broader basis. Therefore, it is likely that there is a correlation between abductive reasoning and successful business venturing, not only owing to a more future-oriented mindset and the prediction of a future outcome scenario but even more because often it creates a certain timespan and plausible path into this future outcome scenario and/or future end goal or end value. Rather than just future or divergent thinking, it helps managers to create plausible explanations for certain observations and formed hypothesis. In line with these results, the one example in which abductive reasoning was present during the BMI process but did not lead to ultimate success reveals sustentation for the positive effect of abductive reasoning during the BMI process. After all, any support in business venturing can make a difference between success and failure. Based on the experiences of the interviewed executives, business leaders should make an effort to advance their cognitive capabilities to envision future opportunities by doing extensive market research, investigating trends and understanding customer needs and wants. Managers should be well aware that the use of iteration and reframing during the BMI process is key for a successful outcome. Moreover, managers should use forecasting methods such as creating business cases, examining trends and contextual research for example in other domains and to mentally forecast and simulate plausible paths to predict future outcomes and opportunities. Managers should train themselves into adopting a mindset like this, train themselves in this business model innovation process as it can lead them to grasp opportunities better. This could be done by searching for inspiration and information in other domains, where managers or entrepreneurs might have or might not have prior knowledge (Fiet, 2007; Guenther et al., 2017), to find new opportunities. Furthermore, to become successful at business model innovation, it is important for managers to use be open to experimenting, questioning the status-quo and easily recognize patterns (Dyer et al.,2008). Especially pattern recognition shows similar cognitive processes to those used in creative thinking (Weisberg, 1999; Welling 2007) and is often linked to counterfactual thinking (Gaglio, 2004). In conclusion, the results of this present investigation suggest that there is a correlation between abductive reasoning and successful business venturing. Combined with the findings from the present investigation, managers should use creative capabilities such as abductive reasoning and generative sensing during the business model innovation process in order to become successful at both the ideation and the implementation of a new business model.

It includes a reflectance model through which a calibration coefficient is computed which is used for performance monitoring. In this thesis, the uncertainty that is associated with this coefficient is researched and a classification in random and systematic uncertainty components is attempted. Throughout this research it became clear that such a classification is somewhat ambiguous and can be misleading because systematic uncertainties are not always constant. In order to identify such uncertainties, the entire modelling / measurement process with respect to the input variables of the reflectance model, and the algorithm of the reflectance model itself, have been researched for potential uncertainty sources. What became clear is that input variable uncertainties are of both nature; random and systematic. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess how the calibration coefficient depends on changes in the input variables. Out of these, the Chlorophyll variable causes the highest deviations due to the large uncertainties associated with this parameter. This research has been able to identify uncertainty sources but has not been able to assign any value to those sources. Any subsequent research could use the identified uncertainty sources described here and attempt to quantify their value to yield a total uncertainty that can be associated to the calibration coefficient. This will increase the usability of this performance monitoring coefficient which means that the user will obtain more information regarding the accuracy of the performance degradation of the optical instrument onboard Earth observation satellites.","uncertainty analysis; Earth observation; optical instruments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","",""

The thesis is part of a larger feasibility study to evaluate the possibility of implementing such experiment on the International Space Station as an internal payload of the Fluid Science Laboratory in the Columbus module. The project was developed in the Fluid Physics and Payloads department at Airbus Defence &amp; Space in Immenstaad, in accordance with European Space Agency expectations and under the supervision of the experts of foam science from the Pierre and Marie Curie University of Paris. The study was dedicated to the development and validation of a miniaturized hardware, which will be integrated in the existent Soft Matter Dynamics Experiment Container available on the International Space Station. It was focused on the design and testing of the demonstrator hardware in a Verification Test Facility, which was as close as possible to the real target system intended for use in the future mission. The system qualification was done in close cooperation with the science team interested in the results of the space experiment. The main findings of this research are related to the possibility of the studying foam in space. The microgravity conditions experienced in that environment are extremely useful to study specific fluid phenomena in gravity absence, to investigate foam proprieties and stability, and to obtain advance knowledge useful for foam practical applications on Earth. In particular, the understanding of rheology in wet foams has proven to be difficult on Earth and a dedicated space investigation could carry out interesting unknown properties, which could affect enormously the application of foams in industrial and commercial processes. The work started with the study of the requirements and was focused on the evaluation of the design through the assembly, integration and testing of the miniaturized system. During the hardware evaluation the weaknesses of the proposed design were identified. Alternative solutions for the demonstrator were developed and recorded in order to improve the future system. Various tests were carried out to verify the design performances and functionality. Good results were obtained with the improvements applied after the first testing campaign. Eventually, a series of verification tests were performed to complete the requirements compliance analysis. The majority of the results obtained was successful, however the full compliance of the current hardware was not reached and the validation campaign was not possible due to an open issue in the membrane application. At the present time, a solution for a multi-layer membrane is under development. Once it will be available, the demonstrator will be assembled and integrated, and a new series of verification tests will be performed. The final steps of the project will be the validation campaign and the presentation to European Space Agency about the system status and suggestions for future design improvements.","Space Systems; Engineering; Foam Rheology; Microgravity Experiments; Validation and Verification; Experiment Container Design; International Space Station; Design; Assembly, Integration and Testing; Miniaturization; Science Tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","",""

These challenges include an energy crisis, a high dependence on firewood and high levels of poverty. Biogas technology has the potential to make a contribution in solving these challenges, but is not yet widely implemented in Ghana. For this reason, the aim of this thesis was to find ways to increase the use of biogas technology in Ghana. To do this, a business model for community based biogas enterprises was created which was based on Ghanaian cultural values and by that included the most appropriate complexity and scale of biogas technology. To arrive at a representation of Ghanaian culture, a field study was done in which thirteen SMEs were visited. Data were collected by in-depth interviews and participatory observation. For the cultural analysis, a model was made based on cultural dimensions by Hofstede and Trompenaars. The model consisted of six dimensions which were given a score between one to five. Based on these scores, the degree in which a civil society and innovative entrepreneurship are present in Ghana were determined. A multi criteria analysis was done to find the most appropriate form of biogas technology in a Ghanaian business setting. The feedstock availability of an average Ghanaian community was assessed to find the most feasible alternative and determine the size of the digester. Various value propositions were compared on their economic viability by calculating their NPV, IRR and DPB. The major findings of this research were that the garage-type digester was the most appropriate digester design, fed with only crop residues available from the community. For an average community size of 491 people, a digester size of 67 m3 would be needed. The best value proposition was concluded to be collecting all the available crop residues from within the community with a cargo tricycle, digesting the crop residues in a garage-type digester, using the produced biogas to generate electricity, selling it to the grid, and drying the digestate and selling it as organic fertilizer. The cultural analysis and discussion showed that additional training for the workforce would be required in cooperation, dialogue, proper work ethic, due planning and precision in labor.","Biogas technology; Ghana; Cultural values; Business model innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, this growth has accelerated, advancing farms rapidly into deeper water and utilizing larger turbines. As offshore wind farm developers continue to look towards heavier, higher capacity turbines, and harsher sites, improving cost-effectiveness will rely increasingly on support structure optimization. Monopile foundations remain the preferred option, but the “XL” monopiles required in deeper water are sensitive to wave-induced fatigue loads and exceed the weight capacity of many installation vessels. <br/><br/>The goal of the Hybrid Monopile support structure, is to provide a cost-effective alternative to the monopile in water depths greater than 30 meters. By providing an open structure in the key wave loading area of the water column, wave-induced fatigue damage can be reduced, allowing for a thinner monopile shell and a substantially lighter support structure. Design of the Hybrid Monopile began with the optimization of the brace member length and diameter for a specific location and turbine in the North Sea. Computations. were carried out using a Matlab-based model in which the structure is represented as a discretized Euler-Bernoulli beam. <br/><br/>Extreme load cases were applied in a static analysis to ensure that selected dimensions are able to resist buckling of either the monopile shell, or the brace members. An accompanying finite-element model of the structure was used to verify that the selected brace dimensions were sufficient under extreme loads. To estimate the fatigue life of the monopile shell, and the brace members, wave loads were handled in the frequency domain and wind loads in the time domain. Damage equivalent loads (DELs) for each were then combined using quadratic superposition. Wind and wave roses for the selected site were used in the fatigue analysis to capture the effects of misaligned wind-wave cases on the calculated fatigue life. In this design phase, the Hybrid Monopile was shown to experience sixty percent less wave-induced fatigue damage than the traditional monopile. <br/>This baseline version of the design was then modified for 256 different combinations of water depth, turbine size, wave climate, and monopile diameter, to demonstrate the versatility of the concept and identify the design drivers. During the design process, the Hybrid Monopile was updated by altering the monopile shell thickness, brace diameter, and brace length. In each case, a traditional monopile was also designed in parallel, to serve as a basis for comparison. Optimization of each configuration was based on an iterative series of design checks during which the variable design dimensions were increased or decreased based on the structure natural frequency, response to an extreme load, or expected fatigue life at one of the critical locations; the mudline and the individual brace cross sections. <br/><br/>Results of the iteration showed that in more than 3/4 of the test cases, which covered water depths from 30-60 meters, and turbine sizes of 8-20 MW, a Hybrid Monopile could be established that offered lower structure weight and improved fatigue performance at an equal or reduced cost compared to a traditional monopile. Viable configurations showed average weight and cost reductions of 27% and 17% respectively. These results were used to establish a limited number of standardized Hybrid Monopile classes, which could be mass produced and assigned to a wind farm, based on only the water depth and turbine size. Looking forward, further work is required to determine the optimum connection detail at the brace-monopile interface, and to assess the fatigue risk at that junction. <br","offshore monopiles; Offshore Wind Farms; support structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This proposition will contribute to a pleasant customer experience for customers of NS International.The analysis shows that most travellers choose their means of transport based on travel cost and travel time. Overall, customers find international train travel too expensive and can get faster on their destination by car, for short distances, or by airplane, for long distances. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of international train travel the train network should be improved with more direct, high-speed connections.In order to make these changes the market should be open upped for competition or he collaboration between operators should be improved. Railways have to collaborate in order to provide cross-border services to travellers, but the railways are independently managed railways, which has a negative influence on the customer experience. With the current regulations, it is difficult for operators to operate on their own and to make real changes in the market.Since NSI has little influence in the market and is dependent on other operators, the innovation space is very small. However, several customer wants and needs can still be met without involving other railways. The analysis showed that inexperienced train travellers are quite uncertain during international train trips and want to be provided with relevant information about their trip.The customer needs gained in the analysis formed the basis for the development of four experience factors; insight, certainty, control and personal. These factors were used to guide the development of the service proposition.In the end, the service proposition Track &amp; Change as developed. The service proposition aims to gives customers more control over their journey in order to reduce the anxiety, especially the anxiety of transferring, which travellers experience during their train trip. In this two-sided service concept, NSI ‘tracks’ its customers and provides them with information about their trip. In case of any disruptions in the customer’s trip NSI will informs it customers and provided them with the possibility to make changes when needed.The service proposition consists of five main components, which together aim to enhance travel comfort by reducing the anxiety customers experience when having to transfer trains. The first component is Mijn NS International, which is a personal domain in which customers can get access to up-to-date information about their bookings. This domain also gives access to the second component, Travel Support, which updates customers with relevant information of their booking both before and after departure. Customers can indicate their preferences in relation to the updates they want to receive.In case customers missed their transfer, NSI provides them with the Available Train Overview, the thirds component which also can be access via the personal domain. In this overview customers can indicated with which alternative train they want to travel.The fourth component is Tailor Transfer, in which customers can choose their transfer time during booking. Customers also get inspired with activities in and around the transfer station.The last component is Tip Loader, which provides customers with relevant tips during booking related to their current search command.","Service Design; Customer-centric; Transport; Comfort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The report describes the design of a platform that aims to stimulate residents of the Frederik Hendrikbuurt, a neighbourhood located in the west borough of Amsterdam, to start and realise an initiative for the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood budget is a subsidy for the support of citizen initiatives. In some neighbourhoods of the west borough of Amsterdam, including the Frederik Hendrikbuurt, this budget is managed by a neighbourhood agent, a civil servant who is particularly active in a specific neighbourhood, and a neighbourhood committee, a group of volunteering residents. In a bi-monthly meeting they discuss and decide which request for the budget are granted a subsidy.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood agent of the Frederik Hendrikbuurt approached OpenStadsdeel with a problem: the neighbourhood budget could be used more widely. Currently, only residents who are aware of the existence of the budget and know how to reach it are using the budget for their initiatives for the neighbourhood. These residents are also referred to as the ‘usual suspects’. The neighbourhood agent, neighbourhood committee and the municipality would like to see more people make use of the budget. <br/><br/>A project goal was formulated:<br/><br/>Stimulate more residents, other than the ‘usual suspects’, to use the neighbourhood budget for the realisation of initiatives for the Frederik Hendrikbuurt by opening up the process.<br/><br/>The project was divided in three phases. In the first phase, named ‘Research’, the involved and (yet) uninvolved stakeholders of the neighbourhood budget in the Frederik Hendrikbuurt were analysed. Interviews, street interviews and a creative session with stakeholders resulted in an overview of stakeholders and their experience of an initiative that is funded by the neighbourhood budget. Residents often did not know about existence of the budget or how to reach it. When an initiator knows about the existence of the budget, requesting it is experienced as a difficult and unclear process. The neighbourhood agent had to spend too much time and energy on guiding initiators through the process of a budget request, which resulted in a lack of time to support initiatives on their content. The neighbourhood committee experienced difficulties in evaluating the requests, because neighbourhood support is hard to estimate and requests are often in- or overcomplete.<br/><br/>The research phase was concluded with the formulation of a design goal. A design goal was formulated for all stakeholders individually. These individual goals have as aim to reach an overall design goal:<br/><br/>“To stimulate more residents to actively participate for the Frederik Hendrikbuurt, I want to help potential initiators to realise their ideas for the neighbourhood by supporting them at the right moment and connect them to people who can help them.”<br/><br/>In the second phase, named ‘Design’, ideas, two creative sessions were organised to generate and select ideas that aim to reach the design goal. The first session was held with stakeholders of the neighbourhood budget. The second session with Industrial Design students and the OpenStadsdeel team. The ideas of a neighbourhood budget competition, online platform and initiative support flyer were selected to develop. In an iterative process of prototyping, testing and designing, the three ideas were developed into a final design. The final design is an online platform where residents can request a budget, find support for their initiative, share and develop ideas for the neighbourhood collectively and share experiences of realised initiatives. The support flyer is tool that is offered by the of the platform and can be used by initiators to find residents who want to support or become involved with an initiatve. The neighbourhood budget competition is an engagement strategy that aims to stimulate residents to start an initiative for their neighbourhood.<br/><br/>In the last phase, named ‘Evaluate’, the final design was evaluated with stakeholders of the neighbourhood budget, OpenStadsdeel and the municipality. The stakeholders and client of the project want to launch the platform before the end of 2017. From the evaluation with the developer of OpenStadsdeel it became clear that to reach this deadline, the design has to be simplified. Therefore, recommendations are given in the form of an advice for a minimal viable product and a roadmap, containing a planning for the further development of the platform, is provided.","Citizen initiatives; Social design; Webdesign; Neighbourhood budget; Municipality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Most membranes are not selective to certain ion species. This study investigates the possibility of increasing phosphate selectivity (in the form of H2PO4 – ) of anion exchange membranes (AEM) by modifying commercial AEMs with a Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly of a few promising candidate polyelectrolytes (PE): Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-Guanidinium (PAH-Gu). The anionic layer was composed of poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS). Membranes were modified with 4 layers. This was done on only one side, the asymmetric modification ((PE/PSS)4), or both sides of the membrane, the symmetric modification ((PE/PSS)2). The membranes were then characterized using low-frequency impedance spectroscopy to obtain, among other parameters, the resistance of the membrane. Asymmetrically modified membranes showed non-reproducible impedance data, while their symmetric counterpart was in good agreement with a theoretical model. Compared to the bare membrane, a decrease in the membrane’s resistivity was found for all the modified membranes in the studied salt concentrations (0.1 to 0.4 M). In the low concentration region, the PAH-Gu modified membrane had the lowest resistance. This result is most likely caused by a high affinity between Guanidinium and phosphate. The electric properties of other parameters, such as diffusive boundary layer and electrical double layer resistance, were found to be independent from the membrane modification. We then performed permselectivity measurements with a competing anion, sulfate. To this end, electrodialysis was performed in the underlimiting current regime. Modified membranes showed no increase in discriminatory function for phosphate. This could be due to several reasons. For example, there might be a pH-change near the surface of the membrane, changing the charge of the phosphate anion. Additionally, the PAH-Gu membrane did show an increase in overall anion flux compared to the bare membrane. These results are promising and warrant further research into phosphate selective receptors in combination with IEMs.","IEM; phosphate; Guanidinium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The most common practice among engineers is to focus on a single spatial and time scale, which means either neglecting certain processes under the assumption that they will average out, or performing detailed simulations for short time-spans in order to optimize the normally limited computational resources. Despite the efforts from several authors, at the moment there is a lack of a clear methodology which would allow incorporating the relevant physical phenomena only when required, hence optimizing the computational effort.<br/><br/>The above leads to the main research objective of this thesis: to gain insight in what is the added value of coupling process based morphodynamic models, regarding the morphological impacts near the beach. For this purpose two models that were originally conceived to resolve different timescales are selected; XBeach as a storm model, and the new suite from Deltares, Delft3D-Flexible Mesh (D3D-FM) as a long-term morphodynamic model. The area selected as study site is Anmok beach, located at the east coast of South Korea. The coastal erosion at this location is not yet well understood (mainly due to human interventions and storms) plus the micro-tidal wave-dominated environment makes this location ideal for this study. Recent researches on this site have found that there is a delicate balance between the stormy and calm periods, where the high energy wave events are the main drivers of local morphology.<br/> <br/>One of the main findings in this thesis is that the coupling of independently calibrated models does not necessarily provide better morphodynamic results than the results obtained by running each model separately. Including different processes such as infragravity waves or Eulerian mass transport (which enhances the offshore sediment transport in the surf zone) during highly energetic events tend to generate large supratidal beach erosion. However, the post-storm recovery mechanisms present in long-term morphodynamic models are not sufficient to bring the sediment back to the beach. Therefore, it is recommended to include all the relevant physical processes (storm erosion and post storm recovery mechanisms) when following a coupling approach in order to have a coherent morphodynamic balance. Furthermore, the coupling of models can play an important role in identifying which processes are missing or are not fully represented by the different modelling packages. <br/><br/>The erosive effect of cumulative storms was shown to be relevant in the short to medium term and might become a key parameter when defining, for instance, the worst case scenario regarding shoreline retreat. Despite the fact that uncoupled long-term morphodynamic models produce better average results in the case of Anmok beach, the implementation of a coupled scheme was proven to be important when the erosion due to cumulative storm effects cannot be neglected. <br/><br/>Among the advantages of using D3D-FM for this work is the implementation of the Basic Model Interface, which meant an important reduction in bookkeeping efforts and the possibility to seamlessly couple D3D-FM with XBeach. This procedure allowed for the incorporation of more complex phenomena (such as infragravity waves) with an acceptable increase in computational time. <br/> <br/>A research version of Delft3D (D3D) with specialized sediment transport equations in the swash zone was tested in an attempt to enhance the post-storm recovery mechanisms. The results obtained are promising in the sense that the accretion of the shoreline and lower dry beach was reasonably enhanced, especially when considering all the limitations involved in modelling the morphodynamics of the swash zone with a stationary wave model. Another important conclusion is that these models were capable of depositing the sediments at the lower backshore at best. Hence, there is still the need of a mechanism/process capable of transporting the sediments farther upslope into the dry beach or dunes, such as aeolian transport. <br/><br/>The decision to undergo with a coupled or uncoupled approach depends on case-by-case basis. For current practice, it is recommended to develop a coupled simulation in the medium-term, where both storms and calm periods have significant effects and where the intra seasonal variation could be a parameter of interest. For short-term simulations, an uncoupled storm model (e.g. XBeach) is recommended as is the most accurate for such a time span. For long-term simulations, the general recommendation is to run an uncoupled long-term model such as D3D. In this case the storm erosion and post-storm recovery processes are expected to average out, being the long-term model the most suitable package to obtain average morphological results. <br/><br/>For future work it is recommended to add an aeolian process-based model and incorporate the swash zone sediment transport module into D3D-FM as this would move us one step closer towards the development of a fully coupled model where all the relevant processes (storm erosion, post storm recovery and aeolian transport) are included. <br","Delft3D-FM; XBeach; Sediment transport; Morphodynamics; Process-based modelling; BMI; Coupled models; surfbeat; micro tidal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37.773753, 128.947159"

In the western part of the Netherlands, cretaceous sandstone bodies are already in use for the geothermal energy production. However, these reservoirs are generally producing water at temperatures less than 100°C from depths of 1500 to 3000 m. To reach higher temperatures, deeper reservoirs need to be targeted. Being more than 130 m thick in some parts and up to 4000 m deep, the Lower Triassic Buntsandstein would provide an ideal target reservoir for geothermal exploration in the West Netherlands Basin, given the high temperatures of over 140°C at this depth. However, the Buntsandstein is relatively heterogeneous in terms of porosity, as seen in numerous rock samples, and the overall permeability that was found in the Buntsandstein in various wells was generally low. Therefore a conventional development of a Buntsandstein reservoir, with a geothermal doublet in a natural hydrothermal reservoir, might not be applicable. To enhance the permeability and achieve economic flow rates, hydraulic stimulation can be performed. This technique has proven to be effective in many other reservoirs. To assess such effects on the Buntsandstein, this thesis focusses on the effect of fractures on the fluid flow in the Buntsandstein. Geomechanical characteristics and physical properties of the Buntsandstein at relevant pressure and temperature (PT) conditions are investigated in core experiments in uniaxial compression tests and triaxial tests. The laboratory experiments on cores provide reliable intrinsic information of permeability at relevant PT conditions and give a realistic estimation of fluid flow parameters. Triaxial deformation tests were conducted on different sandstones varying in porosity, clay content, degree of oxidization and initial permeability. Changes in permeability before and after deformation are compared. Moreover, the effect of increasing confining pressure on the permeability is measured on intact sandstones. Two principal modes of brittle fracture (extension fracture and shear fracture) were tested on samples under confining pressure. Experiments revealed that the permeability decreases by a factor of 17 in porous sandstones, from 85 mD to 5 mD, when inducing shear fractures at 30 MPa effective pressure. Buntsandstein samples with a low initial permeability (~1 mD) show a slight increase to 2 mD. For tensile fractures the permeability increased exponentially with the increase in apparent fracture aperture. Up to apertures of around 1000 µm, the permeability increased by factor of 2 for increments of 100 µm. Ultimately, effects of fractures and resulting changes in flow properties are analyzed for the impact on the production life of a geothermal injector-producer pair. Results from lab experiments are implemented in a field scale thermo-hydro-mechanical model, making it possible to predict the PT distribution in the reservoir in regard to a change in permeability. The laboratory experiments and the numerical modeling procedure indicate that the in-situ permeability is too low for a geothermal reservoir production and would require some sort of stimulation to enhance the permeability.","sandstones; hydraulic stimulation; fracking; permeability; anisotropy; Dynamic Moduli; geothermal energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","","",""

Decline in oil production in the Netherlands occurs in an epoch with an increased interest in geothermal heat production as an alternative source of energy. In the present study it is investigated how oil production from stranded fields (fields abandoned when field development was considered not to be profitable), especially those with heavy oil, can add value to a geothermal project when thermally-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with injection of hot water from a geothermal reservoir into an oil reservoir and coproduction of oil and geothermal energy is considered. The main focus is on the oil reservoir, while productivity and temperature of the geothermal source is assumed to be constant.<br/><br/>In order to determine the feasibility of such project, a geological model for an oil reservoir was constructed, taking the Moerkapelle field as a case study, so that reservoir simulations can be performed on it and results in terms of oil production, heat production, total energy production and economics can be obtained and analyzed. Geological modelling (structural and stratigraphic) and reservoir simulation are developed in three different stages, every time making the model more complex (i.e. heterogeneity due to structural and sedimentary features). <br/><br/>Project feasibility was calculated in terms of the percentage of reduction on the required subsidy for a geothermal project (required subsidy is the one that makes the NPV of a geothermal project to be zero under a pre-royalty pre-tax framework).

However, for heterogeneous reservoirs, the subsidy reduction for a single doublet geothermal project would not be higher than 52% in the most optimistic case and, when all the realizations are taken into account, there is no added value from the synergy but still an average reduction in the NPV of 13%. Scaling up the project to 3 or more doublets generates an average reduction of 31% in the required subsidy with a maximum reduction of 73% in the most optimistic case.<br","geothermal energy; thermal enhanced oil recovery; synergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deliver successful measurements GALA is to be calibrated for its misalignment with an accuracy of at least 14 arcsec. This misalignment cannot be measured on ground since it will be subject to vibrations, microgravity and settling after launch. Thus this calibration is to be performed while JUICE is on its interplanetary cruise to Jupiter. <br/><br/>This thesis aims to answer the question how this calibration can be performed using laser ranging to an Earth-based ground station. This calibration procedure consists of a scan performed by JUICE with a size as large as the maximum expected misalignment found at 333 arcsec. A model for the attitude during laser ranging was developed to be used to simulate the distribution and intensities of the laser pulses transmitted by GALA. During this scan of several hours and with a shot frequency of 30 Hz, the ground station will be able to detect 500 to 1500 pulses. This result was validated with the real life MLA and Hayabusa experiments already performed. The spatial distribution of these detected pulses is used to reconstruct the Gaussian pulse shape of the laser pulses. By determining its peak intensity, the ground station location can be estimated which is used to measure the misalignment. This estimation procedure was found to be robust and reliable enough to be incorporated in the simulation tool that can be run many times to achieve a statistically significant result on the estimation error. Since the estimation is based on the spatial distribution, the main drivers for the accuracy are the slew rate, scan pattern, distance, detection threshold and attitude model. These were investigated for their influence on the calibration and used to find their optimal values. <br/><br/>The trajectory of JUICE was analysed for the most optimal opportunities given various constrains to perform a laser ranging campaign leading to a selection of options to be analysed. Using the simulation it was found that interplanetary laser ranging can be used to calibrate GALA by employing 8-10 hours of scanning at a distance no further than around 0.5 AU by using ground station characteristics such as found at Wettzell with a telescope diameter of 0.75 metres and optical and quantum efficiencies of 0.5 and 0.2 respectively. For the most optimal opportunity, laser ranging will be performed at a distance of 0.39 AU for 10 hours with a slew rate of 0.0055 deg/s. This leads to a 2 sigma calibration residual of 3.62 arcsec resulting in a total calibration error of 11 arcsec. This confirms the assumption that a calibration accuracy of 14 arcsec is possible and thus a successful laser altimetry mission can be performed by GALA. <br","Laser Ranging; Ganymede; JUICE; Misalignment; Calibration; Laser Altimetry; Pointing; Ganymede Laser Altimter; Jupiter Icey Moons Explorer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

One type of resonant motions is related to the so-called Mathieu instability.

International research efforts have led to the development of coupled numerical global analysis tools for FWTs in order to understand their behavior under wind and wave actions. The hydrodynamic models in such tools are typically based on first-(and second-)order potential flow theory, sometimes also including Morison’s equation. In order to accurately model highly nonlinear waves, their interaction with a floating platform, and obtain estimates of the resulting loads on the structure, a numerical wave tank approach is generally needed.<br/>In this thesis, the response of floating structures to nonlinear wave loading is investigated by means of two different numerical approaches: a fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes/VOF solver and a second-order potential flow theory solver. Firstly, the fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes/VOF numerical wave tank, developed within the open-source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM, is validated against experimental data for two cases. These comprise the response of a 2D floating box and a 3D floating vertical cylinder. In order to model the motions of the floating structures, together with the generation and absorption of the waves, the interDyMFoam solver, provided by the OpenFOAM library, is extended with the waves2Foam package, developed by Jacobsen et al. (2012). Furthermore, a simple catenary mooring line is implemented for the moored cases. Secondly, a potential flow theory based model of the OC5-semisubmersible floating platform is generated. The frequency-domain analysis is done with the Wadam software and the time-domain simulations with SIMO. This model is validated against measurement data from a 1:50 scale test campaign performed at the MARIN offshore wave basin and the fully nonlinear validated CFD model. Lastly, both numerical models of the OC5-semisubmersible are compared in order to assess the suitability of the diffraction model in two different conditions where nonlinearities are of relevance. The first one involves very long waves, with periods close to 20s, which are likely to take place under swell wave conditions. These may excite the OC5-semisubmersible platform in heave at its natural frequency. The second situation deals with regular waves with increasing steepness.<br/>In principle, the fully nonlinear CFD model, if no experimental data is available, is needed to calibrate the diffraction model. However, once the latter is adjusted and validated, results are given at a much lower computational cost. According to the computations throughout this work, when dealing with waves with high steepness and high excitation frequencies, the motions, as well as the peak forces, are properly captured by the diffraction model. However, other local effects of importance for offshore structures, such as wave run-up, or the different components in frequency of the loading, require the use of a fully nonlinear CFD solver. Therefore for preliminary design stages a diffraction model is able to give suitable results regarding the motions and peak inline and vertical forces at a much lower computational cost; however, for detailed design, or optimisation phase stages, where local effects are of relevance, a fully nonlinear CFD model is required.","CFD model; diffraction model; floating structures; OpenFOAM; nonlinear wave loads; fluid-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

As 2.4\,GHz and 5\,GHz band communications only provide limited bandwidth, these frequency bands cannot support the demand of ultra-high data rate. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications promise massive available bandwidth to support the next generation of wireless communications (e.g. 5G and the next Wi-Fi standard) such as 60\,GHz band that offers 7\,GHz available bandwidth. This extremely high frequency (EHF) band not only provides large available bandwidth, but it also experiences more losses than in 2.4 GHz and 5\,GHz band communications. With such excessive path loss challenge, mmWave communications employ beamforming to compensate the losses. Switched beamforming, which is performed in the media access layer (MAC), is preferred due to its low computational complexity compared to adaptive beamforming. However, to avoid high beam training overhead, beam-searching algorithm in the MAC layer beamforming must be chosen appropriately.<br/><br/>Beam-searching protocol in IEEE 802.15.3c and IEEE 802.11ad, which exploit two-level of beam-searching, still can experience high training overhead if narrow beams are used. Therefore, hierarchical beam-searching algorithms are proposed to reduce training packet overhead. In our approach, hierarchical beam-searching approach with two beam candidates at each level of beam-searching is chosen to minimize the number of training packets. These beam candidates then transmit training packets giving signal quality information of each beam so that the best beam can be selected.<br/><br/>Some beamforming techniques have already been proposed to follow hierarchical beam-searching algorithm. However, the prior beamforming techniques do not consider non-isotropic array element beam pattern. As a result, the gain follows array element beam pattern where the gain weaken at the angle direction close to the end-fire direction following beam pattern of a single patch antenna element. In this thesis, we propose a beamforming technique that has uniform gain within the scanning coverage even with the non-isotropic element patterns. To the best our knowledge, our proposed beamforming is the first work that considers a realistic element beam pattern in mmWave communications. The proposed beamforming requires flexible antenna weight vectors (AWVs) and more antenna elements than IEEE 802.15.3c or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based beamforming. Due to flexibility value of AWVs, the AWVs must be done in the digital domain. However, digital beamforming requires a large number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Therefore, hybrid beamforming is chosen to solve the problem. We show that we achieve uniform gains with reasonable complexity.","beamforming; mmWave; 60 Ghz; beam codebook","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","br/>Airlines have a strong drive for innovation as there is a high risk of commoditization and new entrants. Mainly low cost carriers are an acute driver for process optimization and operational innovations. Additionally, the airline industry has a risk averse culture that comes with regulation which causes unavoidable innovation constraints. Current designated innovation methods of forming alliances, scaling up and setting up a low cost branch, routinely only improve the service that airlines provide instead of extending their core service model. The airline sector is in need of organizational renewal to discover and develop new revenue streams, improve their operational excellence and enhance their customer experience. With exemption of the core competences, airlines currently do not have the required knowledge to innovate internally and therefore look for solutions externally. <br/>This thesis focuses on the opportunity that external corporate venturing provides in solving this challenge. External Venturing (EV) is the direct cooperation of large corporations with external start-ups, or indirect cooperation with start-ups through a corporate venture investment fund. A literature research, desk research and qualitative case study have examined the possibilities that EV provides as new innovation strategy for airlines. A strategic decision framework has been developed in this thesis as tool for carriers to implement an EV approach. <br/>The interviews conducted with airlines and the corporate venture partners have shown that the dominant motive for airlines to pursue EV is to obtain access to new products, services, markets and technologies. This in order for them to attain new revenue streams and new business opportunities. These elements provide the airline with new ways to enhance customer experience, digitalize the airline and to cut costs. Secondly, EV can be used as strategy to be able to harvest the innovation potential of start-ups by acquiring their knowledge. Both are short term motives, which are the base for the long term motives for EV; competitive advantage, strategic renewal and profitability. EV can strengthen competitive advantage by providing differentiation and can be used as a vehicle to continuously update the strategy. Although profitability is important for the viability of corporate venturing inspired projects, this is not a direct motive for EV as it is only measured in the longer term. The need of airlines for new tacit and explicit knowledge as input for their innovation is more acute than the focus on EV as a generator of future profitability. <br/>The external factors that affect an airline’s motive are macro-economic turbulence, micro-economic turbulence, regulation and geopolitical turbulence and are considered industry factors. As those factors are to a large extent global they are shared by most competing airlines and do not provide distinguishing factors between airlines that pursue EV.<br/>During the interviews also the internal factors that drive the success of external venturing were discussed. It turns out that top management support is the most dominant internal factor to influence the performance of EV for airlines. Top management is in a position to allocate the required resources to the external venturing process and to force adoption of start-up driven innovations onto the company. However, internal organizational turbulence can still dictate that EV initiatives are not accepted in the business units regardless of top management support. Furthermore, a set of clear, pre-defined objectives is a significant internal success factor. The objectives determine the ability to attract and select the right EV investments but also to use EV output to commercial ends in the often independently operating business units within airlines. Again, the internal organizational turbulence dictates how many venturing propositions can make it to commercialization. Additionally, the complementary characteristics of the start-up and parent company prescribes in which ways the parent company and start-up are able to learn from each other. Hence, a match should be found between the strategy of the start-up and the airline for them to be able to consume the EV technologies appropriately. <br/>An element that was brought up by most interviewees, and recognized by all, was the (lack of) organizational readiness; the present workforce might not be open to EV driven startup projects. This can be caused by a perceived threat to the continuity of their business or they might not believe in the long term gains of EV. Interviewees believe that top management should communicate a set of tailored objectives to accompany the EV endeavours. The objectives should explain the importance of EV and the expected results to contribute to a culture that stimulates EV and its start-up projects. Also, creating a safe testing environment where start-ups can validate their propositions inside the airline organization can contribute to EV effectiveness. <br/>Based on this thesis it is recommended for airlines to keep in mind the above mentioned factors to optimize their EV results. Summarizing; to enhance EV performance top management needs to support the EV endeavours with means and a set of tailored objectives. Top management should also be mindful that the organization has to be ready, both culturally and in their abilities, to create an organization that is able to use EV output to commercial ends. Furthermore a detailed sourcing, selection, support and EV development process should be in place. When such processes are available, criteria to measure external venturing performance are dealflow (number of start-ups the airline gets in touch with), number of relevant investments, number of financial exits, return on investment and number of commercial roll-outs after an investment. <br/>For airlines that want to pursue EV a limited set of cooperation options is available. If an airline is looking for extensive strategic renewal, a dedicated airline venture capital fund which is a fully owned subsidiary of the airline should be set up. If an airline has a more modest objective of using EV for driving innovation and the influx of knowledge and ideas, it can become a partner in a venture capital fund. A third, least committed option, is to join an accelerator or incubator program where influence and participation with startups is more limited. The above findings come together in the strategic decision framework which gives airlines the knowledge to establish a strong external venturing foundation with features wherefrom the whole organization can benefit","External corporate venturing for airlines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This was not the first time the Sinai was affected by these flash floods, more than 40 flash floods have been recorded in the El Arish watershed in the last 100 years. The enormous amount of water and the flow velocity of these floods are a hazard to its surroundings and to the rehabilitation plan of the Weather Makers. On the other hand the water is scarce in the arid Sinai and the flash floods could contribute to the plan to create a robust water cycle. The underlying goal of this research is to investigate whether a robust water cycle can be created by reducing the flash flood hazard and increasing the available water for the creation of biomass. Measures will have to be taken to start the transition and tackle issues such as drought, unfertile soil, water regulation and to properly address the social benefits to involve the inhabitants of the area. It is therefore essential to assess the hazards of the current and future situation of the Sinai and to apply appropriate measures on the hazardous locations.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">                The goal of this research is to propose a strategy to reduce the flash flood hazard, by first identifying hazard prone areas and then propose measures to counter these hazards. This strategy takes into account a scenario on change in catchment hydrology, gives guidance on land use for the region and will propose feasible measures to reduce flash flood hazards. It does not involve the design of the feasible measures nor a cost benefit analysis.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">                To assess the hazards in the El Arish watershed, the USACE method is used. The USACE method uses HEC-HMS for the hydrologic modelling and HEC-RAS for the hydraulic modelling. With a DEM sub basins and wadi channels are delineated and measured, precipitation data is collected from the TRMM and analyzed, the retention of the soil is simulated with curve numbers and transmission losses are estimated. The sensitivity of the hydrological model is checked and is used to simulate the 2010 flash flood to compare with imagery of the event. Measures usable in arid areas like the Sinai to reduce flash flood hazards are analyzed on their feasibility and their effects are modelled with the hydrologic model.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"" style=""text-indent:.5in"">The current flash flood hazard is assessed by simulating an extreme event and the region with the highest relative hazard is selected. Measures are proposed based on their applicability and the physical attributes of the surface with a decision tree. The following measures are suggested: spreading dams in flat wadis (&lt;2%), impervious dams in mild sloping wadis (2-5%) and pervious dams on steep sloping wadis (&gt;5%). The effect of these measures combined on the peak discharge is estimated to be 70-75% for an extreme precipitation event. The measures decrease the total- and peak discharge but they also spread the flash flood making the duration of the flow longer. To check whether the suggestions are future-proof a scenario of change in the hydrological cycle is considered by increasing the extreme precipitation with 15%. This causes the peak discharge to increase with 30-35% if no measures would be applied. By applying measures the peak discharge decreases with 60-65%, which is a smaller percentage than without an increase of extreme precipitation (70-75%).</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"" style=""text-indent:.5in"">Challenges of the research are that measurement data was lacking to calibrate the conceptual hydrological HEC-HMS model, the large amount of uncertain parameters therefore cause equifinality.

The proposed method to reduce the flash flood hazards can contribute to the plan of the Weather Makers to rehabilitate the Sinai by slowing down the flood and to enhance the infiltration.

First is the primary oil recovery, where the natural underground pressure is used to drive the oil to the surface. Afterwards is the secondary oil recovery, usually by water flooding or gas injection. However, the water flood yields lower sweep efficiency in heterogeneous reservoirs, contrary to homogeneous reservoirs. Tertiary flooding methods are applied to increase the oil sweep efficiency, hereby improving the efficiency of the extraction process. These methods include injection of gas and chemical solutions. This study focusses on the polymer flooding method. Polymers are used to adjust the mobility ratio (M) between oil and the displacing fluid, where the viscosity of the displacing fluid is increased significantly. However, rock-fluid interaction might affect the viscosity of the polymer, which in turn affects the mobility ratio. <br/>A series of core flood experiments were conducted, where rock-fluid interaction likely affects the viscosity of the polymer. Hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) is used as the polymer, which is injected in a sandstone core with brine. The produced fluids are analyzed afterwards, where its ion concentration, rheology, pH, and carbon content are measured. The results of the effluent analysis shows no change in viscosity compared to the injected polymer. There is however, a decrease in the divalent cations in the Low-salinity fluids, which can be explained by these cations getting stripped from the fluid at attaching to the rock surface. An increase in the effluent High-Salinity Brine is observed, which may be the cause of mechanical degradation, or by the influence of dissolved Ca2+ or Mg2+ cations due to leaching.<br","polymer; rock-fluid interaction; HPAM; RFI; cation exchange capacity; CEC; salinity; molarity; normality; ICP; TOC; pH; coreflood; rheology","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the most prominent applications is the production of aluminium bronze marine propellers by the Wire+Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) method. This method incorporates a welding system attached to a robotic arm. The final product results after sequential bead depositions. The main assets of the method are the efficient material usage and the minimization of lead time, which both have a positive environmental and economic impact. <br/>The aim of this project is to evaluate the feasibility to produce 3D printed aluminium bronze (CMA and NAB alloys) blocks with the WAAM method and compare the mechanical and corrosion properties of the blocks with the market requirements. In order to achieve that, rectangular blocks were manufactured at the facilities of Delft University of Technology and at Rotterdam Additive Manufacturing Fieldlab (RAMLAB). Cross sectional areas were extracted and used for microstructural investigation and for hardness measurement. Subsequently, the blocks were machined to produce tensile and Charpy specimens along the built height. Finally, corrosion tests were performed, including open circuit potential measurements, polarization experiments and Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) tests.<br/>The microstructural investigation revealed that the 3D printed CMA block consisted of a banded structure. The deposited layers consisted of two dominant phases, α and β, and a variety of precipitates. The Widmanstätten α phase nucleates at the grain boundaries mainly. The tempering promotes the growth of the α phase, making the grain boundaries more indistinguishable, while the β phase decomposes.<br/>The mechanical testing results depicted that the hardness, the tensile strength and the absorption energy of the 3D printed blocks exceeded the specifications of the cast products, according to the ASTM standards. The built height direction is weaker than the welding direction; however, the deposition height plays no significant role in the mechanical properties. Samples were also tested after a heat treatment of 675 °C for 6 hours, as recommended in the literature. The result was a 25% reduction of the tensile yield strength and a 10% reduction of the ultimate tensile strength. However, the scatter in the measured values was reduced too. <br/>Regarding the corrosion results, the built height has little effect on the corrosion susceptibility, according to the polarization curves. The material exhibits a remarkable low corrosion rate, which justifies its use in marine applications. The Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) tests illustrated the beneficial aspect of the tempering heat treatment, which alleviates the large potential differences of adjacent deposited areas.<br/>It can be concluded that the CMA alloys are tolerable to the oscillations of the production parameters, making them appealing to the additive manufacturing industry. The mechanical properties achieved, outmatch not only the specifications for the cast CMA products, but also the performance of similar 3D printed aluminium bronze structures, found in the literature.<br","wire+arc additive manufacturing; aluminium bronzes; 3D printing; mechanical properties; corrosion susceptibility; propeller; CMA alloys; NAB alloys; RAMLAB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Replenished sand is then moved and levelled by bulldozers. This is a passive approach to process the outflow of material. The land based equipment is dependent from tides and water levels, and significant effort is required to install and maintain the onshore discharge pipeline. In remote (off-shore) areas mobilization of site equipment to move the sand may be quite a challenge. <br/>The ideal method considers an active approach regarding processing the outflow of material. Instead of distributing the settled material by site equipment, the pipeline out flow point has to be relocated such that the design could be constructed. <br/>To increase workability the pipeline must have the ability to be relocated in water as on land.<br/>Enabling this approach the pipeline system has to be displaced by some sort of means. The main problem is the rigid behavior of the pipeline. Displacement of the pipeline will result that the entire pipeline length has to be displaced. Assuming that in water relocation of a floating pipeline is not that difficult as floating equipment is able to reach the floating pipeline. When the pipeline is situated on land huge pull or push requirements follows when the pipeline needs displacing. <br/><br/>Concepts both for depositing material as for delivering the material have been generated.<br/>The most promising method for depositing material is to apply a spray pontoon. By adding amphibious propulsion technique to the spray pontoon the pontoon is able to work on the interface between water and land. <br/>The most promising method regarding delivering material to the spray pontoon is by applying a steel pipeline. <br/>During depositing the spray pontoon have to be displaced frequently. Also the spray pontoon has to be able to displace the pipeline system. Properties of the pipeline system dictate the required amount of tractive effort that have to be generated by the spray pontoon. Focus is on maximizing the tractive effort to be generated by the spray pontoon. <br/>To decrease the amount of resistance the pipeline will be mounted on platforms. Focus is on minimizing the required amount effort to displace the pipeline system and by generating flexibility along the pipeline system. <br/>By generating flexibility along the pipeline system the pipeline could swing independently of each other. Production figures will determine the amount of flexibility needed along the pipeline system. <br/><br/>It is technical feasible to apply an amphibious spray pontoon but a uniform concept doesn’t exist because there is a large amount of parameters and aspects involved.<br/>It depends on the type of project, and site conditions which type of platform have to be applied. On project locations were small variations of the water level is to be expected and the soil surface has high bearing capacities values platforms can be applied that have an interaction with the soil surface. <br/>However, on soft soils with low bearing capacity values the soil interaction platforms will experience significant sinkage; the resistance force to displace such platforms may possible not be generated by the spray pontoon. In addition on soft soil the spray pontoon is able to generate a smaller pull force compared to when on sandy soil surface.<br/>On (very) soft soils platforms that don’t have an interaction with the soil surface are advantageous compared to soil interaction platforms. <br","design; concepts; depositing; pipeline; displacement; pull effort; shallow water; flexibility; resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Increasing the lifetime of a turbine can play a big role in driving down the overall costs of energy. The more energy the turbine is able to produce in its lifetime, the lower the costs per MWh will be. Fatigue damage is one of the limiting factors in a turbine’s lifetime. These damages are inversely proportional to the damping ratios and as such, estimating these ratios accurately, allows for optimisation of the structural design as well for improving control algorithms.<br/>Modelling software is used to estimate the modal properties, such as damping ratios, in the<br/>design phase of a turbine. However, these modelled properties often have a mismatch with<br/>reality due to differences in material properties, soil characteristic and others. Design based<br/>on these mismatched properties can lead to suboptimal control and a decrease in lifetime of<br/>the turbine. In order to eliminate this mismatch, it is of importance to accurately obtain the<br/>modal properties from the real turbine.<br/>System identification can play an important role in this. Using measurement data obtained<br/>during idling and operation of the turbine, the modal properties can be identified. When<br/>using measurement data, the danger of over-fitting is always present however. Often, a tradeoff<br/>needs to be made between the variance and bias of the estimation.

This impacts the fresh water supply for clean water production. Evides B.V., one of the Dutch water companies, anticipates to these changes with the sewer mining concept called ‘RINEW’ (Rotterdam Innovative Nutrients and Energy Watermanagement). RINEW studies various ways to recover valuable substances in direct decentralized sewage treatment. The treatment scheme involves the pre-treatment microscreen, coagulation and ceramic Microfiltration (cMF) for the water purification step Reverse Osmosis (RO). Since the application of cMF for sewage treatment is a novel concept, the objective of present thesis is to gain insight into technical aspects of cMF (a cMF fouling indicator and effect of oxygen on RO biofouling) and potential financial feasibility of the RINEW concept in the Netherlands. <br/>To study the potential of a fouling indicator for the cMF, irreversible fouling rates and feed water quality results are obtained over a two month period. The feed water quality is digitally monitored and characterized on COD, NTU and EC. The parameter ‘COD’ (chemical oxygen demand) is considered the most suitable as fouling indicator due to the relative large particle size of organic matter and sticky properties of biopolymers. Relating the fouling rates to the feed water quality results in a linear trend where higher irreversible fouling rates occur at higher COD concentrations. Yet, the trend result is scattered significantly since the operational flux was highly instable over time. The feed pump is originally designed for a Nanofiltration (NF) application which may explain the deviant cMF operation.<br/>The effect of oxygen in cMF permeate is studied on the (bio)fouling development on spiral wound Reverse Osmosis (RO). The study is done in duplicate each time using two parallel Membrane Fouling Simulator (MFS) which are fed by cMF permeate. In one MFS setup the water is depleted from oxygen by adding Sodium Bisulfite (NaHSO3). The pressure drop results in the MFS fed by aerobic water indicate a significant unstable fouling rate. The fouling rates obtained from the MFS fed by oxygen depleted water compare to similar studies done with NF permeate and tap water. This suggest a significant stable RO biofouling can be obtained if Sodium Bisulfite treatment is applied to RO feed water.<br/>The potential financial feasibility is studied via a concept study. Concept 1 is the RINEW concept providing high quality water (e.g. demi water) to an industry. Since it is a sewer mining concept the water transport costs are neglected. In concept 2 an equal high quality water flow is produced from secondary effluent by a MF/UF+RO combination at a central Sewage Treatment Plant (SWTP). The water transport from the central SWTP to the industry is taken into account in concept 2. The difference in specific costs [EURm-3] between the two concepts is estimated which is recalculated into a breakeven the high quality water transport distance of approximately 20 km. In other words, if an industry demands high quality water and sewage is the only water source, concept 2 is more financial feasible within a range of 20 km from a SWTP. In relation to the Netherlands the SWTP density is discussed as too high for the RINEW concept to be financial feasible. Similar realized treatment plants in the Netherlands show higher importance to aspects like water source, current expertise and existing facilities in the decision-making of treatment plant.<br","Ceramic; Microfiltration; RINEW; Sewage; Treatment; Biofouling; Irreversible; Fouling; Rate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","RINEW",""

It tries to learn a controller (policy) by trial and error. This makes it highly suitable for systems which are difficult to control using conventional control methodologies, such as walking robots. Traditionally, RL has only been applicable to problems with low dimensional state space, but use of Deep Neural Networks as function approximators with RL have shown impressive results for control of high dimensional systems. This approach is known as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).<br/><br/>A major drawback of DRL algorithms is that they generally require a large number of samples and training time, which becomes a challenge when working with real robots. Therefore, most applications of DRL methods have been limited to simulation platforms. Moreover, due to model uncertainties like friction and model inaccuracies in mass, lengths etc., a policy that is trained on a simulation model might not work directly on a real robot.<br/><br/>The objective of the thesis is to apply a DRL algorithm, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), for a 2D bipedal robot. The bipedal robot used for analysis is developed by the Delft BioRobotics Lab for Reinforcement Learning purposes and is known as LEO. The DDPG method is applied on a simulated model of LEO and compared with traditional RL methods like SARSA. To overcome the problem of high sample requirement when learning a policy on the real system, an iterative approach is developed in this thesis which learns a difference model and then learns a new policy with this difference model. The difference model captures the mismatch between the real robot and the simulated model.<br/><br/>The approach is tested for two experimental setups in simulation, an inverted pendulum problem and LEO. The difference model is able to learn a policy which is almost optimal compared to training on a real system from scratch, with only \SI{10}{\percent} of the samples required.","Reinforcement Learning; Bipedal Walking; Deep neural networks; Model learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Aviation activities contribute substantially to the anthropogenic climate impact. Due to an increasing demand on aviation transport, multiple mitigation strategies have been established to reduce the contribution to climate change by aviation. One promising strategy is to re-route aircraft, such that climate sensitive atmospheric areas are avoided. This mitigation strategy, depends on the scientific understanding of all processes involved. The European project REACT4C assessed the feasibility of such a mitigation technique by simulating the climate impact of NOx, as well as other emissions and contrail formation for eight distinct weather pattern. For each weather pattern, unit emissions of NOx are emitted in the North Atlantic flight sector. Each air parcel, containing the emitted NOx, is tracked within the atmosphere. This unique model set-up allows to analyse concentration changes of O3 and CH4 along each trajectory. In general, due to the emitted NOx, O3 is produced and CH4 is lost. Most recent results showed that by just increasing the operation cost by 1%, the climate impact can be reduced by about 10%. By comparing climate cost functions (CCF), a metric of the climate impact per unit emission, to weather charts, a link between high pressure ridges and the total climate impact of NOx is observed. Therefore, this research focuses on identifying weather influences on the temporal development of O3 and CH4 due to aviation attributed NOx emission.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the NOx chemistry, atmospheric transport processes and the model set-up of the REACT4C project is reviewed. The temporal development analysis of O3 is split-up into two parts, the O3 build-up and the O3 depletion. First, all data from the climate model are re-gridded and chemical production and loss rates are isolated from all other loss terms (i.e. diffusion). Certain characteristics of the temporal concentration changes of O3 are identified. A systematic analysis of the background chemical compounds and all important chemical reactions involved, provide insides to identify seasonal and emission altitude differences. With the help from literature and multiple statistical means, weather influences on those production and loss terms and thus the temporal development of O3 and CH4 , are identified. In a final step, inter-seasonal variations are analysed.<br/><br/>In general, the chemical processes during the O3 build-up are dominated by the emitted NOx, whereas the chemical processes during the depletion of O3 are dominated by the high O3 concentration. Seasonal differences of the maximum O3 concentration and the total CH4 loss are caused by lower background concentrations of all chemicals involved during winter, which lead to lower production and loss rates of O3 and CH4 . At the same time altitude differences in the production and loss of O3 and CH4 are caused by altitude variations in all chemicals involved. <br/><br/>The vertical transport within the atmosphere defines the time when the O3 maximum is reached. If an air parcel containing the emitted NOx, is transported fast to a lower altitude, the O3 maximum occurs sooner. If however the same air parcel would stay for a longer time at a high altitude, a late O3 maximum occurs. It could be identified that this downward motion is caused by the subsidence within a high pressure system. Airparcel with an earlier O3 maxima, experience high subsidence, which leads to a higher chemical activity based on higher temperatures. During summer a high O3 maximum can only be reached, if the background concentration of NOx is low during the O3 build-up. If the background NOx concentration is high, only very low O3 maxima occur. During winter the maximum O3 concentration is limited by the background concentration of HO2 . Only high HO2 background concentrations lead to high O3 maxima. The temporal development of CH4 is mainly influenced by the maximum O3 concentration as well as specific humidity. High O3 and H2O concentrations lead to high OH productions, which lead to a high CH4 losses. A high CH4 loss only occurs, if the maximum O3 concentrations and the specific humidity are high.<br/><br/>This study shows that the weather situation each air parcel, containing NOx emissions, experiences has a direct influence on the resulting concentration changes of O3 and CH4 . Therefore, weather has a direct impact on the climate impact of NOx , since the concentration change of O3 and CH4 directly influences the resulting climate impact. The understanding of processes related to the climate impact of aviation attributed NOx emission is increased. This improved understanding shows great potential to improve possibilities to forecast local climate impact resulting from aviation NOx emissions, which is necessary for future re-routing mitigation strategies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
