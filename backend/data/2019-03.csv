The pipelines stretch out for 31 kilometers from Chikalong(small nearby town) to the treatment plant in Badaksinga in Bandung. For one of those pipelines the current flow to the treatment plant is well below the design flow. The original design flow of the pipeline is 850 liters per second, currently the pipeline transports roughly 580-650 liters per second. This is not a critical problem at the moment because the treatment plant does not have the capacity to treat and distribute more water, but in the nearby future PDAM Tirtawening wants to increase its capacity and supply more water to the people of Bandung. This means that the supply of raw water to the treatment plant also needs to be increased. From the study it can be concluded that the flow drop was caused by human decisions to throttle the flow, based on the fact that there was severe burst (“explosion”) of the pipeline somewhere in the year 2005. The burst was caused by a water hammer incident, occurring during maintenance. During this maintenance period the water flow was stopped and a water body was standing stagnant in the lower end of the pipeline. When the operators opened valve again at the intake point, to start up the flow in the pipeline, the water mass accelerated downwards towards the stagnant water body below. The air trapped between these two water bodies could not escape in time thereby being compressed causing peak pressures. These pressures where of a much higher magnitude than the pressure which the pipeline was designed for, causing the “explosion” of the pipe. The reason why the trapped air could not escape through the air valves is because they are sealed to reduce the chance of locals stealing water. To avoid air entrapment and thereby reducing the risk on water hammer the following three throttling locations along the pipeline where investigated. • keep regulating the inflow at the intake point at Chikalong. • regulate inflow at the first intersection (OVS1) 3 kilometres downstream of Chikalong. • regulate inflow downstream at Badaksinga at the outflow point of the pipeline. From these three options throttling at OVS1 is preferred. The peak pressures along the pipeline stay well below the design pressure. However, throttling at preset at Chikalong has gone ’sufficient’ looking at PDAM’s standards for more than 25 years already. Regulating at Badaksinga (throttling and closing) is not feasible. Very high pressures and problems with cavitation of the intake valve will increase the chance on pipe bursts and damage to the valve. Also, it is recommended to PDAM to slowly open the valve at the intake point after maintenance in order to slowly increase the volume of the flow. This action will insure that the pipeline will slowly fill up with water thereby giving the trapped air the chance to escape, this will decrease the chance on peak pressures and “explosions” in the future.","Watermanagement; Hydraulic Engineering; Sanitary Engineering","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-6.890602, 107.610766"

For space missions the cost is proportional to the launch mass. One method for reducing the launch mass is to incorporate specialised manoeuvres in the trajectory that reduce the propellant mass required. One such manoeuvre is the aerocapture. Aerocapture uses a single pass through the atmosphere to reduce the orbital energy to transition from an open to a closed orbit. The aerocapture manoeuvre was studied using numerical simulations and rudimentary bank angle control. Using this approach, a theoretical optimal aerocapture trajectory was developed. Furthermore, the limits of the initial conditions for which aerocapture is possible were obtained. It was found that for initial conditions within this region a mass roughly equal to the dry mass of the vehicle could be saved when comparing the propellant mass required for propulsive capture to that required for aerocapture.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This thesis will tackle the problem of how to employ a group of mobile-sensors for surveying an unobstructed area in an optimal manner. The mobile-sensors should make use of their onboard computers and they should iteratively compute their waypoints until they successfully surveyed the area. To solve the area surveillance problem in an optimal manner, the mobile-sensors should be able to coordinate their actions. The Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) framework will be employed to define the area surveillance problem. In the DCOP, the mobile-sensors can define their optimal position for the next discrete time step by communicating with the other mobile-sensors that participate in the problem.<br/>For solving this DCOP, the Distributed Pseudo-tree Optimization Procedure (DPOP) will be utilized. The DPOP is a complete solver that can find the optimal solution of a DCOP in a decentralized manner. However, the main limitation of DPOP is that the size of the largest message that the mobile-sensors will have to exchange is space-exponential in the induced width of the pseudo-tree. Considering that the mobile-sensors have to use their onboard computers for solving the problem, exchanging huge size of messages is not desired. To overcome this limitation of DPOP, a new extension, known as the MST-DPOP will be presented in this Thesis. The MST-DPOP makes use of the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm to reduce the size of the largest message that the mobile-sensors have to exchange. Employing MST along with DPOP can bound the size of the largest message and the required computations for constructing the utility messages. However, the new extension cannot guarantee that its solution will be the optimal. The experimental results shows that the MST-DPOP is able to define a solution with an average error less than $2\%$. Moreover, the MST-DPOP requires on average around $1$ discrete time step more than the DPOP to solve the area surveillance problem. Consequently, given that the MST-DPOP overcomes the high memory requirements of DPOP, it is preferred for solving the area surveillance problem.","Optimization; DCOP; DPOP; Decentralized coordination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

To reduce this state space of a MDP several state aggregation, or clustering, methodologies have been applied. Recently, a new clustering algorithm has been proposed that is able to cluster states from a single block Markov chain. A block Markov chain is a Markov chain with blocks in its transition matrix that correspond to clusters. Our aim was to investigate the possible combination of state aggregation in reinforcement learning on MDPs with clustering of states on a block Markov chain. First, we investigated the clustering algorithm and its properties to see its performance with different parameters and trajectory length. We compared the statistical properties of a pure Markov chain and the mixed Markov chain generated by a MDP. Afterwards, we verified the performance of the clustering algorithm on this mixed Markov chain. We proposed the BMC-MDP model that is able to model cluster based MDPs. We proposed C-PSRL, an algorithm, that consists of a single clustering step, on this newly introduced model. We compared its performance with a naïve approach and concluded that this new combined approach of clustering and MDP solving on a reduced space is a viable approach that reduces the computational complexity significantly. This research opened up the possibilities of more complex algorithms with, for example, multiple clustering steps. Moreover, if we can extend this clustering algorithm to clustering based on a state and action trajectory, this may results in an increased clustering performance and thereby enhance the performance of this general approach of optimizing on a cluster based MDP.","Markov Decision Processes; Block Markov Chain; Clustering algorithms; Optimization Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Longitudinal control of the vehicles is an important part of the complete autonomous driving system. The difficulty of this control problem lies with changing longitudinal dynamics and the lack of full-state system information. This complicates controller design when using classic model-based approaches such as Optimal Control (OC). Currently the controllers are still manually tuned by control engineers in the<br/>vehicle. This is time consuming and expensive, therefore other methods for controller design such as learning are explored. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of those methods. To examine the potential benefits of learning a controller, this work will make a comparison between RL and OC. For RL, an actor-critic structure using deterministic policy gradient is applied. Due to partially observable system dynamics OC is used as an optimal output feedback controller. The comparison complies speed control of an autonomous vehicle. The RL agent will learn a controller by training on a nonlinear high fidelity vehicle model. In this work it was demonstrated that RL can reach the same performance as OC when all environmental settings are comparable. When environmental settings deviate, it was is found that RL outperforms OC. To verify the simulated results all controllers were confirmed in an experimental real-life setting.In conclusion, this proved a promising benefit of learning with respect to classical controller computation, when dealing with partially available system information.","reinforcement learning; optimal control; autonomous driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Jamsin, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","One in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives (WHO, 2001). Around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill- health and disability worldwide, in particular in low-income countries, where many barriers to receiving support exist (WHO, 2001). Inuka is a social enterprise spun out from Philips that aims at tackling Mental Health by making psychological support more accessible, affordable, anonymous and qualified. Inuka offers life coaching via confidential chats on smartphones. On one side, Inuka trains and supervises lay health workers in delivering a Behavioral- Cognitive-Therapy method. On the other side, Inuka connects them with distressed clients that want to be supported in facing life challenges, through an online platform. To achieve further social impact, Inuka aims to scale out to new geographic, social and cultural contexts, starting from the Church context. As a matter of fact, distressed individuals, in particular in Africa, seek psychological support in religious leaders as one of the first touchpoints. Starting by translating Inuka to the Church context in Kenya (Inuka Faith), where part of Inuka team is based, this thesis aims to provide the company with a framework to support their future scaling-out processes. Drawing from literature research on scaling social enterprises and adapting Evidence-based interventions to new locations, a framework to adapt Inuka current service to the characteristics of a new context was designed. The framework was tested and iterated on by applying it to the Church context in Kenya. Three main iterations were carried on, one of which entails field research in Nairobi, where the author stayed for 4 weeks. The objectives of the field trip were to better understand the context, its stakeholders and target users and to set the ground for an actual implementation. The adaptation process proposed in the final framework entails three phases (“Assess the new context“, “Validate Inuka Value Hypothesis“ and “Adapt variable components“), is preceded by a phase that unlocks those three (“Assess Inuka’s resources“) and followed by the implementation and evaluation of a pilot. For each phase, Inuka team should assess whether it is reasonable to think that the phase is completed (and therefore go to the next phase), if it is better to pivot on that phase, or if advisable to stop the scaling out process to the new chosen context. The final framework does not aim to be a strict guide to be literally followed, but to provide the company with relevant elements that should be kept in mind and methods the company could use. The application of the designed framework to Inuka Faith case allowed to unveil barriers to its adoption by potential customers and new opportunities. For this reason, the framework is expected to achieve the same outcome when applied to other contexts. This is due to the twofold nature of the framework. On one side, the systematic nature of the framework allows Inuka team to easily appropriate it and to follow its steps, keeping in mind the aspects that turned out to be the most relevant when conducting Inuka Faith case. On the other side, its user-centered nature allows to carry on an adaptation to a new context that is deeply rooted in the users’ and in the stakeholders’ needs, wants and characteristics. With an adaptation based on the characteristics of the new context, Inuka is likely to succeed in the new context.","Mental health; Framework; Scaling; Adaptation; Start-up; Design; Kenya","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Clouds regulate the amount of radiation received by the surface, with competing cloud warming and cloud cooling effects.<br/>With the CloudSat-CALIPSO satellites, cloud observations have become available for a large spatial grid, providing an AIS wide observational based dataset. In combination with the regional climate model RACMO2, a state-of-the art hybrid dataset is constructed with both high temporal and spatial resolution as well as good cloud representation.

In the clear-sky scenario only cloud radiative effects are been removed, with the aid of neural networks. Results show that clouds have a warming effect for each season of the year with an average 16.5 W/m2 and its minimum in summer. However, daytime cloud cooling effects are shown to have more impact on meltwater production. As a result, clouds reduce melt by 23.9 ¬± 10.3 Gt/yr which could impact ice shelf instability. On the other hand, the cloud radiative warming more directly increases sublimation mass loss by 34.7 ¬± 15.6 Gt/yr.

Some people argued that more attention into the social part of socio-hydrology should be given, because often the social aspects were too oversimplified. This thesis research tried to dig deeper into the social aspects of a socio-hydrology system. Keduang sub-basin was chosen to be the case study, as it has a sedimentation problem which has caused a huge operational problem of Gajah Mungkur dam, a multipurpose dam that mainly works as a flood control and hydropower plant in Solo river basin, the largest basin in Java Island of Indonesia.<br/><br/>This research used the case study research approach proposed by Yin (2013). Three different analysis were done to examine the system: stakeholder analysis to identify the relevant actors and their characteristics, historical events analysis to examine what the actors have done that were related to the sedimentation issue, and Socio-cultural, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal and Ethical (STEEPLE) analysis, to investigate those each sectors as external factors that might influence the decision making of the related actors. To summarize the analysis, a conceptual model was created to describe the socio-hydrology system of Keduang sub-basin.<br/><br/>There are a total of 10 relevant actors in the system, which come from 3 different groups: government, society and external actors. The government consists of 7 government agencies, the society represents farmers, and the external factors consist of researchers and donators. Between these 3 groups of actors, there is a feedback loop connection between the government and the society, which implies that the government has created some programs based on the society characteristic. Meanwhile, the external actors only interact with the government towards coordination. <br/><br/>The human-water interactions are different between the government and society, the government has a negative feedback loop with the water system, which means the government reduce what occurs in the water system, for example the high sediment in the system influences the government to remove the sediment. Surprisingly, it is not the case for the society, as it has a positive feedback loop especially regarding high sediments. Once the river had high sediments, people started to throw more garbage there thinking it would not be back clean, which would make the river even worse.<br/><br/>The actions done by the government and society are not only influenced by the water system, but also other external factors. For the government, economic, socio-cultural and politic factors are very influential to their actions. On the other hand, economic and socio-cultural factors are very influential to the society actions. These external factors seem to be more influential than the water system itself for their actions towards the water system.<br/><br/>Qualitative socio-hydrology study is clearly different with the quantitative study. Qualitative focuses on the why and how of relations in the system. It can give a good understanding on how such relations occur in the system. Hence, qualitative study can complement the quantitative study so that the model for quantitative study will not be oversimplified and based on valid reasoning.<br","socio-hydrology; stakeholder analysis; conceptual model; sedimentation; dam management; river basin management; land management; Socio-technical system; agriculture; indonesia; Java Island; solo river; central java; keduang sub-basin; gajah mungkur dam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

A dramatic shift towards autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the future transport system drastically changes the conditions for a transition to V2G, potentially resulting in a more flexible V2G system that efficiently deals with bidirectional flows between AVs and the electricity grid and the transport of passengers. Despite the beneficial effects AVs might have on a V2G transition, there is a lack of scientific research into the joint development of these technologies. This research bridges this knowledge gap by exploring the potential effects of autonomous battery electric vehicles on the performance of V2G for two scenarios: privately-owned unshared AVs and fleet-owned shared AVs. While privately-owned unshared AVs are expected to not have significant effects, fleet-owned shared AVs in combination with charging hubs are expected to enhance the performance of V2G because the ability to provide spinning reserve improves, the investment cost of the charging infrastructure decreases, negative impact on the distribution network can be controlled, and range anxiety disappears. However, uncertainties related to the potential revenues of some drivers and the impact of V2G on battery degradation remain an issue and require further research. In addition, the development of fleet-owned shared AVs is expected to include an on-demand business model that maximises the utilisation rate of AVs for mobility services because the value of renting out the vehicle is much higher than the value of V2G. If the final development path would contain this business model, the priority for V2G would be minimised which would create a new, insurmountable barrier that destroys the business case for V2G systems.","Autonomous Vehicles; Vehicle-to-Grid; Decentralised Storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

These technologies bring significant inconvenience for legitimate users. The goal of the thesis is to undertake a recent study to measure the behaviour of the Great Firewall of China (GFW). Based on that, this work designs a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) circumvention system called MultiProxy which exploits the blockchain-based economical model in order to create a balanced environment for resources providing and consuming. The system also uses multi-hop messaging to protect the privacy of the request initiators. The evaluation results show that MultiProxy can evade censorship while protecting users privacy.","censorship; network traffic analysis; distributed systems; Intel SGX","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Modelling and control design is longer required, which paves the way to numerous in- novations, such as optimal control of evermore sophisticated robotic systems, fast and efficient scheduling and logistics, effective personal drug dosing schemes that minimise complications, as well as applications not yet conceived. Yet, this potential is obstructed by the need for vast amounts of data. Without it, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) cannot work. If we want to advance RL re- search and its applications, a primary concern is to improve this sample efficiency. Otherwise, all potential is restricted to settings where interaction is abundant, whilst this is seldom the case in real-world scenarios. In this thesis we will study binary corrective feedback as a general and intuitive manner to in- corporate human intuition and domain knowledge in model-free machine learning. In accordance with our conclusions drawn from literature, we will present two algorithms, namely Probabilistic Merging of Policies (PMP) and its extension Predictive PMP (PPMP). Both methods estimate the abili- ties of their inbuilt Reinforcement Learning (RL) entity by computing the covariance over multiple output heads of the actor network. Subsequently, the corrections are quantified by comparing the uncertainty in what is learned with the inaccuracy of the given feedback. The resulting new action estimates will immediately be applied as probabilistic conditional exploration. The first algorithm is a surprisingly clean and straightforward way to accelerate an off-policy RL baseline and as well improves on existing work that learns from corrections only. Its extension Predictive Probabilistic Merging of Policies (PPMP) predicts the corrected samples. This gives the most substantial improve- ments, whilst the required feedback is further reduced. We demonstrate our algorithms in combination with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) on continuous control problems of the OpenAI Gym. We show that the greatest part of the otherwise ignorant learning process is indeed evaded. Moreover, we achieve drastic improvements in final performance, robustness to erroneous feedback and feedback efficiency both for simulated and real human feedback, and show that our method is able to outperform the demonstrator.","Reinforcement Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Interactive Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Seeking to contribute towards the development of a wind farm solver using a Lagrangian scheme to analyze the wake, this thesis analyses and validates (using MATLAB) a Vortex Particle Method (VPM) algorithm by simulating the behavior of vortex rings. Due to the computationally expensive nature of VPM schemes to solve n-body problems, such as the simulation of vortex rings and wind turbine wake, a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) library called BBFMM3D has been studied and validated (using C++) for the acceleration of computation of matrix-vector products which are essential in solving n-body problems. The execution of the VPM algorithm has been shown to be possible to be accelerated using the validated FMM library by implementing the library in the VPM scheme to simulate the case of a single vortex ring. Using the VPM solver developed to simulate vortex rings, the simulation of a wake of a wind turbine, that was modeled using actuator lines, was performed (without FMM) and the results have been analyzed and attempted to be validated. It has been found that the VPM scheme generates less than accurate results of the velocity profile of the wake with respect to other CFD simulations and the model could not be validated due to the results not being accurate up to the mark. However, the accuracy of the results has been found to rely significantly on the formulation of the strengths of the vortices shed into the wake.

Multiple researches already showed promising results, with a 25% increased lift over drag ratio compared to conventional aircraft like the Airbus A350-900. Before research of sub-scale flight testing can be conducted, research into the flight characteristics is necessary. Based on the identification of the problems, the research question for the thesis research is defined as: ""What are the flight characteristics of the Flying V sub-scale model at approach speed and high angles of attack?"" In total, three different wind tunnel campaigns were conducted at the Open Jet Facility of the Delft University of Technology. During the wind tunnel campaigns, experiments were conducted to acquire data through balance measurements and flow visualisation techniques by means of oil, tufts ans smoke. The untrimmed maximum lift coefficient was estimated to be 1.09 at 41 degrees angle of attack and positive stability was found up to 20 degrees angle of attack. Flow visualisation results showed that large leading edge vortices acted on the surface of the wing, originating from the root towards the crank of the wing. A leading edge separated vortex spread over the wingtip, which originated at the kink of the leading edge. Investigations into the trimmed flight of the aircraft concluded that due to trim limitations the centre of gravity is bound between 1.345 and 1.425 meter behind the nose. The centre of gravity has an optimal location at 1.365 meter behind the nose, providing a static margin of about 9%. With the trimmed lift curve and the optimal centre of gravity location, the flight speed of 35 meter per second can be flown at 3.6 degrees angle of attack. Due to limitation in maximum deflection of the control surfaces, the maximum lift coefficient is estimated at 0.95, at 28.5 degrees angle of attack at a stall speed of 14.8 meter per second. At 20 degrees angle of attack, where the static stability switches from positive to negative, the lift coefficient is estimated at 0.73 at 17.2 meter per second and is defined as the 'safe' stall speed. Taking the FAA and ICAO regulations into account, the approach speed is estimated at 19.2 meter per second, at an angle of attack of 15.9 degrees at a lift coefficient of 0.58.","Flying V; Flying wing; Open Jet Facility; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Flight characteristics; Flow measurements; Center of gravity; Stalling behaviour; Lift coefficient; Moment coefficient; Static stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","Flying V Research",""

On this planet, water has always been plentiful. Therefore, the conclusion of the United Nations in 2015 was even more shocking. The United Nations estimated that in 2030 a water gap would exist of 40%. The withdrawal of fresh water would be 40% larger than the amount that is replenished every year. We are living on borrowed time, and we need to close this gap. Since most water on the earth is saline, desalination could be a possible solution. Unfortunately, desalination is an energy-intensive process, and it will always be. There are different methods. However, energy consumption would always be rather large. Much of our energy is still created by fossil fuels in most areas in the world. Our increasing demand for fresh water can lead to a further large fossil footprint and therefore more climate change. Climate change negatively impacts our water supplies. A negative spiral could be the result.<br/>The world is consuming a large amount of energy. Unfortunately, this is not done efficiently. It is estimated that 72% of worldwide energy consumption is lost after conversion. Waste heat is an unwanted product as a result of this inefficient conversion. It is estimated that 63% of this waste heat has a temperature of 100 degrees Celcius or lower. A temperature that is not even sufficient to boil an egg, but it is energy nonetheless. If this energy could be harvested, the water gap could be closed by desalination without increasing the carbon footprint. However, how to do this? A solution could be found in Japan and your dry cleaner. In the seventies, when the oil crisis was at its peak, Japan had a problem. It has a high need for air conditioning which has a high need for energy. A device was created that could use waste heat to create cooling with silica gel. The general public knows silica gel as moist eaters that are included in your dry cleaning. By placing silica gel in a closed environment, liquid water could be evaporated. Evaporation needs energy, and this could create cooling. In early 2000, some folks in Singapore realised that this technology could also be used to desalinate. Adsorption Desalination was born. Adsorption desalination (also known as AD) is a boiling point elevation and vapour pressure lowering desalination technique. Silica gel has a high affinity to adsorb water vapour. Since this is done in a closed environment, the pressure is lowered till boiling. When an energy source is placed inside the liquid, an equilibrium can be found without lowering the pressure further. Once the silica gel is saturated, it is heated till a certain temperature that it starts to desorb the vapour again. This vapour is collected and condensed into a clean product. The mass transport takes place by a pressure difference. Since the evaporation takes place in vacuum conditions, it is around room temperature. Therefore it can have a low sensitivity for erosion. Since it is an evaporation technique, it also has a low sensitivity for fouling. On paper, it can be a desalination technology with low operational costs compared to others. In reality, a couple of barriers have to be conquered. One of the barriers is the characteristics of the core element of this technology, the silica gel. The reason that silica gel can adsorb water vapour so well is due to two main elements. First, it is an incompletely dehydrated polymeric structure of colloidal silica acids. Therefore it can create hydrogen bonds, polar bonds and weak electron bonds with other molecules. Water is a bipolar molecule, and therefore silica gel can adsorb water exceptionally well. It can create hydron bonds efficiently, and due to the bipolar nature of water, multiplayer on top of each other can be formed. The second element is the high specific surface of silica gel. It has many pores, and therefore a specific surface equal to human lungs can be formed. In the end, the best qualities can adsorb until 40% of their body weight.<br/>These two elements determine the maximum amount of vapour silica gel can adsorb. However, two parameters determine if silica gel can adsorb. These two parameters are the temperature and vapour pressure. If the temperature is high, the vapour pressure has also to be high to ensure adsorption and the other way around. The same account for the opposite effect. Therefore energy transfer is vital for smooth operation. Unfortunately, the thermal conductivity of silica gel is extremely low. Besides energy transfer to change the temperature of silica gel to go from adsorping to desorbing and reverse, much energy has to be transported during the adsorption and desorption phase. During adsorption, water vapour transforms from a gas phase to a semi-solid phase. In this phase, the energy level is lower. Since energy cannot be destroyed, this energy has to be removed. The same applies to the opposite. If the heat exchanger is not well designed, the adsorption and desorption phase are prolonged, and the daily water production diminished. Even if the whole set-up is well designed, there is still one element of silica gel that can also diminish the water production of the set-up: the degradation of silica gel. Multiple mechanisms can degrade silica gel, but the two most important are fragmentation and pore pollutions by metal ions. Fragmentation (the breaking up into smaller parts) occurs by the high thermal stress the silica gel endures and the pollutions by the feed. A part of the sorption ability is destroyed or temporarily inhibited. The use of acid water can remove the pollution, so maintenance on the silica gel is necessary. Replacing the silica gel by other sorbents like zeolite is possible. Unfortunately, it has a lower adsorption capacity which leads to a less compact device and is, therefore, more expensive. Another unfortunate fact is that zeolite desorbs at a higher temperature. When using zeolite, adsorption desalination can no longer use waste heat of low quality to desalinate. The last problem with using silica gel, but also other sorbents, are the instabilities with the sorption characteristics in vacuum conditions. The sorption characters depend as said before on the temperature and the vapour pressure. Inside vacuum conditions, a disturbance of the vapour pressure can negatively influence the sorption characteristics and can lead to desorption at the wrong moment. Since it is done in a closed environment, it can lead to condensation which lowers the vapour pressure further. A complete breakdown of performance can be the result. Disturbances can happen through air leakage, which is are a common problem in industries. There are some solutions, but in the end, the permanent one is a high-quality vacuum system and intensive maintenance. Even with these barriers, adsorption desalination is still an attractive technology due to its relationship with its own energy consumption pattern. The energy consumption is high but stable and barely sensitive to change in conditions like feed salinity and recovery. Its energy consumption stays around the 40 $kWh/m^3$ in most cases. Only a small part, around 1.38 $kWh/m^3$ or even less has to be mechanical energy. All others can come from waste heat. If the other operating costs are kept low, it is an exciting technology to use, especially for brine treatment since waste heat is an inexpensive energy source. Some researcher claim it is a free energy source, but that statement cannot be valid. To use waste heat, infrastructure is necessary to collect it and transport it. It is not the same as putting a plug in the wall. There is probably enough waste heat in the world to close the water gap. As an example, the Netherlands is the second biggest producers of waste heat in Europe and creates enough to produce probably more 850 $km^3$ potable water. Unfortunately, there are some uncertainties. Waste heat is only classified in three rough categories, low, medium or high. Low is everything below 100 degrees Celcius. It could be that most energy is trapped in waste heat with a temperature of 30 degrees. More validation is necessary since the future of adsorption desalination is intertwined with waste heat. Without waste heat, it cannot be an inexpensive desalination technique. Since it is still an experimental technology, not a lot of data is available to create a solid picture of the costs involved with adsorption desalination. Only two studies exist today, and both estimate that the cost for seawater desalination using adsorption desalination is between 50% and 70 % of the cost while using reverse osmosis. Only one study gives insight into the different sectors of cost. What is notable is that the other costs, replacement cost for parts and chemical cost for adsorption desalination are kept at zero. A strange conclusion since silica gel can degrade and replacement can be necessary, chemicals are necessary for the heating and cooling water AD uses. No conclusion can be made about the final costs of AD, but it the conclusion of these studies seems unlikely. For seawater desalination, the costs are probably in the same range as reverse osmosis. Furthermore, there is a strong case that AD can remove biological pollutants since it is an evaporation technique where temperatures are reached until 80 degrees Celcius. There are a few remarks and only solid empirical data can prove these claims. The original intent of this research was to research these claims. Unfortunately, the set-up was not functioning properly due to practical problems like air leakages. Even with this result, much knowledge was gained, and a few remarks and conclusions can be made. To conclude, adsorption desalination is a newly emerging technology with many interesting aspects. It can provide an alternative for standard desalination techniques while being sustainable. There are a few barriers to overcome, but it deserves attention. Further developments should be stimulated since the water should be close in an environmentally friendly matter. Adsorption desalination is a sustainable solution that should always be considered.","Adsorption; Desalination; Sustainabilty; Waste heat recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

But as these (often traditional) organisations implement AI-systems in customer-facing practices, it slowly becomes the new front-office brand ambassadors of the brand (Wilson, Daugherty &amp; Bianzino, 2017). But even though many organisations are starting to invest and implement AI-solutions they do not seem to fully comprehend its impact on their brand and business (Capgemini Digital Transformation Institute, 2017. And, in a similar way that people can be annoyed or pleased by an interaction with a customer service representative, customer-facing AI also has the potential to shape the brand experience of users. This is due to the fact that people tend to judge and anthropomorphise interactions with such AI-systems, which will ultimately affect their perception of the brand and its performance. Therefore, in order for customer-facing AI to add value to the business as well as the consumer, AI-systems should be designed in such a way that they fit with the brand, and benefit the brand experience of the customer. Based on this, the following research question has been formulated: How to augment the brand experience of users in service-driven brands through customer-facing Artificial Intelligence?

First, this thesis will explore how to design for AI-augmented brand experiences by defining brand experience, and the potential of Artificial Intelligence in it.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","With the onset of the age of space travel, asteroid missions have been steadily gaining interest. The pristine nature of asteroids due to their preserved state since the formation of the Solar System is an opportunity to unravel many mysteries about the Solar System. Also with the ever-growing need for resources, asteroids prove to be a plentiful source. With the discovery of asteroids in the close vicinity of our planet and a probable threat to the preservation of life, a need for defence missions has also arisen. The ever-growing need for better computational speed and accuracy has led to the development of new representations for attitude and position of the spacecraft in the past. The usual methods of representations of position and attitude (pose) are the Cartesian coordinates and quaternions. A recent development is the simultaneous representation of the pose of the spacecraft using dual quaternions which are eight-dimensional vectors. In this thesis, an attempt to incorporate these state-of-the-art guidance technologies to asteroid missions has been made. The novelty in this thesis is, using dual quaternions for SC pose and attitude representation to autonomously guide the spacecraft for mapping an asteroid and perform a touch and go descent using sampling-based motion predictive optimisation and successive convexification respectively. After the development and verification of these algorithms, different scenarios have been designed to find out the robustness of the dynamic successive convexification method. The scenarios have been run by both the Cartesian quaternion and dual quaternion based algorithms. They are found to behave similarly in their results, besides the latter being computationally more expensive as proved by different theses so far. The algorithm performs better than the one developed by Szmuk et al. (2017), but faces difficulties with badly scaled problems as is the nature of missions to asteroids. The software used for the thesis is ECOS, which faces numerical problems in these mission scenarios even when the problem is feasible and has an optimal result. The availability of a solution to the optimal control problem depends on the scaling of the penalty weights used in the cost function to penalise virtual controls and trust region, which are used to prevent infeasibility and bound the problem, respectively. It also depends on finding an appropriate final time for the descent along with the number of nodes for discretisation. This research proves, that successive convexification indeed provides a speedy solution for an autonomous precision descent but needs further work to make it robust and stable. The outcome of this thesis is to carry out further research to understand the complex relations, between the scale of the problem, simulation parameters for the optimal control problem and final time to make the algorithm robust and safe for an autonomous mission. Another important future research prospect is to incorporate the sampling based model predictive optimisation, for the SC to autonomously map the target body and help in selecting a landmark for a descent.","successive convexification; convex optimisation; dual quaternion; motion planning; asteroids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Therefore, in the European design codes (Eurocodes), three reliability classes (RC) are introduced based on the potential consequence of failure of the structure. For each of the RC a maximum allowable probability of failure is introduced, corresponding to a reliability index. In recent research by Roubos et al. (2018), it is suggested that the marginal costs of safety investments for quay walls is quite low. Therefore, it is questionable whether the current reliability classes and the corresponding set of partial factors, as defined in the Eurocodes and CUR 211, are functional for quay walls. This gave rise to the present study. This thesis investigates the relationship between the construction costs and the reliability index for two quay walls located in the Port of Rotterdam; 1) a double anchored combi-wall and 2) a combi-wall with a relieving platform.<br/>In this study, more insight is acquired into the relationship between the construction costs and the reliability index of quay walls. Firstly, the two quay walls are designed semi-probabilistic in RC1, RC2 and RC3, using D-Sheet Piling for the double anchored combi-wall and using Plaxis 2D for the combi-wall with a relieving platform. Thereafter, the construction costs of these designs are calculated and compared. Besides that, the influence of the partial safety factors, which are defined in the Eurocodes and distinguish the reliability classes, on the construction costs is quantified. The same was done for the influence of three of the critical failure mechanisms; ‘passive resistance inadequate’, ‘sheet pile profile fails’ and ‘tension member anchorage fails’. For these failure mechanisms the reliability indices are estimated using the reliability analyses module of D-Sheet Piling, which is based on a probabilistic level II analysis, the First Order Reliability Method (FORM).<br/>It appeared that the marginal costs of safety investments for both quay walls is relatively low, even significantly lower than suggested by Roubos et al. (2018). It followed that the differentiation in construction costs between the reliability classes is considerably less than the differentiation in construction costs between quay walls in practice. Therefore, it seems that the current reliability classes and the corresponding set of partial safety factors, as defined in the Eurocodes and CUR 211, are non-functional for quay walls. Besides that, it can be concluded that when designing a quay wall, the determination of the angle of internal friction of the soil strongly influences the construction costs, followed by the surface- and crane loads. The influence of the cohesion of the soil and the bollard load on the construction costs is very small. Furthermore, the influence of the failure mechanisms ‘passive resistance inadequate’ and ‘tension member anchorage fails’ on the construction costs of the double anchored combi-wall is relatively low. Therefore, it is suggested that the reliability index of the quay wall can be increased in a economically attractive manner by increasing the length of the tubular piles of the combi-wall or the steel sectional area of the anchor rod. Due to these influences, it can be economically beneficial to increase the target reliability index of the failure mechanism ‘passive resistance inadequate’ and decrease the target reliability index of ‘sheet pile profile fails’.","Reliability; Quay structures; Construction costs; FORM; Partial factors; Failure mode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Intervention radiology is a medical specialty which uses minimally invasive techniques to diagnose, or treat diseases. Instruments like needles and catheters are used by radiologists to enter the network of veins and arteries guided by image modalities. A complex treatment in the interventional radiology is the Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure. This treatment is developed for people who suffer from liver cirrhosis which are not eligible for liver transplantation. The problem which arise with a liver affected by cirrhosis is that it can not transmit enough blood. Without transplantation or a treatment this will eventually lead to death. During the TIPS procedure a connection is made between the right hepatic and the portal vein by a shunt. As a result, blood pressure reduction in the portal system since the blood can flow back to the right atrium of the heart, bypassing the liver.<br/><br/>The hardest part in a TIPS procedure is the intrahepatic puncture between the hepatic and portal vein. The interventional radiologist tries to enter the portal vein by puncturing a small stylet from the hepatic vein through the liver tissue. Due to cirrhosis the liver tissue is very stiff and stylet deflection will occur. To reduce the uncertainty of entering the portal vein, this thesis is focused on designing a stylet that is more stiff and able to steer. It is expected that the complexity of the procedure will be reduced and a higher hit rate to enter the portal vein will be achieved.\\ <br/>\\<br/>The prototype of the steerable stylet has been evaluated through various experiments, a visibility test and with procedures in a test liver model. During these experiments the steering characteristics, the stiffness of the stylet, the maximum lateral forces exerted by the tip while steering, the influence of the stylet orientation and the visibility are obtained. Afterwards, an evaluation was done in a liver model, made of PVA, to determine whether the stylet is capable to reduce the complexity of the intrahepatic puncture step in the TIPS procedure.<br/><br/>With the prototype made in this graduation project, based on a steerable ablation needle, the complexity of the TIPS procedure is not reduced yet. The steerable stylet was not able to enter the portal vein. It was already hard to enter the right hepatic vein since the pre-bent stiffening cannula was adapted with a smaller angle which was necessary since the steerable stylet was too stiff to push through the pre-bent angle. According to this prototype, possibilities are shown to use a mechanical steering mechanism in instruments with a long thin shaft. The transmission in combination with the joint mechanisms fits within 1.3mm diameter, was able to bridge 60cm from distal end to proximal end and had only 4 components, the stylet, the rigid cannula, the key to fix the stylet to the rigid cannula and the transmission. By translating the stylet in a push or pull direction relative to the rigid cannula, steering angles could be achieved. With further research and development this steering mechanism must be able to steer the required amount of degrees without any extra components, is well visible with ultrasound, and is good resistant against lateral forces. <br/><br/><br/><br","steerable needles; TIPS procedure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The pipeline production rate and the pipeline’s superior mechanical properties are the crucial parameters for the offshore pipe laying company. Pulling on the bead, i.e. the action of moving the pipe on the firing line to the subsequent weld stall as the vessel moves forwards allows a fast and reliable pipe welding process. During this movement, the ends of the pipes are intermittently not supported and the bending moment in the weld is created as a consequence. Such operation imposes tensile loads in the welds, that are especially high for the 3 mm thick beadweld and the subsequent 3 mm thick hot pass (6mm thick in total). An important question arises whether imposing loads above the beadweld material yield capacity affects the overall fatigue performance of the girth weld. It is in the best interest of the offshore industry to assure that the pipeline welds properties during their 20-30 years operation lifetime are not adversely affected during its installation. This study investigates the effect of pulling on the bead on the weld’s fatigue behaviour.<br/>The overstressing simulation of the test coupons, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the loaded beadweld and the small-scale specimens comparative fatigue study were conducted to investigate the effect of straining history on the full girth weld fatigue performance. Additionally, the holistic approach was implemented to investigate the consolidated effects of other factors: local weld root misalignment (Hi-Lo), weld porosity and microstructure quality. Four test coupons were welded together and overstressed to simulate the pulling on the bead action. To assess the stress-strain state in the beadweld and hot pass during the overstressing simulation the FEA analysis was done. The FEA results allowed to quantitatively determine the exact locations of the elastically and plastically strained beadweld material. Full welds were checked against the porosity and subsequently, 46 fatigue specimens were fabricated and tested in the 4-point-bending fatigue loading setup. Additionally, the fatigue crack observation techniques were implemented in order to separate fatigue crack initiation and growth phases out of the total fatigue life. The optical observations (with the optical-digital microscope) and the Potential Drop techniques were used. Tensile and hardness tests were done to compare the strength properties of specimens with different straining and porosity histories. Finally, the microstructure and fracture surfaces of the fatigue broken specimens were studied.<br/>The research done in this study gives a good overview of the fatigue behaviour of the girth welds and provides insights into the straining history effects. Plastic straining was found not to affect the fatigue performance more than currently acceptable elastic straining does. Moreover, plasticity was found to reduce the negative effect of porosity. Additionally, the prevalent influence of Hi-Lo on the crack initiation phase was confirmed, making it the driving negative factor for the fatigue resistance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-28","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

EUV light is transported from the source to wafer by reflective optics. These mirrors are subjected to large thermal loading, as a large portion of the reflected light is absorbed in the mirror structure. The portion of the absorbed light is strongly dependent on the intensity and wavelength of the considered light, introducing varying amounts of thermally induced strains on the mirror structure and thereby limiting the optical performance. Current mirror designs typically use solid mirror structures for more predictable deformations. These structures are coupled to spiral cooling channels to extract the absorbed heat to achieve more uniform temperature distributions. However, as ASML strives towards ever smaller resolutions, advances have to be found on the mirror design methodology to further reduce the thermally induced strains. <br/>In this research, topology optimization is used as a possible method of producing designs which can minimise the thermally induced surface deformations of a mirror typically encountered when exposed to thermal loading. Due to the ""multi-physics"" nature of this problem, the optimization problem has to encompass thermo-mechanics, thermo-fluidics and the conjugate heat transfer at the interface of these two domains. The topology optimization formulation presented in this research, minimises surface deformations by altering the topology of the mirror structure together with the cooling channel layout producing an integrated solution.","Topology Optimization; Thermo-mechanical; Thermo-fluid; Conjugate heat transfer; Convection; Cooling channels; Mirror; Optical performance; Adjoints; Gradient-based Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Specifically, the goal is to find a way in which smart reminders systems can be extended through the use of user values to ultimately provide more appropriately timed reminders. This is essential in providing software aided support. A system is designed from scratch, combining existing concepts of activity prediction and value-based design. A statistical Markov chain model is made from predictions based on Expectation Maximization and Apriori algorithms. User values are quantified and optimized following the concept of a Socially Adaptive Electronic Partner and added to the model to identify an appropriate moment for a notification. The concept of values is broken down into two aspects. Firstly, the value loss invoked by the nuisance of receiving a notification during a certain activity. Secondly, the expected value gain achieved by actually remembering is simulated through the expected time between the moment of notification and the deadline. The model is implemented in a Node.js web application, following the principles of a RESTful web API. The model is tested for both its success in correct prediction and the moment selection. The basic predictive model shows a 91% success rate but falls short at 73% when considering values. After optimizing the system for user values, up to a 13% improvement in the success rate and an 18% improvement in the score (more appropriate moment) is found for the model considering user values with respect to the basic, predictive model. Overall, a clear and workable approach to value-based smart reminders is shown through a statistical and dynamic approach to incorporate the concept of user values in a smart-reminder system.","smart reminder; saep; user values; activity prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Previous medical hyperspectral image analysis approaches depended on handcrafted features or feature extraction principle, requiring considerable domain expertise. To overcome this, automatic feature learning approaches like convolutional neural networks (CNN), previously used in tasks like classification, detection and segmentation in medical images were applied to hyperspectral data, although in a limited number of research studies.

To this end, two types of CNN models were trained from scratch using limited labelled training data, one to automatically learn the spectral features present in the hyperspectral data and the other to learn the combined spectral-spatial features from the hyperspectral data.

It follows an exploratory research approach that was driven by a research question and where a design was used as a stimulus to test the research question (as can be seen in Figure 3 on page 21). The research question in this thesis is: what can design offer, in addition to contemporary approaches, in change communication to create internal buy-in? To attain an understanding of organisational change and change communication, both literature and field research (in the form of interviews) were conducted. This concluded the first part of the thesis, the Study, and moved it into the Design part of the thesis. After conducting interviews with eighteen people at six different companies, across the levels of hierarchy, a design opportunity presented itself: after the company change was announced, the employees had lots of questions and they felt like they weren’t being taken seriously. The thesis proceeds to describe how a solution to this challenge was designed and tested. The testing of the design brought the Design and Study parts of the thesis together: the concluding remarks from the test reflect not only the feasibility, desirability and viability of the design, but present insights pertaining to the research question. This thesis concludes by offering the insights that what design can offer internal change communication to create internal buy-in are boundary objects and a user-centred approach to problem solving. Boundary objects could provide a form of common understanding and clarity about topics, that are complex or unclear, that allow for people to have facilitated discussions. By creating a better understanding about the change and how employee questions and queries will be addressed, you can reduce resistance to the change and create internal buy-in (Llenza, 2008). Having a user-centred approach allows for users to inform the design of a tool that they will be using, allowing for it to not only meet their needs, but also creating ownership over that tool and the company change. If the change isn’t strongly or exclusively top driven, employees will feel a willingness to participate in the change and take ownership of the change, creating internal buy-in (Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2015).","Communication; Buy-in; Organisational change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Before being able to determine a feasible, viable and desirable innovation strategy a comprehensive MaaS future mobility scenario was sketched out. This scenario was based on the insights gathered from the market, technological and MaaS research. Thereafter, the business context of LeasePlan was analysed in order for us to determine a LeasePlan specific positioning within this future mobility scenario.Based on the MaaS research insights we can conclude that MaaS could challenge the value proposition of long-term vehicle leasing. Therefore, this thesis instead delivers a solution that strengthens and takes away several of the pain points along the current vehicle centred journey of LeasePlan customers, while using the principles and characteristics of MaaS. More specifically, in a future where cities become free of personally driver driven vehicles this thesis provides a solution to the first and last mile mobility gap along the journey of urban LeasePlan customers. It does so by creating mobility hubs at the outskirts of the city, which combine physical parking with a digital MaaS mobility hub application. By doing so, customers are able to make seamless transitions between their regular car journeys and flexible &amp; convenient first and last mile inner city mobility solutions. Ultimately, this solution would enable LeasePlan to deliver upon the set vision for this project which is “Providing careless mobility to our customers.”LeasePlan is able to obtain several benefits by building an extensive network of strategically located mobility hubs spread across the key cities within the Netherlands: 1) LeasePlan is able to strengthen its current value proposition by filling in the first and last mile mobility gap with seamless multimodal vehicle centred journeys; 2) LeasePlan is able to generate additional revenue by offering new vehicle centred mobility services, such as the inter hub micro transit solutions. Additionally, LeasePlan could profit from re-selling first and last mile solutions from their partners; 3) At these mobility hubs LeasePlan services can be offered such as maintenance and commercial activities. This would reduce the costs of such activities and increase the brand awareness of LeasePlan.To support and enable the development and realization of the concept both a strategic and tactical roadmap have been created. These roadmaps explain the necessary steps leading towards the desired future mobility hub concept in great detail. The roadmap is divided into three horizons, spanning from short term developments to long term developments. The short-term solution aims to increase the flexibility and convenience of the current CaaS solution, this in order to fulfil the changing customer needs. While the long-term solution aims to fill in the future first and last mile mobility gap and strengthen the current vehicle centred value proposition of LeasePlan.","MaaS; Mobility; Roadmap; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

During the installation of offshore wind turbine towers there are different stages of transport where we might deal with VIV. The main objective of this thesis is to explore the possibility of modeling the VIV of flexible cylindrical structures by means of an existing wake oscillator model. Sub objectives are to investigate the influence of the deck stiffness and vessel motions on the VIV. And also, the effectiveness of strakes as mitigation for VIV is investigated. From the literature study it is found that an existing wake-oscillator model with acceleration coupling is a good way to model the VIV of a rigid cylinder that is free to vibrate in water. This wake oscillator model, which was tuned to the experiments in water, is then tuned to an experiment where the rigid cylinder was free to vibrate in air. These free vibration experiments were all done in the sub critical flow regime. In the next step the model is extended to model the VIV of flexible cylindrical structures. In an attempt to validate, this model is used to simulate the cross-flow amplitude of a in situ chimney on whom measurements were done during VIV. Due to the size of the in situ chimney, the Reynolds number at which VIV occurred suggests that we are in the super critical flow regime. However, the measured Strouhal number had a frequent value of 0.21 which is common for the sub critical flow regime. From the simulations it was found that by making use of the force coefficients from the super critical regime good agreement is found between the simulated and measured crossflow amplitude, while adopting force coefficients from the sub critical regime, the model significantly over predicted the response. Finally, the model is applied in a case study with a wind turbine tower. A total of four cases are investigated. From this case study it was found that a stiff deck will result in VIV at higher windspeeds, but will also increase the loads. The VIV of the tower is hardly influenced by the vessel motion since the frequencies of the two are far apart. According to the model, covering the top one third of the tower with strakes significantly reduce the VIV, but with a penalty of increased in-line bending load on the deck.","Vortex induced vibrations; wake oscillator model; Wind Turbine Towers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The objective of the study was to design a one-part instrument, based on the DragonFlex, having the same functionality as the DragonFlex, while only requiring the assembly of the control wires. This one-part instrument is called the MonoFlex. In an iterative process of designing in SolidWorks (2018) and testing printed samples, the design of the MonoFlex was developed until final prototypes were obtained, both with and without steering segments. Final compression and torsion tests showed that the grasping forceps side and the control handle side, broke when exposed to torsion moments of 32.9 Nmm and 20.8 Nmm respectively and compression forces of 0.2 N and 1.5 N respectively. When the instruments were exposed to tensile forces up to 19.6 N, both sides did not show any sign of failure. The maximum grasping force reached was 2.4 N, lower that the average grasping forces (of 10 – 20 N), required to grasp tissue. The printed parts were slightly different from the parts drawn in SolidWorks, this was because of the incomplete addition of support material, and the post-processing method. The working principle of a one-part 3D-printed grasping prototype was proven. A recommendation for future research is to make the MonoFlex stronger and more durable by using multiple materials. This will bring medical technology another step closer to fully non-assembly 3D-printable MIS instruments.","Non-assembly; Compliant Joint; 3D Printing; Minimally invasive surgery; Steerable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

In this thesis, a discrete event simulation model is built and used as a tool to evaluate several configurations and scenarios for the coordination between a port and the offshore modular platform in order to integrate the logistics operations on the platform to the existing port container service. The Port of Antwerp is selected for a case study.","container; terminal; port; Antwerp; performance evaluation; coordination; Space@Sea; offshore modular platform; discrete event simulation; barge route strategy; Python; salabim","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","Space@Sea",""

For the solution of this problem, two algorithms have been constructed: a heuristic approach that considers all possible combinations of hubs to be visited and a commercial solver for the MILP formulation. These algorithms are evaluated in comparison to a benchmark heuristic, which is the current heuristic used at Picnic. The proposed heuristic performs slightly worse for small instances and performs better for large instances than the benchmark heuristic. The MILP based algorithm with the current set-up is too slow for operational usage. However, as it provides an improvement of 9.1% less vehicles used and 2.5% less vehicle hours used as compared to the benchmark heuristic for tiny instances, further research in this direction appears to be promising.","Online grocer; Integrated Production and Distribution Scheduling Problem; IPDS; Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-27","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

A well known disadvantage of RL is the necessity for extensive amounts of data for a suitable control policy. For systems that concern physical application, acquiring this vast amount of data might take an extraordinary amount of time. In contrast, humans have shown to be very efficient in detecting a suitable control policy for reference tracking problems. Employing this intuitive knowledge has proven to render model-free learning strategies suitable for physical applications. Recent studies have shown that learning a policy by directive action corrections is a very efficient approach in employing this do-main knowledge. Moreover, feedback based methods do not necessarily require expert knowledge on modelling and control and are therefore more generally applicable. The current state-of-the-art regarding directional feedback was introduced by Celemin and Ruiz-del Solar (2015) and coined COrrective Advice Communicated by Humans (COACH). In this framework the trainer is able to correct the observed actions by providing directive advise for iterative policy updates. However, COACH employs Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, which limit the capabilities to apply the framework on higher dimensional problems due to an infeasible tuning process.This study introduces Gaussian Process Coach (GPC), an algorithm preserving COACH’s structure, but introducing Gaussian Processes (GPS) as alternative to RBF networks. Moreover, the employment of GPS allows for uncertainty estimation of the policy, which will be used for 1) inquiringhigh-informative feedback samples in an Active Learning (AL) framework, 2) introduce an Adaptive Learning Rate (ALR) that adapts the learning rate to the coarse or refine focused learning phase of the trainer and 3) establish a novel sparsification technique that is specifically designed for iterative GP policy updates. We will show by employing synthesized and human teachers that the novel algorithm outperforms COACH on every domain tested, with the most outspoken difference on higher dimensional problems. Furthermore, we will prove the independent contributions of AL and ALR.","Machine Learning; Interactive Learning; Gaussian Process; Regression; Feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Due to the growing technical readiness, the focus is now shifting from the first proof of concepts to optimizing the performance of existing plants. One promising approach is the further development of the monitoring software of geothermal plants. While the current software enables a safe operation of the plant, it does not offer any profound features regarding documentation, data validation, condition monitoring and enhanced maintenance strategies. Due to this so far unexploited potential, an improved novel software is developed within the project Monitoring by the Geothermal-Alliance Bavaria. This thesis is carried out as part of this project and aims to provide specific recommendations concerning the features and methodology of the software. In order to achieve these goals, real operating data of two geothermal plants for combined power and heat production are assessed. Resting upon the evaluation of more than 4,000 entries of the documentation system of one reference plant, a detailed assessment concerning the reliability of the plant and its main weaknesses is derived. On this basis, an advanced system for the future documentation of incident data is developed to remedy the identified limitations of the current system. An enhanced validation strategy based on the VDI 2048 guideline may significantly improve the interpretation of the process parameters’ accuracy. For instance, currently the thermal water flow rate, which is a crucial parameter for the process evaluation, cannot be measured reliably. However, the actual flow rate may be estimated accurately by implementing a validation algorithm, which assesses the heat balances for the heat exchangers. By utilizing suitable key performance indicators (KPIs) within the future software, an improved condition monitoring may be achieved. To select these KPIs, various parameters are evaluated with respect to their potential benefits. Regarding the condition monitoring, systematic parameters, such as the thermal efficiency, exhibit the difficulty of being strongly sensitive to the ambient temperature. Therefore, the actual systematic parameter should be compared to a value indicating the optimal achievable performance for the current ambient temperature and flow rate. With the dimensionless resistance factor and the systematic pump efficiency, two suitable component specific KPIs are identified for the condition monitoring of thermal water pumps and heat exchangers. However, a comparable condition monitoring of the turbine and condenser is only to a limited extend possible. In addition, the investigation of the degradation processes of the thermal water pump reveals a significant improvement potential by adapting the acidification interval to the characteristic of the performance change of the pump. Currently, acidification are carried out in an interval of six to eight months. Within this period, the thermal water flow rate reduces up to 28%, which results in significant revenue losses. The evaluation reveals that despite the additional costs for the acidification, the increases in the achievable flow rate due to shorter acidification intervals may result in a financial benefit of more than 100,000€ within a period of eight months. Finally, a general strategy for the implementation of an enhance maintenance strategy concerning the optimal acidification is elaborated.","Geothermal Energy; combined heat and power; Monitoring; Maintenance Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

OOC often includes porous membranes made of polydimethylsiloxane. The conventional method to create these membranes has drawbacks such as a limited achievable porosity. A novel approach to create porous PDMS membranes is to use micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based fabrication technologies such as etching. With this method, the porosity of the membranes can be finely tuned. Quirós-solano et al.1 used this method and created a thin (&gt;10 m) highly porous membrane and 3D scaffolds. Furthermore, their membrane could be easily transferred from its substrate to an OOC. In order to achieve this transfer, they incorporated a sacrificial layer of poly acrylic acid (PAA). The high porosity of the scaffold was created by introducing lateral gaps between the vertical pores of the scaffold. The dimensions of the gaps can be tuned by changing the etching time. However, this resulted in complete etching of the underlying layer. In order to reduce the etching time, this project is focused on the mechanism that created the lateral gaps. The contribution of bias power, chamber pressure and chuck temperature to that mechanism are investigated. With the knowledge gained from these experiments, the dimensions of the gaps were tuned by changing the aforementioned parameters.Furthermore, in this work the fabrication process of Quirós-Solano et al. is adapted to create thick (&gt;20 m) PDMS membranes.

However, the Safety Department observes an unwanted phenomenon: Occasionally, guests do not safely store their small personal belongings, such as phones, which then fall out during the ride. The result is a lost or broken phone or other personal valuable. Not properly storing personal belongings is considered undesired guest behaviour and is addressed in this thesis. <br/>The problem addressed in this thesis is twofold: First of all, the undesired guest behaviour is caused by expecting guests to make rational decisions in the distracting, emotion-laden immersive environment that is created by the Efteling. Secondly, safety measures are commonly seen as disruptive to the immersive experience created through storytelling. <br/>Experience-driven safety is proposed as a solution to this problem. This type of safety design takes guest experience, rather than a safety problem, as starting point of the design. The result is a safety solution that allows the guests to remain in the immersive experience, while directly targeting the undesired behaviour. <br/>Through ideation, the field of experience-driven safety has been explored, forcefully expanding towards safety-focussed and experience-focussed solutions. The concept that was chosen is the Kompel jacket, a wearable that allows guests to bring their items safely along during the ride of Baron 1898. It plays into the needs of the user behaviour found in the analysis phase, such as a staying close to personal belongings. Moreover, it takes an active role in the storytelling, transforming regular Efteling guests into 19th century miners (Kompels) before entering the attraction. The solution is placed in a low-pressure touchpoint – the queue area – to address guests while the distractions from the environment are still relatively low. <br/>The iterations of this design concept focussed on exploring the clarity of visual cues on the jacket. These communicate the risk of losing phones and the functionality of the jacket as a storage solution. Four different varieties of the jacket were created with communicative elements ranging from experience-focussed to safety-focussed. These were tested with potential users to find the most effective balance between creating an authentic mineworker’s jacket and creating a functional storage solution. The two varieties that aimed at an authentic mining look were considered to be confusing. The variety with the strongest safety elements was preferred and most effectively convinced the participants of safely storing their belongings. The active role the design concept takes within the storytelling assumedly allows for some leeway in adding strong safety cues without breaking the immersive experience. <br/>Guest behaviour needs to be fully uncovered to design functional products within the immersive context of the Efteling. This thesis suggests experience-driven safety as a promising method for capturing the guests’ attention and steering their behaviour within the emotionally turbulent environment of a theme park. <br","Safety design; Experience; Behavioural design; Rational decision-making; Immersive Environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a potential solution to this problem. However, the implementation of CCS seems to be challenging. The port of Rotterdam also intended to reduce its CO2 emission with the implementation of CCS. However, the first two CCS projects were not successful. When making investment decisions on innovative technological projects the TRL scale invented by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) can be useful to compare the maturity of technologies. However, for technologies in sociotechnical systems, such as the implementation of CCS, it might be useful to also consider the maturity of the institutional network. Hence, a NRL scale was proposed by Krijger (2016) and Groenendaal (2018). However, before the NRL scale can be widely used it needs first more validation. Furthermore, it is not known how the information obtained from the NRL/TRL matrix can be used to formulated strategy to stimulate the successful implementation of an infrastructural innovation. To research these two aspects a historical case study on the implementation of CCS in the port of Rotterdam was combined with extensive literature research and expert interviews. Three factors that prevented the increase of the NRL of CCS in the port of Rotterdam were identified: public debate, economic aspects and regulatory processes. In order for the actors of the institutional network to manage these exogenous factors effectively it was suggested to formulate and align nonmarket strategies regarding CCS.

Towards this goal, zebros need to be able to communicate with and localise nearby neighbours. Existing localisation solutions showed to be inadequate for the task, because they generally do not allow for localisation without existing infrastructure, do not allow scaling to a large swarm or because they rely on robot behaviour, which introduces a dependency of localisation on a specific swarming algorithm.<br/>We present a fully-localised method of localisation called Tangolation, which estimates the location of a neighbour as a range and an angle, accompanied by a confidence value from 1 (low) to 5 (high). With Tangolation, two nodes estimate each other’s next location from a range measurement using Two-Way Ranging (TWR), and the exchange of the nodes’ displacement since the last range measurement. Therefore, the two nodes only need each other to determine each other’s location as long as at least one of the two is moving, allowing Tangolation to scale well to larger swarms. No knowledge about the network topology or control over robot behaviour is needed, and communication between localising nodes only needs to happen sparsely, at a frequency of once every five seconds per neighbour. A fully distributed Time Division Multiple Acces (TDMA) protocol named Anarchic TDMA (AN-TDMA) was devised to support communcation within the robot swarm, where nodes synchronise the slot start times without the need for a special coordinating node that indicates the start of slots or frames. AN-TDMA showed to increase the reachable channel utilisation ratios by 55% to 67% compared to the ALOHA method recommended by Decawave.<br/><br/>For TWR, the Decawave DW1000 transceiver was used, and the BNO055 IMU aided in displacement measuring. Tangolation was tested in a simulation with realistic conservative estimates of the noise over the range and displacement measurements. Even using conservative noise estimates, at least 95% of the estimated location angles are within the required 22◦ of the true value. Depending on the confidence level that Tangolation reports, 65% to 84% of the angle estimates are within 10◦ of the true value, which shows that Tangolation more than meets the set requirements.","ultra-wideband; relative localisation; swarming robotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","","51.9988354,4.3713001"

For the study, a pre-existing hydro-dynamic uncoupled submarine slope numerical model, developed by Molenkamp (1999), has been modified to incorporate a fully hydro-dynamic coupled interaction between submerging water mass and submarine slope. The modified model is able to simulate transient quasi-static and dynamic phenomena up-till and including the immediate post-liquefaction behavior of submerged slopes of loose undrained homogenous fine sands in a 2 dimensional Updated Lagrangian (UL) finite element (FE) frame of work. To simulate soil behavior under dredge loading applications the model incorporates a Monot soil constitutive model and for submerging water behavior a Lagrangian expression of Navier stokes for nearly-incompressible visco-elastic, irrotational, fluid model.<br/>The study primarily addresses the effect of dynamics of submerging water on the liquefying submerged slope. The research findings suggest that the dynamic motion of submerging water barely affects the occurrence of instability. However, it may decrease the rate of post-instability liquefied flow as compared to the commonly sorted uncoupled scenario, where dynamics of submerging water mass is ignored and only constant hydrostatic pressure heads due to water level is considered at the slope interface. Moreover, the findings suggest that about 50% of the loss in the potential energy of soil is consumed by the potential energy of the submerging water at the very initial stages of post-instability and that the contribution of kinetic energy of water amounts to mere 3.4%. <br/>Next, as a secondary issue, the study also provides a valuable insight into the effect of the liquefying slope on the motion of the submerging water mass. The findings show a surface impulse wave formation post-instability, moving along the direction of landslide.

The city suffers from severe floods from time to time, finding its cause in both the Indian ocean as well as the Umgeni river. The eThekwini municipality wishes a better insight in the occurrence of these floods and searches for a structural solution to protect the coastline. The eThekwini municipality has models in operation to predict the hydraulic characteristics in the ocean and the river. However, the existing models don’t represent the reality sufficiently, since the interaction between the Indian ocean and the Umgeni river is not modelled properly yet. An analysis on the area of interest has been executed. The conclusion was drawn that the Umgeni river delta was (partly) tide-dominant, meaning that the Indian ocean imposes the downstream water level. Furthermore, the wave climate was observed, as well as a look into present coastal protections. The link between the Indian ocean and the Umgeni river has been modelled using Delft3D. Since the Indian ocean imposes a downstream boundary condition (in terms of a water level) for the Umgeni river, a backwater curve might occur. First, the link is made by extending the Delft3D-model which was present for the Indian ocean only. The model has been extended all the way up to the Inanda dam. The part of the river included in the new model is approximately 32 푘푚 long. When comparing the models output at the river mouth, at the same location as a measurement point, similar behaviour can be observed. The same phase (lag) is observed, contrary to the tidal range. The tidal range in the model differs from reality, but this is due to a lack of calibration in the amplitudes of the different tidal constituents taken into account. Hence, the renewed model seems to work, but more validation still has to be done. This was not possible yet, as there is a lack of measurement stations along the river. Next to an extension of the Delft3D model, a script has been written in Python. This script is based on the empirical fit of Bresse and shows an elegant function. The results from the function in Python and the model in Delft3D are similar in a qualitative and a quantitative way. Both the models show an influence of the Indian Ocean, reaching easily to about 12 푘푚 upstream of the river mouth. This can be explained by the mild bed slope in this part. A structural solution for the flooding on the promenade at the height of North Beach was found in the form of a seawall. The most important design demand is to protect against a high water level of a 200 year return period combined with a 50 year return period wave height. These storm conditions are input for the ocean-river model, which delivers wave characteristics at the beach front, linking the structural design to the ocean-river model. After a pre-selection on design options, a Multi Criteria Analysis is carried out for the remaining eight design options. Grading is done based on criteria, representing the viewpoints of the many stakeholders involved and leading to a highest grading of a seawall in combination with an emergency barrier. Following, the water-retaining height for a vertical wall is determined. Given the the ground level height of the promenade to be 푀푆퐿 + 2.2 푚 and a total water-retaining height of 푀푆퐿 + 2.944 푚 this leads a practical construction height of 0.80 푚. Due to the limited height a reinforced concrete seawall is designed with emergency barriers for the beach entrances. The emergency barriers are designed of pinewood. Additionally, in order the fit properly in the surroundings, an integrated design is added with features like benches, thatch umbrellas and plants to disguise the construction and protect the Golden Mile in style.","coastal defense; Delft 3D; Structural analysis; seawall; emergency barrier","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","MDP266",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Recently, Offshore Wind Turbines (OWT) have attracted great attention in an effort to make a shift from fossil-based energy sources towards an enhanced sustainable and renewable energy production. In order to achieve the renewables targets and reduce the cost of wind energy, OWTs are consistently increasing in size. Therefore, research has targeted the optimization of OWT design. For many years, System Identification has played a central role in obtaining the actual modal properties of existing structures. Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) is a subset of these technique that applies on measurement data obtained from a structure loaded by ambient excitation. In the case of an OWT, such methods would be highly important in validating and/or updating the design and monitoring the structural health of the structure, which would potentially lead into lifetime extension. In practice, using OMA techniques on operating OWT is not a straightforward procedure. Most of these techniques assume that the excitation is a white-noise process, which is not the case when waves and operational loads (e.g. rotational sampling) are present. Additionally, the system itself is considered to be Linear Time-Invariant. Unfortunately, the modal properties of the system are highly affected by the varying rotor speed and in general do violate the LTI assumptions. Given these challenges, the use-ability of existing methods need to be further investigated through application on OWTs under different operational conditions. Also, it is vital to asses and if possible eliminate the impact of the limitations related to loading on the identification. Thus, a benchmark study of OMA algorithms has been performed on simulated data obtained from two models. The first model is a simplified OWT numerical model in Matlab, which can be used to validate the algorithms, and the second is the NREL 5-MW baseline offshore wind turbine in FAST that was used to simulate multiple different operational conditions. Using the simulated responses, Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA), Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI), Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) Least-Squares Complex Frequency-domain (LSCF) estimator and Transmissibility-based Operational Modal Analysis (TOMA) were examined. Through this study the robustness of the algorithms against harmonic excitation and measurement noise were investigated, providing the user with guidelines. In the application on simulated data obtained from FAST, the results showed that all the algorithms were able to derive several stable modes, even when theoretically fundamental assumptions are violated. In general, the algorithms performed better for low wind speeds, while at high wind speeds they leaded in poorer identification. The greatest deviation compared to analytically obtained modal properties was observed in the damping ratios of the flapwise blade bending modes, where none of the algorithms was able to obtain such large damping ratios (&gt;30%). However, most of them were still able to obtain two fore-aft tower modes and an accurate damping estimation. TOMA did remove the influence of external loading from the identification, but faced difficulties in obtaining blade modes. Finally, this benchmark study revealed the strengths and weaknesses of each technique when the core assumptions are violated.","System Identification; Operational Modal Analysis; Eigensystem Realization Algorithm; Stochastic Subspace Identification; Frequency Domain Decomposition; Least Squares Complex Frequency; Transmissibility-based Operational Modal Analysis; Offshore wind turbine; Operational conditions; OMA; SSIERA; SSI; FDD; LSCF; TOMA; benchmark study; Wind loading; rotational sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","52.006469, 4.359825"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In the framework of the High Luminosity LHC project at CERN, the need for further incorporation of evaluation of radiation damage into the design of beam intercepting devices at CERN is described and the risks of radiation damage in high energy applications are summarized. Radiation damage can be an important topic in high energy applications where doses to materials can accumulate up to the point where they start impacting device functionality and lifetime. The context of radiation damage at CERN provides unique circumstances that are not easily investigated experimentally. Simulation is an excellent alternative to study the behavior of particle transport in matter. For the LHC injector upgrade, proton beam energy levels, entering the Proton Synchrotron, are increased from 1.4 to 2 GeV. Using FLUKA Monte Carlo Simulations, the new energy deposition from the protons traversing a 2 cm thick tungsten plate is calculated. The proton beam is not entirely stopped, but the beam is sufficiently diluted to be outside of machine acceptance. Meaning, it can no longer be accelerated further. The energy deposition in the tungsten creates thermal stress waves. To evaluate the suitability of an alternative material, a thermo mechanical design of the plate is made in ANSYS with two different materials. Tungsten and the tungsten heavy alloy Inermet 180 (W-3.5%wt Ni-1.5%wt Cu) interactions with three different proton beams are evaluated. These beams are foreseen for Proton Synchrotron operation during high luminosity LHC. For single beam impact and normal operation mode the maximum temperature is 84 –C. For steady state, accidental impact, temperatures of 430 –C are reached. The maximum stresses are 145 MPa in Inermet 180 and 135 MPa in tungsten. Due to its brittle nature, it is advised to refrain from using tungsten within this stress range. To evaluate the radiation damage, the DPA and gas production are calculated, using the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations. The peak DPA is 0.0035 and the peak gas production is 3.5 appm for hydrogen and 2.5 appm for helium. The average DPA production shows a clear maximum of DPAs just after the centre of the plate (1.18 cm depth from the surface). The maximum average hydrogen occurs after 1.2 cm and the maximum helium occurs more to the surface (0.2 cm depth). The peak concentrations are not entirely at the same location though this is where there would be higher risk of agglomerate formation just after the cascade. Since the peaks don’t overlap the most critical radiation damage is likely to occur in an intermediate point.","radiation; Tungsten; Materials; finite element analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; CERN; engineering; Science","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

A contract can be used to compensate the user for the experienced discomfort. Literature on these contracts is lacking and the behaviour of EV user to these contracts is unknown. This study aims to close this gap. Data is collected by means of a web survey and evaluated with a multinomial logit model. It is shown that the difference in expected demand for price- and volume-based contracts is minimal. In addition, three contract elements can solely increase demand for V2G but require high levels. More value is created when a combination of these three contract elements is used. It would be valuable to understand how and where V2G can provide value. To do so, the results of this study can be used as input for a dynamic model that evaluates day-to-day electricity supply and demand.","Battery Electric Vehicles; Contracts; Vehicle-to-grid; stated choice experiment; electricity grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The industry is interested in these reviews, and wants to know about which topics their clients write, such that the producers can improve products on specific aspects. Topic models can extract the main topics from large data sets such as the review data. One of these is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a hierarchical Bayesian topic model that retrieves topics from text data sets in an unsupervised manner. The method assumes that a topic is assigned to each word in a document (review), and aims to retrieve the topic distribution for each document, and a word distribution for each topic. Using the highest probability words from each topic-word distribution, the content of each topic can be determined, such that the main subjects can be derived. Three methods of inference to obtain the topic and word distributions are considered in this research: Gibbs sampling, Variational methods, and Adam optimization to find the posterior mode. Gibbs sampling and Adam optimization have the best theoretical foundations for their application to LDA. From results on artificial and real data sets, it is concluded that Gibbs sampling has the best performance in terms of robustness and perplexity. In case the data set consists of reviews, it is desired to extract the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) from the documents, in addition to the topics. Therefore, an extension to LDA that uses sentiment words and sentence structure as additional input is proposed: LDA with syntax and sentiment. In this model, a topic distribution and a sentiment distribution for each review are retrieved. Furthermore, a word distribution per topic-sentiment combination can be estimated. With these distributions, the main topics and sentiments in a data set can be determined. Adam optimization is used as inference method. The algorithm is tested on simulated data and found to work well. However, the optimization method is very sensitive to hyperparameter settings, so it is expected that Gibbs sampling as inference method for LDA with syntax and sentiment performs better. Its implementation is left for further research.","Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Topic modelling; Sentiment analysis; Review analysis; Opinion Mining; Hierarchical Bayesian inference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The bad politics and forthcoming economic situation of Zimbabwe has led to instability and dramatic inflation over the last decade. This has resulted in a terrible investment climate, limited aid received from foreign countries and an outflow of educated population. Exploitation of water resources by industries, mines and urban centres located close to the rivers resulted in a decline in the quality and quantity of the environment. Especially the Manyame River Catchment, that supplies the capital Harare and flows north into the Zambezi, has been greatly affected. The catchment suffers from several pollution sources such as agriculture, mining, industrial dumps and wastewater inflow. Poor management and the deterioration of the drinking water supply and sanitation infrastructure has led to the recent outbreak of cholera. Although the Manyame Catchment has enough water, another main issue is the spatial distribution of its water resources. In some areas there are dams, but no farmers to utilize the water. In other areas farmers are desperate for water, but don’t receive any. The increasing dry spells due to climatic changes, has had disastrous effects for the non-irrigating smallholder farmers dependent on their maize production for survival, while floods created by the backwater curve from the Cahora Bassa Dam in the Lower Manyame sub-catchment have washed away the livestock, crops and infrastructure on the fertile areas in the flood plains. The situation stresses for better awareness, monitoring and guardance of the water resources. This will provide information for improvements in the planning, policy and management of water resources. Although the history of Zimbabwean governance would suggest it is purely acting on crisis management, proactive planning would be preferable to the alternative; to wait for the aquifers to dry up only for people to realize the real value of water.","Zimbabwe; Water Resources Management; Manyame Catchment; flooding; drought; Water quality; groundwater; GIS; dam management","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

These moons are currently a hot topic within the science community as their interiors might include oceans consisting of liquid water. These oceans could provide life, but at the moment little is known about the exact composition and structure of these interiors. Only Earth based observations and a few fly-by’s have been performed to measure the characteristics of these moons. The JUICE mission will provide more detailed information on the moons through fly-by’s. This thesis research will focus on Ganymede as JUICE will be the first human-developed satellite to orbit thismoon. Ganymede stands out as a potential scientific target due to several specific reasons; the most remarkable being it’s intrinsic magnetic field. Only two other solid bodies within the Solar System generate such a magnetic dipole field (Earth andMercury). The complex interactions of this magnetic fieldwith Jupiter’smagnetic field are unique and could provide a lot of new knowledge when studied. Measurements from Galileo and the Hubble space telescope suggest that a subsurface layer of (saline) water is present within the moons interior. Saline water could be a good conductor of electricity, generating the magnetic field. The magnetic field of Ganymede could also point towards a complex core, which is another possibility for the generation of this field. It could be that the core of Ganymede consists of liquid, iron rich elements which generate and maintain this magnetic field. Unfortunately, current models of the gravitational potential field and the interior of Ganymede are still uncertain. A precise gravitationalmodel of Ganymede could provide a lot of information about this interior. An orbiter or in-situ probes are required to achieve high precision gravitational potential field models. JUICE is expected to obtain a model of Ganymede’s gravitational potential field of at least degree and order 15. This thesis will provide insight in how different possible internal density distributions of Ganymede influence the gravitational potential field of the moon. Thisway,when JUICE obtains more information on the gravitational potential field of Ganymede, variations within this field can directly be utilized to determine what interior aspects could cause these variations. From 44 billion 1D homogeneous models considered during this research, only 260 adhered to current known characteristics of Ganymede. Certain elements and water phases are present in all models: a pure iron or iron-sulfide core, a silicon mantle, an ice VI layer together with an liquid ocean and a outer crust consisting of Ice Ih. Dependent on the exact layer thicknesses within a model, intermediate ice phases, ice III and V, can also be present. Layer correlations between the 260 models were analyzed and fourteen models where selected for further research. These models were combined with different boundary and density variations to obtain different 3D heterogeneous models. Gravitational potential simulations for spherical harmonics coefficients up to order/degree 48 were performed. It was found that several relations exist between gravitational potential field data and internal density distributions within Ganymede. If one can effectively correct gravitational potential field signals for measurable components within Ganymede’s interior, several sets of internal structures emerge. Furthermore, taking into account the established limitations and correlations between layers, the gradient of the gravitational signal power over spherical harmonics degree can be directly related to the thickness of an interiors ocean. Several distinguishable models show that the presence of ice III, and to a lesser extent ice V, increase the gravitational signal power of a model. When combined with the correlations found between internal layers during this research, one could even establish an accurate first order approximate of Ganymede’s internal composition. These results, together with measurements performed by JUICE, will provide numerous new insights on Ganymede’s frozen enigma.","Ganymede; JUICE; Gravitational potential field; Internal density distributions; Degree variance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Exploration","",""

The prime focus of this study was to gain this understanding via data-driven insights. Conventionally, the design of a new material is carried out by making educated guesses about the design parameters and subsequently performing expensive and time-consuming experiments. In this work computational simulations were utilized to create databases of mechanical responses. These databases are later used to model the relationship between the inputs and the output response. This generated the issue of how and what method to use to effectively determine this relationship. This work explored state-of-the-art machine learning methods to enhance a recently proposed data-driven framework with thegoal of designing a new super-compressible metamaterial with large energy absorption. Importantly, the data-driven design process included the influence of manufacturing imperfections on the mechanical response of the metamaterial.The study revealed that by tuning the design parameters, significantly different mechanical response of the structure was achievable. The proposed learning model has enabled mapping of the influence of design parameters in the design space, moreover the sensitivity to those parameters varied across the design space. The increased energy absorption has been attributed to the resistance to bending of the main load carrying components of the design. It was demonstrated that the number of those components and the elastic modulus were scaling factors for the quantities of interest. Based on the insightsgained, a unit cell metamaterial design with significantly improved energy absorbing capability was proposed.","Metamaterials; Machine Learning; Design of Experiments; Gaussian process; Energy absorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Like many materials producers, these efforts start within their own walls; looking for ways to re-purpose production residuals. Aside from disposal costs, the motivation for this project was to determine more sustainable mindset in a production of materials with a non-renewable origin.

Similarly, the energy invested into the material make it a potentially high value residual. Means of leveraging inherent value were explored in this thesis.The material landscape provides a plethora of (re-)processing possibilities. A selection was explored in order to determine feasibility of implementation within current technological and economic bounds. This offered insights into the readiness of these producers to work in collaboration with DSM Dyneema in a circular value chain.

In terms of the circular economy - where goals are expressed in terms of utility and value retention of materials- this project provided a unique opportunity in product design. The Material Driven Design method (Karana et al.,2015) was used as a framework to guide the search for user value through material experience. Where traditionally product design is lead by a user problem and solutions are embodied with appropriate materials and processes, this method allowed this thinking to be inverted and guided the design to consider the various aspects of material experience before designing a product. A material experience vision is defined and guides the design of a final product that encompasses experiential/technical properties of the material and accounts for circular product considerations.

In addition to its protective function, the Hondsbossche Dunes stimulate ecological habitat development in the coastal area, in line with Ecoshape's 'Building with Nature'-approach. Its morphologic development is monitored to simulate the morphological response to marine processes and aeolian sediment transport, and to determine the optimal profile for dune growth and nature development.The monitoring program of Ecoshape studied the volume change of the beach and the dunes. The decrease of sediment volume on the beach is not equal to the increase of sediment volume on the dunes. The hypothesis is that the remaining sediment must stem from the intertidal zone and the shoreface. The research objective of this study is to investigate the contribution of sediment supply and marine processes in the intertidal zone to changes in morphology and bed composition in the beach and dune. The results of this data analysis show that sediment is transported from the intertidal zone to the shoreface in the north and south of the Hondsbossche Dunes. This behaviour is different from the middle of the domain, where sediment is transported from the shoreface to the intertidal zone. The direction of cross-shore sediment transport between the shoreface and the intertidal zone may depend on the crest level of sandbars in the shoreface: The sandbars in the middle of the Hondsbossche Dunes break more short waves than those in the north and south, which causes 'freeing' of long waves and net landward sediment transport. The modelling study suggests that wave runup and the presence of soil moisture reduce aeolian sediment transport from the intertidal zone to the beach, because grains in the intertidal zone are immobile when they are moist. This reduction results in increased erosion at the dry part of the beach, because the wind picks up sediment from the beach instead of the intertidal zone. The soil moisture content also significantly coarsens the bed composition in the intertidal zone, because the difference in threshold for aeolian transport between fine and coarse grains becomes larger. Hydraulic mixing does not contribute to significant morphological changes in the intertidal zone, but redistributes grains on the bed of the intertidal zone toward its initial distribution by stirring up the bed of the intertidal zone. These marine processes only affect dune growth if aeolian sediment transport is supply limited, which is mainly the case for Profile 2 north and Profile 4. Aeolian sediment transport in Profile 3 south is mainly transport limited, because the dune growth volume in most simulations is equal to the dune growth capacity following the formulation of Bagnold (1941). It seems that dune growth in this profile is less affected by marine processes. These results are likely to be related to the finer bed composition and wider beach at Profile 3 south.","Hondsbossche dunes; Mega nourishment; Marine sediment transport; Aeolian sediment transport; AeoLiS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.752175, 4.645605"

Such flowline-riser systems are used to transport the oil and/or gas from the location of the wells to a production platform, where the fluids might be separated into single phases. Slug flow conditions imposefluctuations in the production rate, which may lead to the flooding of the separators, trips of compressors or pumps, and to increased loads on the supports of the pipeline and piping sections at the production platform.Therefore, measures have to be taken to mitigate the slugging, which can be a reduction of the production rate, making adjustments to the pipeline system, or adding surfactants to the flow. For vertical flow in production wells, the use of surfactants is a proven technology. Here the creation of a foam through adding asurfactant can increase the production life time, as the accumulation of liquid, which typically occurs when the reservoir pressure has decreased at the end of field life, is prevented. Far less is known yet about the effect of using surfactants for the mitigation of hydrodynamic slugs in a nearly horizontal flowline or the mitigation of severe slugs in risers. From a previous Master’s Thesis project by Pronk [1], in which lab experiments were carried out in the same flowline-riser facility as used in the present study, it was concluded that growing slugs could be suppressed by adding a surfactant to create foam. The surfactants also influence the characteristics of the severe slugging cycle, but they are not able to fully suppress it. Re-analysis of the measurement data by Pronk hasturned out that instead of growing slugs, severe sluggingwas measured and therefore that severe slugging can be suppressed using surfactants and no conclusions can be drawn on growing slugs or hydrodynamic slugsfrom her research. There is limited literature on the effect of adding a surfactant to hydrodynamic slug flow in horizontal flowlines, but there are some indications that hydrodynamic slugs can be suppressed, though requiring a higher concentration of the surfactant than vertical flow. Suppressing slug flow using surfactants should eliminate the fluctuations in the flow and can lead to a lower pressure drop. For this research experiments have been carried out in the Severe Slugging Loop at the Shell Technology Centre Amsterdam. This flow loop consists of a horizontal flowline of 50 m, a U-turn and a 15 m section. From there onward the pipe starts declining at an angle of -2.54° over a length of 35 m. Thereafter there is a short horizontal section of 5 m before arriving at the base of the riser, which has a height of 16.8 m and an internal diameter of 32 mm. The other sections have an internal diameter of 50.8 mm. For this research the configuration was used where air and water are connected through a Y-sprout at the start of the flow line. The air is supplied as pressurized air of 6 barg. The water is supplied by a pump, and it is separated from the airat a section at the top of the riser and recirculated through the system. The used surfactant is the household detergent Dreft. At several points along the flowline and riser the flow conditions have been measured using pressure indicators and at two locations along the flowline the pressure difference over 3 m has been measured using differential pressure indicators. Through the inspection windowat the end of the flowline the flowis recorded by using a GoPro camera. Furthermore, over a distance of 40mthe acoustic energy of the flow has been measured by a Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system. The DASmeasurements have been used to determine the flow behaviour of the flow. In the case of slug flow, the velocity of the slugs was deduced from the DAS data. Adding a 2000 ppm concentration of the surfactant Dreft Original has resulted in the full suppression of hydrodynamic slug flow. This has been verified using the pressure data, the video data and the DAS data in combination with the velocity tracking tool. The waves that were present without surfactant are decreased to a much smaller wave height when the surfactant is added; therefore, the flow pattern is changed from slug flow to wavy stratified flow. The severe slugging cycle can also be suppressed using 2000 ppm concentration of the surfactant Dreft Original. At the same flow conditions, the gas is able to lift more liquid through the riser. The measurements by the DAS system were quantified using a velocity tracking algorithm. The measurement data can now be used to accurately measure the slug velocity and to determine whether slug flow or stratified flow is present in the system. This measurement method is ready for scale-up. When the concentration of surfactant is sufficient to suppress slug flow, the flow can be described from visual observations as a threephase flow, containing gas, foam and liquid. The foam absorbs the stresses imposed by the other phases, because of its non-Newtonian fluid properties. The waves are no longer able to grow until they reach the top of the pipe and are diminished into slow moving dampened waves of the foam layer.","Surfactants; Multiphase flows; Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Slugging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isoplanatic correction on the excitation- and fluorescence signals is commonly applied in traditional adaptive optics by using a Deformable Mirror (DM), but ideally, anisoplanatic corrections should be applied because anisoplanatic wavefront aberrations are common in reality. The problem of correcting the fluorescence anisoplanatically remains unsolved in AO, but recently a method was proposed that allows for anisoplanatic correction on the excitation signal. This task requires the solution of a complicated optimization problem, one that has so far been solved with a simple local search algorithm, and a better algorithm can be developed to further improve the method.

The worldwide estimated trend shows an increase of 150 million freight vehicles and an increase of 240 million passenger vehicles. The growth of both vehicle classes will have a major impact on the road network and the roads will become congested. Especially in dense urban environments with many intersections. Further, trucks have a detrimental impact on traffic flows, especially at intersections, because of their slow dynamics and large size. In addition, a stopping truck results in higher emissions and fuel consumption compared to a car. However, today’s traffic controllers are not capable of optimizing traffic flow at intersections based on classification of different vehicles. Therefore, it would be beneficial to all vehicles involved if the number of stops for trucks would be reduced to a minimum, by servicing each vehicle class in a different way.<br/>Throughout this research the focus is to develop a signalized intersection controller which is able to reduce the number of stops for trucks, while maintaining an equal level of service for the other modes of transport. Extensive literature studies provided important insights into the development of signalized intersection controllers. A selection of the techniques found in the literature is used to develop a new truck signal priority controller design. The basic idea is to use a weighted traffic light schedule in combination with priority weights to enable truck signal priority. The design is evaluated in a case study and simulated for multiple configurations. This leads to an overview of the performance in terms of the number of stops and vehicle delay. <br/>From the results several conclusions can be drawn on the optimal weight configuration, which is compared to a state-of-the-art model predictive intersection controller. The results showed an reduction of the total number of stops by 751 and total vehicle delay by 304 minutes for trucks over a week (26,6% and 20,4% respectively). While, the total number of stops and total vehicle delay for cars increased, by 155 stops and 201 minutes (0,1% and 0,3% respectively). However, the overall total number of stops and total vehicle delay were reduced by 596 stops and 103 minutes (0,42% and 0,16% respectively). It can be concluded that the proposed truck signal priority controller design can reduce the number of stops for trucks at a signalized intersection, while maintaining the overall traffic flow at least as good as a state-of-the-art model predictive intersection controller.","Signalized intersection controller; Truck Signal Priority; Simulation; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-31","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Until now, most research on renewable energy production is concentrated on increased efficiency and capacity and less attention is paid to possible secondary effects of the renewable energy production. The composite waste from wind turbine blades is becoming an increasingly important environmental issue for which innovative end-of-life (EoL) solutions are needed. This study aims to investigate to what extent the recycling of glass fibre reinforced composites from EoL wind turbine blades (WTB) by the means of a pyrolysis process can create environmental benefits within the context of the Port of Rotterdam (PoR) in the coming 5 to 10 years. An explorative study provided a better understanding of the concepts based on combination of academic knowledge (desk study) and practical experiences (field study) and was used to define three hypothetical EoL scenarios for WTB including landfill, cement-kiln and pyrolysis. A comparison analysis considering these scenarios showed that pyrolysis could deliver both environmental and economic benefits, providing that the majority of the pyrolysis products find high- value secondary applications and that the combustion of the pyrolysis oil as fuel oil is avoided. Although the extent of the environmental benefits that could be created by the implementation of pyrolysis remain uncertain, the presented results indicate that pyrolysis could form an early step in a larger, long- term transitional movement towards a carbon-neutral and circular economy. Based on these findings the PoR is recommended to adopt a participating or pioneering role in this transition, enabling technology optimization for pyrolysis and investing in cooperation with a network of (future) stakeholders","Circular economy; Port of Rotterdam; Wind energy; Composites; recycling; Reuse; Wind turbine blades","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","Circular design Lab",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Agility is increasingly being used in the public sector as its adaptive approach through short-cycled development could allow public services to keep up with developments in technology and the complex problems contemporary societies face. There are, however, some dilemmas at play when it comes to agility and the public sector’s transparency and stability for accountability. Furthermore, agile projects appear to be less predictable and more likely to go off track. The main paradox of agility is that even though it appears to be at odds with control, it is required for agility to be effective. Besides, public sector bureaucracies come with their own control mechanisms which theoretically conflict with agility. The research explores these phenomena by considering how control over agile processes in the public sector can be enhanced through the use of control mechanisms. By using an explorative and single case study approach with validation sessions the research combines qualitative data from theoretical and practical findings which are analyzed through a Revised Levers of Control framework to provide recommendations for controlling public sector agility. It indicates that the agile process itself is the main means of control for which an extensive list of mechanisms is provided of both strategic and operational nature. Besides, the vast presence of interfaces in the public sector increases complexity while external deadlines and tight budgets provide a clear desire for planning as control. A main recommendation therefore consists of mechanisms to be used to perform planning within agility. The research also showcases that types of bureaucratic control can facilitate or are even required for the agile process to function when it comes to centralized strategic visions on priorities and an organizational vision on implementation of agility. Overall, this implies control over agility in the public sector to be a balancing act between mechanisms associated with ‘pure agility’ and with public sector bureaucracies. Further empirical research into the use and implications of proposed control mechanisms and presence of interfaces in practice would help in enriching the findings and provide more insight into the requirements of different types of public sector organizations to control their agile processes.","agility; public sector; bureaucracy; control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-19","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

We explore this through a machine learning model for a case-study area of the Lower Shire River Basin in Malawi. Several experiments with different sets of predictors and predictands are conducted to test which data adds to the skill and at what spatial detail. As predictors, the following agro-climatic indices are used: cumulative precipitation, soil moisture anomalies,mland surface temperature anomalies, El Niño Southern Oscillation in July and four different dry spell categories within the growing season (0-2 days dry spell, 3-4 day dry spell, 5-10 day dry spell and larger than 10 day dry spell). As drought predictand, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the vegetation optical depth<br/>(VOD) in March are used, the latter obtained from satellite data company VanderSat. The final set of predictors and predictands is narrowed down based on which data is available and with which quality (timeliness, reliability, accuracy).

This decrease the comfortable walking speed and increases the metabolic cost of walking in amputees, as more than half of the positive work performed during able-bodied gait is done during the powered plantar flexion at the ankle joint. A possible contribution to enhance push-off is to utilize passive prostheses that can store and release energy by means of springs. This restores the push-off partially, enabling a higher self-selected walking speed and a lower metabolic cost. <br/>Effective energy release at push-off is not just a matter of higher energy storage, but the release also needs to be well timed. Controlling the release rate of energy in current passive prosthetic feet is often constrained due to the unnatural ankle joint mechanics caused by simple spring behavior. The Variable Stiffness Prosthetic Ankle-Foot (VSPA-Foot) of Shepherd and Rouse (2017) tackles this problem by using a cam and follower transmission to decouple the leaf spring mechanics from the mechanics of the ankle joint. The cam profile determines the mechanics of the ankle joint, whereas the stiffness of the spring determines the energy stored for a particular deflection. Despite achieving this control of ankle mechanics, the VSPA still acts spring-like. This means that energy is stored and released in the exact same manner. The purpose of this study was to decouple the energy storage and release characteristics. A prototype was build that uses two cam-profiles in order to do so. These cam profiles can differ in the way they store and release energy, as long as the total energy stored or released is at most equal (thereby not violating the laws of thermodynamics). By using multiple cam profiles, energy can be stored in the initial part of the stance phase. Rather than returning this energy instantaneously, it is released during late stance to enhance the push-off. This is a continuous approach to the energy recycling concept originally proposed by Collins and Kuo (2010). Implementing the energy recycling concept in the VSPA foot redesign removed the hysteresis losses found whilst using a single cam profile and showed net positive work done during the push-off phase.","machine design; prosthesis; assistive technology; variable stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Until a few decades ago, chromate conversion coatings were the most common conversion coatings in the industry owing to their exceptional performance in this regard. However, the adverse effects associated with hexavalent chromium as found in chromate conversion coatings and certain corrosion inhibitor pigments are now widely known. As a result, various initiatives have been deployed around the globe to restrict and regulate the use of hexavalent chromium. Finding suitable alternatives for chromate conversion coatings has therefore become one of the most pertinent research topics of the moment in the field of corrosion protection.<br/>A number of chromium-free conversion coatings have been found to show comparable corrosion resistance relative to chromate conversion coatings. For galvanized steel, conversion coatings based on zirconium and titanium have been found to be suitable alternatives to chromium. Organic additives may be incorporated in these conversion treatment solutions for galvanized steel to enhance the adhesion of organic coatings to the substrate. The effect of a given organic additive is highly dependent on the surface composition of the substrate as has been observed with the polymers polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) on hot-dip galvanized steel and a Zn-Mg-Al alloy coated steel studied in this project.<br/>The durability of corrosion protection may also be enhanced by embedding corrosion inhibitors in the organic coating. An increased concern for sustainability and environmental-friendliness, has resulted in a global effort toward developing and using corrosion inhibitors which are safe for the environment and for human health. The electrochemical behaviour of galvanized steel in electrolytes with green inhibitors based on silicates, phosphates, zinc oxide and calcium at various concentrations are investigated.<br/>This project considers a multi-layer corrosion protection coating system comprising a conversion layer based on Zr/Ti cations and adhesion-enhancing polymer additives, and an organic coating embedded with 'green' corrosion inhibitors. The overarching aim is to investigate and establish new knowledge regarding the effect of polymer additives in conversion coatings on the adhesion of organic coatings as well as the identification of suitable green corrosion inhibitors. The outcome is an indication of which types of polymer additives and corrosion inhibitors work best for the two substrates tested – MagiZinc® and hot-dip galvanized steel, both supplied by Tata Steel BV.<br","corrosion protection; chromium-free; organic coating adhesion; galvanized steel; green corrosion inhibitors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Royal IHC is a reliable supplier of dredge vessels. Trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD) is one of the company’s main products for port maintenance. A dredge operator is doing all the dredge control task in the dredge operator cockpit. The human-machine interface (HMI) of the dredge operator cockpit is developed on a perpetual basis. The system become more and more complex. Therefore, novice operators need to spend longer time in training in order to be fully efficient. The latest interface technology augmented reality has attracted attention. Royal IHC is interested in head-mounted devices, especially HoloLens. Royal IHC sees the potential of HoloLens in terms of supporting the control tasks of dredge operators, but this assumption still needs to be proven by operational research. Therefore, the essence of this project is an explorative study, which is targeted to discover if there are possibilities of HoloLens to support dredge control work of novice operators. After technology research and user research, some tasks are selected and concpets are created.The core of the concepts is to extract this information and provide it in a more user-friendly way. The operator can then directly see the essential information through the HoloLens and will not be disturbed by other information, which is not relevant at the moment. The operator does not need to switch attention between screens and real world either. However, there are two different perspective for this concept: the first person’s perspective and the third person’s perspective.The concepts were tested with IHC employees and students. It is found that: Compared with the current system, HoloLens applications can give the information in a more straightforward way. Compared with the current system, simplified signals with its spatial property in HoloLens applications are easier to understand. Thus, compared with the current system, HoloLens applications require less workload. With the third person’s perspective, operators could have a more transparent overview of the situation than with the first person’s perspective. It is more easily for novice operators to learn the use of HoloLens applications than people without any dredge knowledge.","HoloLens; Augmented Reality; Dredger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, side effects associated with artificial ventilation, including atrophy, require a cyclic interruption of automatic ventilation so that infants can develop and train their respiratory muscles (the so-called weaning from ventilation).<br/>However, the criteria for judging the readiness and progression of the detachment from ventilation are unsatisfactory since they rely on the subjective judgments of the clinicians.<br/>As a consequence, a research project in collaboration between TU Delft, the DEMCON BV (a Dutch mechatronics engineering company) and the Erasmus Medical Center of Rotterdam was carried out to look for an objective measure, provided with visual feedback, to give indications of the respiratory fatigue of newborns to the clinicians, also referred as work of breathing (WOB). This research revealed that the analysis of the diaphragmatic electromyography (dEMG) is a non-invasive tool that can be used to measure the WOB. As a result, three WOB detection algorithms named peak-to-peak (P2P), differential-peak-to-peak (DP2P) and area-under-the-curve (AUC) were developed. The relevance of these algorithms consists in extracting the WOB information from the dEMG and giving direct visual feedback to the clinicians.<br/>Moreover, since often weaning from ventilation is impaired by the advent of adverse events such as apnea and brachicardia, two algorithms were implemented to detect such complications as well. \newline\newline<br/>Before starting the actual research, some background work was carried out for the DEMCON BV.

The relevance of this work consists in allowing better communication between DEMCON and any other professional who wants to collaborate with them since Simulink is a popular software while Polybench is not.

The system is formed by Purkinje cells (PC), the Deep Cerebellar Nucleus (DCN) and Inferior Olive (IO). Its input activate the PC which produces simple (SS) and complex spikes (CS). The latter induced by the IO. The oscillatory nature of the production of CS seems to play a role in motor control and motor timing. In addition, CS modulate the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synaptic plasticity. IO synchrony can help the system learn timing with the PF input as the timing context. Furthermore, the level of synchronization of the coupled IO cells could determine the function of complex spikes, implying that the olivocerebellum is capable of switching between modes of learning by changing the level of synchronization. In this paper we introduced a novel computational model to analyze the role of coupling of the IO and long-term plasticity at the PF-PC synapse in the response of the olivocerebellar loop. It is a resonant system formed by a detailed IO model and Integrate-and-Fire PC and DCN models, with physiologically observed firing frequencies. The IO cells are modeled as coupled oscillators and plasticity is incorporated through a timing dependent specialization of Hebbian learning (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity or STDP). Two different simulations are performed both for the coupled and uncoupled scenarios. The STDP is used only in the second type of simulation. Both types of simulations use the same noisy input, which is applied twice during the second type of simulation. The second half of the latter is interpreted as the response of a trained loop. Results show that in the presence of coupling the correlation of the firing rates distribution decreases. This indicates that for the coupled scenario PCs are separating the patterns, while for the uncoupled scenarios the noise is encoded more robustly. Furthermore, a drop in the noise current (inhibiting the PC) leads to an IO spike at about 100 milliseconds later. After training, however, the loop recognizes a drop in the noise and depresses the synapses avoiding an increase in the firing rate of the PC. This effect is more noticeable in the coupled scenario. In conclusion, the model shows that plasticity can lead to learning, and that this process is more efficient for a coupled system.","Olivocerebellar System; Purkinje Cell; Long-Term Plasticity; Complex Spikes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kooij, Julian (graduation committee); Alonso Mora, Javier (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","To be able to understand the dynamic driving environment, an autonomous vehicle needs to predict the mo- tion of other traffic participants in the driving scene. Motion prediction can be done based on experience and recently observed series of past events, and entails reasoning about probable outcomes with these past ob- servations. Aspects that influence driving behavior comprise many factors, such as general driving physics, infrastructure geometry, traffic rules, weather and so on. Models that are used today are incapable of including many of these aspects. These deep learning models often rely heavily on the past driven trajectory as an information source for future prediction. Sparsely, some work has been done to include interaction between vehicles or some infrastructural features to the model. The lack of information regarding the driving scene can be seen as a missed opportunity, because it is a use- ful feature source to predict the motion of a vehicle. Especially when a map of the driving scene is available, reliable information regarding the road layout can be extracted. In this thesis, a model architecture is sought that is aware of the interaction between vehicles, and that un- derstands the geometry of the roads in the scene. Importantly, map information regarding the driving scene should be used as the primary source of information regarding the road geometry. First, a baseline deep learning model is constructed, that can generate predictions based on the past observed trajectory. To add interaction features to the model, a social pooling module is introduced. The social pooling method allows to efficiently include the driving behavior of other vehicles in the scene. To introduce reliable, map-based road information to the model, two novel methods are proposed. In the first, the predictions from a model are used to extract features in a map. These features describe the road scene around the predicted location, and are used to update these predictions. In the second method, the semantic map is only used to extract a road segment ahead of the vehicle. A road-RNN is introduced to con- struct features regarding the road segment, and an attention mechanism to determine what part of the road segment is relevant for the predictions. These modules are referred to as road-refinement and road-attention respectively. The importance of including both road geometry and interaction methods in the model is shown by con- structing 5 different models that vary in their road-geometric and interaction awareness. A baseline deep learning model is used and extended with a road-geometry module, an interaction module, a combination of the two, or none. To test the prediction capabilities of the models, they are trained on two different datasets. The first dataset, called i80, consists of trajectory recordings from a straight highway with dense traffic. The other dataset is a curved version of the i80, called i80c, where the trajectories and road are transformed to introduce road-geometric variations in the data. The prediction performances from the models clearly show the importance of both interaction-aware and road-geometry aware modeling. The road-refinement and road-attention models outperform the road-agnostic baseline model on the i80c data, showing better understanding of the road layout. Comparison between these models learns that the road-attention model is more effective for road-geometry inclusion. Additionally, the performance increase for interaction-aware models compared to the baseline clearly shows the importance of interaction in modeling on both datasets.The model that combines the interaction and road-attention modules shows outstanding prediction performance on the challenging i80c dataset compared to all other models. From the predictions it can be seen that the model understands the road layout ahead of the subject vehicle, as well as the interactive forces that are in play.","Autonomous driving; Motion prediction; Deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Max-plus algebra is studied because of its interesting properties, which make some non-linear systems in conventional algebra linear in max-plus algebra. These systems are called Max-Plus Linear (MPL) systems. This exploratory study introduces Max-Plus Linear Parameter Varying (MP-LPV) systems, systems that are not entirely linear in max-plus algebra but not that non-linear either, like LPV systems in conventional algebra. An urban railway line will be taken as an example of an MP-LPV system. Urban railway lines often operate relatively freely, with a passenger-dependent variable dwell time which can be modelled in max-plus algebra as a linear variable dependency on the arrival and departure times. It will be shown that such an MP-LPV system of an urban railway line can be rewritten to a set of linear inequalities, which can be used in an optimization framework to optimize for both minimal total passenger travel time and minimal absolute operation time. Some study cases will be shown in with it can be observed that these systems compute very rapidly, which makes a possible practical implementation interesting.

Seasonal changes were taken into consideration when carrying out the analyzes in the study from both perspectives; the load side and the energy sources. Energy efficiency is analyzed and compared across multiple types of micro grid distribution systems, and the raw data are processed by HOMER program and the results are deduced as such.<br/>The study consists of various grid configurations. Each grid configuration (AC, DC and hybrid AC/DC) is also analyzed by assuming that all three main energy sources are connected to the micro grid. The system performance is also analyzed with 50% load increase in the AC-DC hybrid network. Besides, each grid configuration was re-analyzed using multiple types wind turbine and PV panels and the results were depicted. In Rilland-Netherlands, which was the selected pilot area, solar energy technologies are not utilized sufficiently because the solar energy potential is low. Therefore, most of the energy is supplied by wind power generation systems. For this region, energy surplus produced could be stored in batteries. However, this is not an option due to the cost and technical constraints. According to the analysis results obtained via the HOMER program, the most appropriate solution is to use a hybrid micro grid whose energy source is renewable and it is Grid-Connected. In this regard, the Grid/PV/wind renewable hybrid in a hybrid AC/DC micro-grid system is the most suitable one for the selected pilot area Rilland-Netherlands.","AC micro-grid; DC micro-grid; Hybrid AC/DC micro-grid; PV Systems; Wind; Productivity analysis; Energy production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","51.44803651, 4.48036"

Direct numerical simulations of the settling of a single, two and multiple solid spheres under gravity in a square duct have been performed. The simulations involve 4 different Galileo numbers, i.e. <i>Ga</i>=144, 178, 200 and 250 for a fixed solid-to-fluid-density ratio Γ=1.5 and solid-volume fractions ranging from Φ=0.005 to Φ=0.3. It is shown that for these <i>Ga</i> the particle motions of a single particle are steady vertical, steady oblique, oblique oscillating and chaotic. In the simulations for a single particle it has been found that the observed fluctuations of the vertical particle velocity are due to particle-wall interactions. Drafting-kissing-tumbling (DKT), which is a key mechanism in the formation of particle clusters, has been observed in the two particles simulations and show that DKT initiates when the particles are almost aligned vertically and move in the same direction in the horizontal plane. DKT could occur even when the particles are several particle diameters apart.In the simulations of multiple particles only the steady vertical, steady oblique and oblique oscillating regimes have been considered and the particles are initially randomly distributed in the computational domain. It is shown for these regimes that for solid-volume fractions Φ≤0.01 an increase of the settling velocity of the suspensions compared to the value of a single particle is observed for all regimes, while for higher solid-volume fractions a hindered settling effect occurs. The statistics of a spatial parameter related to the angle of a particle and its nearest neighbour show that the particles align vertically more than a set of random distributed particles for solid-volume fractions Φ≤0.01. This indicates the formation of particle clusters. These findings are supported by multiple instances of DKT observed in the animations of the simulations. Finally, it has been observed for all regimes that the vertical particle velocity fluctuations relative to the settling velocity of the suspension increase roughly with Φ^(1/3).","Direct numerical simulations; Particle-laden flow; Sedimentation; Suspensions; Confined geometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Solid and Fluid Mechanics","",""

The personalization goal is to facilitate future visitors to engage with the collection and maximize the meaning of visiting the museum based on visitors’ diverse concerns. A model is brought up during the project and can describe four popular concerns of the adult visitors at this museum, which are about “understanding Van Gogh”, “learning art techniques”, “enjoying an aesthetic experience”, and “finding out the landmarks”. The concern model contains two parts for each concern: the first part collects the typical minds-on behaviors and terms for each category, and can be used to identify each visitor’s concerns; while the second part contains the facilitation design principles and examples for each category, and can be used to inspire the new content designs for each concern type. It’s also found out that, the core of the personalized product/service system is to collect enough data from the visitors, identify their concern(s) with the help of a robust backend algorithm, and then present selected content to the visitors. A MMT can be called as a personalized MMT as long as it can collect data from visitors, and select one content out of many according to their data input, but with a premise that the content should be relevant to the identified concern. After several design iterations, 17 design principles were generated for guiding the data input and content output design. An embodiment design was made as a personalized MMT example. The final design requires visitors’ interested terms in their daily life and collects them through a concern quiz which will be presented to the visitors at the beginning of their visit; their input will be calculated by the backend Bayesian network, and then ten personal highlights and some personal activities will be selected for the visitors immediately; visitors can see their personal highlights on a digital map and use it for their actual visit; they will also receive invitations of some personal activities from their conversational MMT assistant during the break. All the interaction happens only on the MMT screen. The embodiment design was tested by eight participants from TUDelft who role-played four different charterers in the Van Gogh Museum and visited the permanent exhibition with a Wizard-of-Oz prototype. The evaluation result is positive, which means the final concept can achieve the personalization goal in the desired way.","personalization; multimedia; concern model; design principle; design framework; museum experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shared decision making can help ensure that this care contributes to the elderly´s quality of life, instead of only extending life. To enable shared decision making, clear communication between the elderly and care professionals is needed, however, this communication is especially difficult for frail elderly. Therefore, it is useful to prepare these elderly for potential care decisions and help them to express themselves, in order to only provide them with care that actually contributes to their quality of life. The aim of this project is:“To design a tool for the frail elderly to help them timely express their desired quality of life, so that care can contribute to their actual quality of life.”In this research, explorative research in the form of interviews, observations and design interventions, is used to form understanding in the problem and define design guidelines for the final design.The desired quality of life is defined as what someone desires to do, whereas actual quality of life addresses their abilities. The research helped to understand desired quality of life from the perspective of the frail elderly and define it as a combination of their current happiness, and their beliefs, which together form their wishes. For these elderly expressing their desired quality of life without aid is difficult, particularly because they perceive their future as limited and existing methods focus mainly on the negative aspects of their future. This unintended negativity is what inspired the vision to start communication with the frail elderly, when they are still relatively autonomous, and support them in portraying their desired quality of life in a tangible manner. This results in the following design goal:“Spark a socially frail visitor to collect &amp; create their own Quality of life Portrait together with a meeting center employee, so the visitor can reflect upon their desired quality of life &amp; share their wishes with others in order to treasure them together for the future.”The design goal also presents five conversation elements: Spark, Reflect, Collect, Create and Share.Nine design guidelines give insight in how to achieve these conversation elements and design for the conversation’s interaction, content and tool. Throughout the conversation, the desired interaction qualities are: trustful, encouraging and invigorating.The final design ‘Door mijn ogen’ is a conversation package that contains instructions for the care professional and a booklet for the frail elderly. Thereby the tool helps the caregiver to prepare for their role as listener and encourages the elderly to become the narrator and writer of their desired quality of life story. The vision and design brief are as relevant as the conversation tool, and hold the potential to inspire further design and research. This project shows a way to help the frail elderly express their desired quality of life in order to improve their actual quality of life by preparing them for personalized care decisions.","Frail elderly; Quality of Life; Conversation tool; Shared decision making; Care decision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Ortt, J.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2019","Radical innovation is widely acknowledged as important for companies aiming to contribute to sustainable development while maintaining and improving their competitive advantage. However, the diffusion and development process of radical innovations is described as uncertain and long-winded due to barriers raised within the socio-technical system. This system is a linked network of technological aspects, actors and institutions in which the process of development and diffusion of the radical innovation evolves. In order to overcome barriers within this system, companies can adopt a niche strategy, which enables the creation of a market despite these barriers. In these niche markets the radical innovation is able to develop until it reaches maturity and can survive in the mainstream market. Ortt &amp; Kamp (2019) developed a barrier framework including seven core factors and seven influential factors representing the components of the social-technical system of a radical innovation. The core factors represent the market characteristics; it is assumed that if one of these core factors is absent, large-scale diffusion is obstructed. The influencing factors describe the underlying problems causing the absence. The first objective of this is research was to link niche strategies to barriers comprised of one influencing and one core factor as described in the barrier framework. The second objective of this research was to develop evaluation criteria that companies can use to define the most suitable niche strategy for their particular situation. In order to reach these objectives, a multi-method approach was taken in which three different methods were applied in three different research steps. In the first research step a conceptual model including the linkages between niche strategies and barriers was developed by means of logical reasoning. Furthermore, a list of evaluation criteria was proposed. The credibility of the proposed conceptual model and the proposed evaluation criteria was subsequently assessed in the second research step, a literature review, and the third research step, two primary case studies. The aim of these steps was to improve and refine the conceptual model and evaluation criteria using pattern matching and cross-case analysis. If proposed relationships could be confirmed by literature and/or empirical evidence, the relationships were found appropriate. This thesis research made a first attempt to link niche strategies formally to the barrier framework developed by Ortt &amp; Kamp (2019). In total, 157 linkages were found. Furthermore, the research adds a list of 28 niche strategies that extend the currently described amount of niche strategies in literature, including both the innovation phase and market adaptation phase; it adds a categorisation of the niche strategies; and it adds a list of evaluation criteria. The outcome of the research can help companies to develop a comprehensive decision-making process focused on defining a suitable strategy to overcome the experienced barrier, or the model can be used to define a niche strategy. The evaluation criteria can be used to assess the suitability of strategies in its’ particular situation.","Innovation; Niches; Strategies; Barriers; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

A possible alternative actuation solution could be to apply contactless air film actuators which make use of air bearing principles. The air film actuators use a thin film of air to levitate and propel a substrate. The main advantage of such a technique is that it actuates directly on the substrate and therefore eliminates the moving mass of a carrier. This drastically reduces the actuation force required to accelerate the substrate, which reduces unwanted deformations and excitations of the machine frame. Because the substrate is not in direct contact with the bearing surface, the substrate does not experience any wear, stiction or backlash effects. In this project a demonstrator with opposed air film actuators is designed and manufactured to actuate a flexible substrate in one degree of freedom. To predict the performance of the motion system, the air film actuators are modelled with the use of the Reynolds equation for compressible air, determined both analytically and numerically. The demonstrator consists of two manifolds with their bearing surfaces facing each other and where a substrate is placed between the two bearing surfaces. By using pressurized air, the substrate can be levitated between the two bearing surfaces. By controlling proportional valves, the substrate can be moved in negative or positive x-direction. The theoretical models show good resemblance with the measurement results. However, the substrate vibrated and did not float fully contactless between the two bearing surfaces. Based on these results, improvements can be made on the bearing function of the system, but the demonstrator shows promising results for actuating substrates with large accelerations and fast responses.","Contactless positioning; Air bearing; Reynolds equation; Compressible air; Flexible substrates; Demonstrator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-13","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The high level of biodiversity that is native to areas where palm oil plantations occur is at risk. Various measures are taken, such as the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The RSPO certification is a sector governance measure that indicates which management and operations interventions have to be implemented to protect the public interest – countering negative social and environmental impacts. No research has been done on the impact of RSPO certification and the plantation size on biodiversity. The research question of this thesis is “do RSPO certification and plantation size influence the level of biodiversity of palm oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia?” Three open source online data sets from Global Forest Watch containing information on plantations were used. These spatial data sets were combined with Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) species observations data. From GBIF, four taxa were selected to be used in this study, known to be impacted by palm oil cultivation: birds, lizards, primates and small mammals. The majority of the GBIF observations that laid within the studied plantation data set, however, were bird observations (93.0%). Only 1.8% of the GBIF observations laid within the palm oil plantations. Data analysis indicated that there is no significant difference between RSPO and non-RSPO-certified plantations in terms of biodiversity. The obtained results imply that the measures that are taken by plantations to obtain the RSPO certificate do not affect the level of biodiversity and therefore certification does not protect the species living on plantations better when compared to plantations that are not RSPO-certified. Results also indicate that biodiversity is not influenced by the size of a plantation – small, medium or large. The proposed research was the first attempt in getting insight into the effectiveness of certification and small-scaled plantations – in other words plantation size – on biodiversity levels. It can be concluded that the effectiveness of the two measures has not been proven yet. Suggestions for further research are done, in which higher quality data sets and larger numbers of observations are of importance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current shiprepair yards are land-based facilities that can not be moved when demand for their services declines. A mobile shiprepair facility would be able to and Damen Shiprepair &amp; Conversion (DS&amp;C) expressed interest to investigate the potential of a mobile shiprepair unit. When executed correctly, such a facility may reduce total repair time and thereby increase vessel availability through a higher shiprepair efficiency and reduction of travel time to the repair yard. The resulting competitive advantage can lead to profit maximization of DS&amp;C.The goal of this thesis is to develop recommendations for DS&amp;C regarding the feasibility of a mobile shiprepair facility. No facility of this kind exists to date, therefore the first step is to determine preliminary design features. The target market will be the mandatory intermediate and special surveys that a vessel is obliged to undergo every two and a half and five years respectively, requiring the vessels to undergo underwater investigations. A design feature following from that is the ability to haul vessels out of the water. The concept should moreover be sea-going, easy to (re)deploy and contain an all-round workshop and warehousing capabilities.Subsequently, the costs and projected revenues of the concept are identified and combined in a financial model. The cost items which differentiate a mobile yard from a traditional land-based shiprepair yard are: direct labour cost, machinery &amp; installations cost, housing cost and travel expenses. Revenue results from shiprepair services and includes the quantified competitive advantage. The feasibility of a mobile shiprepair facility is then further evaluated in two case studies: the Caribbean sea and the west-coast of the African continent. The target market in the Caribbean are Supramax/Handymax size vessels and the target market in west-Africa is the support vessels for the offshore oil and gas sector. Both case studies evaluate a semi-submersible non-propelled facility that operates in a sheltered location.The Caribbean is the only area of the two case studies that shows potential. This can be explained by a higher efficiency and hence more projects that can be executed per year. Moreover, the same services can be sold for a higher price than on the west-coast of Africa. Several scenarios were identified in which the concept can be feasible on an annual base. However, the likeliness that these conditions persist during the projects lifetime is considered low and thus it is not recommended to deploy a mobile shiprepair facility in this area. Regarding the west-coast of Africa case study, even under the most favourable conditions - a very high occupational rate and an increase in target market conditions - it is not recommended to deploy a mobile shiprepair facility.It has been concluded using a stochastic sensitivity analysis that the duration of the maintenance project largely determines feasibility. The sensitivity to the fuel price, day rates of future clients and the reduction in deviation days were studied as well. All three were found not to be of large influence for the determination of feasibility, although it had been suspected differently for the last two. It has been found that the added value of the concept can not be transformed enough into a competitive advantage.If a change in conditions justifies the further development of this concept, this report provides several design criteria. Subsequently, recommendations are made on the design of a tool for the maximization of the reduction in deviation time of future clients to enhance the potential of the concept.","shiprepair; conceptual design; feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-01","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Indoor localization entails finding a qualitative description of the occupied area, that is human interpretable, rather than a quantitative position in Euclidean space. In other words, the context of an indoor environment has to be understood, such that a position can be transcended to a meaningful location. A space is defined as a mathematical structure with relational properties, to which all its members adhere. As a subset of space, topological space describes the relationships between (parts of) objects that do not change under continuous transformation. It further defines metric space, as a set where distances and angles between all of its elements are defined. Indoor space is then interpreted as a structure bounded by physical or functional elements, enabling human activities. It should entail the geometric place an actor is in, the topological structure that place is a part of, and the semantics giving the place meaning. Many indoor positioning methods have been developed, which can provide an actor with a relative geometric place. Most preferred are positioning systems not relying on a contingent system, which can be performed using a hybrid fusion of sensors embedded into a mobile device. Such a system found to perform sufficiently is VI-SLAM, simultaneously building a geometric place and tracking each pose and heading relatively. Its output is a mesh model, in which a viewshed of the indoor environment is built. From a mesh model, a topological structure can be derived in the form of its dual graph. Now to finalize this representation of indoor space which can be captured using a mobile device, it has to be enriched with a meaningful context. These semantics are generally stored in BIM models. Thus to transcend the position retrieved using SLAM to a location, is has to be matched with a BIM model, so that the appertaining semantics can be connected.<br/>The method proposed provides for a possibility to perform graph-based indoor localization, by extracting a graph from both input sources and comparing them, in order to find a match. However different in nature and structure, both input sources can be converted to a graph of similar calibre, such that they can be tested for a match. All operations performed on the graphs are derived from spectral graph theory. The graph simplification and analysis is performed using the eigen spectrum of the graph Laplacian, and the match is performed by remapping the spectral graphs into a vector sub space using the eigen spectrum of the data covariance matrix. After a match between both graphs is found, the current position of the actor within the mesh model can be translated to the room found in the graph. This room is now connected to a room within the reference graph, for which the semantics are stored in the BIM. Returning these to the actor, a location description is formed.","Indoor Localization; Spectral Graph Theory; Graph Matching; Mobile Device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

In the end, the water-cup is used to image an ex-vivo human breast. Finally, the limitations of the built water-cup are stated. In addition to manufacturing the water-cup, a pulse-echo-scan of an ex-vivo human breast is made. This pulse-echo-scan is compared with the cross-sectional photograph of the breast. Due to the pudding-like structure of the breast, it is challenging to make a cross-section at the same position as the pulse-echo-scan is made. The pulse-echo-scan is made at the Pathology Department of the Erasmus MC. The ex-vivo human breast study helps to understand what structures are present in the breast. This knowledge can be used to build a new measurement setup and optimize the imaging algorithms for finding tumours.","Breast cancer; Ultrasound; Breast scanning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Delft Breast Ultrasound",""

Therefore innovating is crucial for companies to stay competitive and enter new markets. Large corporations have difficulty in breaking silos and developing breakthrough innovations due to pressures in the form of financial performance and resistance to change. It seems that due to volatility of markets and technological developments, companies need to “join the race” in order to survive. For the purpose of benefitting the innovation space network companies can interact with external parties. Research shows that collaboration with external actors lead to sources of higher innovation performance. Nevertheless, the innovation process is very intricate as it involves many complex interactions and challenges. Innovation depends on people´s expertise, capabilities and creative capacities. Companies need to recognize this and provide an environment that can foster innovation.<br/><br/>Infineon Technologies AG Corporate Supply Chain Innovation department recognizes the need to innovate in a peripheries of its core technological developments. The department is involved in several co-funded European projects which aim towards digitalization improvements. <br/><br/>The main company´s objective is to explore ways to better coordinate relationships between partners, to find ways to innovate and to foster knowledge management practices. Since the firm wants to improve its innovation performance, certain processes need to be develop to stimulate innovation. Infineon Technologies AG does not have processes for managing disruptive innovations therefore is in need to design a model that would enable the company to manage them, the main objective of this master thesis is to design:<br/>A model which prescribes processes for management of disruptive innovations between firms, on a case study of Infineon Technologies AG Corporate Supply Chain Innovation department.<br/>In order to reach objective of this master thesis, a following main research question is formulated:<br/>How to facilitate inter-firm innovation management processes of disruptive innovations in the context of Infineon Technologies AG Corporate Supply Chain Innovation Department?<br/>The thesis project takes a Design Science Project approach and is divided into five phases: 1) research motivation 2) requirements definition through exploration of theoretical foundation 3) design and development of the artefact 4) demonstration of the artefact through validation and 5) evaluation and conclusion. <br/>The overall conclusion for this thesis is: in order to facilitate inter-firm innovation management processes of disruptive innovations Infineon Technologies Corporate Supply Chain Innovation department should implement co-innovation management practices.

Shipright is meant to be used by scale-up SaaS companies to conduct user research on their products’ users. SaaS (software as a service) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.

For outreach, though, the minimum of company size is set on 10 FTE. This allows start-ups to be included as a secondary target group. Among this target group, user research is defined as the collection of user feedback and the analysis of it to get to actionable tasks. All the actions that goes around product decisions, revolves around product teams with typical key members of Product Managers / Owners, UX-researchers, designers and developers. The problem encountered is that, though rich insights from user research is desired, the fast-paced environment of scale-up companies prevents them from being able to spend enough time and attention on user research. Shipright’s original design is able to help scale-up SaaS companies to collect and organize feedback data from their products’ users, and to turn these data into insights.

The mission will see the deployment of 3 spacecraft in heliocentric orbit keeping a triangular formation with side length of 2.5 million km. Laser beams are exchanged between the spacecraft by means of suitably mounted telescopes (2 per spacecraft), with the objective of synthesizing a very-large baseline interferometer. The interferometric measurements are taken between free-floating test-masses placed inside the spacecraft. Due to the nature of the scientific objectives, the mission requirements on spacecraft-spacecraft pointing precision are exceptionally strict. Moreover, the formation needs to operate in almost perfect free-fall, therefore the solar radiation pressure needs to be continuously compensated for by the on-board thrusters. Gravitational wave signals are measured in the frequency bandwidth of 20 μHz to 1 Hz, requiring the vibrations in that domain to also be eliminated both for the attitude and the displacement. The task is made possible by the gravitational reference system, a complex device that keeps the test-masses from touching the walls of the spacecraft by applying on the latter an external force through μNewton thrusters. This mode of operation is called Drag-Free and Attitude Control System (DFACS). In this thesis we attempt to study and design a DFACS for LISA using a technique called Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT). The design process starts from the definition of the orbits, the goal orientation of the spacecraft, the sizing of the solar radiation pressure induced disturbances and the derivation of the dynamics of the 19 degrees of freedom to be controlled. Using QFT, the design process is carried out on the DFACS using separation of the dynamics. As a result, analytical equations for the calculation of the LISA commands are derived and the methods to design a control system compliant to the scientific requirements imposed on the sensitivity are shown.","LISA; Laser Interferometer Space Antenna; control; Drag-free control; Attitude control; DFACS; QFT; Quantitative Feedback Theory; Formation Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","LISA",""

Automating the merging procedure can be the solution for a considerable number of accidents by removing the human factor. People have accepted the risk they are in when driving or being driven but acceptance of automated driving systems remains limited. The goal of this study is to evaluate two automation feedback aids’ influence on the acceptance of automated truck merging systems. An automation confidence feedback bar and top view display, visualizing the surrounding traffic were tested. The feedback aids are evaluated on the number of abortions, mental workload, trust in the system, perceived usefulness of the system and system satisfaction.<br/>Acceptance is the degree to which an individual incorporates the system in his/her driving, or, if the system is not available, intends to use it. Drivers of large trucks exhibit heightened criticism of automation due to professional identity, exposure or familiarity with the traditional task, and some degree of technical knowledge of the current system. Introducing automation feedback gives the driver more information on the automation systems’ status. 41 participants experienced 12 simulations of a truck merging on the highway in a fixed base truck simulator. A high (1.5s gap) and medium workload (2.1s gap) condition paired with merging between cars or trucks created four simulation conditions to test each feedback aid condition (no feedback aid, confidence bar and top view). Mental workload was measured by tonic activity of the GSR. Trust, perceived usefulness and system satisfaction were measured with Jian’s trust and Van der Laan’s system acceptance questionnaires after each feedback aid condition. Five participants rated their vulnerability as ’none at all’, their measurements were removed from further analyses of the feedback aids. A total of 41 abortions were obtained from 432 simulations. A significant difference in abortion rate was found between no feedback aid (22 abortions), the confidence bar (13 abortions) and the top view display (6 abortions). No abortion rate difference was found between merging between cars and trucks caused by visual obstruction. Participants’ mental workload and trust did not change between the feedback aid conditions. Participants rated both feedback aids as more useful and satisfying than driving without a feedback aid with the top view display being favoured over the confidence bar. No correlations were found between driver’s license years and trust, perceived usefulness or system satisfaction in any of the feedback aid conditions. Both feedback aids increased the acceptance of automated truck merging systems. The number of abortions decreased and willingness to use increased by adding either the feedback aids. The top view display showed the largest improvement in acceptance but more extensive research is needed in both feedback aids to assess their benefits in automated driving systems.<br","Intelligent Vehicles; Autonomous driving; Truck merging; Human factors; Human Machine Interface Design; human machine interaction; Acceptance; Merging; Truck driver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

(mentor); Meeuwsen, F.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Hospitals are under an increased financial pressure, due to a significant growth in demand for healthcare, that is caused by an aging population. The operating rooms account for the largest costs of a hospital, and thus require a cost-efficient management. However, scheduling the operating rooms is a complex task that involves the estimation of surgery duration, which is often inaccurate. Delays in surgery duration, that are not accounted for in the estimation during scheduling, often result in upcoming surgeries being cancelled. Hence, the operating theatres are most of the time not fully utilized, which comes with great costs for the hospital. Poor communication of information about the progress of ongoing surgeries to the operating room (OR) schedulers prevents them from effectively (re)-scheduling accordingly. The OR personnel can not be assigned to additional tasks, and thus, there is a need for automated monitoring of the progress of ongoing surgeries. The instrument usage during surgeries is shown to provide relevant information about the progress of surgeries, using a Random Forest model to estimate surgical phases from intra-operative data.In this thesis, a Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) setup is used to detect instruments, equipped with RFID-tags, that are used by the surgeon during a Total Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Hernia Repair (TEP) procedure at Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis (RdGG). The setup is evaluated on applicability into a surgical setting, which involves regulatory aspects, acceptance by the OR-personnel, and performance. A pilot study, of which the results are incorporated into realizing actual in-vivo tests, is performed in a near-surgical setting to eval- uate the extent to which the RFID-setup is applicable in a real surgical setting. During the pilot study, a total of 10 procedures is mimicked of which the data, that is extracted from the RFID-setup, is used to generate a Random Forest model that can estimate the surgical phases. The Random Forest model is used to evaluate the performance of the RFID-setup. After complying with all regulations to perform in-vivo testing, a total of three in-vivo tests is executed to evaluate the applicability of the RFID-setup in a real surgical setting. Lastly, a first step has been taken to extend the research to a greater range of surgery types.The RFID-setup has shown the ability to identify instruments, that are equipped with RFID-tags, during surgery. All regulations to perform in-vivo tests are complied with, and no discomfort of the RFID-setup is experienced by the OR-personnel during the in-vivo tests. Hence, future in-vivo testing is warranted to optimize the setup. The Random Forest model can estimate the phases of surgeries (38% overall accuracy), based on instrument usage data that is acquired through an RFID-setup. The current setup, however, needs to be optimized to improve the detection ability. So far, the first step to make the method of instrument identification applicable to a broader range of surgeries has resulted in a prototyped attachment design to equip instruments with RFID-tags. The attachment is designed in such a way that both the attachment and the RFID-tags are interchangeable between instruments. Further development is needed for the design to comply with a selection of regulations to perform in-vivo testing.","rfid; instruments; operating room scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

For these decisions, it is important that signals are accurately transduced from the outside to the inside of the cell. In \textit{Dictyostelium discoideum}, two opposing mechanisms using G-protein coupled receptors are used for this signalling: the precoupling mechanism, where second messenger molecules bind to the receptor before a ligand binds to it, and the collision coupling mechanism, in which the ligand binding comes first. In this paper, we investigated both models by analyzing how accurately they detect ligand bindings when different receptors are able to interact with each other. A similar analysis is done for returning messenger molecules. We found that the influence of receptors upon each other is low if the receptors operate under the same conditions. However, when the conditions are heterogeneous, the influence of receptors on each other is huge. The main reason for this influence is that ligand binding receptors which are more likely to get detected by messenger molecules will receive more of those messengers, because of their high diffusion rate. The effect of returning messenger molecules on the receptor signal was that ligand detection became possible at times where they otherwise would not be able to be detected anymore, given a replace rate which is low compared to the rate of binding and unbinding of a ligand to a receptor.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Lousberg, Louis (mentor); Stomph, Paul (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The construction sector showed almost no fundamental change in the past 50 years, where other industries reaped the benefits of standardisation and digitalisation. Until recently innovation development was no issue for engineering firms active in this construction sector. At the moment however, they are progressing towards higher degrees of innovation by embracing digitalisation. This progression is influenced by an important development in the business model of engineering firms. Engineering firms were used to have exclusive insights in the value chain of the construction sector, which enabled them to sell these insights towards clients. Selling these insights as core business is threatened however, creating an urgency for a new core business. Engineering firms seem to aim for new business consisting of selling ‘total solutions’. Total solutions in which knowledge and assets of external parties are integrated, in combination with a licence business model to make it scalable. Selling such total solutions is regarded as a transformational innovation for conventional engineering firms, because it has the power to transform their core business. Engineering firms however, lack perspective on how they should develop transformational innovation. They have a strong impression that external parties play a role in the appropriate strategy, but it is unknown how to relate with these external parties in such a way they have an optimal effect on the transformational innovation development. This research investigates what order of steps is beneficial for engineering firms to develop transformational innovation through relations with external parties. A cross-case multiple case study methodology is executed in order to answer this question. Seven cases in which an innovation seeking firm makes a relation with an external venture are investigated. These cases comprise venturing relations outside the construction sector. Each case is investigated along multiple topics resulting from a literature review. The most important topics are the degrees of integration, autonomy and openness of the network. A cross-case analysis of the seven cases results in aspects that seem beneficial for (transformational) innovation development, derived from firms outside the construction sector. Subsequently, these aspects are evaluated by an expert evaluation panel consisting of three innovation experts of three leading Dutch engineering firms. The expert evaluation results in an order of steps beneficial for transformational innovation development of engineering firms in venturing relations with external parties. It seems beneficial to create a moderate degree of operational integration when both parties have business on the same domain. Furthermore, it seems beneficial to start strategic discussions between the engineering firm and the external venture after a moderate degree of operational integration is created. After strategic discussions three aspects seem beneficial. First, the provision of extensive strategic autonomy by the engineering firm to the external venture. Second, the creation of a high degree of operational integration between the engineering firm and external venture. Third, the creation of indirect closed network configurations between the engineering firm and external venture.The most important element in the discussion of the research is the suggestion to recognise the network characteristic ‘degree of complementary relations’ as a network characteristic influencing innovation development. With regard to the limitations of this research it may be considered that only seven cases are investigated. Furthermore, from the companies involved in each case only one or two persons have been interviewed. Lastly, the research scope was limited and a possible cross-industry bias cannot be excluded. A recommendation for further research is to investigate the role of clients in transformational innovation development, as they generally have a stringent role in the construction sector. Furthermore, the role of the rather conservative behaviour of engineers in developing transformational innovation at engineering firms is recommended to look into. Lastly, it is recommended to investigate how a special form of venturing, ‘network orchestration venturing’, can be applied to engineering firms.","venturing; transformational innovation; engineering firm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The houses are generally old masonry houses with flexible timber diaphragms. It is of importance to assess the response of these houses in order to apply proper retrofit measures. There has been substantial research on masonry, however there has been little exploration on timber diaphragms. For this reason, the TU Delft conducted cyclic tests on as-built and retrofitted timber diaphragms, as well as on the connections within the diaphragms. Timber diaphragms exhibit a nonlinear hysteresis under cyclic loading, which is caused by the nonlinear behaviour of the connections. This thesis focuses on the numerical modelling of the as-built and retrofitted diaphragm as tested at the TU Delft. Using ANSYS 18.2, the numerical models of the diaphragms are subjected to cyclic pushover analyses. As the connections within the diaphragms are the only source of nonlinearity, these are simulated first. For the nonlinear connections, it is essential that the numerical models can capture the pinching behaviour and strength degradation for cycles of the same amplitude. The numerical models of the connections are calibrated on experimental tests. With the models of the connections, the models for the as-built and the retrofitted diaphragm can be constructed. The results of the numerical models of the diaphragms are validated with experimental data. The models showed sufficient similarities with experimental results and are deemed suitable simulations of timber diaphragms.","numerical modelling; nonlinear hysteresis; timber diaphragm; as-built; retrofitted; seismic response; Groningen earthquakes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

More than 40 percent of Amsterdam tourists take a trip through the canals, accounting for more than 3 million canal travelers annually. Therefore, the tour boat sector is crucial for tourism in Amsterdam.<br/>Many of the quay walls on Amsterdam’s canals have either reached the end of their lifespan or need replacing because of damage caused by overloading and the overuse of heavy supply trucks. Currently, a length of 200 km out of the total length of 300 km of quay walls have reached the end of their 100-year service life, and some walls have even passed that limit. In 2017, five incidents of quay-wall failure occurred. In 2018, three such incidents occurred. Hence, these quay walls are in critical need of replacement. Many are located along busy canals, which means that closing these canals will almost certainly directly lead to the congestion of traffic flow on the water. This is highly undesirable for the tourist sector. At the moment, there is no research being conducted into how to manage quay-wall renovations without disturbing transport over water.<br/>The main goal of this research project was to develop a first version of a model through which the impact of the quay wall renovations on transport over water (e.g., passenger transport and pleasure craft) can be assessed. Thus, the main research question for this project was as follows: ""How can the impact on nautical traffic flow and congestion patterns of quay wall upgrade works in the canals of the City of Amsterdam be assessed?” A model was constructed based on the Amsterdam canal traffic analysis. An agent-based modeling framework was selected as a suitable framework, because it could give insight into not only if and when congestion occurs, but also why congestion occurs. The ABM framework is able to represent the distinct sailing speed and route selection of each vessel type, can reproduce the (routing) behavior of the three vessel types that interact, and had the additional option to incorporate the irrational behavior. Each vessel was modeled as an entity with its own logic (step-by-step instructions) and making its own decisions while moving on a graph. In order to reproduce observed traffic flow and congestion patterns, modeled vessel objects needed to move through this network, calculate their routes based on the network structure and properties, and queue at crossings. Therefore, this study applied network logic (graph theory) and queueing theory. This project used the open-source NetworkX package in Python to construct a network (graph) based on the spatial coordinates of the Amsterdam canal network, with nodes at crossings and bridges and edges connecting the nodes. Each vessel object in the model used algorithms from the NetworkX package to calculate its route on the network. The model also used the SimPy package to simulate queueing and crossing congestion at crossings with discrete time steps. To summarize, the model simulated on a microscopic level, used discrete time steps, and applied the agent-based modeling framework. As this model is developed within a community setting at the TU Delft, this model, and other transport network analysis models, can be viewed and found at https://github.com/TUDelft- CITG/Transport- Network- Analysis","Congestion; Nautical traffic; Traffic Congestion; maritime transportation; Amsterdam; canals; quaywall; quay structures; simulated model; Python; Simulations; agent based model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This meso-scale Continuum Damage Model poses three requirements for kinking onset: 1) local failure of the matrix in the kink band; 2) fibers fracture due to bending; 3) the longitudinal compressive stress is sufficiently large to satisfy the previous requirement when the kink plane shear stresses is smaller than the traverse shear strength of the ply.

As a result, the performance of these vehicles has improved greatly. Research has thus far been directed towards the performances of the swimming motion. In order for the development of these bio-inspired underwater vehicles to continue, the increased reliability and durability should also be investigated. This research is aimed at long-term-autonomous bio-inspired underwater vehicles, specifically vehicles based on Median/Paired Fin swimming, which could provide continuous, unassisted monitoring of an area. <br/>The goal is to investigate existing options for the propulsive mechanism and find the most suitable solution. A suitable propulsive mechanism can cope with the pressure changes that the vehicle will face due to the varying depths while requiring no maintenance for extended periods of time. This expresses itself in a mechanism that has no dynamic contact between the internal mechanics of the vehicle and the external environment because the dynamic contact is prone to leakage. One actuator and two transmissions are proposed as propulsive mechanisms in this research. The actuator is a reluctance actuator and the transmissions are a flexure joint and a magnetic coupling. The transmissions will be used in combination with an electric motor that is located inside the hull. The reluctance actuator has been found to lack torque generation. The flexure joint will be fused with both the hull and the fin and will be actuated from within the vehicle. It has the ability to either follow the large deflections that are required without encountering fatigue or to resist pressure differences, but both are required. The magnetic coupling does possess the torque, the range of motion, and the rigidity to resist the pressure, and is therefore chosen to be used as the propulsive mechanism that will be investigated further. Existing designs of the magnetic coupling do not comply with the requirements of this swimming mode. Three types of designs are therefore proposed, the coaxial, the face-to-face, and the moment-arm design. To reduce the resultant noncontributing magnetic forces on the fin, the designs have been made symmetrical in the motion plane. To reduce the effect of unstable equilibriums that result from attractive forces on both sides, each type of design has a repulsive design as well as an attractive design. In addition, the designs have magnet orientations that are inspired by Halbach arrays to increase the magnetic field where desired and reduce it elsewhere. Simulations have been performed on the designs using the magnetic finite element method. These simulations indicated that the coaxial designs do not create enough coupling torque and the moment-arm designs create too much radial forces on the fin. The face-to-face coupling designs show promise, both in coupling torque and in resultant force directions. Simulations of the double-sided, face-to-face coupling with Halbach-inspired magnet orientation have been validated and the results indicate that this new magnetic coupling could serve as a solution to reduce maintenance and increase reliability and durability in bio-inspired underwater vehicles. The use of repulsive forces in this design transfers the noncontributing resultant forces from occurring in the unpredictable external environment of the fin to the controlled internal environment of the vehicle.","Bio-inspired; magnetic coupling; maintenance reduction; underwater vehicle; long-term autonomous","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

In this report we mainly consider off-line methods, as we feel off-line methods provide a more friendly introduction into change-point analysis and on-line methods are in principle just an extension of their off-line counterparts. First off, these off-line change-point methods are considered under different assumptions (parametric, non-parametric). In each case, we treat a solution to the change-point problem under different models(normal and gamma model, mean or varianche change etc.).

Traditional balance strategies for humanoid robots are taking a step, control of the center of pressure (CoP) location, a result of the ‘ankle strategy’, and changing the angular momentum about the CoM, for example by a ‘hip strategy’. For humanoid robots, a common assumption behind these strategies is that the CoM height is predefined. However, CoM height changes can be used as an input for balance control, as for example can be observed during the landing of an athlete after a long jump. The first contributions of this work are bounds on the initial states for the variable height inverted pendulum (VHIP) from which convergence is possible to a stopped state, also known as capture regions. First, only a unilateral contact constraint is considered; negative CoM acceleration cannot be smaller than gravitational acceleration. Second, CoM height constraints are added to the model, after which a capture region can still be computed in closed-form. Third, vertical force constraints are added, after which capture regions are computed numerically using a bang-bang control law. The last capture region bridges the transition to the applied part of this work. The second contribution is a control law on vertical acceleration, suitable for application on a humanoid robot using a momentum-based control framework. Push recovery is tested on NASA’s Valkyrie humanoid robot while the robot is standing. In simulation, an increase in recoverable push of 9% can be observed when comparing to a controller that only uses CoP, when pushing the back of the robot. On hardware, an average increase of 7% can be observed for this push direction using a load sensor. Additionally, tests are conducted on hardware on Boston Dynamics’ Atlas using a medicine ball on a rope, but no improvement in recovery is observed. The control method for standing push recovery is also extended for use while the robot is walking. For Valkyrie in simulation, recovery improved the most compared with a predefined height approach for a push applied in the first part of the single support state for rear and frontal push directions. Additionally, a hardware result on Atlas while walking is briefly presented.","Humanoid; Robot; Capture; Capturability; Push; Inverted; Pendulum; Recovery; Variable; Legged; Balance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hunt, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Future consumer products, medical devices and manufacturing processes can benefit from systems with a high number and a high density of individually controlled actuators that are flexible and use little energy, materials and space. These systems with a high count and high density of actuators can be addressed as distributed actuation systems. In nature these distributed actuation systems are already present in the form of organs, eukaryotic cells or body parts such as an elephant’s trunk. This kind of system could be useful for handling fragile materials, delivering drugs inside the human body or creating replacement organs. Creating distributed mechatronic systems using conventional components is difficult, as the rigid parts often lead to complex constructions. This thesis presents a new paradigm for distributed actuation systems: combining planar bending smart materials with the Japanese art of Kirigami. This is demonstrated with the creation of a novel actuator design and modelling approach.First a literature study is presented on methods that have been used to actuate Origami and Kirigami (O&amp;K) structures. General information is provided on several smart materials that can be used for this purpose. The reported methods and materials are evaluated on their potential for distributed actuation. The literature shows that electro-mechanical smart materials can be used for the design of distributed actuator systems. It is shown that multiple, scalable actuators can be designed in one sheet and can be actuated locally. Literature reveals preliminary research on cutting soft electro-active polymer (EAP) Kirigami structures. These EAPs are suitable for the creation of multi-DOF, distributed actuators using O&amp;K techniques. However, this far the investigation addresses only cm-sized structures that exhibit a bending behaviour and the potential of the O&amp;K techniques on EAPs have not been studied. The second study investigates the concept of utilizing Kirigami techniques on ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) materials to manufacture distributed actuators. Different cm-sized designs are described and realized that produce a large strain linear motion from the bending motion of IPMCs. The designs are experimentally validated. The results demonstrate that it is possible to etch and cut a multitude of actuation units into planar bending smart material transducers and that bending actuation can be used to realize translation.To facilitate design and optimization of these IPMC Kirigami structures, a model is needed that predicts the electro-mechanical behaviour and is easy to implement. Existing models are not suitable as they will result in complex and elaborate model constructions when more advanced structures have to be implemented. This thesis presents a practical electrical model in Comsol Multiphysics. The electrical parameters of an IPMC beam are identified. Identified properties include the surface conductivity, through material conductivity and permittivity. The electrical models are validated by comparing the simulations with a time-domain experiment with a sinusoidal input signal of 1V at 1Hz. The results show that the models can be used to describe the macroscopic electrical behavior and can be further used in analysing more complex structures ones the mechanical part of the Comsol model is also completed.","IPMC; Kirigami; Distributed; Actuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The codes establish the relation between stress ranges and their respective number of cycles until failure of the detail. This method is called S-N curves, however this is based mainly on nominal stresses. A different approach is analyzed in this project, the hot-spot stress method. The hot-spot stress is used to analyze stress distribution caused by geometrical discontinuities on a welded connection. Finite element modelling (FEM) is used in order to ascertain and calculate the hot-spot stress for different details. This method consists on performing a stress extrapolation based on read-out points to avoid any peak stress caused by the finite element analysis itself.<br/>This project focuses on a project-specific welded connection in a rail track for a movable bridge located in Tallinn, Estonia, designed by the company Witteveen+Bos. Initially, the company performed a model of the complete rail track used in the movable bridge, where the welded connection is located. This project takes a more specific scenario and develops the analysis of the local model of the connection itself. The hot-spot stress approach is taken to analyze this structural detail by means of two different finite element software, RFEM and ABAQUS, to perform a validation between these programs. In this report, a comparison is performed between modelling using shell elements and solid elements as well as mesh refinement. The extrapolation of the hot-spot stress is performed by taking the normal stresses at the surface of the element. Based on the results obtained from the analysis, this project provides recommendations when performing this type of analysis on welded connections. A design check is also performed to establish if the detail design is sufficient against fatigue, caused by the motion of the movable bridge.","Hot spot stress; Fatigue; Finite Element Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

These configurations include reduced rotor effectiveness on one or two rotors and the inclusion of one or two bumpers. In order to gather a suitable dataset for these highly dynamic models, free-flight model identification is deemed necessary. To facilitate free-flight aerodynamic model identification, data was provided by the on-board inertial sensors and a motion-tracking OptiTrack system. Sensor fusion through Extended Kalman Filtering was chosen to counter frame vibrations and sensor bias. A sufficient convergence rate was found for estimating the biases. Further modeling efforts are required to validate these results. A rotor rate Kalman Filter was also designed to improve rotor rate differentiation. Excitation of the system was performed with position-controlled doublets, designed to observe theoretical modes from existing quadrotor models. This resulted in five main types of excitation, designed to maximize yawing motions, thrust variation and drag effects. The differences seen for each configuration show interesting behavior, and further investigation is recommended.

Achieving professional level performance in the game of Go has long been considered as an AI milestone. The challenging properties of high state-space complexity, long reward horizon and high action branching factor in the game of Go are also shared by many other complex planning problems, such as robotics applications. This makes the algorithmic solutions of AlphaGo particularly interesting for further research. One of the key innovations in the algorithm is the combination of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep learning. The main hypothesis of the thesis is that the success of the algorithm can be attributed to the combination of the generalization capacity of deep neural networks and the local information of tree search. This hypothesis is evaluated through the application of the AlphaZero algorithm (extension of Alphago) in single-player, deterministic and fully-observable reinforcement learning environments. The thesis presents answers to two research questions. First, what changes need to be made to transfer the AlphaZero algorithm to these environments. The changes in the reward support in these new environments can cause failure of learning, since assumption in the MCTS algorithm are violated. The thesis offers solutions that deal with this problem, including adaptive return normalization. The second research question examines what is the relative importance of the locality and generalization in the performance of the AlphaZero algorithm. This research question is answered by comparing the performance of search trees of varying sizes in several RL environments under fixed time budgets. While building small trees support generalization, through allowing more frequent training of the neural network, building larger trees provide more accurate estimates. This creates a trade-off between improved generalization capacity and more accurate local information under a fixed time budget. The experiment results show that mid-size trees achieve the best performance, which suggests that balancing local information and generalization is key to the success of the algorithm. Based on this results, possible extensions to the algorithm are proposed. At last, the thesis also highlights the relevance of the two-component system from a broader perspective and discusses the possible future impact of the algorithm.","Reinforcement learning; Monte Carlo Tree Search; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The models are able to establish a relation between an arbitrary thermal program and the degree of crystallinity produced during this program. Linking the crystallization model to the simulations allowed investigation of the crystallinity throughout the work piece, which is not possible to do with experiments only.

For this to happen, more people need to join in the movement. It is determined that a new mindset needs to be created. A mindset that is daring, bold and experiment friendly. Failure should be seen as a learning moment. Develop: To make sure companies can engage in mindset development, a tool is created. This tool is based upon the realisation that an immersive and playful experience is the best way to reach an audience. Thus, a workshop is developed, based on a set of canvasses. Define: As this thesis follows a lean development cycle, a simple prototype is developed. This prototype is then iterated upon through testing, reflecting and redesigning. In the end, a design of four canvasses and a booklet is created that help companies to on-board new partners. What was found, is that strategic and communication design are two fields that compliment each other in just right way to influence the adoption of DLT. Through the iterative and user focused process of strategic design, tools were created that help people to understand the complexity of DLT through a simple and smooth experience. At the same time, communication design provided the exact approach needed in guiding a group of people through the multiple layers of complexity of DLT-ecosystems. By understanding the abstraction of their own context in contrast to the technological possibilities, new understanding and appreciation of networked-collaboration was created. This new-found appreciation should ultimately result in a foundation of common ground and understanding, upon which the adoption of DLT can be built and spread.","Blockchain technology; distributed ledger technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Janssen, M.F.W.H.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Adaptive website content is an increasingly popular method for e-commerce platforms to personalize the content shown to its visitors in an attempt to increase the conversion rates of their platforms. However, in order to select the content relevant for a specific customer, the online platform should be able to rapidly interpret the explicit choices, as well as the implicitly sensed context, in which the choices are made. Creating a so-called context-aware e-commerce platform thus requires not only the understanding of users’ content-preferences, but also of the users’ context influencing this decision-making and the opportunities of the e-commerce platform to actively respond to this, in addition to analysis of customer behaviour that goes beyond traditional A/B testing used by websites and online services to quickly evaluate hypothesis with real users. Statistical choice modelling and machine learning are both methods with the ability of doing such advanced analysis of choice behaviour. By inferring preferences and trade-offs from people’s choices observed in real life, or hypothetically stated choice experiments, choice models can be estimated with which future choices can be predicted. As statistical choice models provide insight into the most important parameters that influence decisionmaking, conversion rates of e-commerce platforms can be maximized by optimizing those parameters. Moreover, it has long been acknowledged in discrete choice literature that the context in which a decision is made affects one’s decision-making. Machine learning on the other hand, takes an algorithmic approach and bases its prediction on patterns found in the data. The characteristic of machine learning to allow for high-order interactions that are not pre-specified, could be beneficial as the context in which decisions are made, is often fuzzy and highdimensional. However, as this is a black box method, the method will not explicitly give insight into the parameters influencing behaviour, but instead, train itself to maximize the outcome. Although a substantial amount of research is conducted on the difference between statistical choice models and machine learning, and A/B testing and machine learning are both widely used methods for the dynamic content selection on e-commerce platforms, and thus for conversion optimization, less research however, has been done on the complementary use of the two methods within the boundaries of a simple context-aware system-experiment. Nowadays, it is often stated that machine learning has an accuracy far beyond statistical methods and that it is the recommended method for future data analytics and prediction, as machine learning enables determination of outcomes in which large number of variables with complex relationships are involved. However, should machine learning always be the recommended method for an e-commerce platform trying to maximize its conversion rate with the use of dynamic content, or is more traditional statistical choice modelling sometimes still a better solution for smaller organizations less experienced in data analytics? The scientific objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of both statistical discrete response modelling and machine learning methods to maximize, separately or complementary, conversion rate on ecommerce platforms. By using the e-commerce platform Fatboy.com as test environment, in which both methods were required to handle the context-aware opportunities of contemporary online platforms, the potential in applicability of both methods could be examined. The objective within the case study Fatboy® was to understand how the conversion rates of e-commerce platforms can be maximized using statistical discrete response modelling, machine learning, or complementary to each other.","Machine Learning; FATBOY; STATISTICAL DISCRETE RESPONSE MODELLING","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Nowadays, electrosurgical units are part of the standard equipment in operation theatres worldwide, since electrosurgery comes with many advantages such as reduced blood loss. However, the technology of electrosurgery also carries several safety risks such as alternative electrical pathways or current leakage which often have burn wounds as a result. The problem is that electrosurgical equipment was not designed with the low-resource healthcare context in mind. And as research shows many hazardous situations are frequently caused by electrosurgical equipment use in low-resource countries (Oosting, 2018). The aim of this study is to determine how the low-resource healthcare context triggers safety risks to occur. Therefore, the general technology related risks, the journey of the electrosurgical equipment in terms of activities, and the user characteristics are researched. In the user study special attention is paid to the users’ knowledge about electrosurgery. The research data was collected by conducting a literature study, and by using a qualitative case study approach. In a Kenyan national hospital fourteen surgeries were observed and semi-structured interviews were held with users of the electrosurgical equipment. The data was used to map out the electrosurgical equipment journey including all the phases and activities the equipment is involved in. Additionally, user profiles were created. The results show that the electrosurgical equipment journey contains following phases: procurement, pre-treatment, surgical treatment, post treatment, maintenance, repair and disposal. The main users of the electrosurgical equipment are the biomechanical engineering technician (BMET), the nurse, the surgical assistant, the surgeon and medical students. What is striking is that only the BMET learn about the principles of electrosurgery during his/her education. <br/>The study results reveal that the interplay of safety risks generally related to electrosurgery, contextual factors, and user characteristics trigger several safety concerns. The risks lead from the selection of too high power settings to incorrect placement of the return electrode plate, and not knowing how to react in case of an system error. The study reveals that many of those safety concerns are caused by the medical staff’s lack of knowledge about the principles and risks of electrosurgery, and by an interface design that does not consider these user characteristics and needs. On this basis, a new interface of the electrosurgical unit and additional information stickers for safe equipment use are developed during this project. The equipment journey is used to pinpoint safety concerns and related root causes which are planned to resolve. Furthermore, the journey helps to determine where the design intervention should be placed. It is recommended to further develop the design concepts in the future and test their usability with intended users. The equipment journey for discovering safety concerns appeared not only to be valuable within this project. An evaluation of the equipment journey revealed that the tool is also valuable for other designers/researchers to empathize with the low-resource healthcare setting, and to gain insights into the journey of the equipment and the related safety concerns. Future research should explore if the equipment journey is also suitable for mapping out the journey and safety concerns of other surgical equipment.","Equipment Journey; Electrosurgery; Electrosurgical unit; Low-resource healthcare context; global health; Safety risks; Risk analysis; risk assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Preventive measures, such as implant surfaces with integrated antibacterial properties, are hence required. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has led to a growing interest in inorganic nanoparticles as antibacterial agents. In addition, implants should simultaneously stimulate bone tissue regeneration and integration to improve implant longevity. Additive manufacturing (AM) of orthopedic implants has attracted interest as improved bone tissue regeneration and integration was demonstrated by AM porous implants. AM porous implants, however, are at enhanced risks of IAIs; these porous implants require integrated antibacterial properties. This study focused on a systematic comparison of the antibacterial properties of AM porous Ti6Al4V implant surfaces with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) and/or zinc nanoparticles (Zn NPs) against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS.Medical grade porous Ti6Al4V implants were additively manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM). Subsequently, the SLM Ti6Al4V implants were biofunctionalized by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) using an electrolyte that consisted of Ca/P-based species and ratios of Ag NPs, Cu NPs and/or Zn NPs. Implants with 0, 25, 75 and 100% of Ag NPs, Cu NPs and/or Zn NPs were synthesized. After biofunctionalization, the surface morphology, structure and chemistry of the implants were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The antibacterial properties of the implants against MRSA were studied in vitro as well as ex vivo. The leachable antibacterial activity was studied in an agar diffusion assay, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Ag+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions was determined by a micro-dilution assay and the bactericidal activity of the implants was quantified by a colony-forming unit (CFU) count in vitro against surface-adherent and non-adherent MRSA. Furthermore, ex vivo antibacterial properties were determined using a femoral murine infection model mimicking the in vivo environment. RESULTS.Biofunctionalization of the porous SLM Ti6Al4V implants by PEO resulted in a uniform and homogeneous micro-/nano-porous oxide layer that covered the entire surface of the implants. SEM and EDS analysis demonstrated the presence of Ag NPs, Cu NPs and Zn NPs in the TiO2 surface layer. The agar diffusion assay demonstrated a strong leachable antibacterial activity for the implants with Ag NPs and Cu NPs or Zn NPs, while no leachable antibacterial activity was observed for implants without Ag NPs. Antibacterial testing showed that Ag+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions, as well the combinations of the ions, were growth inhibitory and bactericidal to MRSA. In addition, implants with ≥ 50% of Ag NPs and combinations of ≥ 75% of Ag NPs and Cu NPs or Zn NPs, fully eradicated surface-adherent and non-adherent MRSA within 24 h and prevented biofilm formation up to 24 h. Moreover, strong ex vivo bactericidal properties against MRSA were demonstrated for these implants within 24 h. CONCLUSION. Biofunctionalized surfaces with Ag NPs and Cu NPs or Zn NPs on porous SLM Ti6Al4V implants showed strong in vitro and ex vivo antibacterial properties against MRSA. The implants with 50% of Ag NPs and combinations of 75% of Ag NPs and 25% of Cu NPs or Zn NPs are promising for further development, to prevent IAIs and improve the longevity of the implants in clinical applications.","Plasma electrolytic oxidation; Silver; Copper; Zinc; Antibacterial properties; Additive Manufacturing; Titanium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-04","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

However, recent bed level information is not always available, especially not simultaneously resolved in space and time. Time series of radar backscatter images can be used to retrieve bed levels in the intertidal area with the so-called Temporal Waterline Approach (TWA) by Bell et al. [2016], yielding a two weeks average bathymetry at spatial resolutions in the order of a few meters. Bed levels are estimated for each radar cell individually by correlating temporal patterns of wet-dry transitions from the radar with hypothetical patterns found in the water level record for different tidal levels. In this study data recorded by a marine X-band radar located at Bunker Hill station (Sylt, German Wadden Sea island) is used to improve TWA, validate the improvement as well as to show its potential in application. A survey was conducted in May 2018 to provide ground truth. Two modifications are made, that improve robustness and reliability of TWA’s output by adding a second threshold and semi-automating the quality procedure. Root mean square error between radar-derived bathymetry (RDB)<br/>and ground truth for the intertidal area is 43 cm (bias 12 cm) on a 7.5 m squared grid. Sensitivity analysis of four parameters (i.e. vertical resolution, inclusion of wave induced effects on water level, length and position of analysis window, thresholds in quality check) reveals, that TWA is most sensitive to the choice of thresholds. Sensitivity analysis is utilized to tune TWA to achieve full coverage of the intertidal area (zero coverage elsewhere) with sufficient accuracy. Additionally it is found that at costs of accuracy the period for which averaged bed levels are retrieved can be shortened from 14.5 to 8.3 days. This is promising, because RDB potentially is able to observe short-term changes in the order of a few days (e.g. storm events). To demonstrate the value of the improved TWA for bathymetry surveys in intertidal areas the method is applied to a 3.2 km stretch of beach in front of Bunker Hill station, capturing the beach state variations in the course of 2017. During wind sea dominated season (winter) a ridge-runnel type of beach is present, that changes to a skewed transverse bar and rip system during swell dominated season (summer). The method is sufficiently accurate and robust for application and proves its potential to reveal new insights, e.g. indications on how the transition between two beach states evolves. In coastal science RDB could serve as a tool to improve existing theories by providing detailed information, that reveals underlying processes. In coastal engineering it fills gaps in monitoring schemes, for example to evaluate effects of nourishment strategies.","morphodynamics; X-band; intertidal; bathymetry mapping; Sylt; North Sea; Temporal Waterline Approach; remote sensing; intermediate beach; foreshore; radar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","54.790264776, 8.28322493"

Maintaining products is the most efficient way of retaining their desired level of performance. This is called Product care. Product care can be understood as any action that helps to prolong the lifetime of a product. The aim of this thesis is to explore how designers can stimulate users to perform product care activities. This goal has been reached through a practice-based approach and connecting it with strategies from existing literature. This took place at the University of Technology Delft. The context of Product care and the product care behavior of end-users have been researched through a diary study, a micro-emotion scan, creative sessions with design students and literature regarding repair and maintenance. This revealed two things, there are 7 types of product care and each user has a different profile regarding their skills, motivations and barriers. This shows that analyzing which type of product care you are aiming for and defining your specific user are essential requirements. To develop design strategies for Design for Product care various methods were used. A brainstorm session with designers was held to develop product solutions that stimulate product care. An ideation session was held by myself and real product examples were collected that already stimulate Product care. The product solutions were used to cluster into design strategies. The clustering process led to 8 design strategies: experiences, enabling, informing, change, reflecting, social, control and appropriation. hese can be linked to existing strategies and theories regarding Circular, Emotion-centered and Behavioral design. to transfer the knowledge about the design strategies to designers a design tool was developed. The process was iterative and the 2 biggest iterations were tested with design students and designers. These tests showed that a few important criteria for the test were that it should teach the designer about the different types of product care, the design strategies and they should take the type of user and product into consideration. The tool needs to provide a sense of structure, and still be flexible to fit everyone’s process. It should provide examples of how a design strategy is implemented into a design. The final tool is the Product Care Kit, a set of magnetic cards used for brainstorming, ideating and discussing. It presents the most important factors which influence Product care. The set consists of the following cards: persona cards, product cards, product care type cards, design strategy cards and example cards with product solutions for each design strategy. This tool helps to analyze and understand the context which you are designing for. It helps to create conceptual design ideas for product care. In the future this tool should be further evaluated with designers in practice and taught to design students.The outcomes of the tool should be validated by end-users. The tool can potentially lead to sustainable care behavior and lead to physically and emotionally durable products.","Design Tool; product care; Circular Economy; Design strategy; Sustainable behavior change; Circular design; emotion centered; behavioral design; product attachment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Bone graft substitutes, especially from biocompatible materials, can be used as a solution for lling up those defects. However, these cavitary bone defects differ in size and<br/>location. It would, therefore, be convenient to utilize an implant that can change its shape according to its surrounding 3D environment, meaning there is no need to customize the implant for every patient case. In the last decade, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have been the driving force behind the fabrication of complex three-dimensional objects. The various assets of these procedures enable the production of very complex designs with appropriate material properties. These materials that are engineered to exhibit certain properties are referred to as meta-materials. Functionalizing these materials on a nano-scale, to have certain biological or mass transport properties brings us to a new class of materials better known as meta-biomaterials. In this regard, highly deformable implants with novel properties can be referred to as meta-biomechanisms, consisting of multiple interconnected joints. The current research revolves around the direct fabrication of meta-biomechanisms using Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Subsequently, the general design recommendations and process constraints have been discussed briefly for the fabrication of mechanisms using SLM. In this regard, SLM poses an extra burden on the removal of supports, especially for the vulnerable geometries and within the joints clearance. Implementing a design approach, including both systematic and intuitive methods, was chosen as<br/>the main tool towards the accomplishment of the research aim. Consequently, new designs are proposed to minimize these undesirable events and the supports, with the subsequent challenge to obtain multi-joint mechanisms with increased Degrees of Freedom (DOF) and the least amount of supports. The rst joints have been successfully printed, as well as meshes of multiple joints. Surface Morphing Experiments were nally executed to classify them in terms of motion, taking into account the nal application. According to the results, the majority of the proposed meta- biomechanisms approach well the reference acetabular model, with an absolute difference below 1, reassuring the possibility of the proposed meta-biomechanisms as potential implants in cavitary bone defects. Besides the evaluation in terms of mobility, the structures were mechanically tested to derive their behavior under compression loading. The force needed to induce a sharp break was lower than the average peak force reported in hip joints during daily activities. Subsequently, the experiments revealed that their mechanical strength depends on the tting of the structures inside the acetabulum model. The bigger the gap between the structure and the acetabulum, the weaker the structure under compression loading. Overall, their scale and size should be optimized to sustain the average day-to-day forces joints are subjected to.","In-situ fabrication; Joints; Meta-biomechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

However, the system is currently open-loop controlled, meaning that the stimulation pattern cannot be influenced by the patient. Introducing closed-loop control with real-timemotion feedback is expected to improve activity-based plasticity and thereby the therapy, to which this thesis will be contributing. To be specific, this thesis investigates the possibility of a robust real-time gait event detection method for SCI patients, to be used to synchronize the stimulation to movement in real-time. The gait of SCI patients deviates remarkably from the gait of a healthy subject. We identified several factors contributing to the deviation and studied them separately. Datasets were created by mimicking various walking scenarios observed from video references of patients from the ongoing clinical study. A robust real-time gait detection method with three variations of it – one using zero crossings of angular velocity in sagittal plane, another using high frequency contents extracted using wavelet transform and a third using additional trunk kinematics - is proposed and tested in this study with IMU signals from foot, shank and trunk. The results were promising when tested on themimicked datasets and was then tested on the limited patients available. For patient with motor incomplete paralysis (AIS-D), the method seemingly identified events correctly 9 out of 10 times both for TO and HS detection. The performance dropped noticeably for TO detection (to around an F1 score of 0.24) for motor complete patient (AIS-B) while still maintaining the HS detection performance (at around an F1 score of 0.83). We conclude that patient-group-specific strategies might be necessary and that motor complete patients may require additional motion intention recognition strategies. In addition to this, a method to emulate IMU signals from motion capture datasets when limited number of markers are used, is also presented in this study, so as to be able to convert the already existing motion capture datasets to IMU datasets, and to time-synchronize these datasets explicitly when they are collected using independent sensors. Correlation values as high as 0.977 were observed between the emulated IMU signals (sagittal plane angular velocity) and that of the actual IMU signals.","real-time; gait detection; spinal cord injury; EES; IMU; emulation; neurostimulator; Systematic review; paralysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-03","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Praet, Robert (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The production of renewable energy is steadily going up, and as a result of the (almost) zero-marginal cost renewables, the marginal cost based electricity prices go down. While the need for backup generation increases due to the fluctuating availability of renewable energy, the generation units that supply electricity during demand peaks see their income per year drop. This trend could continue to a point where they are mothballed or shut down. As a result, different forms of capacity mechanisms are implemented all over the world, to prevent an increasing amount of blackouts. A capacity subscription market is a capacity mechanism in which consumers make monthly payments, related to the peak demand they want to consume during hours of shortage. Compared to other capacity remuneration mechanisms, this market has the advantage that consumers can choose and pay for their own security of supply. However, a capacity subscription market has not been implemented, and there has been limited scientific research into it. This study aims to give insight into the impact of implementation of a capacity subscription market.<br/>By means of an hourly dispatch model, plant profitability of all electricity generation plants in the Netherlands was estimated. Eight scenarios were used to determine the impact of capacity subscription, variating on the amount of renewable energy production as a result of the weather and the availability of interconnection. The impact of capacity subscription on reliability is positive, meaning there are less hours in a year where the amount of electricity supply is insufficient, and the total amount of unserved energy is lower. The results show that the price for capacity subscription would be around 5-30 €/kW/year. The price per year is dependent on the under- or overinvestment at that time. Because consumers can determine their own security of supply, the risk of underinvestment, black-outs, and thus peak prices is dependent on the risk taking behavior of consumers. While the total long term effect on affordability is unclear, the market is expected to become more efficient, as more demand response decreases the need for back-up generation. The implementation would reward consumer flexibility of consumption and could improve local congestion management. Therefore, a capacity subscription market is considered suitable to accommodate reliability in a 100% renewable market. However, if capacity subscription would be applied just in the Netherlands, the effect could leak away to neighboring countries. If there are shortages in countries with a high interconnection with the Netherlands, this could result in peak prices regardless of a capacity subscription market. It is therefore advised that either this market should be implemented in all coupled European electricity markets or other measures are taken to prevent peak prices caused by neighboring countries. Further research should look into design measures that could prevent this leaking effect.","Electricity market; Capacity subscription; Security of supply; Renewable energy; Demand response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Meander cutoffs and normalizations had mainly taken place between 16th and 19th centuries for navigability, and fixed layers, channel widening and side channels have been constructed in 20th and 21st centuries to mitigate river bed degradation and defend hinterland from flood. Dredging and nourishment have been actively conducted in the study area as well, and nourishment is more dominant than dredging in Niederrhein and Bovenrijn. Characteristic yearly discharges are estimated, which is highly fluctuating in time, and Bovenrijn discharge is distributed to about 64% and 36% for Waal river and Pannerdensch Kanaal respectively. According to data, discharge at Rees (Rkm 837) is higher than discharge at Lobith (Rkm 862) which is the most downstream station in the study area.

The airport is responsible for offering the best services to support the passengers in their journey. This includes the provision of products and services for easy and reliable landside connectivity.<br/>The Kiss and Ride at Schiphol faces capacity and congestion problems. These congestions result in an increase of the stress level of the passengers. This thesis proposes the use of a dynamic wayfinding system to ensure that drivers are well-informed about the traffic situation at Schiphol. Subsequently, the signs can be used to redirect the drivers in case of disruptions. The design exists of two parts, the dynamic traffic signs and the sensors. The sensors measure the number of cars and travel speed of the cars to provide an indication of the congestion level in the respective area. For the placement of signs, several principles are defined, such as the distance, height and frequency. Moreover, the content and dynamic elements of the signs are studied with experts to provide intuitive, compact but impactful information provision. The main benefit of the design is that the operation at Schiphol can take control in case of congestions/contingencies. As a result, unsafe situations can be prevented. Consequently, the insecurity levels of the passengers will be reduced by providing alternative routes.","Schiphol; Airport; landside; Traffic Congestion; passenger experience; Internet of Things; Wayfinding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Engineering firm Pieters Bouwtechniek Delft has designed many cantilevering elements in Compact Reinforced Composite over the past years. This material, often abbreviated as CRC, is an UHPFRC developed by Hi-Con Denmark and the material distinguishes itself from other concretes as it incorporates large volumes of steel fibres and reinforcement steel. As a result it is a ductile concrete type with outstanding crack controlling properties. One of the challenges met during designing with CRC is the fact that the Eurocode does not implement the improved properties of the material, such as the improved post-cracking response which is a result of the addition of fibres. This results in designs often requiring stirrups in order to comply with the Eurocode with regard to the shear capacity and the prevention of brittle failure.An example case where this problem was faced, is in the design of the landing platform in a staircase for the Raqtan project, engineered by Pieters Bouwtechniek. This design consist of a cantilevered platform, connected to a wall via a console. The Eurocode requires the addition of stirrups, while it is expected that these stirrups are not required in order to provide a sufficiently safe design. Therefore the following question was raised: Were stirrups required in the console in the design of the Raqtan landing platform in order to obtain a level of safety as required by the Eurocode? This report researched the structural response of the element without the application of stirrups in order to answer this question and determine whether the safety standards as stated in the Eurocode are met. The design without the stirrups is validated in three ways. The first method is by application of multiple design standards which incorporate a contribution by the fibres, such as the Model Code 2010 and the renewed French annex to the Eurocode. Most codes did not validate the design and predicted shear failure before the design load was reached. The French annex did validate the application of the design without stirrups. This is a result of the underlying principles used for this approach: the French guideline bases the tensile behaviour of the UHPFRC on the uni-axial tensile curve, while the other guidelines are based on the flexural tensile curve.The second validation method was through the Finite Element Method. Multiple tensile models were validated against previous experiments and were then used to determine the structural response and ultimate capacity of the Raqtan element. The models failed in bending at a capacity above the design load, thus validating the design. After the results were analytically validated, a variation study was performed on the influence of certain model properties on the structural response. The variations, such as the boundary conditions and mesh configuration, did not significantly influence the ultimate capacity. This analysis validated the application of the design without stirrups. The third and last validation was performed by testing multiple elements in the lab to find the actual capacity. Both elements without and with stirrups were tested to compare the resulting change in structural response. Some elements were reinforced to increase the bending capacity by at least 50%, as the FE models predicted failure in bending even when mean material properties were applied. The reinforced elements did not fail in shear as well, which demonstrated that the bending moment capacity was not only governing, but also significantly lower than the shear capacity. The derived design values for the ultimate load resulted in sufficient capacity for the element to resist the design loads.Combining the performed validations, it is concluded that the element's shear capacity was not governing for the ultimate resistance as it was at least 50% higher than the found the bending moment capacity. This bending moment capacity was sufficient according to all applied codes. When this capacity is taken as the total capacity of the element, it can be stated that the element complies with the codes and therefore provides a level of safety as required by the Eurocode.","Compact Reinforced Composite; CRC; Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete; UHPFRC; stirrups; shear; FRC; Fibre Reinforced Concrete; design validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-01","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The research conducted from this problem focused on the textile industry and the shopping behavior of teenage girls, in order to answer the research question: How to lower the threshold for teenagers to repair their own clothes?<br/><br/>After investigated the topic of clothing repair and teenage shopping behavior, it appeared that most teenagers buy new clothes because their changes in fashion style and their need to express themselves though clothes. From there on the project focus shifted to creating a pleasant first time experience to make teenagers familiar with clothing repair, and making it possible to upgrade clothes. By doing so, the user is possible to change clothes according to their own new wishes. <br/><br/>A target group research consisting of several interviews and a literature review gave a framework for the design project: in order to stimulate teenagers to start a project, they needed information on the subject, help with developing their crafting skills and motivation. The mentioned motivation needs to involve them personally. While they all want to work towards a green world without child labor, they did not feel the responsibility to change their own behavior to reach these goals.<br/><br/>By designing a concept and iterating it with multiple concept tests, a final concept was created. In this product teenagers are motivated by having the possibility to design with their own clothes and making it personal. They can look up information or inspiration in an online blog, buy do-it-yourself kits to practice and design at home, and have the possibility to go to a weekly crafting table to ask for help. The kits include guidelines on how to tackle a project and include tools to practice sewing. <br/><br/>At last, the design project included the creation of a brand and marketing strategy. The product is branded as a way of practicing your fashion design skills and being able to stay up-to-date with the latest fashion trends. It is thought that the product should be positioned as an alternative of buying new clothes, instead of a new sewing kit. The marketing strategy focusses on creating brand awareness, considering the product and brand are new to the market.

Information of different phases throughout the flapping cycle is obtained by means of a phase-locked averaging procedure. The MAV used for this study is called DelFly II. It is a platform composed a two pairs of wings attached to a slip body with horizontal and vertical tailplanes for stability and maneuverability. Measurements are performed at regular free-flight scenarios within the DelFly flying envelope. The configurations selected have different reduces frequencies which allows to analyze the effect of this important parameter. Same configurations are also measured with and without the presence of the tails to see their influence of the wake topology. In addition, experiments in both tethered and free-flight conditions have been performed, yielding an unprecedented comparison between the aerodynamics of the two conditions.<br/>The significance of the proposed project lies on the ability of assess the complete three-dimensional wake of the DelFly II. This is the first experimental study performed that can achieve such measuring volumes for any flapping-wing platform, to the knowledge of the present author. Another major benefit of this study is the use of standard flight configuration to observe the wake structures when the MAV is able to sustain level flight. Therefore, the proposed work is expected to be a relevant addition to the understanding of the flapping-wing mechanism.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

When climatic phenomena are considered in building design, architecture can generate an informed response through its geometry. By allowing the local climatic context to influence archetypes and low-tech design solutions, buildings become able to benefit from their environmental energy potential through architectural means. Such climate responsive buildings reflect their surroundings through architecture, making them highly location specific.

(mentor); Liu, G (graduation committee); Chen, X. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Several calculation models have been developed to predict the cutting forces in the linear rock cutting process. Rock failure can occur in different manners: brittle tensile, brittle shear and ductile. Each failure mechanism has a corresponding calculation model with specific cutting geometries and assumptions to predict the cutting forces as accurate as possible. However, several researches conducted in the past show that the predicted forces can differ considerably from the forces measured in the experiments. In this research the author proposes expansions to the existingmodels to increase the accuracy of the force predictions and thereby contribute to a more (cost) efficient cutting process. The calculation models considered in this research are based on two main assumptions: the cutting process is 3D and the tip of the cutting tool is sharp. In a 2D cutting process the width of the cut is equal to the width of the pick point and stays constant throughout the cut. During experiments the sideways outbreaking of rock pieces is observed which can increase the width of the cut tremendously and therefore increase the actual cutting forces. This sideways outbreaking makes the rock cutting process in fact a 3D problem. The assumption of a sharp cutting tool results in another inaccuracy in the force predictions. A sharp cutting tool will penetrate the rock more easily and create a clean cut. If the sharpness of the cutting tool decreases, for example due to wear and tear during the cutting process, a crushed zone will appear in front of the cutting tool, while a wear flat arise at the tip of the cutting tool. These phenomena result in extra forces that has to be overcome by the cutting force. For large cutting depths these effects might be negligible, but for small cutting depths these forces need to be considered. In some applications in the offshore environment only small cutting depths are encountered, such as the vertical drilling for monopile installation or the scraping techniques used in the oil and gas industry. An expansion to include these phenomena in the force prediction models would therefore be a widely applicable concept. After conducting experiments on sandstone samples the magnitudes of the 2D force prediction models, the forces due to the 3D effects and the indentation forces are established. Afterwards the empirical relations of these terms are composed based on the rock characteristics and cutting geometry. The results of this research show that the proposed expansions increase the accuracy of the cutting force predictions tremendously. It also shows that for cutting at a very small depth the forces predicted by the 2D models are negligible compared to the 3D expansion and the indentation expansion, but the 2D models are necessary to calculate the angle and length of the shear plane. However, if the cutting depth increases the indentation force converges to a constant value and the influence of the 3D expansion decreases as well, while the forces in the 2D models increase. The author therefore suggests to keep the 2D effects into the equation to keep the total formula broadly applicable.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""
