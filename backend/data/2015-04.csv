(mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Mortier, H. (mentor)","2015","This thesis is focusing on the building damage parameters monitoring techniques and the validation of the current damage prediction methodology on building response next to deep excavations. Settlement risk assessments were done in Delft tunnel project to define and control the risk of damaging the adjacent buildings to the tunnel by following the LTSM methodology steps. Deformations were predicted for every building according to the allowable building damage category and limits were set for every execution phase. Prisms were installed on the buildings facades and these were targeted by robotic total stations hourly, so the horizontal and vertical deformations of the buildings facades were monitored during the execution. Limits were set then on horizontal/vertical displacements per execution phase by assuming that the building actual performance would be similar to the predicted one in the deformation models so the damage criteria of horizontal strain-angular distortion were transformed into horizontal-vertical displacements of a façade prism. The actual damage parameters calculation of horizontal strain/angular distortion per execution phase through a spreadsheet showed that the façade prism cannot be representative for the whole facade as the actual façade status in Boscardin and Cording (1989) graph was in different position than it should be. Moreover, the side walls are more susceptible to damage than the façade as it was seen in the Westvest 5a building. A total station should be used to monitor building deformations but with monitoring points (prisms) installed at all visible building walls and measured during the execution works so the damage parameters to be properly calculated. Thus the actual building status (performance) can be accurately presented and directly compared with the predefined deformations limits (criteria) at every execution phase. For the calculation of façade’s horizontal strain, backside prisms should be used or the one at the most distance to the façade of the side walls. Plus, a bed joint measurement at major execution phases would indicate the critical hogging/sagging areas of the side walls. In case of excessive deformations, a flexible/weak building will tend to follow the greenfield deformations and there will be possible damages on the walls due to differential settlements but the stiff/strong building will rotate and move as a rigid body so no damages expected to be seen. Attention should be given on the free standing buildings, the ones with no buildings next to them as it seems that these are free to move parallel to the building pit and this movement can lead to greater values on the critical damage parameters. Limiting Tensile Strain Method is a practical tool to predict building deformations, conservative most of the times but quite reliable. In cases where special execution techniques are applied or there are critical buildings adjacent to deep excavations then special calculations methods should be used where all available data (building-soil conditions-execution) are imported into sophisticated finite element models (2D-3D) for accurate deformations prediction. At the last step of LTSM, the building is categorized in a damage class and allowable deformations limits are set in Boscardin and Cording (1989) graph (criteria). The actual building status then can be controlled during execution when the damage parameters of horizontal strain and angular distortion are monitored and consequently presented on the graph (performance). In general the damage criterion of Boscardin and Cording (1989) is relatively precise but in cases of excessive deformations it will probably over- / under- estimate the actual damage.","deep excavations; building; damage criteria; deformations; monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

A collective anomaly is a collection of data instances of which the individual data instances may not be anomalies by themselves, but their occurrence together is anomalous with respect to the entire data set. An essential part of a collective anomaly detection technique is the manner in which instances are grouped. A dependency is a statistical relation between two events. When two events are dependent, the occurrence of one event affects the probability of occurrence of the other. For multi-dimensional data, dependencies can be used as a method to group instances for collective anomaly detection. When used in this manner, a dependency becomes an abstract object describing a collection of instances that are related in a statistically significant way. This exploratory study demonstrates the potential of using dependencies to find collective anomalies. During the research, anomalies have been found that no other method currently available would have been able to detect.","anomaly; dependency; log","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information Systems","","Information Architecture","",""

(mentor); Hartjes, S. (mentor)","2015","Aviation has a significant impact on the global atmosphere. Next to particle and gas emissions, the increase of cloud cover might increasingly contribute to aviation induced climate change. Water contained in the exhaust of jet engines locally raises the relative humidity levels sufficiently for contrail formation to occur. These contrails can persist and evolve into anthropogenic clouding, often indiscernible from natural clouding, in case the ambient atmosphere is saturated. With the projected continued growth of air traffic, increasing propulsive efficiencies and possible introduction of fuels with higher hydrogen to carbon ratios, the importance of contrail mitigation is likely to increase. In this study, contrail mitigation by means of flexible free flight was studied, as this is likely the most efficient (short term) mitigation strategy. Contrail avoidance strategies by means of flexible free flight have been in use with air-forces around the globe for some decades. For commercial aviation however, the implementation of any such strategies, requires a thorough assessment of cost-effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding of the wider context of the problem, next to this a viable proposal is made for a short term contrail mitigation strategy. In this research, the formation of contrails and the costs and benefits associated with contrail mitigation is studied. A tool has been developed so that time and fuel burn optimal trajectories can be determined, while mitigating the formation of persistent contrail formation. Flexible free flight in four dimensions forms the basic means by which the optimisation tool can help evading regions prone to persistent contrail formation. The tool has been designed to rely on up-to-date meteorologic Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP), made available by meteorologic institutes. Test cases have been performed under realistic atmospheric conditions, using the Temperature, Pressure, Specific Humidity and Wind vector output from Numerical Weather Predictions, generated by the Canadian National Meteorologic Institute. With the, there from obtained results, an indication for the technical feasibility of this contrail mitigation strategy for commercial aviation has been created. This study has shown it is technically feasible for commercial aviation to evade contrail regions, thereby greatly reducing the effective anthropogenic cloud cover. The obtained results, clearly indicate persistent contrail formation can be avoided, at the cost of increased fuel consumption. The contrail reductions are more than sufficient to offset the additional CO2 emission, induced by the increases in fuel burn, leading to large scale reductions in the flights effective Radiative Forcing. The case dependency of contrail mitigation costs are susceptible to ambient atmospheric conditions. Indicating the great potential of using up-to-date atmospheric data over parametrized and more generic models often used in climate studies. The implementation of realistic, high resolution atmospheric data, significantly impacts the optimal trajectory in a number of ways. Deviations indicate that the realistic non-uniform temperature distribution can significantly affect the path constraints and hence the optimal trajectory. The inclusion of realistic wind data enhances the accurate representation of commercial aviation. For contrail mitigation, trajectory adjustments in the vertical plane are seemingly preferred over adjustments in the horizontal plane. This is due to the large horizontal extent and limited vertical thickness of contrail regions. A number of characteristic contrail evading manoeuvres are seen in the vertical flight trajectory. The sensitivity case analysed herein indicates, 90% of the induced contrails can be mitigated against an increased fuel consumption of less than 1.5%. The marginal costs of contrail mitigation are shown to be non-uniform. The more contrails are avoided, the higher the fuel burn penalty becomes. It might therefore be more cost effective for commercial aviation to implement a partial `contrail-reduction' plan rather than a `zero-tolerance on contrail' strategy. The great merit of implementing flexible free flight contrail mitigation in commercial aviation has been shown. This study presents an academic methodology potentially forming the basis for a commercial tool, to be used for scheduling of environmental optimal trajectories throughout the aviation sector. This would enable airliners to optimise their fleet movements while accounting for both economic and ecological impact factors.","contrail mitigation; green; sustainable; aviation; anthropogenic clouding; climate change; optimal control; optimisation; GPOPS; aerospace engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Air Transport & Aerospace Operations","",""

(mentor); Vermeeren, A.P.O.S. (mentor); Aartsen, J. (mentor)","2015","Museon’s mission is to holistically educate the broad public on the relationship between nature and culture, specifically targeted to families with children and school groups. In light of renewal plans, Museon sought external input on ways to improve their permanent exhibition. The project included an extensive research about Museon and its visitors as well as the design of a concept for the new exhibition and recommendations for the museum. Two major findings are that the current exhibition setup lacks transitions between the various themes it addresses, making it hard for visitors to follow the narrative, or “red line”, of the permanent exhibition. This consequently impacts parents’ ability to relate to and communicate this narrative with their children, impairing children’s retained learning and overall impression upon leaving the museum. Furthermore, it was observed that the majority of families visiting the museum have younger children than the museum currently targets (children aged 3-12 instead of 8-14) and that the intellectual needs of this younger target group are barely considered, often resulting in disruptions to family communication. In order to address these two shortcomings, the design process investigated ways to create a narrative experience across the permanent exhibition. Transitions in between adjacent exhibition topics were designed in order to create an understandable flow for the visitors. A concept proposal was designed for the food exhibition, in which different information levels were created to trigger learning and communication across all family members. A deliberate effort was made to include the needs of young children (aged 3-5) in the learning interaction, in order to promote active family communication. The project outlines approaches for how the museum can adapt its exhibition to fit the needs of its focus group while creating unity in its narrative, and how it can communicate these changes to its visitors. A prototype was built to illustrate one aspect of the total concept, and was tested on families with children by observing their interactions with the prototype in the museum. The main findings of the testing highlighted that although users engaged with the exhibit element and discussed it as a family, younger children were still over-challenged by the installation due to it being too textual. Families with older children, on the other hand, were sufficiently stimulated. The project highlights recommendations for how to further adapt the entire exhibition as well as the prototype concept to the needs of families with children. These recommendations outline how to appropriately provide clear orientation and subtle guidance, as well as how to layer and adjust the information to the demands of different target groups, in order to achieve a satisfying visitor experience.","museum; exhibition; family interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Consequently, more sediments is expected to be transported to the river, thus polluting it. This research focuses on the modelling of the hydrology and soil loss from the catchment to locate the main sources of transported suspended sediment in the Mara River Basin. The suspended load in the river consists of coarse sediments in the river bed and fine sediments in the wash load originating from the top soil in the entire catchment. The main sources of the coarse sediments are assessed hydraulically whereas for the fine sediments a hydrological model is combined with an empirical sediment yield model. The main sources for the fine suspended sediments are the grasslands in the Sand and the crop lands in the Lower sub-catchment. The coarse sediments are found to originate from the river itself which has caused and still causes meandering.","hydrology; sediment; FLEX-Topo; MUSLE; soil loss; sediment transport; model; Mara; Kenya; turbid; water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","NUS-TUD Double MSc Degree Programme","","-0.75730833, 35.34596944"

(mentor)","2015","Scientific research is scarcely used for policy making (Hickey, Forest, Sandall, Lalor, & Keenan, 2013). The problem is as much a lack of communication of research results as a mismatch between the information produced by scientists and the information needed by the decision maker (Hickey et al., 2013; Timmerman, 2004). This information gap is a problem all over the world, but it is perhaps an even more important issue in the Nile River Basin. The Nile river flows through eleven countries and these countries have to share its relatively small flow of 84 BCM (as measured at Dongola, Sudan). There have been several Nile treaties that allocate shares of the Nile waters to the various countries and try to ascertain that there will always flow sufficient water to the downstream countries (Salman, 2013). The latest treaty, which is still operative, is the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement (Nile Treaty, 1959). This agreement, between Egypt and Sudan, divides the complete flow of the Nile between these two countries. The other countries do not accept this treaty and claim that they also have the right to use (part of) the Nile waters. That this gives rise to conflicts is no surprise, especially in the Eastern Nile Basin, which includes both the biggest consumer of (Egypt) and the biggest contributor to (Ethiopia) the Nile flows. While scientists of the different countries are able to work together, they are not able to communicate their research findings to the decision makers and therefore, the conflict at the decision making level remains. Bridging the information gap is an important step in bringing the countries towards further cooperation. The water accounts of the Nile Basin (Karimi, Bastiaanssen, & Molden, 2013) might provide a useful tool in bridging this gap. Because of their tangibility, transparency and integrated approach, they might be a more comprehensible and trusted resource for the policy makers in the Eastern Nile countries. The aim of this research was therefore to identify and describe the information gap and determine whether Water Accounting + can indeed help in bridging it. There are two sides to the information gap: (1) the decision makers’ information needs and (2) the information provision by the scientists. This includes not only the information itself, but also the presentation and the way it is communicated. The decision makers’ information needs were assessed using open, in-depth interviews. Five elements of useful research were derived from the information needs: multidisciplinarity, relevance, usefulness, presentation and trust. Additionally, a framework for the evaluation of water resources and hydrological models was developed based on a literature review. The framework was adapted according to the interviews results. Both the elements of useful research and the framework were used to evaluate the research that is done by the scientific community of the Eastern Nile. The models used and developed by the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office, as well as the research presented at the New Nile Opportunities Conference and the publications on water resources management in the Nile of the year 2014 were evaluated to determine their usefulness for decision making. Comparing the two sides enabled the identification of the information gap. On one side of the gap are the decision makers. They need multidisciplinary research that is tuned to their personal needs and the needs of society. It should be relevant (i.e. address an issue that the decision maker wants to solve) and provide plans and options, with pros and cons. It should be presented in a short message, avoiding jargon and provided by someone they trust. The analysis of the research that is done by the scientific community shows that the scientists are producing research on the technical aspects only, not taking into account the socioeconomics or other aspects. Also, their research is not focused on the needs of the countries and generally does not provide any plans. ENTRO is highly restricted by its mandate and can only disseminate its research outcomes if the countries all agree on the outcomes. With the information gap identified the usefulness of Water Accounting + in bridging this gap was assessed. The water accounts were evaluated using the framework and on their compliance with the elements of useful research. Additionally, the interview respondents were asked for their opinion on Water Accounting +. Both decision makers and scientists think that Water Accounting + is a useful concept and that it can give the decision makers a basic understanding of the water resources in a river basin. It can provide a more multidisciplinary approach to water resources management, provided that the socioeconomic aspects are included. However, Water Accounting + should, just like other research, try to address issues relevant to the countries and provide clear messages and options for the decision makers. Trust is a very important issue. The decision makers in the countries are not likely to trust any other data than their own, nor will they trust a scientist they do not know. This problem can be partly dealt with by validating the accounts together with national experts and international peers. Also, it is probably better to target the decision makers’ advisors instead of the decision makers themselves when presenting the accounts. It is recommended to construct water accounts on national level and address the current needs of the individual countries. Once the water accounts are accepted at a national level, they might be trusted to give basin wide solutions, as well.","information gap; water resources; Eastern Nile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

(mentor); Van Gerwen, D. (mentor)","2015","Physicians use small variations in the needle insertion force to identify tissue properties and detect membrane punctures during needle insertion. Navigation of a needle towards the target tissue, for example to take a biopsy, is often based on detecting these variations in force. Literature shows that presenting physicians force feedback based on forces on the needle tip instead of forces sensed by the physician at the hub of the needle, results in improved detection of membrane puncture events. Measurement of forces on the needle tip is also of interest for other applications like research on needle-tissue interaction forces. The currently studied FBG-based (optical) sensors for the measurement of forces on the needle tip suffer from a cross-sensitivity to temperature, which causes large measurement errors when the needle is inserted into the body of a patient. This thesis investigated several concepts for the design a force sensor based on a fiber-optic Fabry-Pérot interferometer to measure forces on the tip of a core biopsy needle. Special attention was given to concepts for a force sensor with an intrinsic low cross-sensitivity to temperature. Three concepts, using either a quartz glass capillary, an Invar capillary or a thin polyimide film to convert force on the needle tip to a quantity measurable by the Fabry-Pérot interferometer, were investigated in more detail by means of (FE-)modeling and testing of prototypes. Usage of a quartz capillary resulted in a sensor with a very low cross-sensitivity to temperature of 12mN/°C and a good accuracy for the measurement of static forces (maximum observed measurement error of 65mN for a range of 10N). Limited strength of the sensor is however expected to prevent usage of the concept for small diameter needles. Prototypes of concepts using an Invar capillary or polyimide thin film did not perform equally good, although they are better suited for real applications due to better strength, while the latter concept could be suited for the design of a flexible, entirely MRI-compatible polymer needle. Suggestions for methods to improve the measurement accuracy of the latter two prototypes were presented. It was concluded that a triaxial instead of uniaxial force sensor will be required to pursue a very high accuracy by compensating for measurement errors due to transverse forces on the needle tip. Usage of low coherence interferometry was furthermore identified to be better suited than homodyne interferometry to interrogate the FPI-based sensors in most occasions and enable the design of a sensor with an intrinsic low cross-sensitivity to temperature without using highly dimensionally stable but fragile materials like quartz glass.","needle tip; force sensor; fiber-optic; Fabry-Pérot interferometer; cross-sensitivity temperature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Plooij, M. (mentor)","2015","Locking mechanisms are used in a wide range of applications including energy saving mechanisms in the field of robotics. In this thesis a new class of locking mechanisms is investigated: a combination between a singular- and a friction locking mechanism (singular-friction locker) which is statically balanced with one additional spring. This combination of three types of locking mechanisms results in a locking mechanism that has an infinite number of locking positions, can unlock well under load and has an absolute zero actuation force in a singular configuration. In all other configurations the mechanism is theoretically in static balance. The first part of this thesis investigates rigid body type statically balanced singular-friction lockers (SBS-FLs) and works towards a classification of all possible classes of SBS-FLs. This classification contains nine types of rigid body SBS-FLs, consisting of one linkage type class of lockers and eight cam type classes of lockers. In the second part of this thesis different embodiments of SBS-FL mechanisms are investigated on their ability to become a very compact locking device. From five different concepts the highest compactness is obtained by a locking mechanism with a rotational cam input and a rotational follower connected to torsion springs. This mechanism is build and all design aspects are reported. In the third and last part of this thesis the performance and the characteristics of the prototype are investigated. The locking device has a zero actuation torque in the 'engaged' and 'disengaged' (singular) configurations and a maximum actuation torque of 0.035 Nm when switching 'on' and 'off' in 5 seconds. This is a 97% reduction of the actuation torque compared to a regular brake. The maximum braking torque is 0.83 Nm in clockwise direction and 0.75 Nm in counter clockwise direction. The locking device has a diameter of 55 mm and a length of 23 mm. This efficient and small cam based prototype seems to be the most promising approach to statically balanced locking and can find its use not only in robotics but also for example in cars, trucks, bikes and trains.","Static balance; locking device; torsion spring; singular configurations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2015","The concept of the More Electric Aircraft, where the majority of the aircraft’s secondary needs will be supplied by electrical power, is under continuous research over a number of years in order to conform the recent demand for more efficient and environmentally friendly aircrafts. Advancements in power electronics have contributed towards the realization of that demand, by introducing lightweight, high-power density and highly efficient in harsh environment power electronics. The increase in power density of power electronic systems was made feasible, so far, by developments in the semiconductors field, namely by semiconductors that can operate at higher switching frequencies and generate less power loss. Wide-bandgap devices, such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors, have emerged as possible candidates to replace silicon and even silicon carbide devices in various power conversion applications offering potential benefits for high frequency power conversion due to their intrinsic material properties. Another step towards higher power densities is to utilize appropriate circuit topologies since they can reduce the stress upon the components and the cooling requirements. However, as the frequency goes up, the switching behavior of the device is not only influenced by the die itself and the device package’s and circuit’s parasitic elements can not be neglected any more. One of these parasitic elements is the the equivalent parasitic capacitance (EPC) of the magnetic component, which is part of almost every topology. This thesis project aims at two things: first, to observe the switching behavior of a high-voltage cascode GaN High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) under inductive clamped load condition, which is the same commutation mode for the power devices as switching in a PWM, hard-switching type converter and second, to investigate the influence of the magnetic component’s EPC on the switching behavior of the GaN HEMT. For this, an analytical loss model of the device was developed and a double-pulse tester (DPT), which is considered to be a very good example of that load condition, was optimally designed and manufactured in order to verify the analytical model. Two pulses are launched to the device under test (DUT) and the switching transitions of the DUT can be captured for any desired current and voltage rating under hard-switching conditions. Moreover, when operating under that load conditions, applying active devices with reverse recovery charge has significant influence on the switching behavior of the DUT, so both cases will be examined. Finally, in order to characterize the device and eventually verify the analytical loss model, current and voltage measurements need to be taken during the turn-on and turn-off switching transitions. As the GaN HEMT is capable of switching are very high speed, there are issues and limitations that need to be taken into consideration in order to ensure the fidelity and the accuracy of these high frequency measurements","Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT); cascode configuration; double-pulse tester (DPT); analytical model; hard switching; inductor's equivalent parasitic capacitance (EPC)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","","",""

This platform gives international organisations interested in ASC’s partners the ability to submit a request, which is reviewed by its partners to give a clear ‘yes or no’ to host this organisation in Amsterdam or not. Connecting these international organisations and partners in an early stages enables identification of opportunities for city collaboration to tackle urban issues together. In addition, partners are able to spot their own international opportunities abroad to expand their market. Lastly, given the input that is required from these international organisations, a database is built with valuable data about international urban development. This is highly valuable for the municipality of Amsterdam. This not only gives them the ability to compare its city’s development stage with other cities, but also gives all Amsterdam the ability to help create a smarter world.","smart city; platform; international collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Klievink, A.J. (mentor); De Reuver, G.A. (mentor)","2015","Governments all over the world seek to increase the quality of public e-services offered to citizens. One way of doing this is through collaboration with private sectors and citizens in delivering the e-services. Yet, there is little discussion about their collaboration in stage models that provide a guide in public e-service development. Meanwhile, in the field of technological platform, collaboration among multi parties is discussed in the concept of platform as a medium to generate products or services. However, the concept of platform is still rarely incorporated into public e-service development. Hence, there is a lack of research in the platform development for public e-service provision. This research explores the application of the concept of platform in public e-service development. To do so, a platform development model for governments, which consists of stages, is constructed by conducting three main steps. First, stage models that represent public e-service development and platform development are synthesised by following qualitative meta-synthesis methodology. Second, each stage of the model is analysed by employing platform business model components as the attributes. Third, case studies is conducted to evaluate the model. In our findings, five stages of the platform development model are identified delineating the application of the concept of platform in delivering public e-services. Although evaluation cannot be carried out pertaining to the structure of the stages due to limited data, the five stages of the model describe alternatives for governments to collaborate with private sectors and/or citizens in improving the service provision quality. Moreover, description of the state of the art in platforms as a medium for multi parties collaboration in public e-service provision can be gained from the case studies. Yet, we suggest further research in order to refine the model. The analysis of the model can be improved through multiple-case studies for each stage of the model. In addition, circumstances under which a platform evolves from a stage into another could be identified, for example by taking into account the organization’s capabilities and needs, through case studies with more reliable research data.","platform; public e-service; collaboration; government; private sector; citizens","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis, and Management","",""

(mentor); Speelman, L. (mentor)","2015","Atherosclerosis is a progressive arterial disease in which fatty tissue accumulates in the arterial wall. Due to this lipid uptake, the artery thickens and can eventually rupture, causing the lipids to flow into the bloodstream and form blood clots. If this happens in the carotid arteries, which supply the head with oxygenated blood, a stroke can be the result. If a rupture of an atherosclerotic site, called a plaque, occurs in a coronary artery, a heart attack can be the consequence. If a patient is diagnosed with a rupture prone plaque, several intravascular procedures can be performed to remove the rupture risk. Since current clinical diagnostic tools are of limited value in predicting rupture risk, new methods are being developed. One of those methods is biomechanical modeling of plaques. With the use of Finite Element Analysis, the stresses in the plaque are being calculated and the stress levels are used as indicators of rupture risk. Currently used biomechanical models assume homogeneous material distributions of the materials that are present in the plaque. However, especially the inner layer of the artery, called the intima, is far from homogeneous in atherosclerotic arteries. Since no previous studies included heterogeneity in plaque stress calculations, the first goal for this study was to create a method in which heterogeneity is included in plaque stress analyses. In stead of using Finite Element software in the conventional way, in which homogeneous sections are created, each individual element has its own material model. Hence, a completely heterogeneous distribution of material properties can be simulated. To validate the method of individually assigning material properties to each element, a comparison between the conventional and the new approach is performed. Since the conventional approach is unable to include heterogeneity, the comparison was performed on homogeneous models. The resulting differences were significantly small enough to validate the new approach and the first research goal is met. The second goal of this study is to determine the influence of heterogeneity on stress levels in the plaque. For this study, 12 images of plaques were available and for each plaque 100 different heterogeneous stiffness distributions were created. The distributions were based on grayscale values and on stiffness values reported in literature. Besides 100 heterogeneous calculations, also a homogeneous calculation per plaque was performed, to be able to compare the two approaches. It was found that heterogeneity has a large effect on stresses in the plaque. The mean stress of the heterogeneous calculations was generally close to the homogeneous stress, the mean relative difference is 5 ± 15.8%. However the variation that was found in the heterogeneous calculations was considerable in each plaque. Standard deviations, relative to the mean, ranged from 14% up to 75%. To increase the mechanical knowledge on plaque stress analyses, correlations between stiffness of different locations and stress levels were statistically determined. Although the setup of the study was not ideal for this task, some relations were found. It was found that the stiffness of a thin layer that separates the lipids from the lumen, called the cap, was most influential on the relevant stress levels in the plaque. Since it is currently not efficient to perform a large number of heterogeneous calculations, it would be valuable to be able to predict the range that is introduced by adding heterogeneity to the equation. To accomplish this, correlations between geometrical properties and variation in stress levels were determined. Two relations were found. A larger lumen and a thinner cap lead to more variation. It can be concluded that both goals were met in this study. Heterogeneity is successfully added to biomechanical modeling of plaques and it was found that heterogeneity has a strong influence on stress levels in the plaque.","Biomechanical modeling; stress analysis; heterogeneity; atherosclerosis; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Vroom, R.W. (mentor); Romijn, P. (mentor)","2015","The East African motorcycle transport industry is one of the fastest growing motorcycle markets in the world. This has been due to a tremendous increase in wealth and standard of living over the last decades and the developments these factors trigger, such as road/infrastructure improvement and increase in quantity and quality of product-services. Motorcycles provide a quick, easy and financially accessible way for consumers to contribute to and profit from these developments. The vast distances in East Africa and the lack of a well-developed infrastructure require a smart, social and affordable motorcycle that KONEKSIE is currently developing for the taxi industry. At KONEKSIE, current design work (on both the product and the production system) has been focused primarily on their first motorcycle model, the ‘KIBO K150’. To be able to innovate in the future, it is necessary to broaden research and development activities to explore the opportunities for product portfolio expansion. As a start-up, however, KONEKSIE is faced with limited resources and is in need of an efficient and effective technical solution that enables future expansion. This project has taken on this design problem and has focused on the design of a technical motorcycle platform, which aims at reintegrating KONEKSIE’s existing technical design solutions and combining them with new design solutions to create a multi-purpose chassis platform. At its core, this technical innovation will be focused on connecting the design and the production of different motorcycle designs through a series of new and existing, interchangeable and reconfigurable design solutions. At the foundation of the platform design is a product roadmap, based on trends and developments from KONEKSIE’s market of operations: Kenya, East Africa’s leading economy. While focused on the Kenyan market, these identified market segments might also be relevant outside of East Africa, since the market developments that are at the bases of these segments, are occurring in numerous other countries and regions. The roadmap strategy is built on three high-potential (Kenyan) market segments: private and professional mobility (Type I), cargo focused mobility (Type II) and accessible mobility (TYPE III). KONEKSIE’s ‘K150’ has many commonalities with Type II and as such, an updated ‘K150’ perfectly caters to the cargo focused mobility segment. In the roadmap strategy, introduction of the Type II model serves as a transition phase towards introduction of the platform design. The platform design offers a multi-purpose solution that caters to private & professional mobility and accessible mobility. In the form of two motorcycle models, Type I and Type III, the platform is able to position two strongly differentiated models in the market, while minimising the amount of unique component designs necessary. The multi-purpose ‘design core’ of the platform centres on the design of a new chassis that allows for multiple configurations to achieve different motorcycle types. Through the design of a single mainframe that is compatible with multiple subframes and engine types, the chassis platform is able to reach very different user groups. By offering different engine types and an active but professional riding experience, Type I caters to the needs of the growing entrepreneur and middle class citizen. Type III caters to the needs of the novice (female) rider, for whom ease of use is key. Usability and accessibility can be found in both its technical features (such as a semi-automatic gearbox) as well as in its relaxed and highly stable riding experience. In the platform design, the multi-purpose integration of two sets of technical and usability features does not lead to concessions, but to unification and harmonisation in design and production. The platform based design approach allows for model-bridging solutions, that bring down the amount of components. Through the design of custom chassis connectors, the platform design enables simple engine placement, provides footboard/footstep mounting points and introduces a separable connection for production and assembly optimisation. Together with the unique model-bridging design of the engine mounts, the platform’s crucial engine compatibility is established and concurrently minimisation of the total number of (unique) parts is further achieved. The reduced number of production moulds and tooling necessary, contributes greatly to reducing the need for new investments. However, an important part of the platform design’s investment reduction is achieved by reintegration of existing investments. Through analysis of time and capital investment related to the development of the ‘K150’ a number of investment intensive components were identified. The platform design has successfully reintegrated the main gusset plates, which required the most sizeable capital investment in the ‘K150’ design. Together with the near-complete adoption of the ‘K150’ swingarm assembly in the platform design and the standardisation of KONEKSIE bending tools, more than 60 percent of the original ‘K150’ chassis investment has been reinvested in the new Type I and Type III. Creation of a digital and physical prototype of the platform design has allowed for validation of the technical design, the usability and platform strategy. Technically, the design has been validated on its assembly, structural integrity and manufacturability. In CAD, an additional FEM analysis was conducted in order to improve the strength of a common weak point, the steering head tube area. In terms of usability, two user sessions have been held to assess ergonomics. Specifically, the Type III configuration was tested to improve mounting of the motorcycle by novice users, through the use of a lowering in the frame, the step-through. Finally, a comparison was made between a traditional non-platform based design approach and the proposed platform design approach to validate the platform strategy. Comparison results showed that implementation of a multi-purpose platform design strategy would require 41 percent less parts to be designed. As each design requires time and capital investment for its realisation and production, this would mean that the platform-based approach would save KONEKSIE a considerable amount on investment while still being able to provide the necessary differentiation and expansion within the market. The final platform design, focused on the rolling chassis, provides a great foundation for further development of a complete motorcycle platform. The design of the rolling chassis is an important, first part of a whole.","motorcycle; automotive; design; platform; prototype","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor)","2015","The realisation or delivery of a business opportunity in Shell is all about delivering value to the Company and its shareholders. The early identification and understanding of value drivers - i.e. how value will be generated by an opportunity - is of critical importance. Shell has adopted a structured process to progress a hydrocarbon (development) business opportunity through a number of steps each with a check point from Identify through Assess, Select, Define, Execute to Operate. At each of the check points or “stage gates” care is taken to confirm that the value drivers remain respected. Typical of such value drivers are Cost, Production, Schedule, Applica-tion of Standard Solutions, Ability to Replicate / Repeat, Operational Reliability, Reputation and HSSE. In upstream projects, the objective of the Assess phase is to identify a number of feasible con-cepts to take into the next phase. The intent here is to think ‘wide’, keeping in mind whatever value drivers have been deemed important but by the end of the phase to have already narrowed it down to a more limited number of feasible options. To facilitate and simplify offshore development concept selection bearing in mind the value driver parameters of cost, schedule, standardization and replications, Shell Global Solutions has commissioned an improvement of the current selection procedure. Historically, whenever a new project or business opportunity screening has been initiated, the tendency has been to kick off the “engineering” of a number of possible solutions. However, there is a growing global data set of Shell and other industry solutions for analogous prospects or field developments which could be drawn upon as the solution. Unfortunately, the data is not structured or organized in such a way that concept engineers could screen options with the degree of confidence required to support quality decisions at the Assess stage gate. To address this issue, the decision was taken to create an Offshore Concept Selection Guideline. The purpose of the Guideline is two-fold. Firstly it gives a complete overview of all the possible concepts applicable to offshore hydrocarbon developments covering the spectrum from shallow to very deep water. Secondly it contains a procedure to assist all those tasked with concept de-velopment & selection to rapidly and confidently screen possible concepts and land on the one or two most suited to the conditions applicable to the offshore region under consideration. Fi-nally a validation method is used, to prove that the concepts that have currently been placed across the world are the right options for consideration if a project would occur in that location again. One development concept still at an early stage in terms of maturity is that of the ""Subsea Stor-age Unit"". If this concept is proved and accepted, it could have a significant impact on options for the storage of produced hydrocarbons either during extended well testing or as part of the preferred field development. In addition, it could allow for the storage of fluids required as part of the reservoir depletion process. The net benefit is one of decreasing weight either above or just below the sea surface with consequent impact on cost and (potentially) schedule. However, such a concept introduces challenges as well as opportunity. The challenges and how they could be addressed range from installation, scour and stability to eventual re-floating and recovery.","offshore concept selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Bottom founded & Floating Structures","",""

It describes in detail the development of the prototype, the study of data processing algorithms and the implementation of firmware on the probe FPGA. The algorithms and implementations of data readout, timestamps sorting and filtering, and time mark estimation with order statistics are of particular interest because of the use of a tiny and resource-limited FPGA in the probe.

The gas supply is generally limited in such applications, and calls for an optimal system pressure to minimize gas-consumption. Previous work which discusses the optimal pressure was not verifiable, or strictly theoretical. The theoretical work was unintuitive, but did result in an optimal pressure level of 1.2 MPa, irrespective of the required output force. This research presents a simplified theoretical background, and verifies the optimum by measurements. The simplified theory offers improved insight into the existence of an optimal supply pressure and locates it at 1.42 MPa. Compensation for atmospheric pressure strongly affects cylinder size at low system pressures and above the optimum, as CO2 approaches its critical point, gas consumption increases with the density of the gas. The experiments show an optimum at 1.12 MPa, with a bound of -0.10 MPa and +0.30 MPa. The uncertainty in the location of the minimum gas-consumption reflects the challenges of accurately performing the measurements, as well as the shallow curve where the minimum is found. The presented results support the optimal supply pressure found in literature, and when optimizing a pneumatic system for CO2 use, 1.2 MPa is therefore a good choice.","pneumatics; CO2; gas-consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-05-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

One of the solutions considered is Design Thinking, but a pragmatic approach in how to implement this new way of thinking into the domain of innovation strategy is lacking. This thesis aims to bridge the worlds of Design and innovation strategy by the development of a Design Thinking tool for managers who are deal with innovation strategy. The foundation of the tool is the method Vision in Product Design, which is developed at the faculty of Industrial design engineering. This method is closely related to the mental process designers go through and is one of the few methods that captures the entire Design Process. The aim of this thesis is to modify the ViP method in a way that it can be used by managers who deal with innovation strategy. In order to develop the tool, insight in the domain of innovation strategy is needed. This was done by the use of the method Vision in Product Design. The method was used to analyze the current domain of innovation strategy and to create a vision on the future of the domain. This vision on the future of innovation strategy was used to develop the new tool. It became clear that a bridge had to be build between the two worlds, since the two are quite different. Valuable elements of the ViP method, that are also considered elements of Design Thinking, were selected and modified into different tools for the development of innovation strategy. This resulted in the trend predictor. Consumer trends are considered human behavior that is a reaction to changes in the environment. Human behavior is driven by deep human needs that every human being has. The tool therefore consists of a selection of 75 deep human needs that can be combined with different developments into new trends. It makes managers start from the users perspective, since it starts with selecting the needs from the user. It also makes managers think out of their own industry and relate to other industries. Both aspects strongly relate to the ViP method and Design Thinking. The tool helps managers to think a little bit more like a designer. Since so many elements are changing and because managers increasingly work globally, the tool is an online tool. The website is accompanied by a service system, to make managers familiar with the tool and to earn investments back. The tool is new, therefore this research is very explorative and much more research has to be conducted to validate the concept. Many more steps have to be taken before this tool and its service system can be implemented into the market, but it is expected to have a bright future.","innovation strategy; vision in product design; design thinking; tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","Recent years have seen a steep increase in research being performed towards active space debris removal: space debris has proven to be a very real threat to operational spacecraft, and studies indicate that the frequency of collisions will only increase if nothing is done to remove large pieces of debris. In particular, ESA has done studies towards removing Envisat from orbit, after communications were lost and were unable to be reestablished. To this end, a scenario was proposed in which a robotic chaser satellite would use a tether to interface with Envisat, either using a net or a harpoon, and proceed to deorbit the resulting tethered system. This research tackles two main challenges relating to this scenario. First, a suitable model for the tether was developed by discretizing the tether into a number of point masses and massless Kelvin-Voigt elements. The influence of the number of nodes was investigated, showing that increasing the number of nodes used does not significantly increase the fidelity of the solution. Therefore, it was chosen to model the tether with two nodes and three elements. Additionally, multiple combinations of tether length, stiffness, and damping were investigated. Second, a preliminary design for a guidance and control system was developed. This system uses multiple fixed-duration burns as the main deorbit strategy. The guidance system controls the relative state of the chaser with respect to the target during and after these main engine burns: during burns, a hold point is established at the equilibrium length of the tether, and during coasting phases the tether is kept slightly in tension to reduce target and tether motion. At the transition between thrusting and coasting phases, the thrust is gradually throttled down to further decrease these motions. The control system is designed to keep the chaser level with the local horizon at all times. During the design process, the performance of guidance and control systems based on linear quadratic regulators was used as a baseline for the same systems based on sliding-mode control. Furthermore, three different thrust levels for the deorbit burn were examined. It was found that the system based on sliding-mode control offered considerable performance improvements over the LQR-based system: total propellant consumption was reduced by an average of 48\%, while adhering to the same tolerances. Furthermore, it was determined that high thrust levels are desirable for both reducing propellant consumption as well as reducing target rotation. In terms of safety, collision can best be avoided by using lower thrust levels or longer tethers. While this seems to conflict with minimizing required propellant, minimal target rotation and minimal propellant consumption can still be achieved by using long tethers with high stiffness. Finally, it was found that while sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions, the precision of the terminal point is still high enough to allow the target to be deorbited in the South Pacific Ocean. This result was independent of tether model, although higher thrust levels do increase the precision further.","space debris; active debris removal; tether dynamics; guidance; control; sliding mode control; Envisat; lumped-mass model; Kelvin-Voigt material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-31","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","",""

A novel stiffness tuning design was shown to vary the stiffness of double pinned bi-stable beams by up to 80%.","static balancing; compliant mechanism; laparoscopic grasper; design method; stiffness tuning; beam boundary conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Mechatronic System Design","",""

The development of Best Value is a reaction to those needs and proposes a new way of thinking to improve the procurement and management of construction projects by reducing risk in selecting the top performer. Since its introduction in the Netherlands in 2005 the approach is constantly developing. As more experience from undertaken projects is gathered new insights are incorporated into the procedure.

(mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Robbemont, A.J. (mentor)","2015","Since the crisis in 2008 affected the global financial market, the economic climate changed drastically. A significant increase in the amount of vacant office buildings was introduced. Combining this fact with the increasing demand for living space in urban areas, transformation of vacant office buildings to residential buildings seems to be a simple solution to the problem. Redevelopment and transformation of vacant office buildings experience however many obstacles. Research into the structural opportunities of vacant office buildings could be helpful to overcome several obstacles. Due to the complexity of the projects, transformation asks involvement of many parties in an early stage of the development. The developers consult several advisors on financial, structural and architectural aspects. The aim of this research is creating a better understanding of transformation possibilities, emphasizing on the structural modifications of the transformation plan. The investigation answers the main research objective; the influence of the structural possibilities on the transition point between demolishing and transforming multi-story concrete office buildings. The building structures within this research exist of reinforced concrete and are built between 1950 and 1980. The transformation plan changes the office building function to residential function. An assessment tool is composed during the design study and consists of general- and structural selection criteria. This assessment tool is used to obtain a good and comprehensive understanding of the transformation potential. If the buildings have passed the veto criteria ( (1) demand for housing and (2) the environmental regulations), they have been examined to the general selection criteria. If the results are below 50% of the maximum achievable score, the building is not suitable for any further investigation. These buildings are omitted in the next step; the selection criteria of the structural aspects. The aim of this intermediate examination step is to gain a better view on the structural aspects of the potentiometer. Eight potential projects have passed the selection criteria and have been clustered in three groups; low-, medium- and high transformation potential. Two buildings have been chosen for further investigation during the design study; the Shell-building and Cool75, both located in the center of Rotterdam. The architectural design and the corresponding structural modifications have been analyzed on their feasibility. The results of the investigated case study projects correspond with the outcome of the selection criteria. Important structural aspects of successful transformation projects are the availability of original information, the possibility to attach balconies to the current structure and vertical expansion. Other important influences on the transition point between demolition and transformation of the existing office building structure are the free floor height and the installation of ducts in horizontal and vertical direction. The adjustability and flexibility of the structural layout are remaining important factors, flexible floor plans enlarge the feasibility when a change of function is investigated. The strength and stability of the existing structure with the implemented change of function have to be checked on the structural key factors; (1) the horizontal deformation at the top, (2) the shear forces in the normative lintels, (3) the axial forces on the foundation piles and (4) the compressive and tensile stresses of the stabilizing elements. The structural key factors are applicable for a larger range of similar building structures. If the structural key factors fulfill the requirements according the Eurocode, the structural performances of the existing structure on vertical expansion, attachment of balconies and other possible structural modifications have to be investigated. If the structural key factors do not fulfill the requirements, there has to be looked into the integration of required structural modifications which also lead to an increase of the architectural and economic value of the building. The maximum wind load exposure according Eurocode 1-4 is significantly higher for tall buildings than the TGB 1955. The wind loads have a large influence on the bending moment at the bottom of the core and the horizontal displacement at the top of the tower. The Shell-building shows an increase in bottom core moments of ±50% in SLS and ±25% in ULS. The increment of the wind loads is an important factor to the structural performances of office buildings with an equivalent height. The wind load of low-rise buildings is not significantly increased. An important aspect on the transition point is the relation between the structural modifications and the economic revenues of the structural modifications. To determine the transition point between demolishing or transforming an office building, the structural modifications should be justified on economic reasoning. Due to the comprehensive field within the transformation market of office buildings, not every design and feasibility aspect is considered during this investigation. More research needs be done on the structural performances and visual assessment of the case study projects. Furthermore, not all non-structural transformation motives have been taken into consideration. These aspects are open for further investigation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Building and Stuctural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Reniers, A.J.H.M. (mentor); De Schipper, M.A. (mentor); Radermacher, M. (mentor)","2015","This study investigates the existence and character of tidal flow separation at the Sand Motor, a mega-scale sand nourishment at the Delfland coast. Tidal flow contracts at the tip of the Sand Motor, downstream the tip the flow diverges and flow separation could occur. In case of flow separation the diverging streamlines cannot follow the contours of the coastline and the main flow will detach from the coastline. Flow separation causes an eddy downstream of the tip. The spatial variation in tidal flow is important to investigate, because the presence of tidal flow separation could be a hazard for swimmer safety. An advantage of the presence of tidal flow separation is the possible increased mixing of nutrients. By a literature study the first expectations about the location and period of tidal flow separation are done. Comparable studies to tidal flow separation are done in the past, which are relevant for this research. Two important conditions for tidal flow separation are an adverse pressure gradient and a developed boundary layer. From the literature study can be concluded that the location of the eddy generated by tidal flow separation is on the leeside of the headland. During the second half of the flood or ebb period tidal flow separation was expected, because then the two conditions are present. The core of this research is the field measurement campaign using GPS-tracked drifters. In total 15 measurement sessions are performed during both flood and ebb periods. The drifters recorded flow convergence and offshore flow near the tip of the Sand Motor, which possibly indicated the presence of tidal flow separation. The observed flow patterns are subsequently processed and characterized. To characterize the measurement sessions, the environmental conditions are researched. By observing radar images of the drifter sessions, the importance of the freshwater plume, discharged from the Rhine River, became visible. It interrupted tidal flow separation multiple times during drifter sessions. Also tidal flow separation and the associated eddy were observed in the radar images. Interpretation of the measurements shows that the wind conditions and the freshwater plume are the most important environmental conditions for the appearance or absence of tidal flow separation. By observing the results of several flood measurement sessions, the eddy seems to grow in time and gradually extends further offshore. The importance of the timing of the drifter sessions, to measure the tidal flow separation is tested with the numerical model D-Flow FM. The model is used to research the development in time of the flow separation and the associated eddy. Simulations show that the eddy travels from north to south during flood, which explains the measurements several flow patterns during flow separation. The simulations also show growth of the eddy between its generation and dissipation. The model is also used to research the adverse pressure gradient, by testing when the Bernoulli Effect is active at the tip of the Sand Motor. Around the peak of the high water the effect is present, causing an earlier presence of an adverse pressure gradient, which is an essential condition for tidal flow separation. This means that flow separation already could start around the peak of the high water during flood. Tidal flow separation could be a hazard for swimmers near the tip of the Sand Motor. If caught by the current during tidal flow separation, there is no easy escape opportunity and swimmers can be transported a couple of hundred metres offshore. Not only the tidal flow separation is a hazard for swimmer safety, but also the currents in the surf zone could be dangerous. These are even less predictable than tidal flow separation, so the general advice for swimmers would be not to swim near the tip of the Sand Motor.","drifters; Tidal flow separation; radar; Sand Motor; D-Flow FM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","","52.049691, 4.181543"

(mentor); Cabo, A.J. (mentor)","2015","Jaarlijks worden meer dan 10.000 mannen in Nederland gediagnosticeerd met prostaatkanker en overlijden ruim 2500 mannen aan deze ziekte. Vanwege de omvang van deze (mogelijk) dodelijke ziekte wordt er mede door de European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) al jaren onderzoek gedaan naar de ziekte. De beschikbare dataset van het ERSPC Rotterdam met prostaatkankergegevens van 31.752 mannen, welke is opgezet om de effectiviteit van regelmatig onderzoeken op prostaatkanker, bevat ook veel interessante gegevens omtrent PSA-waarden, Gleasonscores en leeftijd van de patiënten. Na oppervlakkig onderzoek in SPSS zijn er twee deelvragen gekozen die verder onderzocht zijn. Is de verdeling van PSA-waarden van mannen met prostaatkanker uit de interventiegroep afhankelijk van de leeftijd van de mannen? Is de verdeling van Gleasonscores van mannen met prostaatkanker afhankelijk van de gemeten PSA-waarde van de mannen? Voor beide deelvragen worden de hypothesen zodanig opgesteld dat de data uitwisselbaar zijn onder de nulhypothese. In eerste instantie worden samengestelde alternatieve hypothesen opgesteld, waarna er wordt toegewerkt naar enkelvoudige alternatieve hypothesen. Om deze hypothesen statistisch te toetsen wordt er gebruik gemaakt van permutatietoetsen, waarvoor geen aannames over symmetrie of parameters nodig zijn. De beschikbare data worden in groepen ingedeeld, respectievelijk gebaseerd op leeftijd en op PSA-waarde. Bij een permutatietoets wordt gebruik gemaakt van het feit dat de data onder de nulhypothese onderling uitwisselbaar zijn. Een gekozen toetsingsgrootheid wordt eerst voor de originele ordening berekend, waarna voor een groot aantal willekeurige permutaties dezelfde toetsingsgrootheid berekend wordt. Het aantal verschillende permutaties is te groot om allemaal te bepalen, in dit project worden elke keer 5000 permutaties genomen. Het percentage toetsingsgrootheden dat extremer of gelijk is aan de toetsingsgrootheid voor de originele ordening is de p-waarde. Voor beide deelvragen zijn verschillende toetsingsgrootheden gebruikt. In eerste instantie worden de groepen afzonderlijk bekeken, waarna gezocht is naar een toetsingsgrootheid die de afhankelijkheid van alle groepen in één keer mee neemt. De Kruskal-Wallis-toetsingsgrootheid is gebaseerd op de variantie tussen de gemiddelde rangen van de groepen. In beide gevallen wordt een stijgend verband verwacht. Daarom is isotone regressie geïntroduceerd, waarbij de best passende niet-dalende functie door de datapunten wordt bepaald. Voor een dalende functie is dit de constante lijn door het gemiddelde. Als toetsingsgrootheid wordt daar de som van absolute afstanden tot het gemiddelde van de datapunten genomen. Bij zowel de Kruskal-Wallis-toetsingsgrootheid als bij isotone regressie op basis van leeftijdsgroepen en PSA-groepen, wordt bij 5000 permutaties een benaderde p-waarde van 0 gevonden. De exacte p-waarde kan geen 0 zijn, maar er is wel een 95%-betrouwbaarheidsbovengrens voor de p-waarde bepaald. Aangezien deze voor een benaderde p-waarde van 0 bij 5000 permutaties bij 0.00095 ligt, kan met vrij grote zekerheid geconcludeerd worden dat de nulhypothese dan verworpen dient te worden. Isotone regressie wordt ook toegepast op de individuele PSA-waarden, waarvoor een benaderde pwaarde van 0.0306 gevonden wordt. De nulhypothese wordt op basis van deze toets dus verworpen bij een significantieniveau van alfa = 0.05. Dit leidt tot de volgende conclusies: De verdeling van PSA-waarden van mannen met prostaatkanker uit de interventiegroep is stijgend ten opzichte van de leeftijd van de mannen. De verdeling van Gleasonscores van mannen met prostaatkanker is stijgend ten opzichte van de gemeten PSA-waarde van de mannen.","prostaatkanker; hypothesen; permutatietoets","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

These characteristics are the result of two main phenomena. The most important one is called ”horseshoe vortex”, it is due to separation of the flow ahead of the obstacle caused by the adverse pressure gradient generated by the obstacle. The second one can be referred as ”secondary corner vortex” and it is triggered by gradients of Reynolds stresses and thus has no counterpart in laminar flow.

(mentor); Richardson, I.M. (mentor); De Vries, P.A. (mentor); Tuinstra, D. (mentor)","2015","The potential of additive manufacturing is great: highly complex and efficient structures can be manufactured with hardly any waste material. While high-tech industries such as aviation and medicine have already embraced additive manufacturing, civil engineering is lagging behind. Research on the structural properties of additive manufactures in civil constructions is necessary to build confidence with structural engineers. The MX3D project aims to 3D print an 8 meter stainless steel bridge with gas metal arc welding based additive manufacturing. The basic elements - rods of 5 to 7 mm in diameter - are printed with 308LSi and 316LSi stainless steel. In this thesis, the structural properties of these elements are investigated by characterizing the geometry, performing structural tests, and studying the microstructure. Several batches were printed with varying process parameters. Every batch contained three types of rods, produced at different angles to the vertical: 0°, 30°, and 60°. The rods were measured through photography and characterized by statistical distributions. Greater production angles led to larger geometrical inaccuracies. The critical geometrical parameters are the minimum and mean diameter. The variation around the mean was described using a normal distribution; the occurrence of small diameters using a Weibull distribution. This resulted in design graphs for the minimum diameter at increasing rod lengths. Micrographs indicated an anisotropic austenitic microstructure of large columnar grains. The grains grew perpendicular to the weld pool, in the direction of the thermal gradient, across different deposition layers. For 0 ° rods, the grains grew in the main direction of the rod. At 30° and 60°, the weld pool was tilted, and the grain orientation deviated from the main direction, influencing structural behavior. Tensile tests on milled rods confirmed a reduction of the ultimate stress of 10 % for rods produced under an angle. Tensile tests further showed ultimate strength values averaging at 611 MPa. Because the 0,2 % proof strength was difficult to determine, it is proposed to use 50% of the ultimate strength as a value for the 0,2 % proof strength, ensuring that strength and ductility requirements are met. The observed Young's modulus showed great spread and was much lower than expected. This may be result of the anisotropic microstructure, but this is still unclear. Tests also revealed ductile material behaviour, meeting Eurocode requirements. Buckling tests were performed for varying slendernesses. The results are not safely described by any of the existing Eurocode buckling curves. An alternative curve has been presented based on altered values for the imperfection factor and limiting non-dimensional slenderness. Fatigue tests have been performed on one type of element. Using the minimum diameter, a detail class of 81 was found. Because of the large spreads in the properties and the risk of production errors, a quality control system based on ordinary welding is proposed. Conservative models give safe predictions of structural behaviour. Accurate structural models should take into account both geometrical and material variations. This research gives confidence that stainless steel additive manufactures can be used in civil engineering structures and lays the basis for structural design rules.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; bridge; stainless steel; structural engineering; MX3D; GMAW; structural properties; columnar grains; welding; 308LSi; 316LSi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel and Timber Construction","",""

Results. Design guidelines were formulated according to data from the relevant literature. For both case studies the key features proved to be spatial layout, façade construction and production density. The split-production zone with a transparent non-insulated façade and a single production layer offers the best performance in terms of cooling energy use and total energy use, relative to the production area.

(mentor)","2015","There is a need for a wave drag method that combines the speed of handbook methods with the accuracy of computational methods. Especially determining the onset of wave drag as well as the initial drag rise is important in initial design stages. Meta-models allow this by capturing the trends present in previously computed data, providing an accurate and fast representation. In this report, it is investigated what gains can be achieved by applying the meta-modeling method GT-Approx to the aerodynamic tool MSES. The total drag calculated by MSES for a super critical airfoil was verified using wind tunnel experiments. It was found that aerodynamic characteristics and pressure distributions are accurate up until M = 0.76. GT-Approx was critically evaluated. It was found that the general prediction quality was good, but that the error increased substantially for complex cases, such as high M or high cl This issue is solved by increasing the resolution of the input data. By optimizing the resolution for the different input variables the average prediction error decreased by 30% for cdv and 70% for cdw. Especially for the difficult cases, the accuracy greatly improved. Two A320 variants are evaluated using GT-Approx and a direct application of MSES. The performance of GTApprox is good. An average difference of 0.21 drag counts between MSES and GT-Approx was achieved, with an in-calculation computation time of 5.13?10??s per calculation instead of 5.58s using a direct application of MSES. GT-Approx is extended to a quasi-3Dmethod, using the simple sweep method. This quasi-3D method is used to calculate the value of CDw for two test cases. The calculated values of CDw are compared with CFD data. It was found that the region of validity of the quasi-3D method is highly limited. Up until 60% of the wing, root and tip effects, fuselage effects and engine installation effects render any comparison useless. Beyond this value the first test case showed no correlation, whereas the second showed reasonable accuracy. Due to lack of more 3D CFD data, no clear explanation for the difference was found. In general it is concluded that the combination of an aerodynamic tool with a meta-model is able to combine low computation times with high accuracy, but only if the aerodynamic model is accurate.","wave drag; meta-modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Stuhlmacher, M.E. (mentor); Fokkinga, J.D. (mentor); Straub, A. (mentor)","2015","Elderly suffering from dementia go through a difficult and confusing time from the moment they start to show symptoms of dementia. During this time, the process of dementia can only be slowed down. It has the looks of it that there isn’t anything more that can be done, but to make them feel as comfortable as possible for the time being. Although it looks like ‘just’ softening of circumstances, this could actually contribute to the wellbeing of elderly suffering from dementia. The theme of ‘well-being’ is inextricably connected the feeling of ‘comfort’. The task that lies before us can be promoted by this research question: How do you create an environment that makes elderly suffering from dementia feel at as comfortable as they used to feel at home, despite the fact that they find themselves in a surrounding that is not their home? The findings of this research focuses the organisational aspects of environments. Although there are a lot preferences that help to feel a elder suffering from dementia more comfortable on climate-level, this research puts emphasis on how the set-up of a building can make one experience more comfort. When the sequences of spaces is similar to the sequences of a normal home, while approaching a living room, it contributes to well-being of the elderly suffering from dementia. In the old traditional elderly housing communal areas tented to fail their function as living rooms, hallways are long and monotonous and outdoor space along with the entry towards these spaces are rare. The different gradients in spaces will avoid confusion of dementia sufferers. It helps to find one’s own place within a environment. Feeling at home does not end at the border of a room or building. Also, creating resident-groups with a similar background makes it easier for residents to connect to their environment. Activities and functions can be aimed towards the mind of a smaller group instead of trying to entertain a large group all at once. Residents will understand the behaviour of their fellow-residents preventing confusion and agitation. Furthermore, the environment that has a small scale and works like an household will also function as a one, creating possibilities for dementia sufferers to contribute to this and gain responsibility and develop more self confidents. This confidents helps elderly suffering from dementia to feel less confused when difficult moments occur. In addition, as result of the inability to function properly at everyday situations the world of dementia sufferers is becoming smaller with time; it is important that they still experience a sense of control over their own lives. When they still have a world where they can move freely, it already contributes to the experience of freedom and not feeling locked up. Also, a sense of control can be provided by a wide range of alternatives concerning from as small as different seatings in common areas to various activities that can be held at the account of the dementia sufferers but also includes third parties. Lastly, by including facilities serving the neighbourhood social integration is encouraged. Associations and communities originating for the nearby neighbourhood will bring different kinds of people into a building and gives the opportunity for the elderly suffering from dementia to stay in touch with the outside world. It works also the other way around that everyday people get more interaction with dementia and thereby creating more support for this fragile group. Safety, security and protection within a neighbourhood do not have to go hand in hand with exclusion of society.","dementia; elderly; society; integration; neighbourhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","The architecture of the interior","","Care for Cure","",""

Drawbacks of the technology at this point, however, are the fact that the maximum speed of the aircraft is limited while utilizing EGTS, possibly impacting other airport traffic and even leading to taxiway congestion. Taking this problem statement as a starting point, this research is aimed at generating an impact study into the effects of EGTS on the airport operations with all the key stakeholders.

(mentor); Van Geenhuizen, M. (mentor); Groenleer, M. (mentor)","2015","University technology-based incubators (UTBIs) have an important role in the development of new technology-based firms [NTBFs]. By providing a favourable environment for these companies it significantly reduces firm failure. In order to maximize the attainment of the incubator goal, UTBIs expect tenants to grow within a particular time. It, therefore, applies a strict incubatee evaluation practice that evaluates which incubatees show sufficient commercial viability to get further support and which ones do not. However because of the heterogeneity in development paths between NTBFs, considerable differences exist among incubatees. Slow growing NTBFs are not always a direct sign of lower commercial viability. Instead, these companies often show a slow commercial growth in their early stage but can grow out to large cooperation’s later on. These firms often need the intensive support from the incubator before they can show such growth. The question that arises: are summative indicators, like revenue or firm size, appropriate benchmarks for future incubation evaluation? Or should an incubator have a more balanced approach that better takes into account the heterogenic and nonlinear development of NTBFs? Not taking into account that this might lead to ineffective and inefficient evaluation and thus inefficient incubation. The study calls for an improved incubatee evaluation method that better take into account the dynamics of NTBF development. It provides an answer to the following research question: How can incubatee evaluation be improved within a university technology incubator? The study concludes that better progress evaluation can be reached when the incubator carefully takes into account the nonlinear development NTBFs. Firms that deal with long periods of technology/product testing, might be not need extensive support. This implies that they might need support at a later stadium, to grow the business. Also, capital-intensive firms or firms with a strong focus on R&D have higher incubator needs for support. Evaluators should be well aware of this when evaluating their potential.","university technology incubator; new technology based firm development; incubatee evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Van de Voort, J. (mentor); Van Dorst, M. (mentor)","2015","The societal issue that this project tries to address is the increasing anonymity in residential urban neighborhoods. The increasing anonymity is caused by a decrease of social interaction between citizens that share the same living environment. The government used to subsidize community facilities like sports clubs and cultural institutions to maintain the social coherence. However, due to cutbacks and a belief in the participation society, the government will gradually pull back and take a less active role in supporting local community development. In order to create and maintain healthy, safe and attractive urban neighborhoods, residents should become aware of a social environment that is linked to the place. Therefor, social interaction among locals must be stimulated so that local communities are able to develop. Architecture is not able to create communities. However, architecture can facilitate community development by creating the right conditions. Not the architecture itself, but the social process of community building, has been put upfront in this project. The project includes a research and a design proposal. In the research has been searched for (spatial) conditions in which people are invited to interact with each other. The design is a community place for the Buiksloterham in Amsterdam. It is a pedestrian/bicycle bridge over the Johan van Hasseltkanaal, the widest canal in the neighborhood, that facilitates community development by providing space for self-organized community activities. The design of a bridge metaphorically suits the goal of willing to connect people. Furthermore it contributes to the improvement of the neighborhood on an urban scale. Because in the Buiksloterham people are invited to design and built their own house, the construction and making of the community place played a significant role in the design. The making of the bridge was not merely a technical problem to be solved, but became a major source of inspiration for the design. This is visible in both the building process (residents of the neighborhood are invited to come and see the making of) and the materialization. By making models of how the building process would work and working with the actual materials, concrete and wood, the constraints have been researched and turned into positive consequences for the design. The design of the bridge, a community place for the Buiksloterham, aims to catalyze the social process of community development. In the subtitle, (a) community building, the a is put in parenthesis to make you aware of the analogy between the noun, a community building, and the verb, community building.","community development; Buiksloterham; bridge; concrete; community building; Noorderparkkamer; Blijburg; Frank van Klingeren; de Meerpaal; 't Karregat; anonymity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-23","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","ExploreLAB","",""

(mentor)","2015","Environmental regulations and high fuel prices are of increasing importance for manufacturers of heavy duty vehicles. The main issue is to increase the efficiency of the trucks and to reduce the fuel consumption. When driving on the highway more than 40% of the total energy is lost to aerodynamic drag. This increases the importance of the aerodynamic drag behavior of trucks in developing sustainable transport. This research develops insight in the aerodynamic drag performance of a platoon and the influence of tails on the platoon. To study this problem, a platoon of simplified truck models with rear drag reduction devices is simulated using a CFD program. Different simulations are done where the spacing between trucks is varied, as well as the tail plate angle and the body front rounding. Equipping trucks with tails in a platoon at short spacings leads to an increased drag of trucks directly behind a tail due to the pressure increase by the tail and the inwards deflected streamlines. At short spacings the best way is to only equip the last body with a tail so the streamlines can follow the contours of the platoon and the wake is reduced by the tail. At larger spacings the bodies behave like the isolated bodies but with some minor influence of the wake of the preceding bodies. So at larger spacings the bodies with the lowest drag in isolation are favored. The configuration with tails on all bodies is thus favored. This research shows that equipping trucks with tails in a platoon can definitely be beneficial, but it depends on the spacing between the bodies in a platoon. The best configuration is to drive at the smallest spacing as possible and equip the last body with a tail, so the wake of the platoon is reduced. Since the best configuration of the platoon depends on the spacing, there is another possibility which is to create an automated folding and deploying system to adapt the configuration of the platoon to the spacing between the bodies.","drag; influence; tails; platoon; bluff; bodies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Koopman, F. (mentor)","2015","Existing historic buildings, remnants of a past long gone are often still highly operational in our time, most likely at the expense of the environment. Without interventions, their energy performance is outdated – provided they are used in a contemporary way - and they contribute to the over-consumption of energy and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Intervention possibilities for historic buildings are numerous and highly dependent on a case by case approach. This project examines the case of the Soda Fabriek in Schiedam, an 18th century industrial building. Technical solutions for the energy performance upgrade of the Soda Fabriek’s envelope in respect to its historical significance will be discussed. Yet even for this aspect of a redesign, it is imperative to keep in mind the original elements or characteristics of the building in question. Interventions are always appropriate to the goals of each project. Lowest energy consumption, energy neutrality, over-all sustainability, conservation are different approaches to the issue of upgrading or redeveloping architectural heritage and can lead to different degrees of intervention on such a building. The approach taken to achieve those goals also plays a big role. Simplicity of interventions, budget, extravagance, appearance can have significant impact on how an existing peace of architectural heritage is being redeveloped for a new purpose. This project shows clearly that partial intervention, although it can achieve some improvement on the energy consumed for conditioning a building, it simply is not sufficient. More holistic approaches on all aspects and elements of an existing building are necessary already from the initial stages of re-design, if a historic building is to answer to the issue of energy and sustainability of architectural heritage.","sustainability; refurbishment; historic building; monuments; building conservation; architectural heritage; heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences - Building Technology Track","","51.911231, 4.405547"

Rapid urbanization has struck on the steep slopes around the centre of Valparaíso causing them to perch on precarious land. Due to its geography, landslides, earthquakes and wildfires are a common threat that might contribute to the disturbance of transforming an existing poor community into a safe and secure neighbourhood. On April 14th, wildfires have consumed more than 2,900 homes, leaving around 12,000 people homeless (UNDP, 2014; Quirk, 2014). A notable remark is that this was not the first disaster the people of Valparaíso needed to witness. In fact, there was a similar wildfire back in 2008 and in 2013 that occurred on these same hills (UTFSM, 2014). With the former residents already commencing to reconstruct their homes on these ashen hills, it is important to prevent entering in the same recurring cycle of a disaster prone area with vulnerable communities. In the first part of this graduation project, a strategic approach for in situ settlement upgrading has been formed based on the concept of evolutionary resilience. The object of this part of the paper is to test the strategic approach to the specific case of Valparaíso. This integrated response, addressing the importance of evolutionary resilience in a disaster prone vulnerable community, is ultimately reassessed seeking for possible replicable solutions for communities in similar situations elsewhere in the world.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","","-33.0477778, -71.6011111"

(mentor); Loonen, M. (mentor); Van de Loenhorst, M. (mentor)","2015","Unilever is the market leader in the fast moving consumer goods industry. It is constantlyseeking ways to effectively use its resources. The company approached me and requested a decision tool which could determine the 'switch-over' point between single and double stacking of pallets (the so-called stacking configuration). The model was to present the decision based on the cost. Currently the optimization focus in the logistics chain is on transportation which accounts for e400 of the e640 million in the total logistics spend. Their method: optimizing the transportation by effectively using both weight and volume limits of the truck. This is done by creating either higher pallets, or double stacking the pallets. The choice for the stacking configuration is by and large reliant on the cubic density (the switch-over point is put at 400 kg=m3). However a more holistic approach to finding the switch-over point is suggested, taking into account all the individual cost post making up the total logistics chain spend. This holistic approach solves the problem of possible negative effects that changes in transportation can have elsewhere in the chain. In order to determine which factors influence the cost, a conceptual framework was put in place which addresses all the key cost posts in the logistics chain. It conceives a list of variables which influence the cost and additionally change when changing stacking configuration. These factors are the causal basis for the remainder of the analysis. The amount of influence each of these factors have on the final cost is determined by the method of higher order linear regressions. This gives the correlation or amount of co-occurrence. These regressions were made in Statistics R. The results were tested for satisfying the Gauss-Markov theorem; which tests the results for being the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). It was also made sure that all the variables tested were exogenous; meaning that the change in one variable can not be explained by another. At this point we had a model for which the causal basis is supported by the correlation of the variables (some show higher correlations than others, reasons for missing co-occurrence was given everywhere necessary). The model, being quite difficult to interpret, it is not easily used by Unilever employees and therefore a tool was created. The tool is made in Excel for end-user convenience. The tool additionally allows to supplement the cost function by functional constraints; both legislative, and physical. The final tool can be used to project the cost of new (or renewed) products when they are created (or changed) by 'research and development'. The tool gives the design that was used as input ('current design') and the savings that can be made by switching to 'double' or 'single' stacks. It is able to export the answers as a usable PDF format such that it can be easily implemented in Unilevers 'innovation funnel'. The first result are very promising. The model suggests that a savings of 23.9% can be made on the 48 cases under scrutiny. This means that with 95% certainty it can be said that the savings for the complete dataset is somewhere between 21.9% and 26.0%. This would yield annual savings in the logistics chain of between e141 and e160 million. To achieve these savings between 12.8% and 37.5% of the pallets should be changed to double stacking. Validation shows, however, that singular values might differ up to 50% (both positive and negative) from the data; which is attributed to the low explanatory power of the 'primary transport cost' (read: on of the) regression(s). This assumption was also validated and turned out to be true. This is, obviously, a theoretical optimum for savings, it does not account for product integrity (the quality), which was set as a constraint (it was stated that the cost could be minimized under the constraint that the quality remained at least as high as current standards). This is therefore suggested to be a topic for further research. There is some work to be done to the model before it can be taken into use by Unilever employees. It was suggested that the regressions should be re-run with all the indicated variables (which requires some additional data acquisition) and that the gathered data was time-stamped in order to account for money and oil price volatility. These actions would likely yield a tool and model where the answers are centred closer to the true cost value. For all statistical models, and this one in particular, keeping it up to date is of the utmost importance. This keeps the answers up to date and the tool usable for all new and renewed products for Unilever.","supply chain; logistics; unilever; econometric; modelling; stacking configuration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transport Engineering and Logistics","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); De Vos, P. (mentor)","2015","This Msc graduation study covers the installation of topsides on a jacket by an offshore heavy lift crane vessel, and its related problems. One of the problems take place after the topside is hoisted on the jacket, during the weight shift from the hoist cable onto the jacket. The topside then exerts large horizontal forces upon the crane and vessel. The problem is that the DP system is not designed to cope with the changed force characteristics. Due to the changing force characteristics the DP system may build up oscillations and even instable behavior. The ultimate consequence may inflict great (economic) damage, human injury or even loss of lives. The current industry solution to this problem is found to be unsatisfying. The goal of this thesis is to propose one final conceptual solution to this problem. This final conceptual solution is selected from four candidate solutions after simulation performance tests. All candidate solutions use the same basic idea of estimating the large horizontal force and feed this into the DP controller. The performance of the candidate solutions is tested on a simulated model of a crane vessel hoisting a topside on a jacket. This simulation model is based on the Imtech Marine DP and vessel model which is extended with a heavy lift crane. With the use of this simulation model the problem of instable behavior is reproduced in a simulation environment using realistic parameters. One of the candidate solutions, denoted the Feed Forward solution candidate, translates the estimated force into compensation thrust by the vessel's own actuators. As a result, the horizontal forces are eliminated, whereby the DP controller will not be disturbed by the changed force characteristics anymore. In literature, this feed forward control law performed very well during scale model tests. In this study however, the performance proved to be very poor. It is shown that the performance is mainly poor because of the acceleration and deceleration rates of the thrusters are too low. The second candidate solution, denoted the Kalman solution candidate, is a more simple candidate and only feed the estimated forces to the Kalman filter. This candidate is performing good, but DP stability is not guaranteed under all conditions. To determine the stability, with or without the Kalman solution candidate, an theoretical analysis method is explained. It is concluded that of all candidate solutions the Kalman solution candidate proved the best performance. Consequently, it is recommended to develop the conceptual candidate to an industrial solution. During this development it is recommended to take extra measures to increase the robustness against differences between the heavy lift vessel model and the true heavy lift vessel.","offshore heavy lift; dynamic positioning; heavy lift crane operation; instable; unstable; feed forward; topside installation; crane modeling; conceptual; solution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Mechanical Systems and Integration","",""

(mentor); Van Der Toorn, A. (mentor); Den Haan, J. (mentor); Jongbloed, A. (mentor)","2015","With the increase in size of offshore structures and the increase in costs related to the construction of these facilities, a necessity to optimize the construction of offshore facilities arises. An element that contributes greatly to these costs is the transportation and installation of the structures. Transportation costs are proportional to the distance covered and the number of transports necessary, since special vessels or tug boats are required. Installation costs are mainly proportional to time since the day rates of specialized construction vessels are extremely high. One of the most used structural members in offshore construction are steel cylindrical structural members, such as piles and pipelines. With increasing dimensions, also these members increase in size and it is often found wishful from a viewpoint of cost efficiency to transport the members on barges that are smaller in length than their cargo. Not only are standardized cargo barges more widely available then specialized equipment, their use also saves on fuel costs and pollution due to their reduced resistance compared with vessels that are greater in dimensions. Due to forces induced by the sea state the barges move and the oversized cargo undergoes a relative motion with regard to the sea surface. In certain environmental conditions this relative motion can develop in such a way that impact and/or submergence of the cargo occurs. This thesis focuses on the hydrodynamic loads involved with this interaction of oversized steel piles and the sea. The relative motions have been determined from a linearized motion analysis of an industry standard 122m long cargo barge. A radiation and diffraction analysis using potential theory software WAMIT has been performed to 1) determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of the barge, and 2) determine the effect of radiation and diffraction on the fluid pressures in the surrounding fluid field. It was found that the relative motions have a peak amplitude at wave periods that are commonly encountered in marine transport. This holds for approaches with and without taking into account the effects of wave radiation and diffraction. The analysis of the relative motions shows that for large enough wave heights water impact is possible to occur. To be able to quantify the loads an extensive literature review has been conducted on the involved hydrodynamic processes. It was found that knowledge on the governing load mechanisms is available. Water exit effects are less well covered in literature and conservative upper limit assumptions have been made to account for water exit effects. For quantification of the involved hydrodynamic loads, two approaches have been developed. First, a quasi-stationary approach is chosen to analyze the hydrodynamic loads. Four characteristics orientations have been identified which give a good representation of the maximum loading situations. The parameters for this approach are found from a spectral analysis of the relative motions, both with and without taking diffraction and radiation effects into account. By using this approach a lot of additional conservatism is introduced, which is mainly caused by using upper limit values for the relative motion and slamming force coefficient. To gain a more detailed insight in the magnitude of different load contributions therefore a second approach has been developed. This approach consists of a segmented force model that operates on time traces drawn from response spectra of the relative motions. The cylinder is divided into segments iv and the involved loads are determined per segment per time step. The total resulting forces are found by summing the contributions of every segment along the pile length. Using a case study of a recently conducted transport the differences between the two approaches have been investigated. It is found that the maximum loads from the segmented model approach are roughly a factor 2 to 10 smaller than the results from a quasi-stationary approach. Compared with an existing engineering method, the forces from the segmented model are lower for all wave headings except stern waves. The comparison is skewed however because in the current engineering method not all involved loads are accounted for. To gain more confidence in the results of the segmented approach, the model is validated by means of three characteristic situations. The validation shows slight conservatism in the results of the segmented model. Ultimately the segmented model shows that when wave diffraction and radiation are taken into account, a wave heading of 180° is most favorable. With this an additional argument for towed marine transports to weathervane in stormy weather is found. The contribution of this thesis is that it demonstrates that using a detailed approach with regard to hydrodynamics may be beneficial. Although in a segmented model approach the analyses have to be repeated multiple times to gain a statistically reliable result, it is noted that once a model is available the computational costs do not differ a lot from a traditional frequency domain approach. This thesis therefore opens possibilities to reduce costs involved with offshore construction or marine transporting general. Further work should be directed at validating the obtained results by means of full scale or model testing, including effects of more complicated cargo configurations, investigating different cargo geometries, and studying the influence of the dynamics of load transfer to support structures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

The azimuthing thruster makes use of a mechanical transmission in order to deliver the power from the prime mover to the propeller. The good maneuverability and the absence of a need for a rudder of such a propulsion unit are counteracted by lack of detailed knowledge for this unconventional propulsion device. The field of uncertainty lies primarily in the very nature of the thruster, namely the fact that it is capable of rotating while operating. The oblique angle of the inflow to the thruster can be the source of a series of complex phenomena, not all of which have been systematically monitored and analyzed. The goal of the present study is: to investigate in depth the hydrodynamic characteristics of a ducted azimuthing thruster and to showcase the potential impact of findings on the current detailed design approach. By means of CFD numerical software StarCCM+, the thruster was modelled in a way which would allow the simulation of oblique inflow cases. A realization of a series of operating conditions for various advance velocities, RPM and steering positions of the thruster was followed by a thorough explanation of the observed physical phenomena. The information acquired by the numerical simulations was then compared with characteristic rules of thumb that represent the prevailing method of design nowadays. Finally, a few selected cases were used as the basis for the realization of a force propagation analysis with the purpose of comparing the bearing reaction forces of the propeller shaft to the respective values that arise based on simplistic rule of thumb calculations. Through the course of this project, valuable information was acquired for the behavior of the thruster unit in oblique inflow. The majority of the cases have been found to be in accordance with the imposed rules of thumb. However, a few cases demonstrated divergence from the predicted values in very large inflow angles.","azimuthing; CFD; oblique; thruster; steering; bearing reactions; turbulence; computational fluid dynamics; rules of thumb; propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production and Operation","",""

In my article I first explore the various approaches different epochs showed towards the notion of a ruin just so I can then attempt to subtract the historical, political and philosophical charges and look at the ruin as at a material and truly architectural object. Ruin is a product of conflict between the order and chaos, total and fragmented, regular and accidental. It is this conflict that produces accidents, exceptions and points of friction at all possible levels and scales. This understanding of a ruin as a fragile point of balance between two conflicting states relates it closely to the concept of Weakness in Architecture as described by Juhani Pallasmaa and Ignasi de Sola Morales. In my article I propose a dual identity between the ruin and the concept of weak architecture, upon which fresh starting points for architectural practice can be constructed.","Ruins","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-14","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore lab","",""

The current port will eventually not be sufficient to handle the capacity demand. The focus is on the development of a new port in the direct surroundings of Durban. A suitable new location is found at the old international airport. The Durban Dig-out Port is designed to cover a yearly container throughput of 10,000,000 TEU, a yearly liquid bulk throughput of 5,000,000 kL and 300,000 vehicles throughput per year. The governing vessel for the design is a 22,000 TEU container vessel with a length of 430 m, a width of 43.4 m and a draft of 16.3 m. The choice for the 22,000 TEU design vessel is reviewed. Based on global developments in ship manufacturing and a brief look at the developments in South Africa's container trade it is concluded that the 22,000 TEU vessel is recommended for the design of the port. In the proposed port layout the entrance channel is aligned such that it gives possibilities to bring the Isipingo estuary and its protected mangroves back to life. New land becomes available for an extension of the mangrove area and a new natural equilibrium between fresh and salt water inflow can be developed. The direction of the entrance channel also results in the central location of the turning circle and therefore the basins are relatively short. This makes manoeuvring for the vessels in the port convenient. A slight bend in the entrance channel is proposed to mitigate the wave action in the port. A straight entrance channel would lead to large downtime and has a direct impact on the port efficiency. The southern swell waves cannot enter the port due to the breakwaters and the eastern wind waves are either absorbed at the inside of the southern breakwater or at the safety beach at the end of the turning circle. The proposed sand bypass system makes sure that the coastal evolution is sustainable. In the proposed layout two configurations for the breakwaters are distinguished in terms of orientation and length. The proposed breakwaters are based on either a relatively high (10 kn) or low (6 kn) maximum vessel entrance speed. From research with a simplified wave model it is concluded that the shorter breakwaters cause downtime for the liquid bulk terminal during storm conditions from the south. During normal conditions it is however found that the liquid bulk terminal can be operational for more than 99% of the time. Next to that, it is found from the design of the breakwaters' cross sections that the breakwater dimensions become significantly larger at greater depths. However both breakwaters are found stable with numerical stability analysis and in combination with the result of the wave model it is concluded that the shorter configuration is preferred. This leads to significantly lower construction costs and the downtime of the liquid bulk terminal is limited.","","en","student report","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","","-29.985278, 30.961023"

Onder druk van de economische crisis zijn de condities van de Nederlandse gebiedsontwikkeling vloeibaar geworden. De aard van de opgave verandert steeds meer richting het herontwikkelen van binnenstedelijke gebieden. Daarnaast is het minder vanzelfsprekend dat de projectontwikkelaars en gemeenten de partijen zijn die de kar trekken en is de wijze van samenwerking tussen de publieke partijen en de private partijen voer voor discussie. Door deze veranderingen en de lastige periode waarin gebiedsontwikkeling verkeert, wordt de belegger genoemd als ‘nieuwe’ kartrekker bij de herontwikkeling van binnenstedelijke gebieden. Maar de kennis en het inzicht in de praktijk over de mogelijkheden en onmogelijkheden die er voor de beleggers liggen, ontbreken nog. Dit afstudeeronderzoek zoekt naar de ‘incentives’ en ‘belemmeringen’ voor institutionele vastgoedbeleggers om te beleggen in en een actieve rol te vervullen bij de herontwikkeling van een binnenstedelijk gebied. Dit is gedaan door middel van vijftien interviews met (institutionele) beleggers, gemeenten en ontwikkelaars. In de interviews staan drie onderwerpen centraal: het beleggen in gebieden, het ontwikkelen en beleggen en de houding van de publieke partijen. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat het voor institutionele beleggers lastig is om te beleggen in en een actieve rol te vervullen bij de herontwikkeling van binnenstedelijke gebieden. Hun activiteiten reiken in de meeste gevallen niet verder dan het gebouwniveau en het herontwikkelen van vastgoed op objectniveau. Dit wordt mede gevoed door het feit dat dit type belegger vanwege de aandeelhouders zich steeds meer moet richten op de financiële kant van het vastgoed. Deze aandeelhouders, veelal pensioenfondsen en verzekeringsmaatschappijen, zoeken vooral solide investeringen met lagere risico’s. Hoewel de vastgoedbeleggers de meerwaarde zien van een aantrekkelijk gebied kunnen zij de kosten daarvan, anders dan die zij maken voor de herontwikkeling van hun bezit, lastig verantwoorden. Doordat het bezit in een gebied verdeeld is, is het lastig voor individuele eigenaren om gezamenlijk een gebiedsopgave op te pakken. Aan de andere kant is de verhouding tussen beleggers, projectontwikkelaars en gemeenten geen beletsel. Alle drie partijen zien mogelijkheden voor een actievere rol voor beleggers als men kijkt naar de onderlinge samenwerking.

(mentor); Blom, A. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Stecca, G. (mentor)","2015","River bed degradation is sometimes counteracted with nourishment of sediment material. Numerical models — which include Hirano’s sediment continuity model for mixed-size sediment — can be used to predict the transport of different sediment fractions (the waves due to spatial variations in the grain size distribution of the bed material are here called Ribberink waves) in the dumped material to find an optimal grain size distribution of the nourishment. Little is known how well these numerical predictions represent physical reality. The uncertainty in predictions of the behaviour of the transport of mixed-size sediment can have severe impact: the grain size distribution influences degradation and aggradation processes and bed friction, both, directly or indirectly, influence water levels and flow velocities that are important for designing measures for hinterland protection. Moreover, numerical models predict Ribberink waves travelling faster than associated bed level perturbations (De Vries waves), which is never observed in reality. In order to gain insight into the behaviour of morphodynamic changes with mixed-size sediment — especially with regards to the Ribberink waves — two flume experiments were conducted in the Water Lab of Delft University of Technology. The first experiment is a case with uniform tracer sediment, installing a shoal of different colour than the sediment in the downstream part of the flume. The shoal was installed for the upstream end. Comparing the outcomes of the latter experiment with a numerical simulation gives insight into the question if the Ribberink wave travelling faster than the De Vries wave is an artefact of the Hirano model or that it has physical meaning and relevance. The second experiment was an experiment with a bimodal sediment mixture. A shoal consisting of the coarser fraction is installed at the upstream part of the flume. The coarse fraction has a different colour than the fine fraction so that we were able to track it through the domain. The tracer experiment shows a distinct propagation of the shoal through the domain. Downstream of the shoal no degradation occurred. The material initially present in the shoal did not travel faster than the shoal. The numerical simulation of the experiment shows tracer material being transported faster than the shoal. The tracer material spread over the bed downstream of the shoal, reaching the end of the computational domain before the end of the simulation. The mixed-size sediment experiment shows a distinct propagation of the shoal through the domain (De Vries wave), preceded by an degradational wave (Ribberink wave). This degradational wave is caused by the spatial increase of the sediment transport rate, which is the net effect of: (a) a streamwise increasing flow depth; (b) a streamwise decreasing average grain size diameter of the bed surface, and; (c) a turbulent recirculation zone increasing local sediment transport capacities. In the area of degradation, the bed gradually becomes finer than the initial situation. A numerical reproduction of this experiment reproduced the experiment well, showing the same propagation celerity of the shoal and the associated erosion wave (but less deep), but shows no significant change of the grain size distribution compared to the initial bed of the bed downstream of the shoal. The predicted Ribberink wave thus travels with the same celerity as the measured Ribberink wave and does not precedes the De Vries wave. The conclusions of this thesis show that the grain size distribution of a sediment nourishment is of great influence on the propagation of the nourished material and on bed level changes downstream of the nourishment. As concluded from the flume experiments, when the nourished material (a hump similar to the shoal of the conducted experiments in this thesis) is coarser than the river bed, an erosional wave downstream of the nourishment will arise, travelling with the same celerity as the nourished material. If the nourishment is done to protect or counteract river bed degradation, this erosional effect caused by the shoal should be considered seriously.","river; sediment; morphodynamics; sorting; Hirano; morphology; Ribberink","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Santema, S.C. (mentor); Slob, N. (mentor); Mohammadi, S. (mentor)","2015","Since the beginning of industrial evolution, industrialization has created a dominating unilateral production- and consumption model. This one-way model of production, also described as a linear model, encompasses a ‘take, make, waste’ pattern in which natural resources are extracted from the Earth, manufactured into goods, used and eventually discarded as waste. It is characterized by a shift in responsibility from the producer of products or goods towards the user in which the consumer has to take care of disposal. Without any incentive to do otherwise, waste will be the final stage of products or goods. The linear economy has proven to be successful in providing affordable products for consumers and material welfare. However, since the publication of ‘limits to growth’ by the Club of Rome during the 70’s, we have witnessed a rising deliberation due to this model’s paradox. The world is finite. The exponential growth in resource extraction due to population growth and shifting consumption patterns in a linear economy is putting stress on our planet. As a result, resource efficiency and depletion will become one of the main challenges during the 21st century. One of the difficulties in developing the circular economy has been related to the topic of procurement. This research focuses on the procurement of circular buildings, specifically on how it should be specified during tender processes. It focuses on the main research question: how can clients (or commissioning companies) of construction projects specify their need/demand order to stimulate circular building? In order to answer this question explorative and unstructured research has been employed on three main themes: circular economy, circular building and tender specification. The circular economy is an economic and industrial system, regenerative by design that aims to maximize the reuse of products and materials and minimizes or eradicates waste by ‘system thinking’. In this research, system thinking is portrayed in form of seven ‘loops’: biochemical feedstock; cascades; maintenance; reuse; remanufacture/refurbish; recycle, which allow materials to flow between the economy and user without becoming waste. Literature study, and interviewees have resulted in three main principles for circular building: 1) using materials that undermine the circular economy; 2) design for circularity; and 3) safeguarding circularity. In order to find out how these principles can be translated to the built environment and how it can be specified during tendering, four case studies have been conducted on construction projects that include circular economy as one of the main concepts. The case studies concluded that the involved parties did their best in attempting circularity but that circular economy in the built environment needs to be further developed in order to fully achieve these principles. The lack of knowledge and measuring tools makes it difficult to specify the circular economy in tender specifications. All four cases had included innovative and new ways of procurement methods. The research concludes the following five steps for clients to stimulate circular building using tender specification: 1) Defining a clear formulation of the client’s ambition; 2) Translating these ambitions to performance-based requirements and possible circular solutions; 3) Determine where to put the emphasis. The more detailed the specification, the more the market parties will be limited; 4) Involving a consortium; 5) Willingness, trust and transparency between the involved parties are key to stimulate innovation and circular solutions.","Circular Economy; Lineair Economy; Sustainability; Global Resource Depletion; Built Environment; Dutch Construction Sector; Procurement; Tender Specification; Circulaire Economie; Inkoop; Vraagspecificatie; Bouw","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Van de Voord, J. (mentor); Nottrot, R. (mentor)","2015","The becoming of sacred places can be studied from the pragmatic, politic and poetic point of view. In this project, the third is done, stating that the power and qualities of an architect lie here, more than in the pragmatic and/or politic. Sacred places are therefore approached as places that go beyond themselves as objects. Sacred places have the potential to take the visitor out of the daily life world into another reality and by doing so, evoking a deep sense of being. This is the result of the direct interaction between visitor (subject) and architecture (object) or the experience of atmosphere. For an architect this means that he has to be aware of how the multi-sensory experience of places – specifically in the case of sacred places but with the design of places in general – triggers emotions and feelings and stimulates our imagination, memory and dreams (where we create the ‘other’ or ‘ineffable’ reality). This understanding is sought through the direct personal experience and the translation of this experience (in models, photographs and texts) in order to transmit the experience more than the analytical characteristics of the visited case studies. This project moreover explicates what the experience of sacredness is and what the origin and value of sacred places are in order to argument why humans need these places whether or not they are explicitly religious. Religion is the phenomenon that explicitly refers to the idea of the sacred. Therefore, religious places are taken as a starting point, whereas these are to a large extent built in order to move people, to stimulate self-transformation and transcendence. The design process formed an investigation on how architectural qualities stimulate the experience of sacredness with a chapel in the city centre of Antwerp as final result. Here, twin-phenomena formed the basis of the design since the main conclusion of the research stated that our imagination is triggered in the fusion of opposites; at the moment where the material becomes immaterial ad vice versa, where time and light become sensible, where our mind and body become one, where our persona and our surroundings are experienced as one. This experience is a fundamental human one, far beyond different worldviews.","sacred; poetics; place; phenomenology; atmosphere; comparative religion","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explorelab","","51.226001, 4.405044"

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (mentor)","2015","Lomography is one of the few brands left to produce and sell analogue cameras. New generations hardly ever experienced analogue cameras because their digital successors took over the market. It shows that potential customers do not understand what the brand is about and what it can mean to them. The stores do attract visitors, presumably because of the looks of the store. However, the ratio of visitors to buyers is too low according to the management. Aim The aim of this project is to close this gap between Lomography and its potential users. The customers need to be informed so that they are able to make a well-funded choice to join Lomography or not. The meaning of Lomography is not just a result from the company’s strategy makers. All users, potential users and spectators give meaning to the products as well. This peer-to-peer information can be of the same in the meaning of a product. Methods Reasoning from a context in order to design a product is described by Hekkert and van Dijk as Vision in Product design. The basic principles from the Vision in Product design method will be applied to this project: 1 A current product within its context gets deconstructed. 2 With this new gained knowledge a product gets designed with a future context as the basis. Lomography produces and sells only analogue cameras. Analogue photography is a technique, which is outrun by its digital successors. The demand for such a product and with that its reason for existence most probably can be ascribed to a cultural impact. Therefore, to research this phenomenon a cultural study is conducted. Four processes that influence the cultural impact of a product or brand are studied. First the Production; what meaning does Lomography give to itself? Next it is about the Consumption and Representation; what meaning do the users and all other people give to the brand? Fourth, through the Identity it is shown what the users look like and who they are. Together they answer to the main question: What could Lomography mean to its potential users? Results To the company itself Lomography is a new way of looking at the world. Analogue photography forces you to slow down and let go of control. This makes it more of a lifestyle besides the way of photography. Experienced users say it is their way of expressing their feelings, a form of art. Living this free life asks for a free way of photography. Letting go of control means embracing coincidences. The experienced users emphasise the fact that those uncertainties make the unexpected gems more precious. The limitations of analogue photography make you think more about taking a picture; it is quality over quantity. Lomography designs and uses special cameras that create special colours and vignettes, which cause dreamy pictures. Every camera has its own characteristics and flaws. To emphasise the old techniques the cameras link to cameras from the old days. The users say that the cameras are not only fun to use but also cool to have. Lomography leaves room for every experience level and age to join. Professionals can for instance use Lomography to search for the boundaries of photography, while others just want their pictures taken in a different fashion. The most important quality of a potential user is his or her level of knowledge on Lomography and photography. Different levels need different approaches for explaining Lomography. The customers are divided in the next five user groups: Notographer Visitors who do not take pictures at all. They need to be shown the reason for taking pictures in the first place. Happy Snapper Visitors who do share the joy of taking pictures with for instance their smartphones or compact cameras. They need to be shown that there are many more possibilities with photography of which Lomography is one. Family portrayer This type of visitors are known photographers. They take pictures on a regular basis and they developed their own habits. They should be challenged to experiment and try new ways of photography as well. Analogue adventurer Visitors who already started with analogue photography need to be shown what sets Lomography apart and what it can add to their current activities. Lomonographer The Lomonographer knows the brand and is familiar with at least one of the cameras. These visitors need to get a complete view of Lomography in order to make well-funded choices. Vision Two interaction visions are created that both describe Lomography and with that the intended interaction with the future product. Just as kids do, with Lomography you create your own world with your own rules. The product needs to provide incentives as starting points for the customers’ imagination, which then needs space to develop into something of their own. Secondly, when Lomographers create their own world, coincidence is of great importance, they embrace and try to learn from it. It should be no prearranged set-up, but is should leave room for exploration and experimentation. Product The Lomo Wall of Fame (Figure 1), contains multiple three-sided prisms which all hold a picture, the camera with which it was made and the film that was used. The rotating of the prisms is a playful way for users to explore the information they need to get to know the possibilities of Lomography. Adjacent prisms complement the information they hold. A mechanism is built in to emphasise the couples and the explorative character. The installation shows a variety of pictures to show the possibilities of Lomography. This will especially help the Notographer and Happy Snapper to see the value of Lomography. The Lomo Wall of Fame will show the Family Portrayer the possibilities of analogue photography through the cameras that are available and what characterises them. Combined with the presentation of the film this also introduced the Analogue Adventurer and the Lomonographer to the complete product portfolio of Lomography.","photography; analogue; lomography; retail; user experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2015","Jack-up platforms are off-shore structure which are more often placed in deeper water and harsher weather conditions. The consequence is that the natural frequency of the platform coincides with the wave frequency and starts to resonate in its natural frequency. The problem becomes more complicated, due to the fact that the natural frequency of the platform is not constant and varies in time due to structural properties, variable deck loading and environmental conditions. These vibrations are undesired and have to be damped. The aim of this thesis is to design an experimental model for a damping system on a jack up platform, which can optimally damp the motion of the primary structure when it is excited in the time varying natural frequency. This problem is tackled by comparing passive, semi-active and active Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) systems, regarding feasibility and robustness for installation on a jack-up platform. Hereafter the optimal tuning frequency and damping ratio are obtained by studying the work of Tsai and Lin, Connor and Den Hartog. These tuning laws are then combined with a Self-Tuning Regulator (STR), which makes it possible to continuously tune the semi-active damping system to its optimal parameters by estimating the unknown structural parameter using a Recursive Least Square Estimator. The designed experimental model is a two degree of freedom model and incorporates crucial characteristics such as mass distribution, damping ratio and natural frequency. The semi-active TMD system is able to adapt its stiffness and damping coefficient, such that is it always optimally tuned when the structural parameters of the experimental model changes. This thesis concludes that a semi-active TMD system is the most appropriate type of damping system for a jack-up platform, regarding feasibility and robustness. A semi-active TMD system in combination with optimal tuning laws and a STR is able to optimally damp the vibrations of a jack-up platform, when it is excited in time varying natural frequency. This model can be used to test and validate the performance of the damping system and controller.","Tuned Mass Damper","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bakker, C.A. (mentor); Haenen, I.T.W.C. (mentor)","2015","In order to reduce environmental impact caused by the production of animal protein (meat, fish, dairy), the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (Min. I&M) seeks to stimulate Dutch consumers in lowering their intake of animal protein and shifting towards a more plant-based diet. According to research (Bakker and Dagevos, 2010), the growing group of Dutch flexitarians – people that omit meat from their diet for at least one day a week (77% of population) – is the most promising group to target for a change of food consumption behaviour. This is especially valid for the group of intentional flexitarians that has environmental, personal health and/or animal welfare motivations for reducing their meat consumption. However, stimulating more sustainable food consumption is a complex social dilemma, because some degree of behavioural change needs to be achieved. A big challenge is the fact that collective interests like sustainability often are in conflict with personal interests like convenience. The goal of this project is to: ‘Design a product or service to encourage Dutch intentional flexitarians to reduce their consumption of meat and support them in pursuing a flexitarian eating pattern.’ Eventually, on the long term, this should contribute to a reduction of environmental impact caused by food consumption behaviour. Analysis Insights from the analysis phase show that Dutch intentional flexitarians are motivated to reduce their consumption of meat, because they know that a change of food consumption behaviour will benefit the environment, their personal health and/or animal welfare. However, when time is running short, momentary cravings and convenience of not having to search for a sustainable meal choice become more important than their wish to eat socially responsible. They often don’t know what to cook or feel like they have to compromise on taste when cooking vegetarian. They do not mind eating meatless meals, as long as they are still tasty. Moreover, deep-seated habits and a preference for convenience often lead to undesired meal-choices. Design Vision The analysis identified challenges that complicate maintaining a flexitarian eating-pattern. Combining the conclusions of the literature study and user studies resulted in three relevant design directions. After evaluation of these directions, it was decided to continue within the design direction of ‘Consciousness of taste and flavours’. This direction tried to find a solution for the conflicting concerns of ‘acting socially responsible’ vs. ‘variation in meals is necessary’, ‘meals should always be tasty’ and ‘vegetarians meals are flavourless’. The following design goal was formulated: ‘To reduce environmental impact of food consumption, we want to encourage Dutch intentional flexitarians to reduce their meat consumption by making them more conscious about flavours and personal taste.’ Conceptualisation The design direction of Taste & Flavours was further explored through literature. Combined with two creative sessions, this resulted in a first concept for a smartphone application that teaches users more about flavour perception and their personal taste in food using flavour elements. Flavour elements are elements to describe the factors that influence the perception of flavour (e.g. salty, spicy) and texture (e.g. crispy, creamy). The consultation of two ‘flavour experts’ provided valuable insights for adaptations of the concept. The design was tested and adjusted through several iterations, which led to the final design. Final Design The final design is named Smaaksafari, which translates to ‘Flavour Safari’. Smaaksafari is a smartphone application that aims to stimulate intentional flexitarians to explore their taste in food and helps them to eat in accordance with their personal taste; hereby implicitly stimulating more sustainable food consumption behaviour. The application works in 3 steps; (1) creating consciousness about taste and flavours by capturing and reflecting upon meals using flavour elements, (2) defining a personal taste profile based on the input from step 1 (3) suggesting recipes for evening meals that match the user’s personal taste profile and have a relatively low impact on the environment. With Smaaksafari, users will be able to easily create an overview of what they eat and why they appreciate the flavours and textures present in those meals or why they do not. Smaaksafari is perfect for busy people who every day struggle to decide on what to eat. With a collection of vegetarian recipes that seamlessly fits their personal taste, they no longer have to eat meals that they do not find exceptionally tasty, or meals they would rather not eat if they would have more time to prepare them. Eventually the increased understanding of taste and flavour is expected to lead to an increased appreciation of vegetarian meals and the addition of vegetarian meals to the user’s meal repertoire. This is intended to let them make more well-prepared food choices in the supermarket rather than habitual choices, and eventually to result in a reduction of their meat consumption. By addressing the personal concerns of taste and convenience, it is expected that Smaaksafari provides encouragement and support to Dutch intentional flexitarians in the process of moving towards a more plant-based diet.","flexitarian; meat consumption; behavioural change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor)","2015","The Meuse in the Netherlands is since the 1920s dammed by 7 weirs, which are located near Borgharen, Linne, Roermond, Belfeld, Sambeek, Grave and Lith. The weirs regulate the water levels in the canal sections (=stuwpanden) to provide sufficient depth for navigation. The management of the weirs is regulated by water level measurements at Maastricht St. Pieter (formerly Borgharen). The weirs dam the river for discharges lower than 1200 m3/s. For higher discharges the weirs are completely opened. Weir Linne is the oldest weir of the canalized Meuse and is part of the smallest canal section (=kanaalpand) of the Meuse. The weir consists just like the weirs of Roermond, Belfeld and Sambeek of two parts, a rough discharge regulating Poirée part and a accurate regulating Stoney part. Weir Linne maintains a water level of 20.80 m +NAP in the upper canal section. The canal section forms a navigable interchange between the Juliana Kanaal, Lateraal Kanaal, Kanaal Wessem-Nederweert and canal section Roermond. The weirs in the Dutch part of the Meuse have been constructed for a period between 80 and 100 years. The weirs are approaching the end of their lifetime in the period between 2020 and 2030. In this situation is not spoken about design lifetime because in the period when the weirs were constructed the design lifetime was not defined. Based on maintenance reports and inspections it is concluded that the weirs are not able to fulfill their functions properly, they need to be replaced or upgraded. The main reasons for replacement or upgrading are technical and functional aging and changing legislations. According to Rijkswaterstaat the weir of Linne has ended its lifespan in the year 2030. Aging of materials and changes in the ARBO legislations are issues of the weir. This conclusions is the result of inspections and analyzes over several years. Besides aging of materials also aging in functionality contributes to the decrease of the weir quality. The functionality of the weirs has been changed in time due to changing conditions, in the RINK project called ""new risks"". These functional changes can have their causes in changes of design assumptions, maintenance, usability and controllability or law and regulations. The weir of Linne has to deal with the risks of changing discharges, ASR degradation, operability and the weir does not meet the ARBO regulations. This graduation report is focused on the problems of weir of Linne. The aim of this thesis research is to improve the situation of weir Linne for the future situation by replacing of upgrading the weir. The weir should meet the requirements based on discharge and navigational purposes in the future. This report is made up at four scale levels, the problem is approached from a high scale level to lower scale levels. The levels are made up according to the elementary design cycle. The first scale level concerns the canalized Meuse in the Netherlands. Because canal section Linne is relatively small It is investigated if it is possible to remove weir Linne instead of renewing or upgrading of the weir. The second scale level focuses on canal section Linne. In this section the effect of the Maasplassen with respect to the water level changes of the canal section is investigated for high and low discharges. Also the effect of the water level changes to the weir management is investigated to obtain a clear view about the reaction time of weir operations with regard to opening and closure of the weir. The third design level concerns the construction of weir Linne. It is considered if according to the RINK reports the current weir construction should be renewed or upgraded. The chapter proceeds with a rough analysis about the required width and retaining height of the weir to obtain if the discharge capacity of the current weir is sufficient for the future. It is decided to upgrade the Poirée part of the weir, the last part of this design level concerns the determination of a new gate type for the Poirée part of the weir. The lowest design level is focusing on the design of the new weir gate. The gate is designed in high strength concrete. The dimensions of the gate elements are determined and the gate is checked to the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The last section of the lowest design level concerns the way of placing and connecting the new gate to the current construction. The result of the first design level is that abolishing canal section Linne by combining the canal section with the upstream or downstream canal sections is not advisable. Weir and weir section Linne should be maintained in the future. This hold also for the other canal sections of the Meuse corridor except for canal section Lith. Because this canal section is the most downstream section in the Meuse canalization and far away from Linne, interventions to this canal section would have no effect on weir and canal section Linne. However the result holds for the current layout of the Meuse corridor. If a new layout should be proposed for the canalization of the Meuse it should be analyzed if weir Linne should be maintained or removed. The Maasplassen have a damping effect on the water level changes in canal section Linne. The damping effect is the effect of the relation between the changing discharge with respect to the water level changes in the canal section. Due to the Maasplassen the water level changes develop more slowly compared to a situation without the Maasplassen. This is the result of the storage capacity of the Maasplassen. The damping effect of the Maasplassen is most preferable and effective during low discharges. Navigational dept is maintained for a longer period because the water level decrease proceeds slowly due to the connected lakes. The discharge accuracy of the weir is not sufficient for the small discharges in the future, to maintain the navigable depth during low discharges the discharge accuracy should be increased. The damping has less effect on extreme high discharges compared to low discharges. Because the canal section is relatively small the water level rise will be relatively quick regardless of the damping effect of the Maasplassen. An increase of the storage capacity of the Maasplassen has a minor influence on this effect. However, the banks and retention areas are omitted in the analysis of the effects of the Maasplassen to the water level changes in canal section Linne. The results are not exact however, relative to each other the variants do represent a clear view about the effect of the Maasplassen to the water level changes. The opening procedure shorter than 8 hours is reliable after high discharges are measured at measure point Maastricht St. Pieter. Investigations on running times of flood waves on the Meuse have been done are not valid any more. Due to the Grensmaasproject running times for food waves will change. It is not advisable according to the RINK (=Risico Inventarisatie Natte Kunstwerken) report to replace the total weir of Linne at the moment. It is advised to monitor the condition of the weir until the period 2030 - 2035 and to take after this period a final decision. After this period a decision should be made to replace the or maintain the current weir for a longer period. In this report is concluded to maintain the current weir construction instead constructing a new weir. Due to over dimensioning the concrete super construction is a robust construction. The upgrade of the current weir will be done by the removal of the Poirée gates and constructing a new gate on the old Poirée part. The Poirée gate does not meet the requirements according to the ARBO legislations and the gate is not able to be remote controlled. The new type of weir that is chose to replace the old Poirée gates is the inflatable flap gate. The flap gate is able to retain a the required water level, able to close the old Poirée part without large reconstruction of the weir. The gate fulfills (when properly designed) the ARBO legislations and is able to be remote controlled. The flap gate is designed in concrete class C90/105, this is a high strength concrete. High strength concrete is a durable construction material and requires less maintenance compared to steel constructions, especially in wet environments. The gate will be supported three air filled bladders, the bladders are placed next to each other. The concrete construction meets the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The checks of reinforcement, cracks and moment of failure are done for bending moments and shear resulting of loads perpendicular to the gate. Torsion due to for example failure of bladders is not taken into account. Checks to the concrete gate with regard to moments, cracks and failure due to torsion moments are also not taken into account. The gate will be placed as a prefabricated element. The element contains the gate, bladder, chain and supporting bottom plate. The plate is on upstream side placed at the rotation notches of the former Poirée gates and on the downstream side to the weir bottom. The gate could be further optimized, optimization could be done by for example reducing of the gate weight and curving the gate to increase the discharge capacity.","Weir; Linne; Maas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

In dit onder-zoek wordt er gekeken naar de gemiddelde waarde en de standaardafwijking van deze constante a.d.h.v. meetgegevens rondom het IJsselmeer.

De berekeningen komen echter veel dichter bij de realiteit wan-neer de windsnelheid niet tot de tweede, maar tot de derde macht genomen wordt. De verklaring hiervoor is een evenredigheid tussen de wrijvingscoëfficiënt tussen lucht en water en de windsnel-heid. Voor het bepalen van de nauwkeurigheid van de formule wordt in eerste instantie gekeken naar een standaardafwijking van de constante in de formule. Met deze methode worden de resultaten voor grotere windopzetten echter erg onnauwkeurig. Een manier om dit op te lossen is door bij de voor-spelde windopzet een constante op te tellen die een standaardafwijking heeft, en bij een waarde van nul de gemiddelde windopzet geeft. Deze standaardafwijking heeft een dimensie, en is afhankelijk van het beschouwde gebied.

(mentor)","2015","Creating opportunities for semi-professional athletes in Brazil The aim of the old SouEsporte platform was to bring Brazilian athletes and companies together. Due to a drop in page visits, an unclear value proposition and a lack of interaction between companies and athletes MJV Technology and Innovation, a Brazil based company, decided to pivot the platform. Before redesigning the platform an analysis of the user needs was performed to get a better understanding of the context around sports in Brazil. The primary goal of the platform is to help athletes grow their career by creating an online platform that stimulates traffic and has a business model to generate revenues. In Brazil athletes, and especially individuals, face difficulties trying to “win” the scholarships or sponsorships that help them to start a professional career. Finding the way from semi-professional the professional sports is difficult since the organizational pyramid in the sport sector is far from professionally organised. “Brazil is a great country for sports, but not for athletes” (Dacosta, 2006). To close the gap between semi-professional athletes and professional athletes, SouEsporte was pivoted into a crowdfunding platform. Crowdfunding is defined as an open call over the internet for financial resources in the form of a monetary donation, sometimes in exchange for a future product, service or other rewards (Belleflamme et al, 2011). The analysis of crowdfunding literature was the starting point of the creation of the customer journey. Several interviews were done with athletes, in which this customer journey was validated. This in turn led to the definition of , the four P’s of crowdfunding. Together with those four P’s an interaction quality was formed for SouEsporte: “the platform should act as a coach”. Additionally, several difficulties that athletes running a crowdfunding campaign might encounter were identified; the (costs of) givebacks, setting up a campaign schedule and compiling a video. To counter the difficulties of givebacks, in this thesis Crowdfunding 2.0 is suggested to bring companies and athletes together. Athletes can save money on their givebacks and companies can reach a broader audience via a new channel. Athletes promote the companies, both online and offline, and companies provide a giveback for the fans of an athlete. Introducing a third stakeholder in the crowdfunding process forms the opportunity to create a new business model compared to traditional crowdfunding platforms. Other unique features of the SouEsporte platform, like compiling a video, a pre-defined campaign schedule, live statistics and “medalise athlete” will be introduced to give SouEsporte a unique look and feel that will help athletes make the next step in their career. In a roadmap, which consists of five stages, the future steps for MJV Technology and Innovation in relation to the SouEsporte platform are described. The steps explain how to implement all functions and work together with several stakeholders to make SouEsporte a successful platform. The first stage - the prototype of the platform - will be developed by external partner in Pakistan to reduce back-end development costs. The layout and front-end development is done by MJV.","crowdfunding; sports; Brazil; talent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","","22.9068, 43.1729"

(mentor); Albayrak, A. (mentor)","2015","The value of user centred design lies in the increased product acceptance that can be achieved after new product implementation. In designing for healthcare, barriers that impede successful product acceptance can most often be attributed to the gap that exists between medical professionals and product developers. Centralising the intended user of the product during the design phases, and allowing user input and contextual factors to shape the design will help evade these barriers and support product acceptance of any innovation. Innofuse’s innovation comprehends a new principle for merging various drugs and nutrition within an IV set that connects a patient to an IV therapy system. Their innovation was triggered by clinical feedback, describing a lack of system control and research findings illustrating issues with the current performance of the IV sets that are used. Innofuse’s objective is to develop an IV set for simultaneous infusion of drugs and nutrition that supports a more accurate and immediate administration. IV therapy, referring to the infusion of fluids directly into a patients bloodstream, is employed in several area’s of healthcare. The consequences for inaccurate or delayed drug administration, differ between these area’s, and between their respective patient groups. Innofuse focusses on developing an innovative IV set for Neonatal Intensive Care, because the smallest fluctuations in dosages or drug administration delays, have the most severe consequences in pre-term or newborn infants. The need for innovation has been recognised by the departments that provide Neonatal Intensive Care, including physicians and nursing staff. However, resistance towards change, remains a barrier that impedes new product implementation and acceptance in the current care context. This thesis will investigate the barriers for new product acceptance in healthcare, and address contextual factors specifically for the implementation of an new IV set for Neonatal Intensive Care. It will provide recommendations to assist evading barriers or eliminating them, and create guidelines for the product to be designed that suit these recommendations. The approach that was followed entails close collaboration with the context, it stakeholders, and mainly its key user, the nursing staff. A generative session provided insight in current IV therapy practise in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units and actual inconveniences perceived by the staff on a daily basis. Main themes that were uncovered by contextual research include: product-user communication, a sense of feedback regarding product related actions, user confidence to positively influence risk-benefit assessment and inconveniences with fluid flow distinction. Preliminary designs, that challenge these themes, have been created and assessed in an iterative process. During a course of five months several design concepts have been detailed and evaluated. These concepts were underlined with principles of “guiding correct use”, “shape correction”, and “shape completion”. The use of several contextual design models and methods, lead to a final design proposal that was evaluated through user testing in a simulated environment. This final design is called Tulive. User testing showed the need for feedback of human actions on more levels, and the value of simplistic and unambiguous use cues. A proof of the principle of “shape completion” was provided by the results of this test, and complemented by recommendations for further development of Tulive. The user centred, collaborative approach, including several feedback moments with intended users, and the implementation of those findings into new concepts, decreases the gap that exists between healthcare professionals and the product development industry. It has proved promising for other challenges in healthcare design, that strive to achieve product acceptance in their respective contexts","neonatology; user centred","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-04-10","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Deformation estimates obtain under blind conditions (i.e. processed without the usage of a-priori information) can be questionable and controversial. The problem manifests itself when different users process the same radar data and obtain different results in terms of density of PS points, the estimated deformation, etc. This problem can jeopardize the reliability of PSI technique and can make confusion among both researchers and end-users. To alleviate this problem we proposed to make use of a-priori knowledge (APK) during PSI processing. We developed a web-based platform which different sources of APK reside in form of questionnaire and some databases. Based on the provided APK, we utilized an assessment strategy to assign optimal value for the parameters required for PSI processing. This methodology is applied based on the case study of Harlingen, a subsiding area located in northern part of the Netherlands. We used the designed questionnaire to acquire user's knowledge about the deforming area and arrive at optimal value for a number of input-parameters. We also utilized external databases to demonstrate their impacts on deformation estimates.","A-Priori Knowledge (APK); deformation monitoring; Persistent Scatterers (PS); radar interferometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Hordijk, A.C. (mentor)","2015","This research originates from the lack of knowledge within the scientific literature on the conditions under which tenants and landlords of Dutch retail property actually opt for turnover rent. Where scientific and news sources were more focused on the reasons why turnover rent is not used in the Netherlands more often, this study attempted to address the subject from the other side. In that way, balanced knowledge arises and parties are informed about the contract choices. Therefore the aim was to provide insight into the conditions that gave parties enough reasons to choose for a turnover rent contract. The following question formed the basis for this study: Why do tenants and landlords use turnover rent contracts at Dutch retail property, what obstacles do they face and how do they to deal with it? To answer the research question, literature research has been done, thirteen semi-structured interviews with market participants are conducted and desk research has been done. First as a reference, three interviews were held with one investor who operates in three European countries. In addition, three contracts from these countries were analysed together with the rental income which partially resulted from turnover rent. During the interviews with parties with real estate in the Netherlands, five different types of landlords with shopping malls, two landlords with retail in shopping streets and three retailers were questioned. For the Netherlands, a standard agreement with a fixed rent was analysed. From the interviews and data analysis on European retail property, it appears that the base rent with turnover rent component, is the standard form of contract. The rental income differs based on the different branches of stores. Shoe stores pay, on average, the most rent in proportion to their turnover (9.8%) and in most countries, telecommunications and electronics stores pay the lowest rent in proportion to their turnover (2.8%). Of the total rental income, only a small fraction (1.5%) came from turnover rent income. The study shows that the parties with a standard ROZ contract agree on a revalued indexed rent. In this study, this form is described as the traditional fixed rent. Landlords of shopping centres in the Netherlands that use turnover rent, generally apply contracts with a base rent with a turnover rent component company-wide. In addition they also use a traditional fixed rent, a full fixed rent / total turnover rent, a variable turnover rent or a total turnover rent. Landlords with retail objects in shopping streets generally use a standard fixed rent agreement and, in exceptional situations, a base rent with turnover rent component. For owners of shopping centres, or retail locations where influence on the turnover of retailers is possible, it is advised to use turnover rent contracts with the highest possible base rent for all retail units. Exceptions are made for anchor tenants and tenants that have a showrooming store. It is advised to still make arrangements for providing the turnovers for proactive management. For landlords with shops in shopping streets, or locations where the owner has no influence on the conversion of the retailer, it’s advised to use a fixed traditional rent contracts. Exceptions are made in situations where there are no other possibilities and vacancy will arise. For retailers, it is wise to financially calculate the ideal form of contract, based on the projected sales compared to desired rent from the landlord. If the retailer projects more turnover than the landlord, it’s wise to agree on a fixed rent contract. If the landlord projects a higher sales potential than the retailer, it’s wise to negotiate a turnover rent contract based on the projections from the landlord. If a fixed rent contract is agreed and the landlord has influence on the turnover of the retailer, in for instance a shopping centre, it’s smart to still give insight in the sales as an information tool for proactive asset management.","turnover rent; retail; contract; sales rent","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Leisure & Retail Lab","",""

(mentor)","2015","The development of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model generally requires calibration to obtain non-observable parameters. This becomes especially difficult in river basins where data are absent, frequently intermittent or inaccurate. Rainfall-runoff models are usually calibrated on discharge data that are derived from stage observations by means of a rating curve. However, this method is error-prone, as it is not able to get around problems such as a changing geometry of the river channel, flows over floodplain and a variable roughness coefficient due to vegetation. Moreover, uncertain stage observations can be a severe source of error as well, because of incorrect placement of the staff gauges or incorrect and infrequent stage readings. Calibration on uncertain discharge data can affect modeled parameters and consequently be cause for erroneous model predictions. This works uses water levels of reservoirs to calibrate a conceptual rainfall-runoff model in the Umbeluzi River Basin. The conceptual model provides the inflow to the reservoir, subsequently reservoir storage is modeled and compared to the observed storage. The proposed method has several advantages over the conventional method. First of all, stage observations are accurately observed because of the social and economic importance of the reservoir. Moreover, the method is well suited to observe floods, as the shape of the reservoir is well confined and its capacity generally more than adequate. It also captures the entire volume of a flood, in contrary to the conventional method where effects of hysteresis can be cause for misconception of the river discharge. An additional advantage is that reservoirs can integrate multiple tributaries, allowing to model tributaries that are not or scarcely gauged. Lastly, this method may have some economic benefits as the water levels and the surface area of the reservoir can in principal be derived by radar altimetry through satellites. This allows for the system to be remotely calibrated. By incorporating irrigation into the hydrological model, the effects of artificial reservoirs on the basin hydrology are assessed. The conceptual model is calibrated with inclusion and exclusion of irrigation and subsequently best parameter sets are compared. Results show that the excess irrigation water that percolates to the ground water has a significant influence on the resulting base flow, such that model parameters have to be compensated when irrigation is excluded. Moreover, a changing crop need due to the varying lengths of dry spells, is cause for variability in irrigation over the years. This makes modeling base flow challenging. It appears that inclusion of irrigation into the hydrological model is the only way to obtain a consistent ground water parameter. This thesis shows a validation approach whereby multiple system components are validated on various independent data-sources. The modeled evaporation is compared to evaporation that is developed with use of satellite data. Both time-series correspond well, which implies that the lumped modeled water storage of the catchment is plausible. In addition, it implicitly validates the amount of transpiration from irrigation, which is included in the actual evaporation. To validate on smaller system components, the water levels of the conceptualized floodplain storage are compared to observed river stage. Although absolute values are not comparable, the emptying and filling of the flood plains harmonizes with the rate of change of observed stage levels. Lastly, the model is tested on a tributary of the catchment, generating reasonable model prediction, despite the poor data quality. The author argues that this way of validation is more valuable than validating on time-series outside the calibration period, as it takes multiple aspects of the system into account. For this study both a lumped and a topography driven model is tested. During the calibration, both models give a similar model performance. However the optimum parameter set of the topography driven mode was better applicable in other catchments. Moreover, the parameters derived where also more realistic. It is therefore that the topography driven model works better for the Umbeluzi catchment.","hydrology; rainfall-runoff hydrology; Umbeluzi; conceptual modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Hydrology","","-26.25, -31.5"

A so called mixed method design is used to investigate this market value from both a qualitative as well as a quantitative perspective. With the use of a hedonic pricing model the market values of national listed monuments have found to be 12,4% higher than those of non-listed buildings. In addition national listed monuments have a market value premium of 8,1% over municipal listed monuments. This implies that the more cultural historic value a building has the higher it is valued on the housing market. The qualitative part explains this higher market value. Housing owners of transformed buildings, with a special cultural history, do appreciate the specifi c qualities of cultural heritage within their daily housing comfort. They in particular appreciate the atmosphere created by the cultural history of the building. This atmosphere is believed to infl uence the experience value of a building and thereby the use value of a house. This higher use value has a direct relationship with a higher market value. The research concludes that buildings with a special cultural history are higher valued on the housing market, because they have an atmosphere that appeals to housing buyers. This atmosphere contributes to both an impulsive acquisition of the house as well as to a higher use value by providing a higher joy of living.","marktwaarde; cultureel erfgoed; woningmarkt; transformaties; monumenten; casestudies; hedonisch prijsmodel","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","REM Adaptive re-use","","52.07708, 4.30694"

(mentor)","2015","For future Floating Liquid Natural Gas vessel (FLNG) developments, SBM Offshore is considering system for offloading of Liquid Natural GAS (LNG). The ability to offload LNG at minus 163 degrees Celsius from the Twin-Hull FLNG to an LNG Carrier (LNGC), is of high importance to the overall operability and economic viability of FLNG development. Side-by-side offloading is preferred above tandemoffloading, due to the location of the (off-)loading manifolds on the LNG carrier. Furthermore the maximum distance for transporting the -163 degrees LNG is limited due to mechanical and thermal properties of offloading system components. Traditionally, time-consuming physical model tests are being used to determine the side-by-side relative response of the FLNG and the LNGC, when subjected to specific waves forces. The aim of this thesis is to verify and validate the suitability ofHydroStar and Ariane software models, to predict responses for the FLNG and the LNG carrier, by comparing the vessel response calculations to the results of model tests performed in the MARIN offshore basin. The calculated responses are performed both in frequency domain and in timedomain, which in both cases is much faster obtained compared to responses obtained by physical model tests. The relative manifold motions are a crucial design factor for the (off-)loading system. A description of the MARIN offshore basin setups for soft-mooring and turret-mooring is given. Both setups are without the LNGC, so the FLNG is moored on its own inside the offshore basin. The responses obtained from these experiments are illustrated and compared. This study exposed unexpected outcomes for roll and especially the sway Response Amplitude Operator (RAO). The sway RAO shows an extreme peak value for the turret moored FLNG. This peak value is not observed in the soft mooring experiments. A theoretical description of HydroStar with the respective setups for the FLNG without the LNG Carrier is discussed. HydroStar does not account for a mooring-system so the same model is used both for the soft- as for the turret-mooring. The frequency response calculated by HydroStar corresponds more to the response observed in soft-mooring than to the response observed in turret-mooring. The HydroStar response does not show the extreme sway peak observed in turret-mooring experiments. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis by HydroStar concluded that the extra roll response of the FLNG in soft-mooring can be the result of a different weight distribution between the two vessels. Two different vessel setups were used in the turret- and soft-mooring experiments. The response of the side-by-side setup is analyzed using HydroStar. The FLNG in SBS arrangement shows a similar response as to the FLNG alone, no extreme sway peak response is observed by HydroStar. Likewise, the response of the LNGC is about the same as the FLNG response. However the response obtained from MARIN for the FLNG in side-by-side (SBS) arrangement shows again no correlation for sway in the lower wave frequencies. This exceptional sway peak also applies for the sway response for the LNGC, observed in the offshore basin. The natural frequency of the turret mooring system does not come near this sway peak. Therefore the mooring system does not seem to be responsible for the observed sway motion amplification. Investigation on the effects of weight distribution, epsilon damping and linear viscous damping, showed that also these are not the source for the sway motion amplification. Possibly viscous phenomena are causing the observed sway behavior, which are neglected in HydroStar. HydroStar is not capable of calculating the sway RAO’s for this typical mooring set-up. In order to ""fit"" the computed RAO’s with the obtained experimental RAO’s, the model has been tuned. The ""tuned"" RAO’s are the RAO’s computed by HydroStar except for the sway RAO. The ""tuned"" sway amplitude RAO and the ""tuned"" sway phase RAO are obtained from MARIN. Subsequently, using Ariane multiple time domain analysis are executed, with the ""untuned"" and ""tuned"" RAO’s as input. Their results consist of time traces of the relative manifold motions, which are compared with the manifold motions obtained from the MARIN experiments. The time domain analysis with ""untuned"" RAO’s show satisfying correlations in X- and Z-direction, however the Y-direction (relative sway) does not correlate with the relative sway obtained in the offshore basin. For the ""tuned"" RAO’s all six Degree of Freedom (DOF)’s do correlate, including the sway motions. Due to insufficient experimental data, a true validation of the HydroStar SBS model and Ariane SBS model is not possible. Therefore it is recommended to perform additional side-by-side experiments in the MARIN offshore basin, which include appropriate parameters purposely designed for calculating the HydroStar SBS and Ariane SBS mdoels.","mooring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Floating structures","","51.999112, 4.370564"

With additive manufacturing design freedom is offered, which enables new opportunities for structural engineers and designers. This new opportunity is applied to design and produce structural joints for gridshells in an innovative way. Topology optimization is used to minimize the weight of the joints. This resulted in a weight reduction of almost 70 % for the Z?oty Tarasy gridshell. Moreover, improved solutions for the detailing of the joints are found. This reduces the labour intensity and it speeds up the erection process. Although the use of additive manufacturing for structural joints for gridshells is not cost efficient yet, it can be in the near future when printing speed goes up and material costs go down. With increased knowledge of the applied design and production method, it might become economically and technically feasible to produce structural joints in gridshells by additive manufacturing.","additive manufacturing; 3D printing; joints; gridshells; light-weight structures; weight reduction; topology optimization; innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Haan, A.R.C. (mentor); De Bruijne, M.L.C. (mentor)","2015","During normal situations there is enough fresh water available for all functions in the Netherlands. But in times of droughts fresh water supply and water safety are at risk. For these periods of water scarcity, a sequence of priority on available fresh water distribution is present. However, experts consider that even these precautions are insufficient. It is expected that due to climate change droughts will increase and become more severe. But, economic and spatial development in the Netherlands are only possible when water safety and fresh water supply are safeguarded. The impact and consequences on society of failure of water functions caused by even these temporal water shortages can be high. Water stress has negative economic, environmental and social consequences, because fresh water is an important resource for drinking water production, electricity production, agriculture, industries, recreation and fishery. The Advisory Council for Transport, Public Works and Water Management advised the Dutch government that due to climate change a more proactive way of dealing with uncertainties is necessary for the future (Raad voor Verkeer en Waterstaat, 2009, p. 53). In sum, implementing adaptive management is necessary as future developments will probably lead to a higher negative impact of water scarcity situations as more fresh water is needed for social and economic development. Especially during these situations trade-offs between water uses have to be made. Therefor the following research question will be answered: How to analyse the Dutch socio-technical water system to design for a process to improve long term adaptive management of temporary water scarcity?. By answering this research question the following design objective be reached: A process design for long term adaptive management for situations of temporary water scarcity in the Dutch socio-technological water system. Because no standard blue print for process designs exist, a case study is used to develop a process design for dealing with long term adaptive management of water scarcity situations. The case of the Rhine-Estuary Drechtsteden has been selected, because of the complexity of this area. This area has been appointed by the Delta Commission as an area of special attention, because of future water challenges. Next to this there is also an institutional complexity with many different water users and water managers. For dealing with water scarcity in Rhine-Estuary Drechtsteden it recommended to implement the process design within the current policy cycles of water management. is a total overview of the process design. The process design is a total concept consisting of a mode of thinking, method of working, instruments and process rules. For presenting the process design the structure of Bekkering et al. (2007, pp. 94, 95) is adapted. The mode of thinking of this process design is based on the following concepts: Adaptive management (Folke, Hahn, Olsson, & Norberg, 2005; Mysiak, Henrikson, Sullivan, Bromley, & Pahl-Wostl, 2010; Pahl-Wostl, 2008; Raad voor Verkeer en Waterstaat, 2009), Process management (de Bruijn & ten Heuvelhof, 2008; de Bruijn et al., 2002) and Integrated Water Resource Management (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2004; GWP, 2000; Savenije & Van der Zaag, 2008; UN-Water, 2008). Adaptive Management and Integrated Water Resource Management are widely accepted in the field of water management. Although these concepts are widely accepted, the process of implementation lacks. The suggested method of working consists of the implementation of revision points in combination with social learning within the current policy cycle of the water management. Because the current synchronisation in time between the plans is maintained, it is possible to integrate these revision points in the current policy cycle. For this process design the instrument of mediated modelling workshops of Van den Belt (2004) is suggested as method of working for the implementation of social learning in decision making processes. The mediated modelling workshops are especially suitable, because it is applied within the field of environmental consensus building. Process rules are suggested based on De Bruijn et al. (de Bruijn et al., 2002). This process is designed for long term adaptive water management for dealing with temporal water scarcity for the case of Rhine-Estuary Drechtsteden. Aspects of this process design are more generally applicable for other cases of temporal resource scarcity. The set-up of this process design with the mode of thinking, method of working, instruments and process rules has given a good overview of the total concept of a process design. Therefore it is recommended to be used in designing processes.","Water scarcity; Integrated Water Resource Management; Participatory processes; Adaptive Management; Process Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","","",""

(mentor); van der Spek, B.J.T. (mentor); van Ledden, M. (mentor); Nillesen, A.L. (mentor)","2015","Flood safety in low-lying delta regions has been a challenge of all ages. Societies worldwide have been trying to protect themselves against flood hazards for centuries. Floods in vulnerable urban regions are often caused by heavy rainfall, high river flow, extreme sea levels, or combinations of those three. Currently, there is a lack of tools and experience in assessing the effects of combined pluvial, riverine and coastal flood risk reduction measures for delta cities. The objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive risk-based model, which supports decision making in delta cities on measures against pluvial, riverine and coastal floods. An idealised hydrologic model has been developed to evaluate flood extent and frequency due to combination of these three factors in urban environments. The model quantifies pluvial, riverine and coastal flooding and identifies the contribution of different weather events to floods in a delta city. The city is schematised by a typical lay-out, in which different elements of a city’s flood protection system are connected. The city was drafted as a storage basin with varying areal sections as a function of the city’s elevation levels; incoming and outgoing water fluxes; and different strengths of flood protection elements, including waterfront resistance, discharge capacity and storage capacity. By calculating the hydrological budget of water, flood levels in the city can be computed as a function of precipitation and water levels in time. The computed flood levels are coupled with stage-damage relationships to define the direct economic damages. By comparing the economic damage and the investment costs, an optimal mix of measures (river flood defences, water pumps, storage areas) can be defined. The model serves as a practical tool that can be used in the search for an optimal combination of flood risk reduction measures. The study has adopted the City of Hoboken in New Jersey (United States) as a case study to apply the idealised risk model. Because of Hoboken’s history as an island, the low-lying area inundates when water levels in the Hudson River increase due to storm surges. In combination with severe rainfall, the impermeable surface and a lack of drainage, floods also occur during high rainfall events, especially when the excess water cannot be drained into the river. The consequences of a flood can be very large because of Hoboken’s economic valuable character and central location. Different combinations of flood risk reduction measures were included by the model consisting of waterfront protection; increasing storage capacity within the city; and increasing discharge capacity. For every combination the reduced flood risk, compared to the current situation of the city, has been calculated. The sum of the investment costs and the expected damage or risk, are the total costs for the combination of the system. The investment costs of each combination have been balanced with its corresponding benefit (i.e. risk reduction). In this study the economic optimum is defined as the combination with the lowest total costs. For Hoboken the elements for computing the present value of the risk and investment costs in this study were a preliminary estimation. Recommended areas for further improvement of the model are: uncertainty and sensitivity analyses for improving robustness of the model; a study to the dependency of input variables and system elements; and investigation to the effects of correlated surges and precipitation on the model results. Despite its assumptions, the model serves as a practical and convenient tool, which can be used in the search for an optimal combination of flood risk reduction measures in delta cities. It can quickly identify the different flood events in a delta city and it can quantify their frequencies and scales. For this matter, it offers realistic insight in the rates between pluvial, riverine and coastal flooding and the required flood risk reduction measures. As a result, the presented comprehensive flood risk model in this study is an effective and efficient tool for urban planners, engineering companies and decision makers of delta cities.","Flood risk; Delta cities; Pluvial flooding; Riverine flooding; Coastal flooding; Risk-based model; Comprehensive flood strategy; Integral design; Resilience; Rebuild by Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Flood Risk & Hydraulic Structures","",""
