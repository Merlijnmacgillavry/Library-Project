(mentor); De Haan, A.R.C. (mentor); Steenhuisen, B.M. (mentor)","2011","In recent years, the occasional ineffectiveness in policy analysis to support policy making in major infrastructure projects in the Netherlands has caught our attention in exploring the latent causes and proper tools to facilitate policy making in the Netherlands. Our client, Het Buitenhuis in the Netherlands, has been engaged in facilitating policy makers in the Netherlands with untraditional ways to create policy, which they call “out of box thinking”. Given the need of an appropriate policy making approach in the Netherlands, it seems worthwhile to study its value in some particular cases. To be specific, we introduce a new method, “the world-café”, as a potential innovative and to our client very promising policy making approach. Therefore, main research question is: Is the world-café approach a suitable alternative to facilitate policy making in the Netherlands, given the style of policy making embedded in the Netherlands? In order to answer this main research question, we delineate it into two sub-research questions in this research: The first step is to study what kind of impact is there from the cultural and non-cultural factors on the Dutch way of policy making, and whether the world-café fits the Dutch policy making context in theory. In this step, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions are applied to find the relations with the Hexagon model to define the features of the Dutch culture, which will enhance our understanding in this country’s unique behavior when it comes to policy making. Meanwhile, previous research on Dutch perspective on policy analysis is studied to understand this country’ style of policy making. As a result we generate the prevailing policy making style in the Netherlands, namely loose rational + restricted participatory/interactive. Besides, given the features of the world-café, we conclude that it embraces the similar style as the style of policy making in the Netherlands, which leads us to the assumption that this new approach should enhance policy making in Dutch environment, which is tested in the next step with further experiments. The second step is therefore to answer the question whether the world-café a promising approach in the Netherlands after testing it also in practice: conducting the world-café workshop as in Het Buitenshuis version in Dutch policy making context? Or should there be any adjustments? In this step, two rounds of the world-café experiments are conducted with Dutch Ministry people and Het Buitenhuis staff. The Betuweroute is used as case study in the experiment. At the same time, we also define the German style of policy making with sources available as this helps to explain why things at the border of the Netherlands and Germany did not seem to match in Betuweroute case. Experience and suggestion are required from the participants on how well the world-café works to solve problems according to the tools they normally use and whether there is space to improve the Het Buitenhuis version of the world-café with problem conceptualization as a start. The secondary aim that this experiment serves is to make the conflicts between German and Dutch policy making explicit for measures to take in solving them. Thus we also test the performance of this method in offering benefits for cooperation in such major infrastructure projects. Conclusions are given on how this world-café method can be modified to facilitate policy making in the Netherlands. Suggestions are made for future projects, on how it can be applied and what resistance might occur etc.","cultural and non-cultural factors; Dutch policy making style; World-café approach; Betuweroute","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-31","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","",""

This study will try to investigate the driving processes in the model and adapt or extend the model application to the coastal system. If we want to apply the model, it has to be determined if the various model assumptions hold in a sandy coastal environment. This need becomes more urgent when dealing with a type of ‘mega’ nourishment like the sand engine, because of the considerable portion of surface area above the water line. To make the model suitable for the Dutch coastal zone, changes had to be made to several program components. From literature, several processes can be identified that have to be included in a proper model of coastal aeolian transport as opposed to a desert environment. This study identified several of these aspects that should be included in a correct model of aeolian sediment transport. The cases of the sand engine and Vlugtenburg put these modifications to the test and evaluated the results. With the sand engine case the emphasis lies on the evolution of the shape due to aeolian processes. The Vlugtenburg profile represents an arbitrary beach profile, but also contains interesting features like vegetated dunes and a sandy dune valley. Model results show that the processes of aeolian transport and morphologic feedback on the topography are captured. Combining this model with a hydraulic transport models like Delft3D or XBeach could provide more insight in the processes that act in the interface between the sea and the (high) beach.","aeolian transport; dunes; process-based; wind; sand engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","This thesis describes the research which have been conducted on the self adjusting multinozzle electrospraying technique, applied in an electrostatic wind energy converter (EWICON). An EWICON system directly converts wind energy to electrical energy by the displacement of charged droplets in the opposite direction of an electric field. Electrospraying referrers to a process where nozzles are formed by so called Taylor cones. These cones form the nozzles which spray an aerosol of charged droplets. The self adjusting technique offers advantages compared to other methods with respect to electrospraying properties and utilization of material. For practical implementation, the following components have been simulated and tested. First the electrode configuration was optimized for electrospraying. This configuration exists of two cylindrical conductors at a distance of 42 mm and a diameter ratio of 1 to 8. This ratio appeared to be able to generate the desired electric field for stable electrospraying while minimizing the velocity in which the charged droplets are attracted back to the system. A wind shield was designed and applied to locally increase wind speed and provide stable Taylor cone formation. Secondly the creation of charged droplets was examined with this setup. A mixture of 30% ethanol and 70% demineralized water appeared to be the most suitable spraying liquid. Experiments were conducted to observe the relation between the flow rate and applied potential and the number of Taylor cones with the coresponding current. From these experiments can be concluded that it is desirable to generate a large number of Taylor cones while maintaining an as low as possible flow rate and charging potential. Higher potential will result in unstable spraying and corona discharges. It was discovered that the number of cones could be significantly be increased by making use of the hysteresis effect. Finally the charging system was placed on an insulated self-supplying platform to complete the EWICON system. Experiments have been conducted, using a wind generator, to assess the performance according to output power. Results were compared to a similar needle configuration (using needles as nozzles) investigated by D. Djairam. There has been a significant improvement according to previous charging experiments with the self adjusting multinozzle system. However, the system efficiency is low compared to the needle system, due to the inability of removing all charged droplets from the system by the wind. A comparable output power could be achieved, when all charged droplets would be removed and improvements are realized according to the output power per nozzle. In this stage of this research, the advantages of the self adjusting character of the systems are being outweighed by the sensitivity to variations in flow rate, wind speed and electric field distribution. Another important aspect is the humidity of the surrounding air which causes leakage currents and disturbing the electrospraying process. In general, it can be concluded that the self adjusting multinozzle system offers perspective for implementation in an EWICON system. However, further research should be conducted to improve electrical, as well as aerodynamic performance.","electrospraying; EWICON; wind energy; high voltage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","High voltage technology & management","","","",""

This study then raised two main research questions that need to be answered, ""Why should document printer manufacturers consider entering the package printing market and how will these manufacturers enter the market segments in terms of entry strategy and why digital is used as the preferred technology?"" And, ""What is the most attractive market segment on which document printer manufacturers can focus while entering the package printing market and what are the preferred digital printing technologies to enter this segment?"" Based on the analysis, there are five segments in the digital package printing market that Océ can enter. These are label printing, folding cartons, flexible plastics, rigid plastics, and metal package printing segments. From these segments, label and folding cartons package printings are the most interesting segments for printer manufacturers similar to Océ to enter. The market for folding cartons packaging segment is steadily growing alongside label printing thanks to the increasing demand for short run printing, customization and personalization, market tests, sales samples, and prototypes. The digital technology of inkjet should be the first choice for package printing. Inkjet printing still has more opportunities to develop the technology further compared to electrophotography (toner). Inkjet technology enables printing on non-flat surfaces e.g. already folded packaging because the print heads do not make contact with the surface, meaning more flexibility on printing surfaces that inkjet can handle. In the overall package printing industry, digital technologies are still in the early stages of their life-cycle. The market for conventional technologies is already quite a competitive market where with poorer growth opportunities. The digital technologies are still in the introduction phase. Their adoption rate is still limited to early adopters and niche markets. In the digital package printing market, electrophotography is now becoming the dominant design of digital in package printing with a large market share. However, the development of electrophotography will be less since it is already mature compared to inkjet, which is still growing, catching up with electrophotography. Nevertheless this study has some limitations. This analysis is based on information that depicts the current situation in the digital package printing. Years from now, the trends, dominant technologies, attractive segments and other aspects will develop and change. Since this study is done for possible markets that printer manufacturers can enter in the future there will always of course uncertainty and unpredictable actions of competitors.","packaging; package printing; technology life cycle; digital printing; offset printing; entry strategy; market segments; printing technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","",""

It is expected that the flood problem will increase in the future due to urban and industrial developments in low lying areas, climate change and land subsidence. A possible solution for, or contribution in solving, these problems is controlling the in- and outflow in the estuary mouth to a feasible extent with a barrier downstream of HCMC.

(mentor)","2011","The safety of a large part of the Netherlands is dependent on the safety level of our flood protections. The height and volume of the dunes and the near shore zone influence this safety level. Robust dunes have provided natural safety against the sea for centuries. In the last centuries, structural erosion of the coastline and the increase of the use of the hinterland have made coastal maintenance a necessity in order to provide this safety. The Noord-Holland coast is one of the most extensively maintained coastal stretches of the Netherlands. In the last twenty years Rijkswaterstaat nourished this coastal stretch with a total volume of 44 million cubic meters, in the shape of beach and foreshore nourishments. To assess the need of such extensive maintenance and to map sedimentation and erosion trends a system description is made. Over the area from IJmuiden till Den Helder, the coas is divided into seven coastal cells (van Rijn, 1997). Per cell the near shore volume evolution is analysed. To describe the Noord-Holland coast it is chosen to use the JARKUS database. Forty five year of coastal morphologic data is used, over the period 1965 to the year 2010. The error with regards to the JARKUS data is found to be limited when a large number of profiles is analysed. This can be explained by the law of large numbers and a convergence of the systematic error. Accuracy in the order of 15 – 21 m2 over the surface of a profile needs to be taken into account. In the year 1990 a new coastal maintenance policy was introduced; “Dynamic Preservation”. This policy had the strategic objective “to guarantee a sustainable safety level and sustainable preservation of values and functions in the dune area” (Min V&W 2001). To reach the objective a coastal state indicator has been implemented. In the year 1990 the position of the coastline was established through a concept called the Basal Coast Line. Combined with a benchmarking principle a method was formulated to assess when coastal maintenance, in the form of nourishmens, is needed. Since the implementation of this benchmarking principle and the “Dynamic Preservation” policy the nourishment volume increased vastly. By correcting for the artificially added volumes an autonomous volume evolution is presented for each cell. With the assumption that similar erosion rates would have been present without coastal maintenance, an indication of the state of the Noord-Holland coast is given. The near shore volume corrected for nourishments over the period 1990 – 2010 shows an autonomous degradation of similar order compared to the years 1970 – 1990. This indicates that for the whole Noord-Holland coastal stretch, the concept of the autonomous behaviour as conservative indication of erosion / sedimentation rates holds plausible values. The system description indicates that the coastal stretch of Noord-Holland received a significant larger nourishment volume than deemed necessary to reach the objective of the “Dynamic Preservation” policy. The autonomous volume changes over the period 1965 to 2010 are used to calculate yearly sedimentation and erosion rates per coastal cell. By adopting alongshore transport rates over the + 3 to – 8 m zone proposed by Van de Rest (2004) a sand budget model is made. The results indicates that for the most northern cells Van de Rest underestimates the alongshore transport gradients. By adopting the calculated transport rates from Stive and Eysink (1989), better results are obtained. Although the sand budget model holds some limitations, the results are quite acceptable.","coastal maintenance; nourishments; Jarkus; sediment budget; coastal morphologic data; Noord-Holland; near shore zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

We discuss the differences in small-world properties in the anatomical brain for typically developing children and children diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

(mentor); Zlatanova, S.Z. (mentor)","2011","Nowadays the field of geo-information is undergoing major changes, and the transition from 2D to 3D is having a major influence. A significant amount of 3D datasets are stored in the database. Experts are aware that new quality control mechanisms need to be built into the database systems in order to secure and guarantee high-performing data. Constraints are effective in providing solutions needed to avoid errors and enable maintenance of data quality. Whereas constraints for 2D geographic datasets have already been the subject of several research projects, studies into 3D geo-data constraints are largely unexplored. This thesis research discovers a new approach to model, conceptualise and implement 3D geo-constraints which can function in the database. At the outset, constraints can be formulated using natural language. As natural language is subjective and varies between individuals, expressions can be ambiguous and can easily cause confusion. So spatial constraints are abstracted using geometry that depicts the exact shape, and also topology that reveals the spatial relationship between geometries. This step makes the meaning of a constraint clearer to others. Furthermore, using standardised UML diagrams and OCL expressions, geo-constraints can be formalised to an extent that not only humans, but also machines can understand them. With model-driven architecture supported by various softwares, OCL expressions can be automatically converted to other models/executable codes (e.g. PL/SQL) just by a few clicks. And with small modifications, database triggers can be formulated to carry out constraints check. A database including various topographic objects (e.g. buildings, trees, roads, grass, water-bodies and terrains) is used as a study case to apply the discovered approach. During this research, a first attempt to formulate 3D geo-constraints in OCL has been made. These expressions can be tested and translated to other models/implementations when the OCL standard is extended with spatial types and operations. In the implementation stage, the current 3D functions in Oracle Spatial database are found to be insufficient. A new 3D function using existing 2D functions - plus additional code relating to computational geometry - has been developed by the author to bridge the gap. Based upon this function, a large group of spatial constraints which apply to objects in 3D space can be checked. Bentley Map and Python IDLE are used to test the performance of constraints as well as the visualisation of warning messages to clients. Database error messages are immediately displayed on the front-ends when a modification that does not satisfy a constraint is attempted to commit to the database. During the case study, new classes of constraints are also discovered. They are higher-level constraints, parameterised constraints, constraints allowing exceptional instances, extra-check rules to detect conflicting constraints and constraints relating to multi-scale representations.","3D spatial; constraints; database","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-15","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS-technology","","MSc Geomatics","",""

The increased plurality in communication standards, characterized by the use of different operating frequencies and data rates, has translated into very tough specifications for the broadcasting base station power amplifier, in terms of efficiency, bandwidth and linearity. For this reason, currently many high efficiency power amplifier concepts are investigated for their suitability to handle the upcoming generations of wireless communication standards. At this moment the Doherty power amplifier (DPA) is a popular concept, which gives good effciency in the power back-off, making it a suitable choice when dealing with signals that have a high peak-to-average power ratio. To be efficient in power back-off operation, the Doherty power amplifier is composed out of two linear amplifiers with an impedance inverter as an output power combiner. Due to its high complexity, the traditional Doherty amplifier is limited for its RF bandwidth. In view of this, the objective of this thesis is to design a linear wideband class-B power amplifier cell which allows incorporation in the DPA. For this purpose an LDMOS based push-pull topology together with baluns (implemented by bondwires) at the input and output of the transistors has been adapted. The described topology helps to achieve an orthogonal relation between the fundamental path and its second harmonic, resulting in wideband high efficiency operation. The resulting amplifier provides an output power of 60 W with a power added efficiency greater than 48% over a relative bandwidth of 40% centered around 1:8GHz.","power amplifier; class B J; Doherty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

(mentor); Dequan, Z. (mentor); Jianing, M. (mentor)","2011","For a long time, the development of urban infrastructures has been considered as a national responsibility, which means the urban infrastructures should be invested, constructed and operated by the public sectors. The urban subway infrastructures have the characteristics of large upfront investment, long cycle for return on investment, low profits and so on, which make the private sectors that they have no abilities to afford the investment and no desires to afford the investment for the infrastructures. However, many years after years, with the development of countries, public sectors are increasingly hard to afford the huge funds to construct and maintain infrastructures under monopolistic mode. Since from the eighties of the 20th century, western countries and some other countries had started to do some researches and practices to PPP financing model and accumulated many experiences. China, as a developing country with rapid economics development, is more urgent for a variety of large?scale infrastructures than other countries. It is a certain way to build more and more infrastructures with flexible and variable financing models. Over the past decade in China, the transformation of government functions and the increasing demands for subways, encouraged the opening of urban subway market, the diversification of investment and financing entities, the introduction of competition, and improvement of management efficiency. In the year of 2005, the PPP financing model reached a peak of its development in China. The Beijing Metro Line 4 is the first application case of PPP financing model in China, which tried to use PPP financing model in the design, construction and operation to ease the shortage of central government funds. But in the following years, there are only few cities tried to introduce PPP financing model to the subway projects, and most of the other cities were worried about PPP financing model itself, which has complex form of organizations and high cost in the early phases, with the co?effects from global economic crisis in the year of 2008, there seems a declining trend on the application of PPP financing model in China. However, it can be seen as another period to apply PPP financing model in China currently. The main objective is this thesis is how to achieve successful PPP subway project in China. In this thesis, the author starts from the theoretical explanation of PPP financing model applying in the urban subway infrastructures through analyzing the definition, classification, life cycle and actor analysis of PPP financing model and the characteristics of urban subway. And then, with these theories, the applicability of PPP financing model on urban subway in China is discussed in section 2.3. In the third chapter, the author chooses critical success factors as the point, collects and designs a questionnaire with 59 success factors based on comprehensive factors and seven life cycle phases, which are feasibility study and project approval phase, the private sectors chosen and establishment of PPP Project Company phase, design phase, tender phase, construction phase, operation and maintenance phase, and transfer phase, and all of these success factors are considered as critical ones by some famous academics. After two months sending and collection of the questionnaires, 41 valid questionnaires are finalized. The data from these responders are analyzed from the view of phases and totality in section 3.3. There are 18 critical success factors from the view of phases, which are The project conforms to national policies, urban development objectives, degrees of economic development, Governments' abilities on finance and leadership, Financing model is attractive to private sectors, Expected return on investment to private sectors, Good relationship between competitors and governments, Good management skills of the contractors, Innovation of design, PPP experiences of private sectors, Total investment of design, Special preferential policies provided by the governments, Good quality control, Good safety measures, Reasonable price, Stable operation environment, Support by the Central Government, Normative legislation and enforcement (Foreign Investment Law, Contract Law, Intellectual Property Law, Bidding Law, Tax Law), Good method to transfer technology, and Good degree of the current project. There are seven success components from the view of totality, which are Component 1 (Safety, high quality and the stability of operation environment in the operation and maintenance phase), Component 2 (Safety, high quality and standards on the construction in the construction phase), Component 3 (Abilities and credits of contractors, which will influence the results of tender), Component 4 (Ability of local government, the local government is a important public sector in the subway projects, which will influence the PPP projects much), Component 5 (Relationship between governments and the other departments or organizations, which sometimes will influence the negotiation results on preferential treatments between these organizations or departments and governments in the tender phase), Component 6 (Anticipated benefits got by the private sectors), and Component 7 (Support from the central government, which is the fundamental to carry out all the infrastructures in China). In the fourth chapter, the author takes Harbin Subway case as the example, and the objective is to design some specific policy recommendations for Harbin government to use PPP financing model in Harbin Subway Line 2 or 3. The history and future plan of Harbin Subway are discussed at the beginning to analyze the applicability and feasibility of PPP financing model on Harbin Subway. Then, from the view of Harbin government, the author analyzes the goal hierarchy and actors involved in Harbin Subway case. Associated with the critical success factors from the questionnaires, the author gives some specific policy recommendations in life cycle phases, especially in the private sectors chosen and establishment of PPP Project Company phase, which is the basic phase of successful PPP project.","Public Private Partnership; Critical Success Factors; Harbin Subway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","","",""

(mentor); Hindriks, K.V. (mentor)","2011","Multi-agent environment frameworks have been connected to Agent Programming Languages (APLs) before. These connections are created to combine the computational and graphical power offered by environment frameworks with the reasoning power of agents in APLs. However, only limited reasearch has been done to determine how the interface presented to the agents needs to be structured. This thesis aims to expand the knowledge in this area by providing guidelines for designing agent-facing interfaces. The thesis is motivated by the desire to connect GOAL (an APL) to a multi-agent environment framework. This allows us to make efficient use of the power of GOAL to represent knowledge, while at the same time useing the environment modeling capabilities of an existing environment framework. We compare three environment frameworks and find Repast most suitable for our purposes. We create the connection between GOAL and Repast using the Environment Interface Standard (EIS). EIS offers a language, called Interface Immediate Language (IIL), which allows two-way communication between the environment and the APL. Objects written in the IIL contain percepts and actions which agents use to do their work. To make implementing EIS more manageable we add our own extension, called EIS2Java. EIS2Java reduces the overhead of translating between Java and the IIL. The EIS2Java framework also enables programmers to quickly make changes to the agent interface, and ensures that the code is maintainable and portable to other projects. The connection between GOAL and Repast is used to create two simulation environments, in which we build and evaluate agent-facing interfaces. By evaluating the design and implementation of both environments, we construct the following three guidelines for building agent-facing interfaces. First, create the interface such that agents are able to spend their reasoning cycles on accomplishing important tasks that are best suited for the explicit knowledge representation of APLs. Second, introduce unique names for objects and agents, since APLs have no notion of pointers like most other programming languages. Finally, keep computationally expensive functionality in the environment, as APLs are usually less efficient at math-like computations than languages in which the environment is written. Finally, we also conclude that EIS2Java is a helpful framework and we aim for it to be included in the EIS distribution by default.","multi-agent systems; mas; goal; agents; EIS; EIS2Java","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Man-Machine Interaction Group","",""

(mentor); De Graaf, G. (mentor)","2011","As the world is in need of more sustainable energy sources, the use of new gases like hydrogen or bio-gases seems to be a very attractive one. By mixing these new gases with the traditional natural gas, it becomes possible to have a smooth and economically durable transition. The amount of new gases added may be dependent on the availability, progress of technology and safety and regulatory issues. This is very much like what is already been done with electrical energy sources like wind or solar power. However, unlike electricity, gas comes in a wide variety. Unfortunately appliances and machines currently running on gas are designed to operate only within a very strict window of gas compositions. To be able to widen this band, it is required to have machines that can adapt, depending on the available gas composition. It is therefore required to be able to measure this composition. This thesis describes the first steps in the design and development of an infrared absorption multi-gas micro-spectrometer for the measurement of the concentrations of Carbon Monooxide, Carbon Dioxide and Hydro Carbons in a composite gas. This includes mathematical modeling, design and fabrication. From the model it is found that it should be possible to design a system which is capable of detecting all these gases with sufficient accuracy and over their total dynamic range. Test structures have been designed and partly fabricated, giving great insight in the limitations, restrictions and tolerances of the fabrication process.","spectrometer; gas; infrared; NDIR; composition; sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory","",""

(mentor); Pel, A.J. (mentor); Chorus, C. (mentor); Van Noort, M. (mentor); Snelder, M. (mentor)","2011","Travel and traffic information play an important role in traveller behaviour and traffic flows. Travellers have the possibility to use information on current and future traffic situations to make their travel decisions. Travel decisions by individual travellers subsequently influence the performance of a total traffic system. This makes behaviour of travellers an interesting topic to policy makers and road operators. In this thesis travel choice behaviour also plays a central role and we specifically take into account car drivers and en-route route choice. This graduation assignment was done at TNO and after an initial scope further focus was applied resulting in the goal of modelling driver traffic information use and subsequent enroute choice. After coupling en-route route choice to DRIPs as the channel for travel time information in this study it was decided to model in the ITS Modeller. Latter provides a micro simulation environment through which driver behaviour can be analyzed at the individual driver level. First opportunities for improvement in modelled driver use of information during en-route route choice were identified. The following research questions were used to further explore and implement a driver information model. RQ1 How can the DRIP information market be characterized and how do market dynamics affect driver route choice behaviour? Through a concise exploration the DRIP information market and visit to the Verkeerscentrale Midden-Nederland we made some interesting findings. These findings originate from the fact that the DRIP information chain is a complex system involving many technical systems but also a multitude of stakeholders. Some examples resulting from DRIP information dynamics are used to illustrate effects on route choice behaviour. The first example is formed by occasional manual operation of DRIPs by traffic controllers. During this process it appears information provisioning to drivers is prone to delays. Secondly it became clear that the small number of responsible parties for maintenance of DRIP control systems posses a large amount of knowledge seemingly necessary to maintain DRIP information quality. Both examples carry a risk of information quality deteriation and as such a the risk of losing trust of drivers in DRIP information. RQ2 Given the lack of a driver information evaluation mechanism in the ITS Modeller: How can driver route choice behaviour be modelled and implemented? This report identifies an apparent opportunity for improving driver route choice modelling under influence of DRIP travel time information. A driver information model is proposed in which car drivers exhibit updating behaviour on their travel time estimations and uncertainty about these times. The model fits in the current method of modelling route choice in the ITS Modeller. Our driver model is based on uncertainty about a drivers’ own mean travel time estimation and travel times provided by a DRIP. High uncertainty about his own estimation leads a car driver to update his expected travel time closer to that predicted by a DRIP. If the opposite is true then a driver updates his expected travel time closer to his initial estimation. In other words: “Updated quality perceptions are a weighted average of prior beliefs and observed quality. Weights reflect perceived reliability of prior beliefs and observations, respectively: when the traveller distrusts (trusts) his own observations, updated perceptions of quality are relatively close to initially anticipated quality (observed quality)” (Chorus & Dellaert, Forthcoming) RQ3 What are the route choice effects of the proposed driver informing model? The simulation phase illustrates the difference in driver travel time updating for different levels of uncertainty while all other simulation factors are kept constant. The implemented driver model indeed leads to different updated route cost under influence of travel time information. In the particular scenario comparison overall network effects due to difference in route choice behaviour were minimal though because of the small absolute difference in updated route costs. Further face validity analysis indicates that this small change in route choice behaviour early in the peak period appears to have a positive effect on travel time dispersion. This conclusion is not supported by significance and as such is made with reservation. Based on this study we recommend the following for further research: Practical recommendations:  Inclusion of truck drivers in use of the driver information model and future research. In this study we assume the group of drivers only consist of car drivers. In practise this is not the case and this study indicated that truck drivers show different route choice behaviour in light of traffic information, specifically route and travel time information through a DRIP. The current study overestimates the effect of provided information.  The utility function in our study consists of travel time and travel time uncertainty. In practise more factors may be important in a drivers’ en-route route choice consideration. Further research should investigate which factors are important. Practical recommendations:  During implementation of the model it appeared that an implementation at individual driver level would lead to too high computation times. We consider some opportunities for better implementation to be feasible. TNO has the opportunity to use server based computation. Running the improved driver information model in such an environment might result in acceptable analysis times.An other option is further evolution of the way in which the driver information model is applied to drivers. An implementation could be conducted analogous to current implementation of for example lane changing and car following models.  We assume the lack of influence of a DRIP on network familiarity. In short route information of a DRIP does not lead to inclusion of a route in a drivers’ route set. Further improvement of the driver information model ought to take inclusion into account.  We saw that in certain situations DRIP information delays occur outside of control of the CDMS (Centraal DRIP Management Systeem). It is deemed beneficial if the source of this delay, manual operation, is taken into consideration and how this affects DRIP information delay. Gained insights could be used to have a future calibrated driver information model more robust.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Van Daalen, C. (mentor); Peeters, P. (mentor); Mayer, I.S. (mentor)","2011","The tourism sector of Norway is one of the sectors that aim for sustainability and is the subject of an ambitious project. With an estimated 5% of the total global CO2 emissions coming from tourism, this is a good sector to examine for improvements in sustainability. The tourism sector in combination with the government started the project Sustainable Destination Norway 2025. The project carried out by the Norwegian research group Vestlandsforsking, they involved Paul Peeters, associate Professor Sustainable Transport&Tourism of CSTT, for his expertise in sustainable tourism. The Norwegian government wants their tourism sector to be sustainable based on the following goals:  30% reduction of CO2 emissions in 2025 compared to 2005  1 million extra inbound tourists in 2025 compared to 2005  A higher contribution of tourism to the Gross Domestic Product The question that was addressed in this research is: In what way insight can be gained in the complex system of sustainable tourism in Norway, and how to communicate these insights to stakeholders in the tourism sector? In a joined facilitating role with Paul Peeters a mediated modelling session was conducted to obtain the input of the Norwegian research group Vestlandsforsking. During this session we created a few rough sketches of the subsystems in the tourism sector. The rough sketches produced in Norway have been used as a starting point and inspiration for the causal analysis. In this causal analysis more insight was created in the influential factors of the tourism system, and the way they affect each other. The main dilemma in the tourism system is the large contrast in the goals of sustainable destination Norway, getting in more inbound tourist almost directly increases the amount of CO2 emissions. Strong measures against CO2 emissions for instance in the form of taxes on air travels, almost immediately has a negative effect on the inbound tourists which also influences the tourism revenues. However, more tax on air travel could also lead to more domestic tourists so the effect on the revenues is more complicated to predict. To get more insight in these relations a computer simulation was made based on the causal analysis. There was a need for a way to quantitatively go in depth into the relations of the different factors of sustainability in the Norwegian tourism sector. In order to make good policy for the future, more insights need to be created in the behaviour of the system and ways to influence this. Building a System Dynamics model can provide these insights and help the tourism sector create policy to increase the sustainability of the sector. The model has been divided into six subparts: Tourism streams (inbound, outbound and domestic), Global / Norwegian economy, Transport modes (air, public transport and car), Local trips, CO2 emissions, Revenues. Statistical data for the model was produced by experts from Vestlandsforsking, gaps were filled by the expertise of Paul Peeters. The model was built based on System Dynamics and created in Powersim 8, modelling software that is based on System Dynamics flow diagrams. The program numerically solves the differential equations that are produced by the system of stock and flow equations. To build trust in the model several tests have been performed to test model structure and model behaviour, a sensitivity analysis, extreme value testing and historic data validation. The model showed weaknesses at extreme values, which is important to keep in mind when using the model. In the sensitivity analysis the model outcomes were not troublesome, all variables showed normal sensitivity some a little more than others but all within boundaries. Most questionable in the verification phase are the derivative constructions that were used to prevent illegal loops in the model, however they should not affect the outcome of the model. In the model use it became apparent that the tourism sector of Norway has a serious problem getting their CO2 emissions down with 30 percent by 2025. The baserun shows a large increase in CO2 emissions, and during the testing of the policy options it became clear that this situation is not easy to improve. Norway has to work together in all policy fields, combining their forces to tackle the increase of CO2 emissions and turn it into a reduction. To be able to let tourism experts use this model a graphical user interface was created which hides the complexity that is in the simulation model and gives them the opportunity to test the policy measures they desire and see the important outcomes. To be able to communicate the important lessons of the system dynamic model, a simulation game has been created based on the model. This way people who have never experienced computer modelling will still be able to use it. A second goal of the model is to facilitate discussion amongst stakeholders from the government and tourism sector. The game has been tested in a political arena in Norway, where the way the game facilitates discussion has been examined. The simulation game was received very positively by the users and the project team of Vestlandsforsking. In itself the game performed really well, both goals of the game have been accomplished. The game turned out to be a great facilitator for discussion in the first session and experts in the tourism field felt like they had learned many lessons from the game. Since it is hard to quantify the results of this first simulation gaming session in Norway, an experimental session at a tourism university in Germany was held with questionnaires for scientific measurement. The goal of the session was to show the added value of simulation gaming to the amount of learning. In three different workshops the students were introduced to the challenges of sustainable tourism in Norway: a classic brainstorming session, a System Dynamics modelling session and a simulation gaming session. To be able to identify which of the three workshops taught the participants the most, these questionnaires, testing knowledge before and after the workshops, have been analysed with SPSS. Even though the results of the experiments were not statistically significant, they did point towards an added value for simulation gaming in communicating the important aspects of a complex system. So the answer to the main research question “What is the best way to gain insight in the complex system of sustainable tourism in Norway, and how to communicate these insights to stakeholders in the tourism sector?” could indeed be the combination of System Dynamics modelling and simulation gaming. The recommendations that follow from this research are: Improvements of current research:  Get the list of missing data from Vestlandsforsking to be able to perform the historical data validation more accurately.  Performing the experiments with larger groups and an actual control group instead of three groups that test different sets of policy tools.  To really improve the understanding of complex systems for stakeholders it would be interesting to add the group model building part to the simulation gaming.  In this project the extreme values as well as the sensitivity of the model have been analysed. At 110% the model performed well, but with 200% the model gave problems with producing outcomes. It would be very useful to know where the problem of the model starts, somewhere between the 110% and the 200%. Possible development directions for the model:  Try to develop a more general version of the model to be able to play the game in several countries, the results from the conference in Balestrand were extremely positive.  A more regional version could also be used in Norway to get the discussion going in all regions of Norway.  Broaden the sustainability of the model, CO2 emissions as only performance indicator is soon not enough for the sustainability debate. Possible development directions for the game:  Give the departments a budget for their policy choices and assign prices to the policy options.  Different competing goals for the different departments, in the described sessions all departments worked towards reaching the emission goal.  The presentation of the game could be improved with for instance a board game like addition.  A single player version of the game could be developed with for instance different levels of complexity and the possibility to have different objectives of play. Further research:  Investigate the acceptance of the model in real situations, will stakeholders still be enthusiastic when the outcomes are negative for them?  What are the differences in learning between a single player mode of the simulation game and the multiplayer mode of the simulation game?","system dynamics; serious gaming; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2011","Electricity generation is reaching its maximum levels in most of the countries in Europe. For this reason, governments are pushing firms to enhance the security of supply and reduce the emission gases produced by their generation. To reach those policies, a decrease in the demand should be facilitated immediately. This means, the consumers should be made aware of their electricity consumption in order to reduce the current levels. By making the consumer have an active roll in the sector, new policies can be reached. To decrease their consumption an economically driven incentive is proposed in which the price is higher during peak hours and lower during non-peak hours. With this, consumers can decide whether to consume or not. The prices and consumption information is transmitted to the consumers and back to centrals by making use of communication’s infrastructure, which is known as Smart Metering Infrastructure. This document is focused on how European countries are implementing the smart metering infrastructure and what are the lessons learned from neighbor countries that are in similar situations asking themselves the same questions. Which are their successes and drawbacks? How is the implementation process? Who should pay for it? What is the benefit of the smart metering issue? Answers to these questions can be derived from the lessons learned from the European countries studied in this work: Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and France, and to have a broader worldwide view of the situation, the Californian and New Zealand cases are considered. The main lessons learned from the studied cases are the decision of choosing determined communication’s infrastructure according the requirements and possibilities of each country, adaptations on the meters that help to reduce installation times, reduction of costs derived from technical developments, and improvement of the distribution network by using the gathered information from meters. However, negative lessons are also considered such as the bandwidth used and the consumer’s behavior to the use of the new system.","Smart Metering Infrastructure; Comunications infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","EMIN / Policy Analysis","","EPA-EMIN","",""

The objective of the research was to explore the contribution of design to service concept development. The analysis focused on exploring the role of design for understanding customer value and considering it for the service offer. For fulfilling this aim, the project emphasised in analysing the methods coming from service design that were used through the case study. In particular, the analysed methods were performed during the first three stages of the design process (discover, define and develop). The case study was the ‘Kokkerelli and the Kids University for Cooking’ project, an initiative for educating children about food and healthy habits. During eight weeks academics, professionals and students in fields related to design and marketing, got together to design a virtual platform for children to learn online through an entertaining online offer. During the research, data was gathered mainly through participant observation in the project. Furthermore, the results from observation were also complemented with the perceptions of the team members collected through interviews and focus groups performed during and at the end of the project. These last two methods enriched the information and helped to get a better understanding of the relationships in practice between different disciplines for service development. The review of literature intended to cover different perspectives in the development of services. Responding to a limited amount of research in service design (due to the newness of the discipline), the review also considered literature from service innovation and service science. The relationships established between different academic perspectives through the literature review helped to create a theoretical structure that became a base for understanding the results of the practical study. The structure covered theories linked to the service concept and the notions of value co-creation and the perceptions of interaction value (the last two especially related to the Service Dominant Logic). The results present a contribution to understanding the relationships in practice between business and design disciplines for service development, covering not only analysis of the design process, but also different perspectives of the benefits and limitations of service design methods. More specifically, conclusions were made with regards to the contribution of service design in defining the service concept (i.e. defining value propositions, customer experiences and touchpoint integration), and the practical implications for the collaboration of service design in a multidisciplinary team for service development (i.e. for approaching user groups, facilitating iteration and idea generation and dealing with different processes of analysis and synthesis of data).","Service Design; Service Concept; Design Methods; Service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Practical production problems often involve large, highly complex reservoir models, with up to thousands of unknowns and many constraints. Moreover, our understanding of the reservoir is always highly uncertain, and this uncertainty can be reflected in the reservoir models. Consequentially, performance prediction and performance optimization, which are the ultimate goals of the entire modeling and simulation process, depend a lot on the data assimilation process and uncertainty from reservoir models themselves. In this thesis, the main goal is to discuss two ways of optimizing oil production and do research on the uncertainty of optimization according to data assimilation and reservoir models. Chapter 2 states an efficient method of data assimilation—Asynchronous Ensemble Kalman Fliter and its application in a square reservoir model. Chapter 4 and 5 discuss the two aspects of production optimization respectively: optimization of control of well settings and optimization of well placement. I use gradient-based method and implement it into simsim simulator, which is a simple simulator of reservoir model. In Chapter 5, I apply Particle Swarm Optimization method to optimize well placement given a fixed well settings. In Chapter 6, I do a research on the uncertainty of optimization results due to data assimilation and then study on the optimization process given a true permeability and porosity field. I found a stable performance of the optimization when applying field data estimated by data assimilation and demonstrate the effects of two types of optimization. Some disadvantage and future recommendations are presented in the last part.","petroleum reservoir model; ENKF; gradient-based optimization; particle swarm optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

Arctic is the new exploration frontier and it is expected to hold about 30% of the world's remaining undiscovered oil and gas reserves. Natural gas has become a preferred fuel, due to its low carbon emissions. To transport natural gas from the Arctic to its markets, liquefaction is the preferred state. The remoteness and distance from Artie are the main reason for this preference. The liquefied natural gas is then transported in shipping vessels which are affected by the extreme weather conditions found in Arctic; during the winter and spring: sea ice, icebergs, low temperatures, and complete darkness, and for the summer and fall: fog, waves and mammal migrations. The available window to perform logistics without hindrances is significantly reduced in this area. Experience on how to deal with Arctic and the effect the weather has over the LNG supply chain needs to be assessed. Therefore the objective of this study is to identify a robust supply chain concept for LNG under Arctic conditions by comparing suppiy chain concepts against pre-defined performance indicators. By means of using a simulation tool, the analysis of the LNG supply chain can be done. However a methodology to implement Arctic conditions will be developed during the course of this project as it hadn't been done before with this simulation tool.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-01","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""

Culture or (and) market development","Ye, P.","Schoormans, J. (mentor); Blijvenens, J. (mentor)","2011","This research looks into the evaluation of product aesthetics in different cultural contexts and it aims to disentangle the prominent influential factor on products’ aesthetic appraisal. The product meaning: modernity is used to evaluate the relationship between consumers’ perception of product appearance and the aesthetic appraisal. For the culture value: uncertainty avoidance (UA) and market position are introduced to examine the influence on product preferences. Different from other cross-cultural research that often uses socioeconomics as covariate of culture value, the use of market position in this research is argued more specific, especially for product evaluation research. Further, the market position is also argued has more prominent influence on product preferences than culture value. Two studies, a pretest and a main study, are executed. The key reason for conducting the pretest is to select product stimuli that with different level of perceived modernity for the main test. The stimuli are products of IKEA. The main study employs a 2x2x2 between-subject design with two levels of perceived modernity (low modern vs. high modern), two levels of UA (low vs. high), and two levels of market position (low vs. high). Both of the consumer’ market position and value of UA are assessed by measures. The first hand data of culture value and market position gives the research an advantage rather than adopting second data that used in some other cross-cultural research. Chinese and Dutch, who are considered distinctive in their culture value and market position, are invited to participate in this research. The samples (N=158, Chinese=74, Dutch=84) of the main study are local consumers of China and of the Netherlands. For the analysis, the method of linear regression is used to test the hypotheses. The outcome of the research suggests that for designing a preferred product appearance, companies can take the consumers’ market position of a cross-cultural market as a referent in addition to culture value. The knowledge of the influence of market position on the product evaluation provides companies an approach to look for the most appropriate for their products. Looking at market position, especially for retailing companies, can also make distribution strategies. And for designing a new product, the market position of the target group can provides an additional guideline for designers.","product meaning; modernity; aesthetic appraisal; culture; market development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","","",""

The wave of globalization has affected the whole aspects of this metropolis, especially its growth and development as well as its dominant ideas of city-planning, so that, many aspects of these effects are observable in the city. The Holy Shrine of the 8th Shiites’ Imam is located in the centre of the old radius nucleus of the city, with 16 million pilgrims per year. The city has witnessed rapid growth in the last two decades, mostly because of its religious attractions. Changing from a traditional walled city in beginning of 16th century to the second biggest city in Iran, (rural-urban migration process) transformation (modernization, technologisation, globalization) has left many spatial and social consequences inside the city.

(mentor); Schoormans, J.P.L. (mentor)","2011","Designers of audio logos are often troubled with the assessment of their work, both by themselves and by their clients. Audio logos are very short, typically less than five seconds, sonic expressions that brands use to ‘mark’ their communication toward other parties. Some of the criteria for a good audio logo are unclear and/or very difficult to assess. One of the most important criteria is the fit of an audio logo with the brand that it is made for. In this thesis an instrument (in the form of a questionnaire) is developed that is able to measure the brand-audio logo fit as it is perceived by the Dutch public. The questionnaire results in a five-dimensional brand-audio personality scale that provides decisionmakers in audio branding with valuable information about the quality of audio logos from their actual audience. However, the use of this test is not limited to the assessment of audio logos. It can also assist audio logo designers in the first phase of their design process with the identification of a brand’s personality and the setup of their design brief. Furthermore, the test can support audio branding academics who study the effects of (in)congruity between brands and audio logos. The present thesis also explores a few relationships between audio parameters in an audio logo and their effect on the perception of people. This exploration resulted in four guidelines that give audio logo producers directions during the creative part of their design process.","audio branding; audio logo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Wenzler, I. (mentor)","2011","Business process simulation (BPS) provides the possibility to simulate and evaluate the dynamic behavior of business processes, without directly influencing or changing the processes. The main problem is that developing a simulation model is considered to be difficult, time-consuming and expensive. For management consulting companies, BPS could be a useful addition to their current practices. As BPS requires advanced skills to develop a simulation model, a new approach is however required to enable business process simulation by management consultants. A user-centered design approach is applied to increase the likelihood that a designed solution is finally found useful and usable by the management consultants. The new designed approach for modeling and simulation of business processes, is based on Model-Driven Development (MDD) principles. Furthermore, we defined a conceptual modeling language based on the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and we adapted it to connect with the consultant's mental model. For each modeling element, a corresponding DEVS-simulation component is defined. To support the transformation from conceptual model to simulation model, a set of model-transformation rules is defined. And finally, several output statistics are specified, related to for instance resource utilization and processing times of entities in a business process. As a proof of concept, a prototype is developed based on the MDD4MS framework. It includes a visual model builder, a set of formally defined model-transformation rules, and the simulation components implemented in Java programming language. The Distributed Simulation Object Library (DSOL) was selected to provide the simulation and execution functionalities of the prototype. The prototype is finally used to model and simulate a sample-case, as well as a usability evaluation with management consultants. We conclude that the proposed design is a fruitful possibility to enable business process simulation by management consultants.","business process simulation; business process modeling; User-Centered Design; component based modeling; DEVS formalism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-30","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Farajzadeh, R. (mentor); Kleinknecht, A.H. (mentor)","2011","Following the industrial revolution started circa 1750, global energy consumption and, consequently, CO2 emissions have been rapidly increasing. The amount of CO2 rose from 280 ppm in 1750 to 388 ppm in 2010. This increasing amount of GHGs gases, specifically CO2, is the underlying cause of global warming. According to the IPCC report, with the current rate of emissions, the average global temperature would increase by between 1.9 to 5.4 oC by the end of the 21st century. There is a consensus that the current growth rate of energy consumption and CO2 emissions cannot endure in the future if the disastrous global warming is to be prevented. It has been predicted that global energy consumption will be doubled by the year 2050 if the present trend continues. Thus, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in order to take measures for reduction and stabilization of GHG gasses. The most important measure for mitigation of CO2 is implementation of sustainable energy generation, which requires major large-scale changes in our energy infrastructure. In other words, it is until recently that climate change and sustainable development started to become points of concern in the energy-oriented fields. These issues bring many controversies and discussions among politicians, scientist and the public. There is a myriad of different approaches on how to preempt the climate change and leap towards a more sustainable world. Carbon capture and storage technology is one of the alternatives which can be used as a measure to this end. However, CCS is considered as a medium-run “bridging” option for the reduction of CO2, given the still high cost of renewable energy in combination with deceptively sufficient amounts of fossil fuel. Moreover, CCS is one of the most controversial topics in the field of sustainable development with a rich vein of oppositions. The main objective of this research is to investigate the cost effectiveness and benefit of carbon capture and storage technology. Cost – benefit analysis is a tool which the author deploys to assess CCS. The case study of this research is the Netherlands. The calculations are based on the costs for CCS with a special focus on its technological improvements mainly derived from Dutch context. The main research question for this study is: What is the importance of CCS for the mitigation of the greenhouse gas, and consequently climate change from technical and economic point of view? In order to answer that question, the above is decomposed to the following sub-questions:  What is the current local (i.e. the Netherlands) and global state of Carbon Capture and Storage technology?  What is the current and future state of CCS in the Netherlands?  What are the costs of CCS per each stage and in total?  What is the benefit of carbon capture and storage?  Is implementation of CCS profitable? The Netherlands has substantial fossil fuels resources, mainly natural gas. Hence, the Netherlands and Norway, which is another important fossil fuel producer, have an inclination to play important roles in deployment and development of CCS in the Europe. There are many stakeholders in diverse fields which are involved in this technology in the Netherlands. Indeed, there are notable national and international projects such as CATO2 that are aimed to develop CCS technologically and economically. Moreover, the Netherlands has a good potential for implementation of CCS with regards to the transportation and storage. Due to the existence of gas network and several depleted hydrocarbon fields, mainly in northern areas, for CO2 storage in the Netherlands, there are good infrastructures for captured CO2. In this study, I lay emphasis on two major types of power plants: Existing PC power plants and New IGCC power plants; since they are more applicable for the Netherlands. In addition, using results of other studies, different ranges of costs (low, medium and maximum) for both cases are estimated. The challenging part of this study is choosing the benefit for the implementation of carbon capture and storage. Since this technology has not run on a large scale yet, it is not easy to talk about its economic benefits. After substantial investigations and discussions with experts, I concluded to consider social cost of carbon as a benefit of CCS. Afterwards, to enhance the precision of the analysis it was very important to choose proper figures for SCC so that a wider range of studies are covered. I selected four studies among several ones. With regards to four diverse SCC from different studies, with varying assumed discount rates, I perform the cost-benefit analysis for low, medium and high costs of CCS. This analysis leads to 12 sets of scenarios for existing and new power plants. In case of existing power plants, the results shows that with consideration of very low social cost of carbon, CCS implementation will not be beneficial at all even with the minimum cost of CCS. Conversely, according to high social cost of carbon, CCS implementation is notably beneficial even base on the maximum cost of CCS. The story is the same for new IGCC power plants but the benefits base on high social cost of carbon is significant. Moreover, except the analysis based on the lowest social cost of carbon, in most of the scenarios based on other three studies, implementation of carbon capture and storage system would be beneficial economically with regards to climate change. However, it is important to add that there are many studies on SCC base on different discount rates but I tried to choose maximum and minimum figures among the recent studies which are carried out from mid 90s forward. In addition, in this cost-benefit analysis I just considered social cost of carbon as a benefit of carbon capture and storage. Whereas, definitely, there are other benefits in implementation of CCS in terms of economic. This rings true that in the future by decreasing the cost of CCS due to technological development in line with recognition of other benefits of CCS, this technology would be more beneficial and feasible to implement as a measure for hindrance of diverse effect of climate change. Finally, in the future studies it will be needed to cover more elements than SCC in order to perform a more precise analysis. This needs substantial time, budget and a team of researchers. In addition, due to more or less unknown benefit of CCS, recent studies are vastly qualitative rather than quantitative. The lack of further quantitative studies is more palpable since their inherent objectiveness appeals more to policy makers and authorities.","Carbon Capture and Storage; Social Cost of Carbon; Economic Assessment; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Climate Change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Innovation","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The energy dissipation is lowered with a factor of 2.5 in comparison with the best performing commercially available voluntary closing prosthesis, which shows the higher efficiency of the proposed design as compared to the currently available prostheses. The force transmission ratio of the prototype is 0.5, representing the ratio between activation force and pinch force. This is comparable with the best available voluntary closing prosthesis. Whereas the new design has no protruding mechanical parts out of the frame compared to the other voluntary closing prostheses, reducing damage to the clothing considerably. Conform the benefits of this new prosthetic device, it is a better performing voluntary closing prosthesis than the commercially available ones.

(mentor); Boess, S.U. (mentor); Krikke, N. (mentor)","2011","Introduction: The nowadays economical developments in emerging countries, like Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) ask for a new approach in global practice for multinational companies. Currently most products for emerging countries are simple modifications or defeatured products based on products first designed for developed economies. Reverse innovation is a strategy where products are developed meeting the specific needs and budgets of customers in emerging countries. With a local approach in development and manufacturing innovative products can emerge with a possible spin off for developed countries, which gives the strategy its name: Reverse innovation. Project: This project has been exploring the possibilities for developing an affordable large format printing system by Océ, appropriate for emerging markets. By conducting a field research in India giving insights about printing practice, usage, context, environment, and technical and maintenance related aspects, a design proposal has been developed. This research was mainly focused on small and medium enterprises in the markets of print service providers (copy shops), architects, engineers and constructors. Research: The field research showed five key aspects that should be taken in to account for further product development: With India’s history in caste system and enormous population it has a service focused society, with services that offer solutions for people with every budget. Prepaid payment systems, pay per use and exact and transparent cost communications are elementary in this service practice. Although, with the printed volumes the total cost of ownership of Océ products is much more interesting than inkjet competitors, the initial cost price of the current product is too high and not affordable for offices in India. Offices and copy shops do have serious space constrains, especially in bigger cities. There is no space for media drawers and the printer is only accessible at the front and top side because of other equipment or office furniture. India has a very big and ambitious young population. The focus group of engineers and architects is well-educated, follows the latest technical developments and is an early adaptor of new technologies. They have studied or worked abroad and do know what they want. One of the most noticeable developments in India is the rapid growth in mobile communication, where wired infrastructure is largely skipped. Smart phones are becoming cheaper and will be the first access to Internet for a large population in India. Focus: The research showed that just defeaturing the product is not the solution. Buyers compare products on offered features and price, and all employees have to able to work with the product. They look for most value for money. A new product should be affordable, appropriate for the context and appreciated by the buyer and user. Strategy: In a strategy where product features are offered as pay per use services a more affordable initial cost price could be achieved without taking off features. By transferring the local image processing and data storage to cloud computing, and replacing the local interface by already used mobile devices, first steps in material cost price savings can be made. Business model: Using cloud computing offers a platform for new business models and automated services, for in time supply and maintenance and on distance support. It also offers possibilities for all kinds of cloud services that can be introduced over time, like accounting and document management. Conceptualization: In the design phase of this project the possibilities have been explored to make a smaller and more accessible multifunctional table top printer, with convenient handling, an affordable cost price, meeting the expectations of young professionals. Various workflow scenarios have been studied to improve document handling in an office environment for inexperienced users, with simple interface and cloud solutions. Proposal: The design proposal consists of three layers: printer engine, mobile interface and cloud services. The printer is a full functioning table top printer that anticipates to the space limited context in India. By making the printer smaller, using fabric parts, taking off the local interface and minimizing the local storage and processing the printer has a material cost price reduction of 30% compared to Océ’s current product. The mobile interface connects with the printer trough near field communication. The interface is context aware and adjusts the presented functionalities according to the placement of the mobile device: Mobile device on the printer for scanning, copying, fast print start and media change. Mobile device from the printer for making print jobs, managing scans and documents, accounting and task history. The proposed cloud functionalities can be categorized into six elements: Cloud information and cloud control to support the use of mobile devices and create a more efficient workflow. Cloud processing and cloud storage to compensate the defeatured engine and offer device independent document access. Cloud accounting and cloud monitoring are new services that offer users, Océ and other stakeholders up to date information to make their practice more efficient. Conclusion: This project showed that developing professional products for small and medium enterprises is more focussing on the emerging middle class with young ambitious professionals, than on button of the pyramid. Defeaturing products especially for these markets is not a strategy that will succeed in India. Using new technologies and smart innovations affordable solutions have to be achieved.","reverse innovation; emerging markets; emerging economies; India; printing; cloud computing; mobile devices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-30","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Shen, C. (mentor)","2011","Recently there has been an onset of fluidic filters fabricated using micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology. These filters, compared to conventional ones, are more accurate and precise due to the highly sophisticated techniques that are used to define and implement the separation mechanism. In order to contribute to this new field of research, a project on micro- and nanoparticle filtration was started in the MEMS group of Delft Institute of Microsystems and Nanoelectronics. This project had grown to produce two MEMS filter designs prior to the beginning of this graduation thesis. This thesis study seeks to identify and analyze reoccurring issues in the two MEMS filter designs and from those results, realize a new design that is superior in the aspects of performance, robustness and durability. The first MEMS filter design proves that it is possible to create vertical membrane filtration devices using MEMS technology and seal these with dry film photo-resist. However, the first design suffers from a high flow resistance that cannot be dealt with effectively, without relying on a more area efficient design. The second MEMS filter design is meant to outperform the first design in the aspect of flow resistance. The second design is a promising concept, but does not reach its full potential. Critical issues from a number of sources degrade and limit its performance to such a degree that it is close to dysfunctional. A redesign is necessary to fully exploit the advantageous aspects of the second design. A third MEMS filter design was developed based on the knowledge and experience gained from the preceding designs. This third design aims to incorporate the advantages of both the first and second designs while avoiding their disadvantages. Although the third design does address and solve the problems encountered in preceding designs, the development of this design resulted in new issues that are yet to be addressed. However, despite the addition of new issues, fully functional devices for fluidic experiments could still be fabricated. A series of fluidic experiments were performed to verify the functionality and performance of the fabricated designs. The basic filter function was hereby confirmed for all devices. Moreover, pressure and flow rate experiments were carried out to quantify the performance parameters of the filter devices. From these results, devices from the third design were found to have the best pressure and flow rate performance. A qualitative comparison was made between the three different filter designs. This comparison considers both the structural aspects of the designs and the data gained from the fluidic experiments. Based on the comparison, the conclusion is made that the problem initially defined for this thesis has been properly addresses by the third design. Although further optimization is still possible, the third design has proven to be the best amongst the three MEMS filter designs.","MEMS; silicon micromachining; particle separation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","ECTM","","MSc Micro-electronics","",""

To obtain a frame rate suitable for real-time applications, optimizations such as camera capture time reduction, algorithmic optimizations and utilizing SIMD unit of the Cortex-A8 processor known as NEON for data parallelism are performed. As experimentation, the optimized version of the algorithm is used to build a real-time application that recognizes gesture from images to control applications. The performance of the application is studied and a frame rate of 4 - 4.5 frames per second is achieved.","Gesture Recognition; iMX515","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Hage, J.L.T. (mentor)","2011","After fifteen years of service, blast furnace #7 at IJmuiden’s Tata Steel operation was blown down on the 31st of August in 2006 for a small repair. The blow down and salamander tap were successfully completed and afterwards the furnace was quenched with water. All remaining liquids are solidified followed by excavation of the remaining skull. Copper was added to the last ore dump to distinguish the liquids prior to the quench. Around 300 holes were drilled in the skull, used for explosives. The cores were gathered and used for analysis. Several cores have been analyzed with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry; these rough data were the base of this study. Carbon lamellas were observed in certain areas of the skull. Their formation appears during slowly cooling of flowing hot metal. These lamellas confirm that part of the skull was solid previous to the blow down of blast furnace #7. Radial variation of silicon is not detected. Results do show a distinct boundary, which separates material with different concentrations of copper. This is possibly a result of early solidification of the skull.

(mentor); Zlatanova, S. (mentor); Van Paassen, L. (mentor)","2011","The notion of terroir covers the interaction between the natural, the cultural conditions and the grape vine itself relative to the character of the final wine product. It is about a dynamic chain whose factors get different weights in each wine region and this results in the typicality of the different terroir wine products. The Old World wine regions have been for many years occupied with the terroir research in order to explain the uniqueness and the specificities of their wine products. Nowadays, more and more wine regions are interested in such kind of investigations in order to highlight their distinct products, expose their originality and get a place in the wine market. DOQ Priorat is located in South Catalonia in Spain and is a wine region that has recently been nominated a label of originality for its products. Such a denomination made the region’s cultivators interested to learn more about the natural conditions of the area in a try to explain the success of their products and with the prospect to preserve the quality of their wines. In these terms, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), providing the ability for spatial, statistical analysis and visualisation, have been considered important tools for the DOQ Priorat’s natural conditions’ analysis and diverse terroir investigation. Previous research has indicated topography, the soil properties and the climate of a region to define the natural conditions of a region and therefore being the factors of interest/effect in the wine terroir. These three factors can be described by specific attributes. For instance, elevation and ground inclination for topography, PH and texture for soil, temperature and precipitation for climate. The distribution of such attributes and many others that characterize the aforementioned natural conditions, has been studied in the DOQ Priorat territory in order to examine the resemblance of the DOQ Priorat vine growing conditions to the conditions that are considered beneficial from international research. The correspondence of the DOQ Priorat conditions to the standards for vine growing has been treated by means of a multivariate GIS analysis. The DOQ Priorat topographic and soil attributes have been evaluated relative to their suitability for vine growing and different suitability classes have been defined. Moreover, the growing season temperature distribution and its capability to define conditions of viability for specific grape varieties, has been used to define two major terroir units in DOQ Priorat. The suitability of the DOQ Priorat land for cultivation of specific varieties has been assessed through the topographic-soil composite suitability in relation to the teroir units defined. DOQ Priorat’s greatest extend has been classified in intermediate and intermediate to high vine growing suitability classes relative to its topography and soil conditions. The shallow and dry soils as well as the steep slopes visited in the area seem to contradict to what is considered beneficial for vine growing. In terms of climate however, the whole area presents ideal conditions for a wide variety of grape cultivations whereas most of these varieties proposed to fit the area are already cultivated today. Even though the current vineyard cultivations still present conditions of intermediate and intermediate-high suitability relative to what is considered beneficial from international vine growing research, the quality of the wines produced in DOQ Priorat is indisputable; there are therefore some unique features in the DOQ Priorat terroirs. The DOQ Priorat vines are cultivated in higher elevations and in soils shallower and less fine textured than what is considered to fit for vine growing internationally. That is what gives the DOQ Priorat wines their unique character and these are finally the conditions that are considered ideal for Priorat wines. Such a conclusion, leads to the confirmation of the dynamic nature of terroir, whose factors and attributes cannot be strictly defined and quantified for every wine region. New vine growing standards could be defined for several wine regions relative to their specificities whereas it is mostly the try, the result and the experience that define good and bad terroirs. The DOQ Priorat case has been a very nice example of a region going against the vine cultivation pattern whereas obtaining high quality and recognised wine products.","GIS; multivariate; suitability analysis; terroir; natural conditions; vineyards; wine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2011","The assignment was 'to develop a manual on how to use the value model approach in practice'. This project was carried out by means of semi-structured interviews with consultants of Philips Innovation Services, informal interactions and several design iterations that, combined, helped me to develop a value model guide. The final product is meant to suit the needs of the Philips consultants who offer consultancy in the area of collaborative cooperation. Designing a consultancy tool that could translate an abstract value model into a workable consulting tool is the most important element of this project. The guide can support consultants in balancing between improving value for the client and stimulating clients to take an ecosystem perspective. Most important requirements for such a guide are: that consultants must be supported in choosing the appropriate level of detail for value model visuals; that they are advised about choosing between different types of value model sessions; that value model visuals must distinguish between different phases in the development process; and that the negotiation process for developing a value model should be supported. The value model guide that this project offers meets these important requirements and assists the consultant in managing the complexities surrounding collaborative innovation. The type of value model visual (with a little or a lot of detail) depends on the timing in the product innovation process. The type of value model session - internal, external or reconnaissance - depends among others on the type of client. The different phases that should be visualized with separate value models constitute of the current market situation, the actors necessary for the exploration phase and the actors necessary for the exploitation phase. Lastly, the negotiation process is supported by a toolkit which includes tangible objects. Practical implications of this thesis are that the consultants of Philips Innovation Services will actually use (and re-use) the value model guide and toolbox. Furthermore, from initial evaluations we can conclude that the value model approach can indeed support collaborative innovation during internal value model sessions.","collaborative innovation; consultancy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

This has represented a boost not just for the mobile phones industry, but also for that of wireless infrastructure. Larger-scale production and increased competition have transformed the manufacturing costs into an important issue for the producers of basestation equipment. The current state-of-the-art front-end circuits for basestations have extremely high dynamic range, but are narrowband and predominantly implemented in GaAs. One way to minimize costs is to use wideband low-noise amplifiers and mixers that cover all the mobile standards. Another way is to implement the aforementioned circuits in less expensive processes, such as SiGe. And finally, significant cost reduction can also be achieved if some of the constituent blocks (such as low noise amplifiers and mixers) are integrated on the same chip. The two criteria that describe the dynamic range of a basestation receiver are the (output) 3rd order intercept point, (O)IP3, and the noise figure (NF). To achieve the demanding linearity specifications (OIP3 above 30dBm), special linearization techniques (such as out-of-band harmonic cancellation) are employed in the design of the first stage, a low noise amplifier. Since the linearity of the following stages is even more important for the overall OIP3, a current-commuting NMOS mixer followed by a trans-impedance amplifier has been selected on account of their excellent linearity. Our down-converter achieves an output 3rd order intercept point higher than 37dBm over a bandwidth from 0.7GHz-3.5GHz (performance unmatched by any of the front-ends available on the market), and has a gain of 18.5dB and a noise figure of 3dB at 2GHz.","Low-Noise Amplifier; Mixer; Wideband; High-Linearity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","RF Analog Design","",""

However, the manual manipulation may cause loss of concentration, loss of time and increased risk of infections. To improve the manipulation, a semi-automated lighting system commanded by the surgeon is suggested. The commands are given via a pointer device to indicate the desired location and orientation of the light beam. The pointer device is tracked in space with a low-cost infrared 6DOF real-time system based on Nintendo Wii-Remotes. In this study, the precision and accuracy of the tracking system was tested with static markers, dynamic markers and with the pointer device. Moreover, the wound reconstruction was evaluated. The results showed that the tracking system is sufficiently precise and repeatable. On the other hand, the position accuracy was lower than expectations, especially with the pointer device. It is concluded that the method of collecting relevant parameters with a pointer device using a low-cost tracking system is promising for the surgical lighting control application when a proper mapping of the system coordinates to the real world coordinates is achieved.","surgical lighting; tracking; infrared; stereo vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-08-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

In standing balance GVS is used to assess the contribution of the vestibular system, where it has been shown to elicit coherent responses in lower extremity muscles involved in maintaining balance. However, to date no information exists regarding the influence of GVS on neck muscles or head-neck stabilization. This study aims to test the hypothesis that GVS can be used as a technique to investigate the vestibular contribution to head and neck stabilization. Sinusoidal stimuli of 0.5 – 2 mA within the bandwidth of 0.4 – 5.2 Hz were used as GVS signals and applied to eleven healthy subjects using a bilateral bipolar configuration. Subjects were blindfolded and stimulated while seated on and restrained to a chair. Measurements of natural sway (without stimulation) were included as control trials. Displacements of head and torso were recorded using a motion capture system. System identification techniques were used to identify the relationship between the input (GVS) and the output (motion) of the head and neck. The results show significant coherence between GVS and the head-neck kinematics and modulation of these responses was observed across frequency and not amplitude, demonstrating the linear range of the vestibular feedback. Furthermore, the vestibular origin of the responses was demonstrated using non-vestibular stimulation tests. EMG measurements were used to characterize the relationship between the vestibular input and muscle activities in neck. Based on the findings of this study we propose that using GVS with system identification techniques provides a viable approach to quantify small motions (~ 0.1 mm) in neck and understand motion control of the head-neck.","galvanic vestibular stimulation; head stabilization; spatial perception; neck reflexes and system identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

The results of the first experiment can be used to verify a similar experiment that currently tries to measure the Brownian motion of the same MFM-tip, but then in a more complicated setup that couples the motion of the resonator to the state of a nitrogen vacancy center (NV-center, i.e. an example of a spin qubit). The measurements shown in this report are in very good agreement with the theoretical expected value of Brownian motion and can be made using either optical interferometry of through tapered fibers. The NV-experiment has not yet been conclusive, so that comparison has not yet been made. The second goal is interesting as it will be the first time that someone tries to measure the mechanical properties of mono-crystalline diamond resonators. It is expected that the monocrystallinity will lead to high quality factors. Besides, the resonators themselves can now contain spin qubits (NV’s ‘live’ inside diamond) allowing one to perform new types of experiments to couple a qubit to a resonator. This report will show two frequency spectra of such resonators measured through optical interferometry in a vacuum chamber. The resonant frequencies agree with the expected value from Euler-Bernoulli beam-theory. The precise shape of the resonances is not yet fully understood. It is non-Lorentzian and seems to consist of two slightly separated peaks. It is therefore not yet possible to give a conclusion on the possible high quality factors of such resonators.

It has numerous applications, such as view-point interpolation, 3DTV, object detection, etc. In the past decades, many algorithms have been proposed to improve the matching quality or to increase the speed. Due to the high computational complexity, it is still quite challenging to attain high matching-quality at real-time speed. In this thesis, we propose a hardware design of stereo matching, which is capable of producing high-quality disparity maps at real-time speed. A high-quality stereo matching algorithm is efficiently implemented and hardware-oriented optimized, attaining huge speedup by parallel computing. The whole algorithm is implemented in a single EP3SL150 FPGA. The experimental results show that our design is capable of matching high-definition videos at real-time speed, i.e. 60 frame per second at 1024×768 resolution. In terms of matching quality, our design is among the leading real-time methods, evaluated in the Middlebury stereo benchmark. As an application of the stereo matcher, we also build up a depth-scaling system for 3DTV, working together with a view synthesis module.

The current challenge in the field is to explore the methods of free-viewpoint interpolation for 3D TVs. Free-viewpoint interpolation enhances the user experience significantly by allowing the viewer to select and alter the desired viewpoint of the scene interactively. This thesis covers the development of the free-viewpoint rendering platform for the European iGLANCE project. The proposed FTV platform is powered by a 7-issue slot VLIW architecture combining scalar and vector data paths. Our processor is based on an image signal processor (ISP) template from Silicon Hive. We vectorized the free-viewpoint algorithm developed in the context of the iGLANCE project, and mapped it onto this processor. The performance of our implementation is compared to an out-of-the-box implementation and previous vectorization work using the same architecture template. In order to address irregular memory accesses, identified as the bottleneck by the previous work, we used scatter-gather unit and a customized memory transfer scheme. This allowed us to apply several classical vectorization methods to fully utilize data level parallelism. In addition, instruction level parallelism is improved by applying further optimizations (loop transformations, data mapping, extending ISA). As a result of all above, a speed-up of a factor 6x is achieved over the selected baseline, which is equivalent to 78x over the out-of-the box code, and the ILP is improved by 17% as compared to the previous work. We set up a demonstration system to validate the results in a real-time environment by mapping our design to an FPGA running at 50 MHz frequency. The achieved frame rate is 6.75 fps in a 1280x720 resolution. This result indicates that when our design is mapped to silicon, running at about 10x the FPGA frequency and with extended processor resources, we will be able to achieve performance levels required in current-day consumer applications, which is Full HD resolution at 30 fps per eye.","embedded systems; free viewpoint; rendering; 3D TV; multi-view video; irregular memory access","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

Mass customization, social networking, ecommerce and rapid manufacturing (a.k.a. 3D printing) were applied in a context of precious jewellery. Needs of jewellery designers and potential customers were studied through desk research, netnographies, interviews and observations. The concept was prototyped in two parts; a front-end website and codesign functionality in Google Wave. The prototype was used in three case studies. In each case a customer codesigned a unique jewellery piece together with a professional jewellery designer of her choice. The resulting CAD model can easily be 3D printed in wax and cast in a precious metal of choice. Case study analyses have shown customers enjoyed the codesign experience and were pleasantly surprised with their designs. Designers had no trouble in performing the codedign process online and helped identify opportunities for improvement. Financial scenarios were used to investigate the concept’s commercial potential. A marketing strategy was defined with a strong focus on social networking presence to drive growth through sharing of customer experiences and word-of-mouth.","mass customization; customer integration; rapid manufacturing; jewellery; codesign; ecommerce","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Ravesteijn, W. (mentor); De Jong, W.M. (mentor); Mi, J. (mentor)","2011","“The battle for sustainable development, for delivering a more environmentally stable and healthier world, is going to be largely won and lost in our cities.” Klaus Toepfer, Former Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programme said. ""Over the past 50 years, humans have changed natural ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period in human history,"" said Dr LEE Jong-wook, Director-General of the World Health Organization. Approximately 60% of the benefits that the global ecosystem provides to support life on Earth (such as fresh water, clean air and a relatively stable climate) are being degraded or used unsustainably. World Health Organization published a report[1] in 2005 to warn that harmful consequences of this degradation to human health are already being felt and could grow significantly worse over the next 50 years, particularly acute to poorer countries. Harbin, a large city with almost 10 million populations in the northeast of China, is suffering serious ecological problems such as wetland degradation and biological diversity reduction. Harbin Eco-corridor System (HES), one of the core ecosystems in urban area of Harbin, is a representative serious degradation urban ecosystem in Harbin. So Harbin government is searching for a sustainable way to develop Harbin Eco-corridor System. Harbin Eco-corridor System, as an urban river ecosystem, is located along Songhua River with 123km length and 4.5km width, and consisted with 15 islands. Wetland is one of the important resources in the ecosystem. The ecosystem is not isolated with Harbin, even plays a crucial role for the progress of Harbin. It not only keeps the biological diversity in ecological aspects, but also has the value to create economic income and can keep carbon emission under control. So Harbin Eco-corridor System is expected to be sustainable from ecological, social and economic aspects. Harbin Eco-corridor Restoration and Conservation Plan and Developing Wetland Tourism are proposed strategy from Harbin government for the sustainable development in the future 30 years. But is the strategy the right way to help Harbin government to realize the objective? Policy analysis from the perspective of complex ecological-economic-social system and multi-stakeholders are expected. This paper proposes a policy analysis approach to help Harbin government to test the proposed policy. Moreover, identify the most robust policy for government through comparing the proposed one with alternatives. Additionally, find weaknesses of robust policy and propose preventive actions. The approach is consisted with eight steps. First, we can get a general description about what’s happening and what’s the problem in Harbin Eco-corridor System and what is the plan of Harbin government to solve the problem. Second, based on the problem and the proposed solution, objective analysis is conducted. The main goal-achieving a sustainable Harbin Eco-corridor System is divided into three sub-objectives: more ecological effective, more economic effective and more social effective. In order to make the sub-objectives measurable, nine indicators with units and weights are selected in criteria analysis, they are the area of wetland, wetland water consumption cost, Total CO2-equilavent of wetland, the number of employee in HES, Investment return rate, Total amount of revenue and The number of annual visiting times. The expected target value of each indicator is designed based on some documents from government. Meanwhile, because for each stakeholder, it has its own weight for each indicator, stakeholder analysis is conducted to get an integrated weight for each indicator. Third, external factors analysis is conducted to identify flooding, social power and demography as external factors which cannot be controlled by government but can bring large impact to the system in times of change. Fourth, causal relations analysis is an essential step for simulation to construct the structure of the system. Most of the causal relations are referred from research outcomes of public academic papers. Fifth, the causal relations among factors are coded by data for the establishment of a model. After verification and validation, the model is built access to reality as nearly as possible. Sixth, proposed policy and alternatives are designed. Seventh, scenario is designed. Eighth, all the alternative policies are tested in different scenarios in the model and the most robust policy comes out. Through policy analysis, a sustainable development of Harbin Eco-corridor System can be achieved through: replenishing water for wetland and developing tourism, which is recommended by this dissertation. In detail, thought sensitivity analysis and policy test, replenishing water with 176900 tons per year is a sufficient condition for the wetland to recover wetland in Harbin Eco-corridor System. While, developing tourism has some alternatives-do not developing any industry, developing eco-agriculture or developing real estate. Through comparison, we found that developing tourism is a most robust way for government to get economic and social benefit from Harbin Eco-corridor System without at the cost of ecological loss. Recommended policy effect can be predicted: in ecological aspect, replenishing 176900 tons water per year for wetland can recover most part of island area into wetland as government expected in the next thirty years. In economic aspect, total amount of revenue in tourism will reach to 354billion Yuan, and total number of annual visiting times will reach to22.75million times per year in Harbin Eco-corridor in 2040. Average investment return rate is 43%. The predicted values of economic indicators are close to target. In social aspect, the tourism industry will bring 20633 employee positions in the system every year. Total CO2-equilavent value of wetland will reduce 31% of the value in the situation that wetland structure is maintained as the current proportion. However, there are two weaknesses of the developing tourism. First, tourism investors will face with some barriers: large initial investment and long investment return period. By analysis with increasing business tax rate from 5% in 2010 to 20% in 2040, tax credit solution is tested to be one of solutions. The total water consumption cost for replenishing wetland with 15 billion RMB will be covered by the total tax with 46 billion RMB before 2030, Even if the government always keeps fixed business tax rate at 5%, the gap will be covered at around 2035. Second, developing tourism also will bring lots of garbage, if without dealing with it in time, water quality in the system will be affected. One of the solutions-controlling the number of tourist is tested by model in this paper, 1km2 opened tourism area can maximum for 867 tourists per day would be a criterion for controlling the number of tourist. In conclusion, the approach proposed by this paper is to help government to get a deep understanding of Harbin Eco-corridor System, to achieve a general consistent policy in multi-actors environment, to test whether a policy is robust, to identify the barriers in proposed policy and to provide recommendation for the sustainable development of Harbin Eco-corridor System. However, it is difficult to make sure that the model is exactly the same as reality, the variance is mainly on model structure and data collection. Future researches are listed in chapter6.4. Meanwhile, there are some limitations for the approach to be used in China. First, Leader-oriented decision style will result in the ignorance of stakeholders’ perceptions. Second, promotion-oriented decision style probably leads to the absence of continuously fiscal budget for ecological recovery in the next political term. Third, the lack of post policy assessment and accountability system maybe produce policy strategy preferred by interest group, rather sustainable policy strategy. In order to avoid the barriers, some future researches are proposed in chapter6.3.","Policy Analysis; Sustainable Development; Ecosystem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi-Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A. (mentor); Pleij, M. (mentor)","2011","Deejays, video jockeys and light jockeys are responsible for creating a coherent show during a party where lights, visuals and music compliment each other. In small clubs and parties however there are usually no video jockeys and light jockeys present. Deejays play their records and a small computer, called a light controller, controls the lights. Because these light controllers aren’t user friendly, in practice nobody really controls the lights at small parties, while the creation of the right atmosphere with lights at the right moment can be of great value for the total experience for people in the audience. The resulting goal is to design a practical and user-friendly solution that enables the user to control lights in a direct and live way that enriches the experience for the audience. The first step in the research phase was to gather information from different stakeholders. In depth interviews were organized with a deejay, a light jockey, a club owner and a rental company owner followed by short interviews with partygoers and literature study to compliment and support the findings. The most important factors which play a role in the heuristic consumer experience of enjoying a party are the show and the interactions within the audience. The show can be broken down into; music, lights and the interactions between the deejay and the audience. Within the show music is the most important. Light appears to play a supporting role. A significant part of the audience is not aware of the light at party’s. Light jockeys mention however that they can lead the audience with lights and when lights aren’t supporting the music or atmosphere it has a negative effect on the audience. It is clear from the research findings that lights should compliment the music and party. Lights should enhance the atmosphere or mood (1) of the party and the music that’s being played. The timing (2) aspect should be related to the timing of the different elements of music such as the structure or instruments. The transition from break to climax in music is mentioned by all the interviewees. The audience indicates strongly that lights should compliment the music during this transition. Present solutions were studied and an inventory of the lights used at the target (parties) was made to get an understanding of the associated possibilities and limiting conditions. Further research (literature study) was done to analyze the effects of individual light characteristics on the perceived atmosphere such as associations with colors. This knowledge was combined in order to gain further understanding of the creation of specific atmospheres within the context of the target (parties). The findings suggested a radical change in the way light controllers should function. The light timings can be combined with the timing component of music through the use of frequency analysis (1). The user should have some atmosphere buttons which enable them to select colors associated with certain atmospheres (2). This way users could create a basic atmosphere in an easy, effective and fast manner. Also linking information that is sent from the deejay mixer to the light controller could be used to intensify music manipulation by the deejay with lights (3), benefiting interaction between the deejay and the audience. During the initial phase of the design the main ideas for how light controllers should function where clarified and evaluated with a usability test. For this usability test a software prototype was built in MAX/MSP. The results show that the three main ideas for functionality could be combined. Based upon this functionality a number of principles of use were generated. The most promising was chosen to be further developed and evaluated using a second prototype and usability test. The chosen principle of use was that users could control lights from the end goal perspective. This means controlling the lights from the perspective of creating the right atmosphere or mood. The user is given a set of eight different mood presets which could be selected via push-buttons. When a button is pressed associated colors are selected and a variety of light parameters (such as afterglow, threshold and the pattern changing time) are changed accordingly. These parameters were grouped under three different dimensions (attention, activity and warmth) and could be changed or tweaked with rotary knobs according to the exact preferred mood. The usability test was done at a party with 4 different deejays participating. Results concluded that the principle of use fits the user needs and therefore could be more detailed in the next iteration phase. In this phase extra functionalities were added to the design. This resulted in an interface including physical elements (rotary knobs) for controlling intensity, light effects and atmosphere dimensions as well as a touchscreen with four menu’s for the selection of presets(1), the selection of colors(2), changing the settings(3) and connecting the lights through a setup menu(4). This design was tested in a third usability test. This test was done at a small club that fits the target (parties).Three separate tests were done. One with users to find usability problems, another where two deejays performed with the build prototype to get feedback about the using experience and a test where people in the audience were asked to rate different light atmospheres on three different scales. The gathered data was analyzed and showed that the atmospheres were indeed rated differently. The users were very enthusiastic about the performance, functionality and possibility’s of the design and reported the user experience as intuitive. However users did encounter some usability problems. These where taken into account for the final design. In the final design a few extra functions were implemented. The main extra function was that the users can now control the light atmosphere with individual light parameters rather than three atmosphere dimensions. The new concept can be seen as a big improvement in contrast to the current solutions. And the main elements of this design can be applied to a wide range of different light controlling devices.","light; atmosphere; deejay; mood; music; DMX; design; interaction; usability; audience; lights; party; parties","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Albayrak, A. (mentor); De Laat, J.M. (mentor)","2011","Since the Dutch society has to deal with ageing of the population and the amount of healthcare requests is increasing more and more, medication safety at home gained high priority. The introduction of the medication roll, in which pills for one administration moment are packaged in a plastic pouch, already supported patients in their therapy compliance. However, some other disadvantages stick to the use of the medication roll that also threaten medication safety. Out of the literature and user research followed that the inconvenience of pouch opening, not remembering of the administration times and forgetting of the separate medication are the main weaknesses of the medication roll. Current medication roll dispensers do not offer a solution to all these problems. The basic dispensers do not offer more functionalities than storage, wile others take nearly all the responsibility of medication use out of the patient’s hands. It was the design goal to fill this gap with having back in mind that responsibility regarding medication use should only be taken off from patients when they are not able to manage it their selves, to keep their self-respect. At the start of the concept development two design challenges were formulated: supporting of convenient pouch distribution (opening and emptying of the pouches) and supporting of therapy compliance and awareness for all the medication. The final design consists of two product parts: the Medi-Manager and the Medi-Marker. The Medi-Manager contains a manual cutting principle and pill catcher that provides support in handling of the medication roll pouches. The dispenser can be extended with a display module that presents the administration scheme to the patient and that is wirelessly connected to the Medi-Marker. The Medi-Marker is a reminder alarm, based on a colored light and sound, that can be placed on one or more strategic places in the house. The alarm from the Medi-Marker can only be turned of by confirmation on the Medi-Manager. It is assumed that patients will be activated by this fact and that the chance of proper medication administration increases. This vision is summarized in the term RAISE: Reminding, Activating, Informing, Supporting and Evaluating. In this way the final product design is an integral solution, because it supports the administration itself (with distribution and emptying of the pouch), it indicates what should be administered (by presentation of the pharmacotherapy) and when this should be administered (reminder). Good collaboration with medication roll producers, pharmacists and homecare organizations is considered to be inevitable for proper implementation of this product-service system. Convincing inspection institutions and health insurances of the product’s benefits might also accelerate the product acceptation.","medication safety; therapy compliance; medication roll; product design; dispenser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Multiple prototypes were created, parallel to the research being done and evaluated by conducting qualitative user research. The main parameters that contribute to comfort are discovered and changed progressively in each stage of prototype development to find an optimum solution.This resulted in the design of the Illuminaid, a product that offers comfortable wrist support as well as blue light therapy to treat wrist related disorders. The ergonomic shape of the Illuminaid constrains unwanted deviation of the wrist and maintains it in a more neutral position. The overall design of the product creates a highly portable, compact and easy to use solution for frequent photo therapeutic treatment periods as and when the need arises, without obstructing normal activities.

For DSM reaching sustainability includes pursuing economic prosperity, environmental quality and social equity, this means creating value on the three dimensions of People, Planet and Profit simultaneously. Globally the consumption of energy is increasing considerably, and as a consequence, the emissions of “Greenhouse Gas” (GHG) are also rising in an exponential speed. The increase of energy consumption and GHG emission are the key elements for the “Global Warming” effect. Nowadays global warming is a worldwide challenge with serious consequences for our social and economic infrastructure as well as the natural environment and future generation, long terms actions plans will be needed, which will require reduction efforts and the cooperation of the entire society. This thesis report will provide DSM with new strategies and recommendations to raise its levels of sustainability by developing and implementing a sustainable office model, namely “The Green Office Ecological” model (GO-ECO). The implementation of the Green Office Ecological model by DSM Food Specialties (DFS) will focus only in office’s related activities; it will demonstrate DSM’s long term commitment to sustainable business practices by integrating these best practices throughout the entire organization.

To remain market leader, a company should invest in innovation to be one step ahead of the competition, in this case by implementing sustainability. Results: Field research, a life cycle assessment and creative sessions are conducted in order to reveal possibilities into three fields of interest where sustainability can be applied, (1) modularity, (2) production & (3) additional functions. After evaluation of the company, the customer and sustainable values a modular fencing system was developed that is composed of a fixed foundation, flexible main fence and a flexible add-on. The add-on further developed in this report describes an autonomous fine dust absorbing add-on. This add-on generates its own electricity by means of pv-panels, stores the energy in its batteries and uses it to make 30kVDC that creates a static electric field between the main fence and the high voltage wires. This field absorbs fine dust from the air, hence improving the air quality. Conclusions: The modular construction offers possibilities in a more sustainable life-cycle of the fence by applying fence-refurbishment and re-using the foundation. Second, a cost reduction of 9% for replacement projects is achieved. The fine dust absorbing add-on is recommended to place at industrial sites, coal-storage locations, harbours and highways, the main anthropogenic sources of fine dust emissions.

With the rise of social media, collective actions in the forms of social movements and campaigns regarding sustainable issues are attracting more attention and online participation. This results in ‘online slacktivism’, which refers to the phenomenon where a large population participate via the internet. However, it is not clear yet which factors in social media communication strategies contribute to ‘online slacktivism’, nor the impacts and implications of such phenomenon on relevant stakeholders and issues. To understand the extent to which social media communication factors contribute to the participation of online slacktivists in energy campaigns, this study is designed with a triangulation of qualitative and quantitative methodologies. In the qualitative case study, literature survey, semi-structured interviews, observations and cluster method are applied to investigate the social media communication strategies applied and to identify the social media communication factors. In the quantitative analysis, 55 energy campaigns are analyzed based on the conceptual framework established from the qualitative study. By operationalizing the concepts and applying factors analysis to reconstruct the conceptual framework, multiple regression analysis is conducted to investigate the relationships between the social media communication factors and the participation of ‘online slacktivist’ in energy campaigns. It is observed that there are differences in the conceptual frameworks in the qualitative case study and the quantitative analysis. It could be concluded from the multiple regression analysis that: i) factors with lower perceive ease of use, more effort to perform actions and behavior objectives which has higher relevance to real-world actions in the concept ‘action barrier’ has a negative effect on participation ii)factors with presence of interaction through discussion, presence of online community, the possibility to collaborate, and share in the concept ‘network opportunities’ contribute positively to participation iii) factors with rational arguments and presence of use suggestion/tips in the concept ‘content of the communication message’ contribute negatively to participation iv)factors with presence of visualization of group achievements, competition, individual and group achievements, and personal profile in the concept ‘comparison of social content’ contributes negatively to participation. For factors which are excluded in the regression analysis, future research need to be carried out to investigate the extent of their contributions to participation. The report ends with discussions on the research results, quality of the research, implications for relevant stakeholders and issues, and also gives recommendations for future study.","Social Media; Communication Factors; Energy Campaigns; Online Slacktivists; Participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Science Education and Communication","","Science Communication","",""

If the mass transfer would be solely based on diffusion, oil recovery would be unacceptably slow. The success of this method therefore depends on the degree of enhancement of the mass exchange rate between the solvent residing in the fracture and the oil residing in the matrix. A series of soak experiments have been conducted to investigate the mass transfer rate between the fracture and the matrix. In a soak experiment, a porous medium containing oil is immersed in an open space containing the solvent to simulate the matrix and the fracture respectively. We use a CT scanner to visualize the process. The experimental data are compared with a simulation model that takes diffusive and gravitational forces into account. We find that the initial stage of all experiments can be described by a diffusion-based model with an enhanced effective diffusion coefficient. In the second stage enhancement of the transfer rate occurs due to the natural convection of solvent in the fracture. The experiments are quantitatively modeled by numerical simulations. We find that transfer rates depend on the properties of the rock permeability, the viscosity and the density of solvent and oil. The gravity enhanced transfer is quantified by comparison of experimental and simulated results.","Civil Engineering and Geosciences; EOR; mass transfer; solvent; diffusion; CT scanner; x-ray tomography; miscible displacement; gravity4","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Wolters, M. (mentor); Verhaeghe, R.J. (mentor); Böcker, B.M. (mentor)","2011","Door verstedelijking staat de infrastructuur in de provincie Zuid-Holland onder druk. Woon-werkverkeer en goederentransport zorgen dagelijks voor congestie op de wegen in de Randstad, versterkt door de groeiende vraag naar verplaatsingsmogelijkheden. Waar het wegen- en spoornetwerk onvoldoende reservecapaciteit heeft, biedt het vaarwegennetwerk in de provincie Zuid-Holland ruimte om transport over water uit te breiden. De provincie Zuid-Holland heeft daarom als doel gesteld om het goederenvervoer over water te stimuleren. Vooralsnog ligt de focus op het technisch opwaarderen van de vaarwegen, echter biedt dat geen garantie voor een toename van goederenvervoer over de provinciale vaarwegen. Overslagfaciliteiten in het vaarwegennetwerk zijn nodig om het overslaan van goederen mogelijk te maken. De nadruk moet voornamelijk liggen op nieuwe overslagfaciliteiten voor containeroverslag. Door de wereldwijde trend in de “containerisatie” van producten en de aanleg van de Tweede Maasvlakte, zal het containervervoer van en naar Rotterdam de komende decennia groeien. Daarnaast zijn er interessante logistieke concepten en een pilot om bijvoorbeeld planten en groenten per binnenvaart te vervoeren over provinciale vaarwegen. Vooralsnog wordt 91 procent van het achterlandtransport van containers tussen Rotterdam en de Randstad vervoerd over de weg. Twintig kansrijke watergebonden bedrijventerreinen zijn getoetst met scorekaart VL op onder andere “potentiële containerstromen over water”, “interesse gemeente”, ”bereikbaarheid over weg” en “bereikbaarheid over water”. De robuustheid van de uitkomst van scorekaart VL is gecontroleerd met een gevoeligheidsanalyse. Zeven gemeentes, van de negen hoogst gewaardeerde watergebonden bedrijventerreinen uit scorekaart VL, zijn geïnterviewd of er op deze locaties daadwerkelijk initiatieven zijn en ruimte beschikbaar is om overslagfaciliteiten te realiseren. Op basis van gemeentelijk beleid en marktinitiatieven, is een momentopname weergegeven met initiatiefarme en –rijke watergebonden bedrijventerreinen. Mogelijkheden zijn er gevonden op watergebonden bedrijventerreinen in Delft, Gouda en Katwijk, waarvan de initiatieven in Gouda op dit moment het meest concreet zijn. Op deze concrete interesse is ingegaan door een inpassingsplan te maken voor een containerterminal in de regio Gouda. Uit gesprekken met diverse bedrijven in de regio Gouda is de potentiële overslag voor een containerterminal in de regio Gouda vastgesteld op 33.000 TEU overslag per jaar, waarvan 4000 TEU concreet. Het terrein van Gouderak BV (bedrijventerrein Middelblok Groot) is voor de realisatie van een containerterminal de meest geschikte locatie, ten opzichte van het terrein van Cyclus op bedrijventerrein Kromme Gouwe. De belangrijkste voorwaarde voor inpassing van een containerterminal op het terrein van Gouderak BV is te voldoen aan de geluidsnormen. Het inpassingsontwerp is gebaseerd op de ontwikkeling van zowel het terrein van Gouderak BV als het naburige terrein van bouwbedrijf Baas. Op het 1,4 hectare grootte terrein kan jaarlijks maximaal 28.000 TEU worden overgeslagen met een mobiele havenkraan en reachstacker. De bodem voor de laad- en loswal van de containerterminal dient beschermd te worden om de vorming van erosiekuilen door binnenvaartschepen tegen te gaan. Door het opstellen van een exploitatieberekening is onderzoek gedaan naar de haalbaarheid van de containerterminal. De nadruk ligt op de afweging of intermodaal vervoer tussen Gouda – Rotterdam kan concurreren met wegvoer tussen Gouda – Waalhaven en/of Gouda – Maasvlakte. Vanaf een jaarlijkse overslag van 20.000 TEU is intermodaal vervoer (binnenvaart met voor-/natransport) een goedkoper alternatief tussen Rotterdam – Maasvlakte. Tussen Rotterdam – Waalhaven is intermodaal vervoer alleen concurrerend bij een overslag vanaf 25.000 TEU met beperkt voor-/natransport.","goederenvervoer; binnenvaart; scorekaart; containerterminal; exploitatie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports & Waterways","",""

This research concentrated on triple-leaf membrane systems with filled cavities. From a state-of-the-art review can be concluded that triple-leaf membrane systems, when filled, perform better than double-leaf and single-leaf membrane structures. From literature research it was concluded as well that tension in the membrane has a negligible effect on the sound insulation and that, on the other hand the flow resistance both of the filling and of the membrane material has large influence. Three different kind of filling materials were used in the present study: (lightweight) glass wool, polyester wool and aerogel. Acoustical measurements were carried out in a laboratory, of which the outcomes were compared to a number of computer and mathematical models. The Multiple Layer Model appears to give good prediction for filled triple-layer membrane systems and this model therefore was used to optimise the important parameters. A well performing triple-layer membrane system was discussed, which met the restriction of 7kg/m2 for the surface density of the membrane package. This system includes one layer of aerogel for reasonable sound insulation at low frequencies, and one thicker layer of glass wool yielding good sound insulation at higher frequencies. This system is only investigated theoretically for nog and not empirically (yet). Details have been worked out for a number of practical membrane structure applications for this result (also applicable to variants using only glass wool), focussing on temporary (festival) tent structures.","sound insulation; membrane; triple-leaf membrane; aerogel; practical solutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Building Engineering","","Building Physics","",""

(mentor)","2011","Background: Haptic guidance is a continuous form of haptic feedback where the driver obtains information through small corrective forces on control inputs, such as the steering wheel. Haptic guidance for automotive steering has shown promising results such as improved primary task performance, reduced visual workload and reduced control activity. Despite these promising results, it remains unknown how much information on curve negotiation is provided by haptic guidance when combined with full visual or reduced visual information. Objective: The goal of this research is to gather empirical data to investigate the capability of haptic guidance to present essential steering control information for curve negotiation to drivers when essential visual information is removed. Method: Previous research identified a far and near visual point for providing drivers with essential visual control information. This research removed essential visual control information while haptic guidance was presented to the subjects. The visual information was removed by occluding all visuals above 7.5o down from the true horizon for the near visual condition and all visuals beneath 1.68 down from the true horizon for the far visual condition. This corresponds to 0.34 seconds and 1.53 seconds look-ahead time respectively when driving at 20 ms-1 . It was hypothesized that the designed haptic guidance would be able to compensate for this loss of visual information. Results: While using haptic guidance, driving performance and control activity show a significant performance increase for all visual conditions. For the experimental conditions tested, control effort only increases for full visual and slightly for the far visual condition. The summed absolute lateral position is increased to better than baseline performance for all visual conditions, however time to line crossing performance is not increased to better than baseline performance for the near visual condition. Conclusion: Based on the empirical data it can be concluded that haptic guidance is capable of providing drivers with essential control information, although driving performance does not match that of full visual feedback without haptic guidance. It also appears that drivers are more likely to accept haptic guidance if essential visual information is removed. Application: With this empirical data new mathematical and cognitive driver models can be developed that incorporate haptic feedback which can be useful in the future development of autonomous systems based on human driving behavior.","Haptic Guidance; curve negotiation; control information; visual occlusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Van der Meer, J.D. (mentor); Van Oeveren, R.J. (mentor)","2011","Buro Koos is an Amsterdam based strategic design consultancy firm, which helps companies in various industries with innovation on product, service and communication level. Buro Koos experienced firsthand that often small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are skeptical of hiring an external company for innovation advice. This project was in line with this observation, and strived to develop an innovation strategy tool for Buro Koos which is specifically targeted on SMEs. An extensive research has been performed were the character and working methods of Buro Koos, the needs and whishes of SMEs and best practices of competitor tools were analyzed. This research resulted in a set of opportunities which were used in the development of a new tool. A tool was developed and tested thoroughly in two test cases. Based on the results of the test cases the tool was optimized which resulted in the: the KIST (Koos Innovatie Strategy Traject). The KIST is a standardized tool which consists out of four phases (workshops). These four phases primarily derive from the COBRA model of Buro Koos, which is the theoretical backbone of the company. The four phases together ensure a holistic approach, which according to Buro Koos, is the best way to develop successful innovations on product, service and communication level. 1: Who are we and what makes us unique? In the first phase the aspects which make the clients business really unique are explored. What are their strengths? Why do they do the things they do? How do they make a difference? What value do they add to their customer’s life? 2: Who are our customers and what do they want? From knowledge that is already available, customer segments are constructed based on motivations, context and needs. These segments are then brought to life with personas. 3: Identifying opportunity domains In the third phase multiple opportunity domains are constructed, Opportunity domains are promising areas where the strengths and values of a company match the needs and whishes of their customer(s). 4: Exploring and refining opportunity domains All opportunity domains are prioritized in a roadmap and the first opportunity domain is further explored. A customer journey map is used to identify which touchpoints are under performing and how these can be improved (e.g. new product). The KIST is a tool specifically targeted on companies with limited financial resources. Because the KIST is a standardized tool time is saved preparing and facilitating the workshops. This has as a result the KIST can be sold for a relative low price which makes it financial accessible for especially SMEs. The KIST contains no research and is purely based on knowledge that is embedded in the client (and Buro Koos). The KIST makes explicit, what is implicitly already there, turns it around, structures it and hands it back to the company in easy to use posters, models and tools. The end result of the KIST can be summarized in the following five points:  Direction and inspiration for future innovation efforts  A holistic approach to develop products, services and communication  A consistent brand experience delivered through all touchpoints  Tools and processes for the clients to be more innovative themselves  Cohesion and consistency in teams, based on a shared vision","Innovation Strategy; Tool; SME","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Alternative forms for Maxwell equations have been developed and discretized in order to calculate backscattered mean powers from cloud particles. With simplified discretized equations the backscattered electric field has been approximated for a single particle. This approximation of the electric field is the same as Rayleigh approximation used in meteorological literature. The discretized equations have been implemented in computer code to calculate backscattered power from particles inside a small box, located in the far field of radar. In current radar approach, incoherent Rayleigh approximation is used as the standard scattering theory to retrieve cloud properties. To validate this theory the correlation between particles has been studied. In order to study the influence of inter-particle displacement on correlation between particles, a new idea has been deployed to create turbulence among particles. For different turbulence settings the randomness of the medium has been quantified by the real part of the correlation matrix. In the last chapter both exact and incoherent Rayleigh backscattered mean powers from particles have been calculated. It has been shown that Rayleigh backscattered mean powers are good approximation for uncorrelated particles and both are distributed normally around the same mean value. In case of correlated particles the exact backscattered mean powers have shown to be distributed lognormally. Depending on the degree of correlation their distribution shifts from lognormal to normal, respectively for highly correlated and uncorrelated particles. With statistical results it has been concluded that for correlated water cloud particles, the exact backscattered mean powers will be smaller than the incoherent approximation.","water clouds scattering; backscattered power correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Remote sensing of the Environment","",""

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor)","2011","Langkamp Technology is a small company founded in 2004. They sell products for medical instruments, agriculture and horticulture, coffee dispensing machines, railways, solar boilers and heating. They produce mainly low tech products and to improve their competitive position. They would like to introduce a high tech product. Therefore they want to introduce a new sensor system for the Dutch greenhouse industry. The sensor system can be used to measure relative humidity (RH), CO2 and temperature. The goal of the product is to make better climate regulation in greenhouses possible, which will increase the turnover and decrease the costs of greenhouse owners. In a greenhouse there can be spots where it is colder and the humidity level is higher than in the rest of the greenhouse. This can lead to fungus formation. Therefore it is useful when a greenhouse owner has a detailed overview of its greenhouse climate. This overview will also lead to more efficient energy consumption, higher yield and more equal crop quality. The product should first be introduced in one segment of the greenhouse industry and later in other segments. The tomato segment is the most innovative segment of the Dutch horticultural industry. Tomatoes are also grown with an open structure, which makes climate regulation easier for this crop than for crops that are grown with a closed structure. The tomato segment consists of 400 companies. When 10 sensors per hectare are used a greenhouse owner in the tomato segment can increase his yield with 4% and decrease his energy consumption with 10%. This means a possible increase of his income with 19.000 and a decrease of his costs of 11.000. After introduction in the tomato segment the product can be introduced in other segments. The pepper segment seems to be the most promising other segment in which the new sensor system can be introduced. The tomato segment is in a crisis and the operating results of most companies are negative. Greenhouse owners are looking for products that do not require high investments, but still have a high impact on their operating results. It is advised that Langkamp Technology sells the product to climate and process control companies and the end users of the new sensor system will be greenhouse owners. Both parties will only accept proven technologies. The new sensor system needs to be tested on basic functionalities and on how the sensors should be placed in a greenhouse. The most important reasons for greenhouse owners to buy a product are:  With the use of the product their income increases  The product improves crop quality  With the use of the product their costs are decreased The most important reasons for greenhouse owners to not buy a product are:  The price of the product is too high  The technological risk is too high The new sensor increases the income of a greenhouse owner, improves the quality of the crop and decreases the energy consumption of the greenhouse. It is estimated that the return on investment of the new sensor system is less than a year for greenhouse owners. The product has clear advantages compared to competing products, which will make it easier to convince customers to buy it. A similar kind of product was tested in the past, but this product became less accurate over time. Inaccurate lead to approximately 5% increase in energy consumption. The new sensor system is different from the other products that Langkamp Technology sells. Therefore Langkamp Technology should use a different approach to relation marketing. It is a good idea to cooperate with climate and control companies and together develop more products in the industry of sensors for climate regulation inside a greenhouse which deliver detailed knowledge about the crop condition and the climate conditions between the plants in a greenhouse. They should provide greenhouse owners with good after sales service and try to get user feedback. This feedback can be used to improve the products functionality. To stay ahead from their competition after the product is introduced Langkamp Technology can develop software updates and provide the users with tips on how to use the product. The product should be tested at an opinion leader in the industry. This will increase the adoption rate of the new sensor system. Word-of-mouth is very important in the greenhouse industry and the early adopters are the opinion leaders. When the product is accepted by the opinion leaders the product adoption rate will strongly increase. Therefore it is wise to offer trials of the product to opinion leaders. Next to word-of-mouth Langkamp can try to convince magazines to write about the product. Specific literature is an important communication channel in the greenhouse industry and fairs are as well. The product should be demonstrated at fairs for the greenhouse industry. Advertisement can be minimized when there is enough word-of mouth.","new sensor system; greenhouse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Terwel, K.C. (mentor)","2011","Most buildings constructed in the Netherlands are constructed with steel and/or reinforced concrete as the main load-bearing material. The use of concrete in high-rise buildings has the advantage of being able to build rather stiff and fire proofing structures thanks to the large applied amount of concrete. Structural stiffness is important in high-rise structures since the maximum lateral displacement at the top has to be limited to meet the required comfort level in a building. An often-used type of structure is the framed tube structure. Several studies have pointed out that the tubular structure is able to achieve great heights. It highly improves the building’s stiffness, resulting in less lateral displacements. In the last decades, higher buildings are being built in seeking the ultimate height limit of a structure. While buildings were being built higher and higher, the quest for higher quality materials continued as well. Until now, many new types of concrete have been developed, which have better properties than its predecessors. This thesis applies two new types of concrete in a framed tube structure, namely High Strength Concrete (HSC) and Ultra High Strength Concrete (UHSC). It appears that higher strength concretes can be applied in the structure. Its behaviour changes since the higher strength concretes have a different modulus of elasticity. The structures are proven to give better performance: the lateral displacements reduce and higher structures can be built while still fulfilling the requirement to maximum deflection. Obviously, the higher strength concretes come with a higher price. Consequently, the structure becomes more expensive. However, thanks to the better material properties, the building can be built higher. To acquire knowledge in whether the higher building is feasible, the costs per floor are calculated. A higher building contains more commercially available area and the analysis shows that the costs per unit floor area decrease by 14% if HSC is applied. Despite the fact that the building with an UHSC structure contains more commercially available area, it is not beneficial due to the high price of the UHSC mixture: the costs increase up to 25%. The Very High Strength Concrete (VHSC) mixture is not studied in this thesis, but is expected to provide costs and structural performance that lay in between the HSC and UHSC performance. Several changes to the structure are recommended to optimise the structure’s costs-performance ratio. The most important recommendation is to utilise the material properties of the higher strength concretes as much as possible. This is achieved by applying a hybrid structure: combining higher strength concrete with ordinary concrete in one structure. HSC is applied in only the lower eight floors, while in the remaining 22 floors of the structure OC is applied. The thesis shows that the application of higher strength concretes in framed-tubular structures is possible. It provides better performing structures and, in some cases, a reduction in costs. While the HSC models proved to provide a good performance to costs ratio, the UHSC models currently do not.","Higher Strength Concretes Tubular Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Building Engineering","","Structural Design","",""

Crowdsourcing (Howe, 2008) and open innovation (Chesbrough, 2003) are two specific types of collective intelligence. Collective intelligence is in general addressed to the outcome of a group of individuals who do things collectively in the way that it seems intelligent (Malone, et al., 2009). In other words, collective intelligence involves groups of individuals collaborating to create synergy, something greater than each individual part (Castelluccio, 2006). This project started on November 15, 2010, with the objective of providing solutions for the problem statement that was provided by Philips High Impact Innovation Center: “University students are a potentially very rich source of innovation ideas, as shown by several Philips projects and external bench¬marks. Current use of this resource is ad hoc and limited in topic and geographical scope. When it is done, most often there is no concrete follow- up within Philips. It is unclear, at what stages of in¬novation processes, and how to ensure the most value is extracted for Philips”. In order to gain better understanding of the key factors, which shape the structure of the problem, literature research was conducted (chapter 2) on: (1) Network-centric Open innovation, (2) Crowdsourcing and on-line community construction, (3) Product and brand strategy, and (4) Motivation and group collaboration. In the next phase (chapter 3: Analysis), we analyzed the market by identifying and studying the leading enterprises of the innovation market. In order to explore the market trends, we followed some influential blogs and discussion forums on a daily basis. Market analysis highlighted a very basic and fundamental fact: student crowdsourcing is an on-line effort that highly relies on the “social media policy” of a firm. We realized that in order to gain competitive advantage, it is essential to define the competition set, paying distinctive attention to the on-line trait of student crowdsourcing. In the analysis phase we also studied the advances and trends in social media technology. Policies on leveraging social media and the trends in this domain were also extracted from annual market predictions of leading enterprises. The next step was dedicated to understanding of the needs, characteristics and capabilities of students. The role of students and the type of incentives that motivate them to participate in challenges such as idea competitions was also identified. By converging the results of the research phase (chapter 4) and clustering the challenges of open-innovation and crowdsourcing, we developed a decision-making model. In developing the crowdsourcing method for Philips, we tried to provide answers for all the criteria that are included in this model. On the other hand, we realized that conducting a research on models of collaboration is essential in our project. We decided to undertake a research to understand which model of collaboration generates better outcome for Philips (chapter 7). Quantity of ideas was generated in the conceptualization phase (chapter 5) by conducting a three-days on-line brainstorming. We clustered the ideas based on the solutions they provide for each crowdsourcing challenge (addressed in the decision-making model). After grouping the ideas, we developed two main concepts. Based on the evaluation factors and the objectives of the project, the final concept was selected and detailed. The ideation phase lead to development of “Philips Parrot”, which aimed to undertake an interdisciplinary, international and collaborative crowdsourcing (chapter 6). In our research on collaboration patterns (chapter 7), we defined idea sharing as the collaboration task that students would undertake in our crowdsourcing method. Then, we developed two patterns of collaboration. The objective of our research was to realize which of these patterns, produces ideas that meet Philips TV Business Group needs and interests. The TV B.G. experts set criteria for evaluation and scoring of the ideas. In order to take a concrete step toward our concept method, and by request of Philips TV Business Group, we executed a pilot test of our concept (chapter 8). We organized the pilot test, considering the patterns of idea sharing in our research. To execute the pilot test an idea contest was planed. Philips TV Business Group formulated two separate challenges for Information Technology and Industrial Design students. 105 students from 14 universities across Europe, Iran and India participated in the contest. Philips Parrot idea contest was held on May 23 to May 29, 2011 and 40 final concepts were submitted. The results of the pilot test confirm that locating the crowdsourcing open platform on social networking websites increases the collaboration and engagement of students. We came to this conclusion by comparing the results of the generic idea competition that was held in parallel to our pilot test with the outcome of the two collaboration models. The results demonstrated that collaboration on group idea sharing pattern leads to higher quality concepts for Philips than idea sharing at individual level and the generic competition models.","Crowdsourcing; Collaboration; open-innovation; social media; idea competition; students","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

In this concept, the total of urban flows (like building materials, food and waste) together with the processes which transform those flows are metaphorically viewed as the metabolism of a city. The thesis starts with a search for a clear description of the concept. Existing literature is analysed and ordered in which two main conceptions of the concept are distinguished: Urban Metabolism according to a biological point of view versus an ecological point of view. The second part of the thesis deals with the value of Urban Metabolism for reaching sustainable urban development. Urban Metabolism relates mainly to flows of materials and energy. A roadmap is developed how to apply the concept for reaching a sustainable exchange of materials and energy between the urban system and the environment. It appears that Urban Metabolism provides a framework within one can systematically search for such a sustainable exchange. However, to be more useful it is necessary that Urban Metabolism research shifts from describing the urban system to applications which aim to understand and control the metabolic processes and flows. In the last part of the thesis special attention is paid to the value of Urban Metabolism in reaching sustainable development through optimizing the spatial structure of a city. There is a clear connection between the urban metabolism and the spatial structure: some of the largest urban flows (building energy, building materials, transportation energy) are influenced by the urban structure. However, at this moment the possibilities to integrate spatial components into the concept of Urban Metabolism are limited.","Urban Metabolism; sustainable urban development; material and energy flows; spatial structure","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","In the development of wireless sensor networks, power consumption is one of the bottlenecks for wide applications. In order to improve the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks, a wakeup radio scheme is presented. The main transceiver that is responsible for data communication is in the sleep mode most of the time. An additional device called the wakeup radio receiver is a simplified receiver with much lower power consumption and data rate than the main transceiver. It is always on to monitor the channels continuously. It detects the wakeup packet, and sends the main transceiver a wakeup trigger upon successful detection of a wakeup packet. However, the detection of a wakeup packet is a challenging task. Since the wakeup radio receiver operates in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical band, a wakeup packet can be greatly interfered in such a noisy channel, which may lead to detection performance degradation. Therefore, a multi-carrier wakeup radio receiver is proposed as a solution to interference mitigation by making use of frequency diversity. But in practical implementations, the impairments from the multi-carrier wakeup receiver itself cannot be neglected. The receiver detection performance may degrade due to the non-idealities at the receiver. In this thesis, the detection performance of the multi-carrier wakeup radio receiver in the presence of channel noise, fading, co-channel interference, as well as non-idealities is explored.","wireless sensor network; wakeup radio receiver; detection performance; non-idealities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Telecommunications","",""

(mentor); Jansen, A. (mentor)","2011","Sailing yachts have a long history in the Netherlands. Since WOII the economic prosperity growth, the amount of sailing yachts increased a lot and became larger and larger. During this decades, lots of developments were made in building methods, materials and outside design to new demands of sailors who demands more and more space and luxury. Also in interior design, some progress is made but it seems that this part is less developed than other aspects of sailing yachts. The industry focuses on the life-style-sailor: a sailor with passion for its hobby and wants to create a second home from his boat. This project includes a research to possible new demands of users and changing habits of sailors, done with interviews, questionnaires, a observational research and literature study. In this analyse a method called Vision of Product design was used. This methods pays attention to the current product, the interaction between the user and his product and the context wherein it all takes place. Next to this, a new context is created with a new interaction between user and product, leading to a new product. After the analysis of the current situation, a new context an interaction is created in this project. Findings here are that next to the traditional sailor, a so called ‘part-time’ sailor exist. A sailor with sailing as a hobby and not a way of life with different sailing habits, less involvement in his boat and therefore other demands of his interior. He does not want to make a second home form his boat but uses his boat to be away from home. He has a busy life and uses his boat to take friends with him. With this information a design statement with requirements is made for this type of user as an end result of the ViP method: We want people to enjoy their free time on board of their sailing yachts with others, turning their boat in a social meeting tool. Use the interior to have away-from-home feeling in a free way, suited to the users demand in a particular situation. Being on board must feels like a holiday rather than being at home. This statement is used in the design phase: different layouts and several idea’s are made leading to three diverse concepts. Every concept has its own layout and focus with a suitable feeling, developed by making a collage for each concepts: Concept 1: Adventure together with focus on the adventurous part of sailing and bringing along friends to join you when sailing Concept 2: Relaxation on the way, focussing on enjoying free time in a relax way instead of an active one and makes use of the relaxing aspects of sailing. Concept 3: Dynamic Space focuses on extra space and therefore ability to take along friends with the help of flexible solutions. Having the right space when needed. After the concept choice, together with Simonis Voogd Design, the first concept is taken for further development with focus on the social interaction between users with an adventurous touch: a social adventure. Next to the development, the design is evaluated in both the end result and the process with a small but positive examination on the ViP-results. Also a number of recommendations are given, especially on the market-side of a possible sequel project because the marketing and sales aspects are not within the scope of this project.","sailingboat; interior; yacht; ViP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","A screening study and subsequent dynamic simulation of selected Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods for the Rijn oil field are presented. The objective of the study was to obtain insight in the EOR potential of the Rijn field. The Rijn oil field, located in block P15 in the Dutch sector of the North Sea Continental Shelf, produced 24MMSTB oil cumulative (RF= 12-18%) by water flooding and gas lift from 1986 until 1998 and was re-developed in 2010, using electrical submersible pumps (ESP’s), expecting another 3.5MMSTB (expected RF= 21%). In general an EOR method has to address certain reservoir characteristics such as heterogeneity, remaining oil saturation and residual oil saturation. For the Rijn oil field the presence of a thief zone, extensive water cycling, the offshore location and a relatively short remaining field life were also important factors taken into account when making a selection. From the screening study polymer flooding, surfactant flooding and in-depth conformance control (by BrightWater) were selected for investigation by numerical simulations. Other techniques such as solvent, microbial and thermally enhanced recovery methods were discarded based on the field characteristics. Numerical modelling was done on a detailed sector model of the Rijn field with a refined grid, instead of using a conceptual simulation model. This was done to incorporate realistic reservoir and geological conditions. Polymer flooding showed disappointing production responses mainly caused by injectivity issues due to increased viscosity of the injected fluid. In-depth conformance control using BrightWater did not increase recovery because the poor reservoir quality in the modelled reservoir sector. A simulation run, where the high permeable thief zone was blocked, displayed a decrease in water cut but also a decrease in oil production. It is expected that better results could be obtained when the method is applied to better quality parts of the reservoir. The EOR method with the best response was surfactant flooding. Adding surfactant to the injection water showed 12% increase in oil recovery. The results presented form a basis for further investigation of surfactant systems for applications in the Rijn oil field.","EOR; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Rijn oil field; TAQA energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

They address electricity consuming behav- ior of young professionals and the role that consumer electronics (CE) play in it. This project focuses on the design of eco- feedback technology, a technology based on providing feedback about an individu- al’s or group’s energy consuming actions with the goal of reducing their environ- mental impact. A user-centered approach was taken to investigate the target group in the context of their homes, observing their household routines, their lifestyle, and their stance on electricity consumption. Two main problems emerged from the data. First, the level of complexity of exist- ing feedback information exceeds the level of understanding from most users. And second, most exisitng eco-feedback inter- faces fail to meet the interaction standards that young professionals have gotten used to because of their smartphones and tab- let PC’s. These are smooth touchscreen interfaces that are often beautiful, engag- ing and pleasurable to use. A set of design criteria for eco-feedback was constructed focussing on making elec- tricity consumption more graspable, and engaging users with an interesting, intui- tive and pleasurable interface. These criteria were translated to the design of a Home Energy Widget (HEW), an Android application for Samsung’s Galaxy Tab. The HEW was tested with the target group using an interactive (Flash) prototype. The results show that the HEW scored higher on both pragmatic and hedo- nic qualities than a comparable existing interface. The feedback on the design of the HEW showed the validity of the design criteria. Samsung can now use and develop these criteria in their future designs of eco-feedback technology.","home energy management system; energy widget","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Sustainability","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Mulder, W. (mentor)","2011","The numerical modeling with the diffusive controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) method has been used to validate the published results of Ellis et al. (2010a) by first investigating the validity of effective medium theory for both horizontally layered isotropic and vertically transverse isotropic (VTI) layered earth. Ellis et al. (2010a) used ’moving window average method’ to calculate bulk vertical and horizontal resistivities of resistivity logs, from which they calculated effective anisotropic ratio. The question is if the application of their local averaging scheme is valid also for a layered earth. The investigation of effective medium theory is done in horizontal wavenumber-frequency domain (k??) which allows us to evaluate the influence of propagation and attenuation parts of the complex vertical wavenumber on the existence and stability of the effective solution for the whole range of wavenumber, k. For the layered models considered, the total thickness is held constant while the number of layers is varied with consequent changes in thickness of the individual layer. Also, reflection and transmission interactions are both ignored and included. For the horizontally layered isotropic earth, with only propagation-diffusion term, a stable effective transverse electric (TE-mode) isotropic conductivity exists from 0.5% of maximum wavenumber irrespective of the unit thickness of a layer. But with the inclusion of reflection and transmission interactions, the effective skin depth or wavelength has to be sufficiently large compared with unit thickness of the layered earth for a stable solution to exist at all values of wavenumber, k. It is noted that effective transverse magnetic (TM-mode) isotropic conductivity is not the same as that of TE-mode for large wavenumber, k, because of the different limits of their reflection coefficients at large k. However, there are no effective vertically transverse isotropic (VTI) parameters which satisfy the horizontally layered isotropic or VTI layered earth because the effective VTI parameters are wavenumber, k-dependent, though with approximately constant effective anisotropic ratio. We conclude that the effective medium theory adopted by Ellis et al. (2010a) is not a valid approach for modeling a layered earth, though it may be valid for a local measurement.","CSEM; VTI; Effective","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section of Applied Geophysics and Petrophysics","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Seismic interferometry is a technique by which the Green’s function (or impulse response) between two receivers can be acquired from the crosscorrelations of wavefield responses at these receivers. Recent developments of this method has led researchers to exploit active as well as passive seismic wavefields to retrieve surface wave Green’s functions by crosscorrelation. The primary objective of these applications has been to gain near surface resolution from the high frequency content of the active data while gaining greater depth resolution from the low frequency content of the passive data. In these applications however, a Green’s function is retrieved for each data type and therefore a matching filter or a form of joint inversion is required to benefit from the additional bandwidth of both data types. Interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution (MDD) is a relatively new method of Green’s function retrieval that provides several advantages over interferometry by crosscorrelation. This thesis proposes a new method of merging active and passive data during the process of MDD. A primary advantage of this method over the alternatives is that the source signatures are disregarded and only a single Green’s function with the combined characteristics of both the active and passive data is retrieved. Using numerical modelling it is demonstrated that a broadband Green’s function response can be retrieved from combined active and passive data without the need to compensate for the differences in source signatures or variations in amplitude. Merging active and passive data prior to deconvolution may in fact improve the retrieved response due to the additional illumination provided by the supplementary data. In addition to expanding the bandwidth of the retrieved response, this method is shown to be capable of using data from one source type to spatially infill gaps in illumination in another source type when the bandwidth of the two are comparable.","seismic; interferometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Applied Geophysics","",""

(mentor); Van der Meer, J.D. (mentor); Fockema Andreae, H. (mentor)","2011","This report is a summary of all the phases of the Graduation Project fulfilled by Pieter Romijn. The project was performed at the company Lemnis Lighting B.V., which is a sustainable lighting manufacturer based on LED technology. This Graduation Project is the final and individual project of the Msc Strategic Product Design at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft. The assignment for the project was to develop product strategy recommendations for the company’s brand Pharox. The methods that are used in the project to come to a product strategy, are scenario building and roadmapping. As Lemnis stands on a cross way of product directions in an highly uncertain market, scenarios will provide more insights into the different directions. The use of roadmapping is appropriate to communicate strategic and product recommendations for the coming future in attempt to create a mutual understanding about the future possibilities of the company and its products. The foundation for these methods was the performed analysis of external, internal and product aspects of Lemnis. The outcomes of the analysis were transformed into scenario drivers that function as the adjustable parameters to create different development of the future. The first driver is the industry dominating by the global players Philips, Osram and GE. Secondly is the technological development that occurs for LED lighting; this could mean a transition from retrofit bulbs towards integrated luminaires. It also entails the development of efficacy rates of LED technogy, which is forecasted to increase rapidly. The third drives is material scarcity, which imposes an imminent threat to the raw materials of LED chips. The three scenarios are: - Retrofit Renaissance: a continuing structure of separate light source and fixture. - Luminaire Luminescence: integration of light source and fixture and interactive lighting systems. - Scarcity Scandal: China bans the export of scarce materials that are needed for LED production. In a consequences analysis of the above mentioned scenarios appeared that the establishment of strategic partnerships is the key implication of all three scenarios. The main partnerships are divided over three stages, of which first is the retrofit LED bulb route. This route suggests a continuation of the retrofit bulbs that Lemnis manufacturers. Partnering up with Ikea in this route, will give access to a global distribution channel (with the potential sales volume) by the collaborative development of a fixture and retrofit LED bulb combination. In addition to the partnership strategy, stands the phasing of customer segments for Lemnis’ current retrofit portfolio development. A segment focus strategy will give the relative small technical department of Lemnis the time and space to develop lighting product for a particular business segment and consumer light product. The second route entails the development of luminaires. The first step within this route is to find a partner for the added functionalities that light requires in the future. Interactive lighting systems will be possible in the a partnership with Dutch semiconductor company NXP. The second step within the luminaire route is to find a host for this light engine. Vitra’s architectural and design assets will be combined with the lighting expertise of Lemnis in the development of a lighting product that stands in line with the progressive furniture and should define a new position of interactive lighting within people’s interior. The third product route is based on the potential of material scarcity of LED. OLED is the answer to decrease the dependence of Lemnis on the mentioned material aspects, while maintaining the company’s lighting expertise. Novaled is the best potential partner that can provide OLED technology so that Lemnis can continue its lighting expertise and integrate this new technology into its products. The roadmap on the next pages summarizes the above mentioned strategic recommendations. In the conclusion of this report, one can find an overall recapitulation of the main results of the project and the additional recommendations for Lemnis.","sustainable; lighting; roadmap; product strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); De Jong, A. (mentor)","2011","“Reducing food waste in the household through behaviour change“ is a thesis project for the Design for Interaction Master Programme at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. The project was carried out at the Interactive Institute in Stockholm. In Sweden 25% of purchased food is thrown away. If people only bought the food they needed and ate the food they bought the amount of food waste would undoubtedly sink. This thesis looks at what role design can play in changing people’s consumption behaviour. The focus of this thesis were skills and knowledge on how to treat food. Skills and knowledge around food were seen as having the potential to contribute to the effort of reducing food waste. Three skill domains were defined as food management, storage knowledge, and the art of cooking, that were used as a means to structure the large and diverse group of skills present when dealing with food. In the course of the project “food skills“ was defined more narrow as insights into one’s own routine behaviour. It was believed that this insight would lead to a more skilful way of dealing with food as people would understand what they had to improve. A practice oriented approach was used in order to gain an understanding of current practices and the underlying elements that determined their form and about what could cause changes in practices. Instead of pre-defining how people should behave, people were viewed as co-creators of practices giving them an active role in which they were asked to find solutions for the food waste problem. This was done because it was believed that the best practice could vary greatly between different people and that new practices had to be developed to fit a modern sustainable life style. These new practices were yet to be discovered. The product was to stimulate and trigger people to reflect on their current routines and experiment with new ones. In order to facilitate reflecting and experimenting it was decided to develop a group activity and to include a game aspects. A participatory design approach was used during the product development. Participatory design includes consumers in the design process in order to collect qualitative consumer data at an early stage in the product development. Due to this approach insights could be gained on how consumers react and deal with the idea to experiment with new practices and what kind of insights they gain by that. How group dynamics work in this setting and what kind of a group people feel comfortable sharing the experience of reflecting on their routines and exploring new ways of behaving is another phenomenon that could be explored thanks to the participatory design approach. The final concept is the service “The Food Challenge” that is a collection of tasks that are meant to engage people in doing things differently. When taking on a challenge people have to break with some of their routines and through that get the chance to reflect on the current situation and find out how they could do things differently. Reading the challenges often makes people reflect on their food practices. By offering different ideas on how to deal with food “The Food Challenge“aims to inspire people to become active in finding solutions for the food waste problem.","practice theory; behaviour change; users as co-creators of practices; food waste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor); Keuenhof, M. (mentor); Geerse, M. (mentor)","2011","This master thesis describes the design process of “The development of a European design strategy for the ‘next generation’ dispensing solution for Heinz Foodservice”. Because Heinz has indicated that the current dispensers aren’t meeting up to the needs of the users and the technical requirements. From a European level, the need has been indicated for consistency and clear communication about the future of the dispensing solutions of Heinz. Therefore it would be best to work together on a European level, to start developing the next generation dispenser, and bundle the resources. It's about the development and improvement of a sauce dispensing solution for cold and/or hot sauces of the Heinz and Wijko brand. The dispensing solutions are used as an easy, quick and hygienic solution to serve sauces. To improve the dispensing situation at Heinz, a European vision and design strategy for dispensing was needed. The strategy should focus on the needs of the end-user and consumer, in order to create a product with an exclusive competitive advantage that is meeting the existing high expectations of the brand. To build the strategy we needed to research the needs of the user, and gather insights about how they feel about sauces and sauce dispensing systems, and how they experience the use of the products. We interviewed employees of seven companies in the Netherlands that are working in the Foodservice business, and an online survey was sent to consumers of the sauces. The insights gathered were written down on statement cards. The cards were used to map the relationship between the statements. This resulted in the brand vision poster for the dispensing platform of Heinz and a rough customer journey. Six key objectives could be defined of how Heinz can add value for the end-user and the consumer: (1) by creating the Heinz experience, (2) by being a professional partner, (3) by providing a strong and trusted brand, (4) by using effective brand exposure, (5) by adding the finishing touch to food , and (6) by delivering efficient products. The brand vision and rough customer journey were used in two creative sessions, which have been organised in order to generate ideas and solutions for the future. After a series of clustering and selecting, nine feasible concepts were chosen for further development. The concepts that were most promising based on the criteria ‘added value for the end-user, ‘efficient product performance’ and ‘enjoyable food experience’ were chosen by the employees of Heinz. This has led to a top three; they also had the best fit with the brand vision. Based on the rough customer journey, the customer journey is detailed at a much deeper level. It can be used as a tool to provide Heinz with the guidelines to make future design more valuable and relevant for the user. It contains all experiences that a user has with the products and services of Heinz. We can indicate 10 key experiences for the end-user and 3 key experiences for the consumer of the product. Each experience comprises several individual touchpoints, where the user comes in contact with Heinz. Besides that we have built design guidelines, they are individual statements that in words and visually capture what is meant by it. They can be used as a tool for discussion about all aspects concerning the future dispensing solutions. We can divide them in four themes, each representing different aspects and layers of the design, brand exposure, professional look, usability and smart working system. The detailed journey and guidelines were used to further develop the top three concepts. The SOM Expert, the SOM Hot and the Foodservice assistant are closely aligned with the mission statement and values of Heinz. Heinz Foodservice wants to provide the user with tools to create beautiful food moments for their guests, by being a professional partner in food with differentiated brands and products. The SOM Expert is a professional dispensing system that will be integrated in the environment of use and is fixed in the environment. It is easy and convenient in use, does not take up workspace and has a nice unified appearance. The SOM like it HOT is a sauce dispenser that is specialised in portion heating. Only one portion at the time is heated to the desired temperature. It opens potential new markets, is trustworthy and is efficient with energy and in use. The Foodservice assistant is a 24/7 accessible service program for the end-user, so he can have a personal assistant within reach, whenever and wherever he needs it. It provides good customer service, is an added value and takes off workload. Because of the long history of the project, the advice is given to start a follow-up project as soon as possible. The content of this thesis provides Heinz with the stepping stones to start the development process and write a well underpinned follow-up proposal. A reasoning, why the development of a next generation dispensing solution has a high priority, is given. And the future dispensing solutions guidelines help Heinz to focus on the most important aspects concerning a new dispensing solution, to set the goals for the future.","customer journey; dispensing; insights; out-of-home; food experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bouwman, H. (mentor); De Reuver, M. (mentor); Warnier, M. (mentor)","2011","The increasing ubiquity and capabilities of smartphones provide opportunities to combine their processing power, storage, connectivity and sensors into a shared resource pool for end-users and service providers. This is analogous to the concept of cloud computing, in which cloud computing datacenters provide a shared resource pool. Several technological architectures and prototypes exist in which smartphones themselves serve as such a mobile cloud computing resource pool. However, little guidance is available regarding the possibilities for commercialization of mobile cloud computing. This study identifies factors influencing the feasibility and viability of the mobile cloud concept in order to provide input for future mobile cloud business models. To this end the opportunities for mobile cloud to deliver multi-sided platforms are explored. Multi-sided platforms serve as matchmakers between supply and demand side customers, while the platform owner can benefit from mediating between different types of customers. Mobile cloud platforms can mediate between end-users of mobile cloud services, individuals providing smartphone resources and service providers. To evaluate the feasibility and viability of mobile cloud platforms, ecosystems theory is used to formulate a set of qualitative criteria for the role divisions, structures and performance of multi-sided platforms. The criteria have been applied in fourteen semi-structured interviews with mobile industry experts, resulting in a range of success factors and inhibitors for mobile cloud ecosystems. With regards to ecosystem role divisions it is noted that mobile cloud platforms are most likely to succeed when positioned in existing strong ecosystems with large user bases of service providers and service consumers, such as those of the handset operating systems and internet based service providers. Operators lack such ecosystems and innovation capabilities and are therefore less likely mobile cloud platform owners. However, their support may still be required as end-users incur data subscription costs and cause inter-operator traffic handoff when sharing smartphone resources via the operator network. Billing mechanisms between users and between operators may need to be adapted to take this into account. With regards to ecosystem structure a mobile cloud platform owner can benefit from the revenues obtained by providing third parties and end-users access to a shared mobile resource pool, which may include unique and desired resources such as sensors. However, this coordinating platform ownership position may be difficult to maintain as similar access to mobile resources may be obtained by installing specific-purpose applications on smartphones. Operators and handset OS developers may therefore struggle to maintain platform control as internet-based service providers can use web-based cross-platform applications to gain access to any number of smartphone resources, regardless of geography and hardware. The performance of mobile cloud ecosystems is currently considered to be hampered due to current technological limitations and market conditions. Scarce and perishable smartphone resources, limited, expensive bandwidth and lack of clear end-user sharing incentives are the most visible hurdles, along with the security, privacy and legal concerns associated with smartphone resource sharing. While some of these issues may be addressed over time with technical and network improvements, these improvements may also disrupt the need for smartphone resource sharing. Faster operator networks diminish the need to share connectivity, while increasing smartphone power and cloud computing datacenters reduce the need to offload computing tasks to other smartphones. This potential performance of mobile cloud platforms is expected to change when more collaborative services making use of multiple devices are conceived, rather than considering mobile devices as a straightforward resource pool akin to cloud computing datacenters. A shared pool of smartphone sensors is expected to lead to innovations of which both end-users and service providers can benefit. Additionally it is noted that in private or community environments such as homes and offices some of these performance hurdles may not apply, as they provide an environment where trust and cost are less of an issue and appliances are more visible than in a general purpose resource pool. Follow-up research towards mobile cloud platforms could focus on mechanisms to award smartphones users for opting in to a shared resource pool. Furthermore, operator, device and service provider centric ecosystems could be further specified in terms of role divisions, relations and platform assets shared using the success factors and inhibitors uncovered in this research as a basis. Finally, as mobile cloud can potentially seamlessly integrate with the traditional cloud, future research could explore ways to optimize whether the resources of a traditional cloud datacenter, a local mobile cloud resource or a remote mobile cloud resource are acquired depending on cost and connection properties.","Mobile Cloud Computing; Mobile Cloud; Mobile Ecosystems; Platform as a Service; Multi-sided Platforms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); De Voogd-Claessen, H. (mentor); De Ruyter, M. (mentor)","2011","In this graduation report, the graduation project ‘Equipment for Sitting Volleyball Players’ for NeVoBo (the Dutch volleyball organisation) is documented. The assignment for this project is: ‘Design and test equipment for sitting volleyball players to improve their performance.’ The execution of the project is done with a user-centered design process. In this user-centered design process, methods like observation, context mapping, prototyping and user testing are used. In the analysis phase, a decision has been made about how the graduation project will evolve. The most important part of the equipment to improve first, are the pants and shoes with a focus to make it possible for the sitting volleyball player to slide better and the wish to make them more comfortable. This is combined in the interaction vision: ‘Enjoy a match as sliding a slide on a playground’ To realise this vision, there are boundaries set and a list of requirements is made. With this list of requirements and wishes, the generated ideas, and later on concepts, can be judged. During the concept phase, due to limitation of time, the focus will go to the pants for the new equipment, which will be worked out into complete prototypes. The development of new shoes will stay in an ideation phase and a rapid prototype of them will be used during the testing of the prototypes of new pants. In the synthesis phase, four design cycles were done. The first cycle was an orientation on what the sliding capabilities were of currently available pants and shoes. In the second cycle, more research was done to the sliding coefficient of the materials and a pair of climbing shoes was chosen to use during prototype tests, because of its good grip. With this information, in the third cycle, a pair of shorts, trousers and shorts with braces were made, which did not seem to have significant differences in speed. In the last and fourth cycle, the problem of sweat regulation and the problem of sharp orthesis were looked at. As final concept, a tight fitting design, made of Lycra, was chosen, with pieces of better absorbing stretch cotton in the pattern. This choice was based on sliding coefficient tests, the sliding speeds of the prototypes and the feedback of the players, after they tested a prototype during these design cycles. In the detailing phase, there is chosen for the ‘Bora’ Lycra of Wegal for the sliding zone and the Staco Medical fabric ST014, a sort of stretch cotton, for the absorbing pieces. With the pattern, where the players choose if they like to have shorts or trousers, prototypes are made with an individual tight fit. The fabric is sewed together with a lock stitch and a flatlock stitch, the top is finished with an elastic band with integrated cord and the end of the legs is hemmed with a double stitch. Protection garment is designed for the knee, a brace around the knee, a brace around the ankle and for a stump. This protection is filled with coldfoam of 12 or 17 millimetres thick and made of an outer layer of ‘Bora’ Lycra and an inner layer of the stretch cotton. The protection is finished with an anti-slip elastic band at the top and a hem at the bottom. The final prototypes were evaluated in a user test, in which can be concluded that another requirement for the fabric is that the fabric does not have a nap, which was not observed earlier. Also, the pattern of the pants should be optimised to be a bit tighter to prevent chafe markings and not be too high at the belly but still be high enough at the back. The protection garment should be tightened a bit at the top and the bottom and could be further designed with a research to the possibilities of the foam to optimise this protection garment. It is recommended that for this optimisation phase, there is cooperation with a production company specialised in producing Lycra sport clothing. This company will have more knowledge about making tight fitting patterns for individual athletes and access to a broader range of textiles. The process of this project went well with the use of the user centred design process. The design cycles with prototyping and testing were very valuable. The opportunity to use the team in this was very important. It was possible to bring this graduation project to a satisfying end within the tight time frame and with the available knowledge.","sport; disability; user-centered design; prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-09-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Janszen, A. (mentor); McDougall, N. (mentor)","2011","Upper Ordovician glaciogenic rocks from Block-NC186, in the Murzuq Basin, SW Libya, represent important hydrocarbon reservoirs. The producing reservoirs are found in glacial incisions filled by the Melaz Shuqran and Mamuniyat formations. These formations present complex reservoir architecture and high sediment heterogeneity. Understanding the morphology and internal reservoir architecture in these incisions is important in order to improve prediction in such complex reservoir systems. This study describes the Upper Ordovician formations from Block-NC186 (Libya) using an integrated approach based on seismic, isopach maps, well logs, core and chemostratigraphic data. The results are compared and contrasted with the infill of a Pleistocene glacial incision from Lake Simcoe (Ontario, Canada) inferred from high-resolution seismic data. Results show differences in the infilling history of the two systems. Sedimentological records from the Upper Ordovician show different phases of ice-sheet advance, retreat and glacio-isostatic rebound infilling a complex network of mainly fault-controlled incisions, of very variable widths and depths, cut under the pre-glacial Middle Ordovician Hawaz Formation. In the other hand, the Pleistocene infill from the Lake Simcoe shows a similar incised valley, filled during small fluctuations of the ice front in a single episode of ice-sheet retreat within low energy lacustrine environment. The comparison of these two systems highlights the variability of the glaciogenic infill and the need to incorporate influencing parameters such as regional tectonic trend, bedrock types, glaciations amplitudes and geographical environments into the geological models aimed to reconstruct and predict reservoir distribution within these glacial sedimentary systems.","tunnel valleys; glaciations; integrated approach; geological modelling; chemostrat; Libya; Lake Simcoe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Geology","","","",""

We show that for all of these cases, the decay of the turbulent spot can be described by Poisson process, which supports the chaotic transient model for this flow. Furthermore, we show that characteristic lifetime of the turbulent spot increases with Reynolds number faster than exponentially, but does not diverge to infinity. This is in agreement with the most recent studies in pipe and Taylor Couette flows and implies that turbulence is a transient state for all Reynolds numbers (before the global bifurcation). Finally, we show that there is a universal behavior for the characteristic lifetime of the intermittent state in Taylor Couette flow with stationary inner cylinder.

(mentor)","2011","The connectivity between SAGD pair-wells is the key for success of SAGD processes. The bituminous sands of Corner field situate in middle McMurray, where tidal influenced meandering fluvial point bar dominate the deposits. Thus, to characterize the internal structure of point bar deposit is essential to optimize SAGD production in Corner field. The aim of this thesis is to investigate correspondences between point bar internal structures and VSP responses. Since VSP preserve higher frequency than surface seismic thus VSP data would provide more precise identification and characterization of internal structures if we can recognize them from data. These investigations are done by comparing actual data, synthetic data and targets part in the model. Prior to the comparisons, we need to build a model that preserves the characteristics of our targets in subsurface as accurate as possible. We decompose the segment of logging data corresponding to the thickness of point bar deposits into a function which is able to represent the influence of gravity on deposition and a function that is able to imply the affect of current. After examining relation between borehole and inclined units of point bar structure, two scaled functions are combined in a way which can produce structures of point bar deposits. As soon as a realistic model is constructed, VSP simulations proceed. Based on the comparison of plane wave source VSP data with the model, it is found that variation of travel-time difference between two levels indicate heterogeneities between these levels. Since finite difference used in this thesis is based on acoustic wave propagation, only travel-time is investigated. While if an elastic modeling is available, the results will be more fruitful with respect to amplitudes variation and wave conversion.","IHS (Inclined Heterolithic Strata) modeling; VSP; heterogeneities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Applied Geophysics and Petrophysics","","Applied Geophysics","",""

(mentor); Jellema, A.H. (mentor)","2011","Orientation This report describes the process and the results of a project that aimed to: “Design the next generation of a flexible brace to prevent flexion contractures in the knee after transtibial amputations, and test the interaction between the new concept and its user in a user research”. The project has started with exploring the company; the assignment and the current concept (Contraflex) and its working principle. This already led to important topics for the brace. The brace has to prevent flexion contractures in the knee by applying an extension moment on the knee joint, strong enough to fixate the leg in extension. This extension moment has to be applied by the three point principle. This three point principle is covered by the patent LIVIT already has. The brace should allow the user to bend the knee in order to relieve the stretched muscles, but when the user bends the knee the brace must provoke that the joint tends to correct the position of the leg to full extension (180°). Analysis; The body Out of literature it became clear that almost 3300 amputations are performed in the Netherlands each year and that the majority consists of transtibial amputations. It was emphasized that most amputations are caused by vascular diseases because of diabetes and that most amputees are over 65 years old. It became clear that ‘the long posterior myofasciocutaneous flap with short anterior flap method’ is used most often in transtibial amputations. The focus of this study is knee flexion contractures. Contractures can be subdivided in preoperative and postoperative contractures. Preoperative structures develop before surgery and will still exist after the amputation. Postoperative contractures, which develop after surgery, can be prevented by prolonged stretching and active stretching. In clinic prolonged stretching doesn’t appear to happen though, because this is uncomfortable the patient tends to bend their leg again. Treatment of a developed contracture mostly focuses on curing the contracture; decreasing the angle or ensuring the angle will not increase (the worst case scenario). Because Postoperative contractures (20%) happen more often than preoperative contractures (5%) and prevention ensures that fewer contractures develop which in turn reduces treatment costs, the concept which will be designed focuses solely on postoperative contractures. The most common problems of a knee flexion contracture are associated with the alignment and construction of the prosthesis; the limit of choice in prosthetic components and de cosmetics of the prosthetics. It is therefore desirable for both LIVIT and the patient that the patient has no knee flexion contracture. Prevention of knee flexion contractures currently includes three important ingredients: Regular periods of daily exercises of the joints in full range of motion; passive or active stretching of the muscles; Proper posture of the body (stretching the leg when sitting in a wheelchair on a stump support, sleeping on the back with a stretched leg). In clinic this doesn’t appear to happen though. Because of comfort reasons the patient takes a rest position with a bended knee. Research has shown that only the recommended 20-30 minutes of active stretching is not enough to prevent contracture, for this prolonged stretching of the leg for 8 hours a day is recommended. Current aids for prolonged stretching (besides the stomp support), like orthopaedic casts and dynamic splints; however seems to have the disadvantage that the product becomes uncomfortable after a while. Because there is no option to bend the knee, the user gets ‘cramp’ in the leg after a while. Therefore the new brace should provoke the leg to stay in extension, but should allow the knee to flex actively. Analysis; The market In the analysis of the market the specific target group is defined as transtibial amputees older than 65 years because 80% of the people who undergo an amputation are older than 65 years and it is expected that older people have more problems in rehabilitation and are less active in their movements when compared with younger people. Therefore this group is most likely to develop contractures. The several physical and/or mental disabilities they could have were discussed subsequently. The medical conditions of elderly, which are the target group of this product, has its consequences for the design of the product. It should be easy to use and understand and should not apply excessive high forces. The size should be easy to adjust, since the elderly often suffer from musculoskeletal disorders such as a decrease in muscle strength. There should also be permanent attention for comfort while using this product, since the elderly often suffer from pain. This could be neck and back pain, but could also be pain that is caused by certain disorders, such as osteoarthritis. The amputation itself may be considered a major stressful live event since it causes several threats and/or challenges for the patient. The psychosocial wellbeing is however not only influenced by the amputation itself, it is also influenced by the characters of the patient itself (age, sex, socioeconomic status, personality and self-perception) and by social-ecological factors (social support). There are five stages of grief which the amputee could go through: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Some patients will skip stages, move back and forth between stages, or go through the stages in a fast pace. The psychosocial wellbeing also has an impact for the clinic. Keeping a positive attitude towards them seems to work in motivating the and communicating with the patient. Clear information and instructions, with a positive attitude, should be given to those patients who lack motivation and have a negative attitude. Analysis; The Contraflex This analysis of the current concept, the Contraflex, is based on conclusions drawn from the analysis, on actual experience of users and on discussion with specialists within LIVIT. Important disadvantages like the dorsal back support which moves in the wrong direction, the high shear forces and/or pressure on the leg; the number of straps which makes them complex and the force on the ventral side which grips on the patella (uncomfortable) lead to the decision to consider other options which come with more advantages than the current concept. Although there seems to be an option that the current concept could be improved to overcome it disadvantages, it is important to prevent lock-in and to be open for other, maybe better, options. It is therefore meaningful to consider other options which come with more advantages than the current concept. Requirements and wishes The analysis showed several aspects which can be translated into requirements and wishes. In addition other requirements were formulated in a previous study on this subject. The requirements and wishes from this and the foregoing study form the basis for the criteria on which the concepts will be evaluated. The evaluation clarifies to what extent the different concepts meet the wishes and requirements. This makes it possible to choose the best possible concept. Design The first two disadvantages of the Contraflex named above were caused by the placement of the back support. This back support was placed on the dorsal side of the leg; when bending the knee this part of the leg becomes shorter. This brought up the idea to think about a concept which bends in line with the pivot axis on the knee. When doing so the area under the brace doesn’t become shorter or longer. This will keep the concept in place and minimize the shear forces. This has led to the final concept: The Flextension. The Flextension connects two glass fibre poles on the sides of the leg by using two straps on the dorsal side and one strap on the ventral side of the leg. The Flextension is based on the glass fibre pole which applies a continuous extension moment on the knee. Because of this continuous extension moment during a flexion moment, the brace will be fixated on the leg by the forces; therefore circular closed straps around the leg are not needed. The load is adjustable by pulling the flexible straps tighter. Because the straps which connect the flexible pole to the leg are non-elastic, the brace will keep walking over the pivot axis of the knee. User research The aim of the research was to investigate if the Flextension is a usable and comfortable product for all the users involved. Next to this there was tested if the aesthetics of the brace give the participant the intended feeling. The results of the user research are very promising. The usability of the brace is assessed positive on all topics. Little improvements are possible, but the concept itself is already very good in use. Improvements are possible on the adjustability (by using one length strap) and the recovery/wound healing (by putting a protective layer of textile on the inner sides of the passants). The effectiveness and the durability both need further exploration. The topic in comfort led to different problems like irritations of the Velcro on the skin or against the clothes; the bodies which were standing out on the proximal side of the brace; pressure sores when the passants are placed against the skin; the pole which pricks in the leg; etc. All these problems can all be solved by small adjustments (Chapter 9 recommendations). The assessment of the aesthetics of the brace was very positive. The feelings which are evoked strongest by seeing the brace are mostly also the feelings the design of the brace intended to evoke. Most important, the brace was able to extend the stump in the correct position, while the leg still had the option for flexion. So, with minimal adjustments the Flextension will be able to extend the stump adequately in a comfortable way, with a very usable brace.","flexion; extension; brace; orthesis; orthopeadic; livit; flextension; contraflex; knee; contracture; transtibial; amputation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor)","2011","Today, wireless networks are connecting more and more devices around us. The scale of these systems demands for novel techniques to maintain availability for various services such as routing, localization, context detection, etc. Distance estimation is one of their most important building blocks. The majority of current algorithms presume knowledge about node position via systems such as GPS. While for some application scenarios this approach is feasible, for a lot of cases it suffers from frequent unavailability and high costs in terms of energy consumption. The main contribution of the thesis is the introduction of a novel distributed algorithm called GDE for the estimation of distances in large-scale wireless networks. It is based on a gossiping mechanism to estimate distances between nodes solely based on local interaction. We analyze the parameters that should be considered by real applications, and present mathematical models to compensate their influence for distance estimation. Three kinds of applications are shown in the thesis using the GDE algorithm, including cluster center detection, overlay shape construction, and routing. Finally, we introduce some more improvement methods for the GDE algorithm to increase the distance estimation accuracy. The evaluations by means of simulation show that GDE succeeds in estimating the distance between nodes in both static and mobile scenarios with considerably high accuracy for various parameter setups, such as varying node density, node speed, spatial node distribution, etc.","hop count; distance estimation; distributed algorithm; large-scale networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Systems","",""

Therefore, physical pain is always avoided. However, physical pain is involved in our daily lives, not only as an avoided concept, but also as a constructive concept. It is used for functional or hedonic purposes; whether consciously or not. The focus in this research is exploring these ‘used’ pains, and their relations to product design; in other words, how products are (or how they may be) used or manipulated to use pain instead of avoiding it. Eventually, the aim is to map the pain experience as a constructive element of experience and to come up with a statement for the usage of physical pain in product design as a beneficial tool, instead of just being a tool for pleasure as it has been used in product design till now. In order to explore the pain experience with products, a contexmapping study and a focus group study have been done. The phenomena of ‘good, transitional and bad pain’ were introduced. Following this, pain experience with products model was proposed utilizing the results of the studies and for the exploration of the implementation of the model in practicum, a generative session study to obtain initial design ideas was done.","pain experience with products; physical pain; product experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The unique situation of founding my own company and developing a new product and technology platform while in parallel executing my graduation project within this company can be considered to be the “red thread” for this report. The product developed at Calendar42 is a digital calendar service that differentiates from other digital calendaring services by providing subscription based calendaring in a decentralized architecture. This setup enables to pro actively enrich, simplify and support the users calendar. The commercial interest of Calendar42 can be found on the one side in the fact that it can act as a communication channel while at the same time providing valuable insights and data about the information consumption regarding calendar information. The research approach followed during this project was a combination of different types of research approaches. The combination of both creating a theoretical foundation for execution and actually executing and implementing results into daily business can characterize this project as a learning by doing process. The process was based on five phases. An internal analysis phase intended to analyse the situation of Calendar42 at the start of the project. A research and case study phase intended to gaining external insights about the context of Calendar42. An experimental phase in which small scale tests and trial and error experiments are executed. A pilot phase containing the main scope of this project in preparing, executing and analysing a full scale service pilot at the TU Delft. And finally a synthesis and conclusion phase in which all information is processed in order to come to a set of learning moments, insights and recommendations ultimately leading to a final recommendation for the introduction strategy of Calendar42 and providing detailed road maps as guidelines for the Calendar42 team.","Market introduction strategy; Mobile; Calendar42; Web","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","In times in which Information Technology is dominating our global society, cooperative research and developments (R&D) is rapidly becoming the most relevant topic in educational and scientific field. International collaboration is the trend in future research and education. Why is collaboration in education and research relevant? What kind of research topics can be addressed in collaborative projects? How do we design and implement systems that could effectively support such projects? How do we link academic research and business companies in an international setting? These challenges are highly relevant from the perspective of E-Business and E-Service research, education and practice. The eBerea project stands for E-Business and E-Service Education and Research Network between Europe and China. The eBerea project is a EU funded joint exchange and collaborative research program. The main goal of the eBerea is advancing higher education and research in fields of E-Business and E-Service in Europe and China. The project is a three-year long program from 2010 to 2012. The eBerea consortium aims at exploring E-Business and E-Service in the following three aspects: business modeling and design, financial service for customers and citizens, and institutional arrangements. Nine European and Chinese universities joined the project until now. Three universities are from Finland, one is from the Netherlands, and one is Italian university. The other four participants come from China. It is expected that the organizational network among these universities will change along with the development of the collaborative project. The eBerea project has already carried out some sub-researches and exchanged some PhD students. More joint research projects will be continued in future among these partners. At the moment, the eBerea consortium has its own official website: http://eberea.org. It provides some basic information of the eBerea, such as introduction of the eBerea, a general introduction of the nine partners, news and events, and so on. This kind of information on the web popularizes the eBerea project. However, the website is lack of supporting functionalities in many respect, for instance, opportunity to share administrative as well as non-administrative documents, repository of research papers, paper reviewing tools, and so on. So, there is a gap between the current situation of the website and requirements one would expect researchers collaborating in joint projects to have. The main research question proposed in this thesis is: How could the eBerea consortium improve the current website to effectively support collaborative activities in E-Business and E-Service education and research between Europe and Asia? To answer the research question, the thesis starts from three streams of literature on (1) collaborative research, (2) web-based research support system, and (3) E-Business and E-Service. Next data is collected based on a questionnaire among the eBerea participants. A collaborative framework and a process model are proposed in analyzing collaboration in the eBerea project. The challenges in the eBerea collaboration include cultural collaboration, social and organizational networking. The research on the Web-based support system is conducted based on extensive literature review and the questionnaire. The specification towards E-Business and E-services is relevant from the perspective that researchers have to practice what they preach. The combination of the three perspectives leads to suggestions to improve the current website by adding the following functionalities: documents sharing, literature searching, high quality contents, discussion forum, cultural reducing, simplicity, relevant news and information, and frontier knowledge on E-Business and E-Service.","E-Business; E-Service; collaborative research; collaboration; cross-cultural collaboration; network; Web-based research support system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Dröge Wendel, Y. (mentor)","2011","This project was initiated as a self-formulated graduation assignment from the MSc course Design for Interaction, faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft. It contributes to the research of Stella Boess and Lenneke Kuijer in the program User Experience, Theme 4: Usage, Comfort and Safety, which is part of the faculty's research portfolio 2008 — 2012. Furthermore, it feeds from insights and draws inspiration from the artistic research approaches of Yvonne Dröge Wendel on human—object mediation. Objects are not always used as intended by design. In the process of making products part of daily life, people often reinterpret use to fit new, complex and unpredictable situations. This is not always the result of not understanding product features, nor does it necessarily result in frustration and 'unpleasant experiences'. It can also have creative possibilities for inventing new uses. By attempting to eliminate possible (mis)interpretations of use based on preconceived ideas of users, user-centered design risks becoming user-design: turning people into users by limiting space for improvisation and possibilities for creating new uses. The main problem of that design approach, is not how accurate preconceived ideas of user behavior are, but that it sustains a culture of passive user-consumers becoming numb to other ways of relating to things than what is offered by the industry. Cases of people (unconventionally) repairing, make-shifting with, and re-purposing objects to help them achieve (not always so-) ordinary purposes, and analyzing these in terms of deviation from intended (by design) use, present a view of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction, as always relational to situated contexts and susceptible to re-interpretation — not necessarily the result of confirming the expectations of a specified user. Furthermore, the distinction between user and designer is blurred when users actively engage in reinterpreting objects to create new utilities that could not have been anticipated during the design process. This suggests that 'user experience' may not always be something to anticipate and strive to 'match' by improving usability based on more accurate predictions of user behavior. Studying such cases in terms of skills involved in re-purposing objects, identified resourcefulness, creativity and improvisation as ingredients of the human capacity to perceive alternative possibilities of use. I see optimism in abuse, misuse, hacking, subverting, and re-purposing objects. The skills involved in these actions — from the simplest reparation to the most brilliant subversion of functionality and invention of new uses — are a form of resistance. They seed the capacity to negotiate the conditions of engagement with our material world, the environment and others, and allow alternative realities to emerge. This holds for designers as much as for users: the ability to create change depends on our capacity to perceive things as able to change. And if change is to be based on a socially sustainable process, we also need to rethink our preconceptions about users and designers. But how to approach rethinking of this distinction by avoiding the presumptions that both terms (designer — user) carry? The method this project follows to answer this, is looking at interactions from the perspective of the objects involved. Reversing the conventional aim of usability — creating unequivocal signs that effectively condition use — this project investigates whether and how, material and semiotic qualities of objects can trigger improvisation and catalyze the process of inventing new uses. Through iterations of experimenting with materials, evaluating and posing new questions, the project explores concepts of object de-scription, functional choreography, material language, development of skill–purpose relationships and resistance to de-signification. Addressing mainly the informed group of product designers, the aim is to contribute to design practice by generating theoretical as well as material tools. These can be used to question and rethink contemporary attitudes and ways of working in the field of interaction design, and inspire designers to embrace unexpected interactions with objects as creative possibilities.","design research; unintentional interactions; improvisation; re-purposing objects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","In the context of the initiative Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology demonstration (FAST), this dissertation describes the design and comparison of several nonlinear attitude controllers for TU Delft’s micro-satellite. The control requirements include robustness against model uncertainties and disturbances. To this end, Backstepping is selected as the base control design for the stability awareness provided and the versatility in rendering the control law robust and adaptive. Five Backstepping schemes are selected for comparison: Standard Static, Static Robust, Integrated Adaptive with tuning functions estimation, Modular Adaptive with nonlinear extended state observation and, finally, Immersion and Invariance Adaptive. The spacecraft model is written using Modified Rodrigues Parameters. Three perturbation sources are considered and applied separately: constant inertia tensor mismatch; saturated reaction wheel; and moving mirror from a payload spectrometer. All perturbations are translated to time-variant disturbance torques. Convergence of the tuning functions estimator to the true disturbance value is proved. The Immersion and Invariance Adaptive Backstepping law is here proved input-to-state stable in case of time-variable perturbation. Command filters are used in all designs allowing the inclusion of magnitude and rate constraints. Simulation reveals similar tracking performances of all controlled systems in a disturbance-free case. In all disturbance scenarios the adaptive laws clearly outperform the static ones. This is especially evident in the presence of a faulty reaction wheel and a moving payload. Sampling time analysis shows higher dependence of the adaptive designs on the control frequency. The Modular Adaptive and the Immersion and Invariance Adaptive Backstepping controllers display the best performances. However, the latter design emerges as, not only the easiest to tune, but also as the one with the most consistent performance.","Spacecraft Attitude Control; Robust Control; Adaptive Control; Backstepping; Immersion and Invariance; Modified Rodrigues Parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this thesis the development of the state of health of Li-ion battery cells under possible real-life operating conditions in electric cars has been characterised. Furthermore, a practical circuit-based model for Li-ion cells has been developed that is capable of modelling the cell voltage behaviour under various operating conditions. The Li-ion cell model can be implemented in simulation programs and be directly connected to a model of the rest of the electronic system in electric vehicles. Most existing battery models are impractical for electric vehicle system designers and require extensive background knowledge of electrochemistry to be implemented. Furthermore, many models do not take the effect of regenerative braking into account and are obtained from testing fully charged cells. However, in real-life applications electric vehicles are not always fully charged and utilise regenerative braking to save energy. To obtain a practical circuit model based on real operating conditions and to model the state of health of electric vehicle cells, numerous 18650 size LiFePO4 cells have been tested under possible operating conditions. Capacity fading was chosen as the state of health parameter, and the capacity fading of different cells was compared with the charge processed instead of cycles. Tests have shown that the capacity fading rate is dependent on temperature, charging C-rate, state of charge and depth of discharge. The obtained circuit model is capable of simulating the voltage behaviour under various temperatures and C-rates with a maximum error of 14mV. However, modelling the effect of different temperatures and C-rates increases the complexity of the model. The model is easily adjustable and the choice is given to the electric vehicle system designer to decide which operating conditions to take into account. By combining the test results for the capacity fading and the proposed circuit model, recommendations to optimise the battery lifetime are proposed.","LiFePO4; battery model; capacity fading; electric vehicle; lithium-ion battery; battery degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-10-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

(mentor); Wolf, K.H.A.A. (mentor); Speksnijder, A. (mentor)","2011","This report presents the results of a study on the reservoir quality of Main Buntsandstein formations in regard with possible geothermal energy development and exploration in the Zuid Holland area of the West Netherlands Basin. The assessment of the possibility of using the Triassic Buntsandstein sandstone reservoirs for geothermal application is carried out in a similar way of basin exploration for hydrocarbons with major focus on reservoir quality. Geothermal energy is becoming increasingly important as an alternative source of energy and heat for the Dutch agriculture and urban areas. In order to determine the possibilities for geothermal exploration in the target area the reservoir properties have to carefully studied and assessed. This is done with respect of the original depositional environment of the sediments, the burial history of the basin and the related diagenetic history. The results are summarized in reservoir geologic models and evaluated. The study on the depositional environment of the Main Buntsandstein formations is the most extensive for the project and covers basin wide well correlations, petrophysical and sedimentological evaluation and interpretation of the encountered facies, and introduction of sequence stratigraphic model for interpretation of the formations. The results of the study include new insights on the formation boundaries and lateral continuity. Each formation member is described separately and examples are provided to support the suggested interpretations. The burial history study is carried out on three two dimensional seismic surveys in-lines in the offshore and onshore part of the target area. The work is performed using specialized software and the result indicate that specific parts of the basin have experienced significantly stronger effect from the different stages of the tectonic development of the West Netherlands Basin. The major conclusion of the study is that although the Triassic sediments have not been exposed to burial depths of more than 700 meters of their current depth, individual fault blocks have experienced very varied burial histories and have therefore different diagenetic footprint. The results of the previous studies are used to evaluate and explain the available information for the diagenetic history of the sediments in the target area. The results indicate that significant differences are to be expected between adjacent fault blocks in regard with the late diagenetic processes such as quartz dissolution and precipitation. The acquired knowledge for the reservoir properties in the target areas in the basin is summarized in extensive reservoir models and grids. The resulting grids represent the observed spatial variations in reservoir quality and also the changes in reservoir thickness across major faults. The resulting grids have also suggested well planning and evaluated for the expected temperatures using available well temperature data. The time of thermal breakthrough is calculated using a theoretical approach and suggestions are made for further dynamic simulations of the already created reservoir simulation models. The project is then evaluated in terms of financial planning and expected costs.

(mentor); Scholten, V.E. (mentor)","2011","Currently organizations are investing large sums of money, time and knowledge to stay competitive and profitable. Driven by strong competition and increasing operational costs, the global aviation industry is under paramount pressure to strengthen operational excellence and improve profitability. Airlines are heavily investing in the means to improve productivity and reduce variation in the maintenance, repair and services processes. Both the well-established and new entrees to the aviation industry need to develop and implement well-developed and proofed quality management system to stay competitive and lead the industry and/or expand to new market segments. A quality management system will help Airlines to meet their customers’ expectation through improved products and services. Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) is facing fierce market competition from European and Middle East airlines such as KLM, Turkish Airlines, Emirates, Qatar and Fly Dubai. EAL implemented Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE) to improve its performance and stay competitive in the market. ACE is a custom-made system developed by United Technology Cooperation (UTC) and yet not proved useful in other organizations. Its implementation highly depends on organizational culture, company resource and existing quality management system. To understand and exploit advantage of ACE, a detailed investigation of its philosophy, tools, techniques, critical success factors, pre-conditions and (dis-)advantages is established. Furthermore, a detailed comparison and potential benefits of its integration with the well-established quality improvement system Six Sigma, are demonstrated. Six Sigma is a business process improvement approach that seeks to find and eliminate causes of defects and errors, reduce cycle time and cost of operations, improve productivity to meet customer expectations, and achieve higher asset utilization and returns. Six Sigma employs a project-based method that uses statistical and non-statistical tools and techniques to remove process variation and improve process performance and capability. Furthermore, Six Sigma is a data-driven, result oriented and uses well-trained improvement specialists and top-down approach to execute the improvement processes. To thoroughly understand the logical reasoning behind ACE and to improve the rate of ACE implementation, resemblances between ACE and Six Sigma and benefits of integrating of ACE and Six Sigma on organization performance; the main research question is formulated as: “How can Six Sigma be integrated with Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE) quality management system to reduce products and services variance, and to improve the performance of an organization?” An extensive literature review on business performance, Six Sigma and ACE is carried out to establish a theoretical framework for this research project. The literature finding of ACE is demonstrated with an exploratory case study at EAL. A detailed insight to the practical challenges and barriers of ACE implementation are presented. The findings of the literature review are crafted against the case study in corporation with ACE experts to formulate firm conclusions and recommendations. Organizations must thoroughly identify their strategy, structure and culture, institutional forces, resources and performance measurement system before embarking on ACE and Six Sigma integration. Top management involvement, commitment and leadership is critical for successful integration. A top-down approach is suggested for project prioritization and selection in an integrated Six Sigma and ACE environment. This increases the involvement of top management in continuous improvement processes. Top management translates organization’s strategies to goals and objectives to meet customers’ expectation and remove barriers and obstacles to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of continues improvement programs. Furthermore, top-down approach facilitates integration of stakeholders’ issues; sustained profit, low operational cost, sustainable annual growth and usage of “voice of customer” (VOC) as an input to project selection process. The introduction of Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) in design and development of new products and services leads to sustainable business operation in a dynamic market environment by delivering high quality products and services to their customers with at lower-cost. DFSS benefits ACE with by reducing product development cycle and high production efficiency and effectiveness. Six Sigma’s tools like design of experiment (DOE), analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear regression analysis, multivariate SPC and other improve process certification process and reduce process variation. The benefits of these tools further extend to problem solving and decision making through relentless root cause analysis. Thus, ACE and Six Sigma integration extends the benefits of these tools to ACE. In cooperating environment/ community and employee’s satisfaction perspectives in the existing balanced scorecard (BSC) extends business performance measurement to more dimensions. The new perspectives together with BSC‘s four perspectives are smoothly translated to ACE Control Tower six categories at strategic level. This helps to track, monitor and evaluate the effect of ACE or integrated Six Sigma and ACE on organization strategies and performance. An Action-learning model facilitates understanding the current situation and employee’s perceptions and involvement in an improvement process. The model helps organizations to bring organizational change and to create a clear understanding of current situation. Action-learning model play a great role in bringing paradigm shift from result-oriented to means driven culture and in developing safe practice field to support network (community of practice) of fellow employees. A well-structured Cell formation guideline that defines the number of employees per Change Agents per Cell, ways to weight operational activities in a Cell and ability to solve conflicts of interest between sections in a Cell must be developed. To reduce employees’ turnover and internal transfer, an incentive or compensation plan for those Cells with excellence business performance must be put in place. Moreover, organizations should create knowledge management system to capture the tacit knowledge from senior quality management experts. The integration makes ACE more data and fact driven, execute process certification on project basis with top-down approach, total value chain gets more focus, improve new products and services design and increased employees and suppliers involvement and get other benefits.","Six Sigma; Process Improvement; Quality Improvement; Achieving Competitive Excellence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Energy and Industry","",""

(mentor); Pavel, M.D. (mentor)","2011","Due to the inherent instabilities and nonlinearities of rotorcraft dynamics, its changing properties during flight and the difficulties to predict its aerodynamics with high levels of fidelity, helicopter flight control requires strategies that allow to cope with the nonlinearities of the model and assure robustness in the presence of inaccuracies and changes in configuration. The control laws developed in the last years normally concern a complex architecture based on an approximate model inversion, with a robust control synthesis or adaptive elements to compensate for the inversion error. In this thesis, a novel approach based on an incremental model inversion is applied to simplify the design of helicopter flight controllers. With the adopted strategy, by employing the feedback of acceleration measurements to avoid the need for information relative to aerodynamic changes in the rotorcraft, the controller does not need any model data that depends exclusively on the states of the system, thus enhancing its robustness to model uncertainties and disturbances. The control system is composed of a three time scale separated loops architecture that allows to provide navigational control of the vehicle. The overall system is tested by simulating several maneuvers with distinct agility levels commonly used for flying qualities analysis and an efficient tracking of the commanded references is achieved. Furthermore, with the robustness properties verified within the range of inaccuracies expected to be found in reality, the suggested method seems to be eligible for a potential practical implementation, even if only a simplified model of the vehicle is available.","helicopter modeling; helicopter flight control; nonlinear dynamic inversion; incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion; pseudo-control hedging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","","",""

(mentor); Haagsman, E.M. (mentor); Rijnders, L. (mentor)","2011","This graduation report shows the design process followed during designing new playground equipment for Boer Speeltoestellen in Nieuwendijk. The assignment for this project was: Develop a new product for outdoor playground equipment for the Dutch sub-urban environment, that interacts on a multi-sensory level with both boys and girls in the age of six to nine years. While focus lies on this target group, it should be possible for younger and less able-bodied children to understand the product and participate in the play. The product should help children develop their skills, but learning should not be the main goal of the design. Above all, the design should follow the ‘rules’ for play, characteristics derived from child psychologists’ theories. Take into account that the design should have the influence that children are and stay motivated to play actively, hereby improving physical exercise and their health. Literature was frequently used during the analysis of the market, the company and the target group. These analyses led to many good results. In order to investigate the requirements and criteria of the target group, the contextmapping method has been used. By sensitizing children from the target group with assignment booklets (cultural probes) about the subject of ‘playing outdoors’ and having sessions with Velcro modelling (building your own playground equipment with objects that are covered with velcro) afterwards, a large amount of rich information was gathered. Important conclusions from the analysis phase and contextmapping phase have been used to compose a list of requirements and criteria. These contain directions for production, safety, aesthetics, play and ergonomics. The list is important: the product should meet the requirements, besides this it should also meet as many criteria as possible. Next, sketches have been made and brainstormsessions have been held in order to come to new ideas. By ranking the best ideas, three were selected and developed further. Of these three concepts, one quickly dropped out because of safety regulations (Klim-op). The other two (Tuimel and Bengels) were compared with each other by using a Harris profile and the Weighted objectives method. By using the mentioned methods, Bengels was chosen being the best concept. Bengels is a product in which a seesaw and swing function are combined, along with some sensory experiences. The concept has then been developed further into a detailed product proposal, hereby proving that the product is viable. In order to test the mechanism, a prototype has been built at the factory of Boer. This prototype has been evaluated by the designer, after which a couple of recommendations have been drawn up. The mechanism in the prototype worked as expected, but should be tested more to be sure it will also be working in the real product. However, most important of all is what the children think of Bengels: by letting children from the target group play with the prototype, it became clear that they liked to play with it. It can be concluded that Bengels fulfils the assignment and with a few adjustments, Bengels could potentially become a good product with a new combination of interactions.","play; multi-sensory; playground equipment; contextmapping; active play; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","Contactless Power Transfer (CPT) is the process of transferring power between two or more physically unconnected electric circuits or devices by means of magnetic induction. The potential application of CPT can range from power transfer to low power home and office appliances to high power industrial systems. Medical, marine, transportation, battery charging applications where physical connections are either dangerous or impossible or inconvenient are all prospective candidates for use of this technology. This thesis mainly concentrates on development of fundamental theory of CPT and application of CPT technology in achieving driving range extension of Electric Vehicles (EV). The work in this thesis can be divided into three broad categories which are, analysis and development of design criteria of a CPT system, experimental and practical implementation, and range extension studies with on-road charging of EVs using CPT technology. The main component of a CPT system is the specially constructed transformer with a large air gap between the primary and secondary winding. In order to achieve efficient power transfer through this large air gap, the principle of resonance is used. To increase the power transfer capability and to reduce the VA rating of the CPT system, capacitive compensation is used in both primary and secondary winding. In this regard, Series-Series (SS), Series-Parallel (SP), Parallel-Series (PS) and Parallel-Parallel (PP) topologies are analysed and design criteria for efficient and stable operation are presented. Constant current mode and constant voltage mode operation of SS compensated system are discussed and it is concluded that SS compensation topology is the most suitable topology for battery charging application. Power electronic requirements for efficient power transfer are investigated and it is concluded that use of active rectifiers in the output stage provide more controlling options and higher power transfer efficiency. To test the many analytically deduced design considerations and feasibility of a CPT system with respect to the efficiency of power transfer, an experimental setup is built. The efficiency of power transfer was measured to be close to 91%. But since DC power is required at the output to accomplish battery charging process, full bridge diode rectifier is employed in the output stage causing additional losses in the system which brings down the overall efficiency of system to 83.2%. To reduce losses in the rectifier stage, use of active rectifier is recommended. Later, CPT charging process is successfully demonstrated on MagIC (Magnetically Induced Charging) car, which is a radio controlled car with super capacitors acting as the on-board energy storage. Due to the multitude of advantages associated with CPT technology, the use of this technology in EV charging application is considered. In particular, application of CPT technology in on-road charge replenishment of EVs is discussed with the help of two case studies. In the first case study, urban driving scenario is considered in which it is assumed that CPT systems are installed at traffic signals and CPT for charge replenishment would occur whenever the EV stops at a red light. From this case study, it is inferred that, for the various urban driving cycles under consideration, considerable driving range enhancement is achievable i.e., the driving range of the EV would be more than doubled with CPT of 20kW. In the second case study, highway driving scenario is considered in which charge replenishment occurs when the EV drives over the primary winding buried underneath the highway. From this case study, it is concluded that to attain considerable range extension, large portion of the highway will have to be covered by primary winding of the CPT system. It is therefore recommended that economic and practical feasibility of such on-road charge replenishment systems have to be studied further in detail. A cost estimate of such CPT systems for stationary EV charging application is also presented.","Contactless power transfer; Inductive charging; Electric vehicle; Driving range extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

These improvements allow embedded systems to implement increasingly complicated systems. As a result the performance gap of processors build on FPGA technology compared to Semi-custom ASIC technology is decreasing.

In this thesis, we design and implement a flexible platform aimed for ease of use whilst offering significant speed-up compared to a General Purpose Processor based system. As a basis for our platform we have taken the MOLEN Polymorphic Processor. By combining a General Purpose Processor with custom accelerators only parts of an application have to be implemented in custom hardware to gain considerable speedup. We aim to decrease the implementation effort further by using a VLIW processor as accelerator in the MOLEN system. Specifically the Xilinx MicroBlaze processor is used as host processor and the r-VEX VLIW processor is used as the accelerator. The r-VEX processor offers parametrization of many of its aspects, such as the issue width and logic organization. As a result of the parametrization a r-VEX processor can be implemented that meets the applications specific requirements.","VLIW; soft-core processor; MicroBlaze; hybride; Embedded Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

During plan development, many solvers employ a heuristic-driven backtracking approach, over the course of which they maintain a so-called Simple Temporal Network (STN) of events and constraints. Recent research has shown that partial path consistency (PPC) can be used to efficiently propagate temporal information in such networks. This insight was applied in the IPPC algorithm, which enforces PPC in an incremental fashion when new constraints are introduced. We present two new algorithms that efficiently enforce PPC in modified STNs. Vertex-IPPC allows the incremental introduction of an event and all its associated constraints at once. Conversely, Support-DPPC allows the removal or loosening of existing constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decremental algorithm for enforcing PPC. Our ultimate goal is a fully dynamic algorithm for PPC, supporting on-line deletions as well as additions. This will allow solvers to efficiently explore the solution space, rather than solving entire networks after each update.","Constraint Satisfaction; Simple Temporal Problem; Scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

Optimal control algorithms for AO systems can provide significant additional improvements beyond the standard control approaches presently in use. These optimal control methods depend upon accurate knowledge of atmospheric conditions. In the optimal control algorithms proposed in literature, consist of a disturbance predictor, that is designed under the assumption that the influence of the atmospheric turbulence on the wavefront can be modeled by a linear time invariant Auto regressive (AR) or state-space model. However, in practice the turbulence statistics will vary with time, and thus it becomes necessary to constantly update the predictor so that it adjusts to the changing atmospheric statistics. In this thesis time-varying AR model structure and state space model structure based predictors are presented. The parameters of the AR model are identified by the Least Mean squares (LMS), Recurisve Least Squares (RLS) and Fast RLS array algorithms at each time instant. For updating the state-space model a recursive subspace identification method, the so called Predictor-Based Subspace Identification (PBSID) method, is used . The algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy, rate of convergence and tracking performance and computational complexity on a laboratory setup under nonstationary turbulence environments. It is shown that the AR model based prediction algorithm with the RLS algorithm has higher accuracy in comparison to the other algorithms. This algorithm is able to predict the nonstationary turbulence with %99 accuracy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

A popular approach among labour intensive industries is the Low Cost Country sourcing strategy.

Especially, firms within the manufacturing industry, where a large share of the operation cost is determined by labour cost, do largely implement the Low Cost Country sourcing strategy in order to reduce their cost and stay competitive. Although, Low Cost Country sourcing proved to be profitable in the past, due to vast economic progress and social developments, the future prosperity should be reconsidered. Labour costs within the eastern European regions have increased considerably, even more as within the western economies. Besides, this unequal growth in labour cost there is also vast difference in the speed of recovery after the recent recession. This great variety in economic performance and development considerably impacts the success of sourcing decisions.

Enabling a WSN to adapt to a changing environment could be a solution for this problem. The goal of this thesis project is to develop software for sensor nodes that is able to reconfigure a wireless sensor network at run-time, allowing the sensor network to perform within its requirements under changing conditions. An approach is proposed in which developers provide knowledge about the WSN’s requirements to sensor nodes during design-time, enabling the nodes to reason about their configuration at run-time. A middleware solution is designed that combines the run-time environment data with the knowledge about the requirements and indicates which reconfiguration is required. A proof-of-concept implementation is developed which reasons about reconfiguration within milliseconds. The performed evaluation includes the implementation of a reconfigurable modal analysis application and shows the processing and memory overhead introduced by the middleware remains low.

A great deal of the risks on the inbound side of a firm is caused by the inability of a supplier to provide the purchasing company with the raw materials demanded. Given these conditions, SABIC in Europe is interested in adopting a risk management approach on its entire supply base. To provide a solution to this problem, this research has been conducted in the form of a single case study facilitated by the European Procurement Department of SABIC in Europe, backed up by an extensive literature review.

(mentor); Rudinac, M. (mentor)","2011","Objective: Injuries caused by falls of elderly people are a common worldwide problem and ageing of population will even further increase related burdens and costs. Recent technology using active monitoring systems have proven their success in order to analyze human actions. What is lacking in these researches is implementation in real elderly home environments. Most of the healthcare researches are focusing on the detection of falls and not on the detection of normal daily actions. We present a single camera with a fisheye lens which is capable of monitoring an entire room. The use of only one camera reduces the costs and simplifies the computational burden which results in a real time system. While different research is done on the detection of such actions, none of these is done using real data by elderly people in their own living environment. Using this data will increase the difficulty level of the action recognition, because every living environment will have different settings and noise factors. Main: We developed an action detection system which monitors the actions of elderly people in their homes during normal daily activities with the idea to raise the alarm in the case of danger. Our system is equipped with a single wide angle camera mounted on the ceiling of an elderly home. This gives a topview image of the environment resulting in a clear map of household objects without any occlusions. The main idea is to monitor the motion information of elderly and to model actions as a change of motion or poses in time that leads to a specific action. After background subtraction using Gaussian Mixture Models, the motion information is extracted using the Motion History Images method and analyzed to detect important actions. We propose to model actions as the shape deformations of the motion history image in time. Every action is defined at several moments in time, called “Action peaks” using different features, the holistic area, contour and location measurements as well as the Fourier shape descriptors. We combine all the measurements into the Bag of Word model and create unique action representations called Action Signatures?. These action signatures are then transformed and combined using feature fusion in order to learn the optimal combination of features for each action. Learning the optimal feature fusion is performed using Support Vector Machines. The final trained system is used to classify each new action. Results: the result section is divided into 2 sections. First the scientific data is used which is recorded in a testing room, simulating elderly home, with colleagues and students. We recorded and detected multiple actions: Bending, Walking, Falling, Collapsing, all with very high accuracy rates, above 93%. Finally real data is recorded in real elderly homes observing 4 elderly people. Different actions are monitored: Walking, Sitting, Open Door, and Eating. Results in a real environment depict high detection rates and prove that the system is able to detect multiple human actions using only one single camera.","Computer Vision; Healthcare Applications; Motion & Action Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Seck, M.D. (mentor); Ruijgh-van der Ploeg, M.P.M. (mentor)","2011","A well designed public transportation system can provide convenience to the public, increase the profit of the transportation company, and reduce the cost to the society as a whole. The depot is an important part in the study of transportation systems. The choice of the capacity of the depots is a strategic decision. It will constrain the possible tactical decisions (such as vehicle planning) for a long time, due to the life-span of the infrastructure. It is therefore important to study the impact of the options before they are implemented. The transportation company now is facing the problem that there is no appropriate tool in the decision support system to assess the capacity of the depots and the vehicle planning on the deadhead-kilometer (non-value added trips) and the robustess of the service. The simulation model is an appropriate method for the main part of the study. It can be used to evaluate the key performance indicators of deadhead-kilometer and average delay time, to study the complex interactions among the different elements, and to improve the understanding of the behaviors of the transportation system. The simulation model is useful for evaluating both strategic decisions and tactical decisions. The analyzing tool is designed following the methodology of systems engineering. First the requirements were gathered and translated into specification. The design was then conducted to fulfill the requirements on the conceptual level. Specification of the key classes were then concluded from their functionalities and relationships. The detail design came out with detailed attributions and methods of the classes. The analysis is based on a part of the network which consists of five service lines. According to the analysis, compared to the current design (Scheveningen, Zichtenburg and Lijsterbes), the future alternative with “Remise Zuid” depot and closing down “Lijsterbes” depot achieves 18% reduction on average delay time, but with a cost of 15% of increase in deadhead-kilometer. With the ratings obtained from the policy advisors of HTM, the alternative with “Remise Zuid” outperforms the design of current situation on the overall performance. Though the methodology applies to the entire network, the analysis results so far portaits the impact on these five lines. A more comprehensive study can be conducted with the same method and the input data covering all the operating lines. Some improvement can be made on the management of depots by a better the training of the employees and a clearer definition of job responsibilities.","rail transportation; depot planning; vehicle planning; discrete-event simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-22","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Moreover, the types and average number of niche markets change depending on the two product categorizations mentioned above. We also studied the sequences of niche market applications which appear prior to large-scale diffusion.

(mentor); Visser, A.A. (mentor)","2011","Problem statement A robot vacuum cleaner (rvc) offers a solution to maintain clean floors while saving the time and effort of cleaning. This benefit is most fully enjoyed when users let it clean during the time they are away from home. However, this requires the user to trust the robot being capable of cleaning (managing) completely autonomous. Many current users stay nearby when their robot is cleaning, and do not fully experience its benefit. Trust in the cleaning performance is therefore important to enhance in future models. Since the West European market of rvc is growing rapidly, the targeted users are ‘potential buyers’ that are still new to the concept. Winning over trust therefore aims at the first stages of interaction, including the time prior to purchase. Interaction is often based on posters, face value and communication of product’s specifications. In addition, trust should be enhanced by further usage. Trust is influenced by many factors. The experience was therefore framed in four key factors that can have dominant role in eliciting trust experience: Predictability, Familiarity, Confidence and Power. Trust experience is thereby approached as a dynamic, abstract framework that can adopt different values for each key factor. The framework is used to analyse why the product experience has a relation to trust, distinguishing different stages of user-product interaction and different mediums for communicating the product. Goal The goal of this project is to redesign an interaction concept that enhances trust in its cleaning performance. The project analyzed and hypothesized what factors elicit an enhanced experience. For verification, a prototype and model of the concept were used to test the enhancement with potential users. Methodology An explorative study firstly evaluated trust in a literary review. As a second part of this study, a generative session was used to explore trust enhancing product effects, and formulate design criteria. During the early stages of further concept development, the design criteria are refined with feedback obtained in two (potential) user sessions. For evaluation, the concept was verified in a qualitative research, based on semi-structured interviews. The test presented the design proposal by means of printed full-color renderings, a model and a mock-up of an interactive interface on a smart phone. Concept: The Wingman The interaction concept split its focus into two parts: characteristics of the aesthetic design of the robot, and feedback provided on a remote interface. In figure I, the design proposal and the prototype are shown. Conclusions The experience of trust in the cleaning performance is found to be a dominant in the overall product experience, during the first stages of interaction. An experience can be dominantly influenced by factors in the aesthetic design and feedback, to elicit trust in performance. They are further discussed in this thesis.","Robot Vacuum Cleaner; trust; interaction concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

This framework encompasses a structure of 4 different mission frames, the corporate, the brand, the model and the designer mission frame. Collectively they elucidate the styling mission of a car in a multi- brand portfolio. Herein each individual mission frame explains the factors involved in the styling of a car, by describing specific styling roles. Further study reveiled how the different mission frames, and especially the designers influence varies between different styling projects.

(mentor)","2011","This thesis focuses on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructural projects, in which PPPs entail Design Build Finance Maintain (and Operate), or DBFM(O) contracts. The main differences of such contracts with more traditional contracts is the establishment of a project-specific Special Purpose Company (SPC), the need for external financing and governmental payments based on the availability of the infrastructure; indeed, a long-term service contract (20-30 years) rather than a construction/product contract – illustrated in diagram 1 below. Diagram 1. Cash Flows DBFM-Contract versus DB+M contract The Dutch government, with infrastructural execution agency Rijkswaterstaat in particular, is ravenous for these DBFM-contracts, since it allows Rijkswaterstaat to transfer risks to the party who is best able to control them. Furthermore, these contract forms relieve Rijkswaterstaat from many responsibilities and duties while making use of market efficiency and the external discipline on the contractors by external financiers which would speed up the construction process and ensure as little maintenance will be performed as possible – since penalties are charged to the SPC for closing off roads. More importantly, Rijkswaterstaat argues that these contracts warrant a much higher Value for Money than more traditional contracts (e.g. Design & Build); either less costs for the same scope, or more scope for the same amount of money. Rijkswaterstaat bases this conclusion on two important decision instruments: ? The Public Private Comparator (PPC): This decision instrument is used for a preliminary comparison on the value of contract costs. Indeed this instrument is based on personal input, experiences and historical figures. With this instrument at least one PPP contract (e.g. DBFM) compared to at least one non-PPP contract (typically Design & Build). The instrument focuses on the design, construction and exploitation costs of the infrastructure but disregards the effects of external financing and therefore the availability based payment structure. A comparison of the Net Present Value of the costs for each contract determines the calculated “added value” of a particular contract – assuming the same project scope for each contract. In case the PPC indicates added value for the PPP contract a tender process on this contract form will be started. ? The Public Sector Comparator (PSC): The Public Sector Comparator is the determination of a benchmark versus the private PPP- bids in tender process. It estimates - to a greater detail than PPC - how much it would have cost (in net present value terms) the government to execute a project with the same scope as each of the private bids, but then using a non-PPP contract form (e.g. D&B). The private bids should always be lower than the PSC benchmark, else it will not be chosen. Rijkswaterstaat records the NPV difference between the PSC and the value agreed on in the final DBFM-contract as the “realized added value” of the DBFM contract. The issue here, is that both of these instruments are based on estimations rather than “hard facts”, making the use of the term “added value” to the PPP contracts disputable. RESEARCH GOAL Following from the latter, the main research goal of this thesis was to examine whether private financing increase the financial-economic Value for Money for infrastructural projects in the way Rijkswaterstaat expects. Since these expectations follow from the way the PSC and PPC work, and how they are used in the decision process, the following two sub-questions were tried to be answered: 1. Are the PPC and PSC based on valid assumptions and methods? 2. Is the decision process – from the PPC onwards – arranged in an appropriate way for selecting the optimal contract for infrastructural projects, from a governmental perspective? METHOD This thesis was made using the methodology of case study research. A common and robust way of doing research and conducting analyses in case study research is called triangulation, in which the researcher attempts to confirm facts by using different data sources from the same category (e.g. interviewing multiple persons, or comparing academic articles) in combination with data sources from other categories: in example confirming academic findings and governmental publications by means of conducting interviews with relevant people. Eventually, for this research sixteen expert interviews have been conducted, complemented by investigating governmental publications, confidential PPC & PSC reports and academic research in numerous papers on public finance and risk management. MAIN CONCLUSIONS After an intensive research process, the following set of main conclusions could be drawn up , indicating that private financing - as in PPP contracts - does not add value like the PPC and PSC decision instruments make Rijkswaterstaat believe: ? Misuse and (in)transparency of PPC & PSC : There is room for manipulation in both the PPC and PSC, since these instruments are based on subjective input and are undisclosed. ? Ignorance or underestimating costs of financing in PPC: The costs of financing are underestimated and more often completely ignored in the PPC. This result in a bias towards PPP-contracts, since these financing costs are substantial. ? Inappropriate discount rate in PPC & PSC: The discount rate used for calculating the net present value in both the PPC & PSC is unjustified; they include a risk spread which – due to the cost - makes riskier projects seem more attractive, leading to irrational decision making. ? The costs of scope changes, delays and uncertainties: The impact scope changes, delays and the occurrence of unforeseen risks have on the costs for Rijkswaterstaat in DBFM-contracts is much higher than for DB-contracts – due to higher transaction costs and external financing which imposes additional interest rate costs. This is however disregarded in both the PPC and PSC. ? Innovation & maintenance costs: Innovation as a result of market incentives is overstated for DBFM-contracts; engineering efficiencies would be a better term. The question to what extent the opportunity costs of network efficiencies in with regards maintenance reduce the efficiencies gained by innovation (or engineering). ? Misrepresentation of added value PSC versus PPC: The use of faulty discount rates, and the incorporation of different financial structures and other cost units, makes the comparison of calculated value between the PPC and the PSC unjust. The methodology in the instruments is completely different making “added value” comparisons irrelevant. ? De-central governments are less able to execute DBFM: Due to the fact that nationwide infra-projects are embedded in the so called MIRT program, infrastructural projects using a availability based payment structure suitable. Since smaller projects carried out by de-central governments are not embedded in the MIRT program, the financing of PPP contracts is much more problematic for budgetary reasons. ? Lack of competition and bad negotiation position: During both the contracting phase as well as the exploitation phase, there is a lack of competition (i.e. market efficiency) which negatively affects the negotiation position of Rijkswaterstaat. RECOMMENDATIONS With regards to solving the issues concluded above we propose the following recommendations (amongst others): ? Be careful with personal preferences in PPC/PSC interpretation and team selection ? Disclose PPCs and PSCs to the general public ? Attach greater importance to qualitative arguments in the PPC ? Do not overestimate the value of innovation in the PPC ? Decrease transaction costs of tender process by standardization ? Take charges on inflexibility and delays into account in valuation ? Take financial costs into account in PPC ? Try pilot project of asking double prices in tender process For the full set and explanation of conclusions and recommendations, I would like to refer to the original document.","PFI; PPS; PPP; Private Financing; Infrastructure; DBFM; DBFMO; Tender; MIRT; PPC; PSC; Public Private Comparator; Public Sector Comparator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-19","Technology, Policy and Management","SEPAM","","Policy, Organization, Law and Gaming","",""

(mentor)","2011","This graduation thesis aims to provide solutions for the improvement of the quality of estimations at the first stage (fuzzy front-end) of projects. In order to do so, three research questions were answered: How are the project front-end estimations currently made and by whom? What knowledge sources are used in the process of estimations and to what extent? And what are the main factors that make difficult the practice of front-end estimation and how can they be overcome? A qualitative research was carried out and four data collection methods were used: literature review, corporate archival records analysis, structured interviews and non-participatory observations. The research is carried out in the context of the Healthcare Imaging Systems industry; a sector that offers interesting characteristics for carrying out the proposed research. The study does an extensive exploration of how to improve the quality of estimations. A categorization scheme was developed to structure the discussions. It was found that obstacles and solutions can be divided in 6 major categories: Political, Organizational, Methodological, Technical, General and External. The study also has some limitations. The internal validity is limited at some extent due to the number of respondents. Results can hardly be generalized; however, they provide interesting insights as explained below. This limitation is compensated by the fact that all the interviewees possess extensive technical experience in the organization in addition to their managerial expertise thus providing a balanced mix between technical and managerial insights. Summarizing, the ultimate contribution of this research is to identify the main factors that hinder the practice of carrying out front-end estimations. By analyzing these issues and contrasting them with the good practices found in literature and in a complex environment like that of the Healthcare Imaging Systems sector, this study aims to shorten the research gaps mentioned above and contribute to the body of knowledge of project’s estimation. The main conclusions are that estimations in the context of this industry are carried out primarily using expert knowledge and standard times and that even though current estimations lead to the success of the organization, some opportunities of improvement were found. The high granularity and variety of the obstacles and solutions found in literature and in the empirics makes them quite precise, recognizable and addressable in the case study organization. However, it makes it difficult to consolidate them without losing valuable details.","estimation; project management; historical data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Management","","","",""

The trends point to further growth in the foreseeable future. However, the dynamic nature of the wireless channel places fundamental limitations on the performance of wireless communication system. Unlike wired channels, which are by-and-large stationary and predictable, wireless channels are extremely random and do not offer easy analysis. Therefore, in order to gain better system performance it is of great importance to accurately and efficiently map the wireless channels. Existing wireless channel models are based on statistical impulse response methods derived from empirical analysis. Such models employ a lot of channel coefficients which affect the complexity of computation. In this context the theory of wavelets and wavelet packets, which have recently found applicability for signal processing applications, hold the promise for wireless channel modeling. Wavelet packets offer the important feature of localization in both frequency and time domains. This property can be exploited to model channels with reduced complexity. In this thesis report, the applicability of wireless channel representation based on wavelet packet algorithm is addressed. The possibility of one-dimensional and two-dimensional wavelet packet algorithm for time-invariant and time-varying representation, respectively, is investigated. The results illustrating the efficiency of one-dimensional and two-dimensional approach are presented. To improve the performance of the proposed system, two optimization methods, namely coefficient reduction and tree pruning are implemented. Furthermore, the impact of the number of decomposition levels and the type of mother wavelet employed are also investigated. To measure the system performance, first and second order stochastic metrics such as Mean-square Error (MSE), Level-Crossing Rate (LCR) and correlation were employed.","Channel Modeling; Wireless Communication; Wavelet Packet Transform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor); Pommeranz, A. (mentor); Wiggers, P. (mentor); Van Auweraert, A. (mentor)","2011","This thesis presents the research on designing a decision support system for designing communication strategies. The importance of this topic comes from the idea that more academic knowledge from social sciences could be used in designing communication strategies. However, often those strategies are not designed by scholars. Therefore a way must be found to transfer knowledge from the academic field to practice. In this thesis it is believed that this can be done with help of a decision support system. The results of this thesis are guidelines on how to design such a decision support system. The theoretical framework of the design exists of three main topics. Design science, decision making and decision support systems. The first is addressed to become acknowledged with the way in which professional designers work. Most important findings are that especially in ill-defined problems the design process is not straightforward, switching between problem and solution occurs often. Furthermore a design is based on the stance of the designer, separate designers create different solutions to similar problems. Next, it was inquired how decisions are made and which parts of decision making could be supported. Thorough decision making is a very tedious and cognitive effort demanding task. Humans tend to shorten the decision process - consciously and unconsciously - by using all kinds of simplifications. It is expected that professional decision makers are more able to make tedious decisions, but still short-cuts in behaviour are found. As third, from the field of decision support system is found which systems already exist and which kinds of problems they address. Until now, not many systems have been designed to work in ill-defined areas like communication strategy design. The decision support system was designed by some of the intended end users under supervision of the researcher. The Public and Communication Department of the Dutch government, which arranges all government communication also found that using academic knowledge could improve the effectiveness of their campaigns. Therefore, they issued a request to two social scientists to write a body of knowledge specific for their needs. This is called the Communication Development Model [30]. For this research this was ideal, as a body of knowledge was needed as knowledge of the decision support system and participants were needed to design the system. Both were found at the Public and Communication Department of the Ministry of General Affairs. During several workshops the participants designed the system according to their needs. Care was taken by the researcher that the discussion was on a level which could be understood by non-computer specialists. Three main workshops were organised: during the first workshop the participants expressed their ideas by drawing on post-it notes and other paper; for the second workshops these ideas were translated to a paper prototype of the decision support system, this prototype was discussed with all participants; these ideas were implemented in a software prototype for the third workshop. The results from this last workshop were used to build a final prototype. However, it is not the prototype that is the result of this research but the guidelines that are found in the design process. Guidelines specifically for the design of decision support systems for designing communication strategies. Five guidelines have been stated as conclusion of this research: involve the user in the design, show the complexity of the task, give support not answers, enforce justification of decisions and keep the work area small.","communication; science communication; human-machine interaction; participatory design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Science Education and Communication","","Science Communication","",""

(mentor); Nikookar, H. (mentor)","2011","Wavelet Packet based Multi-Carrier Modulation (WPM) offers an alternative to the well-established Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as an efficient multicarrier modulation technique. It has strong advantage of being generic transmission scheme whose actual characteristics can be widely customized to fulfill several requirements and constraints of advanced communication systems. In the last decades wavelets have been favorably applied in signal and image processing fields but they just recently attracted attention of the telecommunication community. Therefore, some research questions remain to be addressed before novel WPM can be used in practice. One of the major concerns involves the performance of WPM transceivers under various synchronization errors. In this thesis we analyze the interference in WPM transmission caused by the carrier frequency offset and time synchronization errors. Using standard wavelets, the sensitivity of WPM transceivers to these errors is evaluated through simulation studies and their performances are compared and contrasted to OFDM. To alleviate the WPM‘s vulnerability to time synchronization errors, a method of synchronization is proposed. The proposed time synchronization method in WPM is based on already published feed-forward decision-directed approach which uses correlation method in the wavelet domain (after processed by the analysis filter bank in the receiver side), with lower implementation complexity and improved stability. The proposed method can be considered as “coarse” time synchronization, suitable for estimating large time offset but with less precision. Through computer simulations the performance of the proposed method is proven and further its performance is compared for different parameters of wavelet filters.","Wavelet Packet Modulation; Synchronization; MLDD Algorithm; M&M Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

It is recognized as being a dynamic area of the nearshore region, characterized by strong and unsteady flows, high turbulence levels, large sediment transport rates and morphological changes on a small timescale. Due to the complexity of the processes taking place in the swash zone, there are still great uncertainties about the driving forces for sediment transport. Morphodynamic process-based numerical models tend to overestimate the seaward directed sediment transport in the swash zone, especially for mild wave conditions. The main objective of this thesis is to obtain insight in the hydrodynamic processes responsible for sediment transport in the swash zone, and to use this knowledge to optimize a morphodynamic numerical model (XBeach) for simulating swash zone physics. First, an extensive literature review is carried out to provide the physical base. Second, a number of (theoretical) linear profile simulations are conducted to provide insight into the simulated swash characteristics for different beach states, and to assess the effect of including a number of swash processes (e.g. turbulence or groundwater flow) in the simulations.

(mentor)","2011","In the current radio planning of wireless cellular networks, analysis of system performance is based on Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). However, for wideband system such as LTE, the performance depends not only on the SNR but also on the amount of frequency and spatial diversity that the system can exploit. These diversities rely on the delay and angular profile of the radio channel which are often quantified in terms of delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS). From an operator’s point of view, in order to get reliable prediction of network capacity and coverage, delay spread and angular spread should therefore be taken into account in the radio planning. In this thesis, the effect of delay spread and angular spread on LTE system performance is investigated by performing LTE system level simulations. LTE system level simulation models AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding) hence it aligns with how the system works in reality. However, to implement AMC, system level simulation needs an accurate prediction of link level performance in terms of BLER. For this reason, AWGN link level simulation is required. The simulation results show that different delay spread values do not significantly affect the performance of LTE. This indicates that delay spread is not an important parameter to be taken into account in LTE radio planning. On the other hand, first result shows that per path angular spread strongly affects the performance of LTE. This suggests that it should be included in the radio planning of LTE.","delay spread; angular spread; AMC; LTE performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Cognitive radio (CR) is an approach with high potentials in the effort of battling spectrum scarcity, introduced by J. Mitola in the late 90’s. It is capable of sensing the communication environment and adapting to it by changing its radio parameters. Beamforming technique allows the cognitive users to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum without interfering the licensed users by exploiting the spatial domain in the radio transmission. Distributed beamforming is a new concept to form communication beams by utilizing the distributed wireless nodes in order to transmit signals towards a distant destination. Applying distributed beamforming to the cognitive radio system gives the flexibility to the system, since the CR nodes are treated as virtual antenna arrays. CR also improves the lifespan of each node because the communication signal is generated in a distributed manner. This advantage of CR aligns with the principal of green communication which has the objective of less energy consumption. Power efficiency area is a particular field of interest in the cognitive radio domain, where cognitive nodes are small battery-powered devices, distributed randomly in an area. Optimal number of nodes selection is proposed in this thesis to optimize the power usage in the implementation of distributed beamforming in cognitive radio networks. The selection is based on the requirements of the primary licensed user in order to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of the licensed user’s link. Recent works on the distributed beamforming field describe that the average beampattern shows a deterministic result and the mainlobe is independent of the particular node locations when the number of utilized nodes is considered as very large. However, for finite number of nodes, the beampattern does depend on the number of nodes and the way they are selected. In this thesis research, an approach is presented for deciding the number of nodes for distributed beamforming. Furthermore, several novel node selection algorithms such as Euclidean based, sector based, ring range, and circle range are proposed and their performances are studied in detail in this thesis work. In these entire schemes, the precise locations of distributed nodes of CR are needed. Further in this thesis, location errors of CR nodes and destination are taken into consideration. Its impact on the generated beampattern of the selected nodes is reported. The results show which of the proposed methods are more robust to the location information error of the CR nodes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","IRCTR","",""

(mentor)","2011","Air conditioning is one of the major consumers of electrical energy in many parts of the world. The demand can be expected to increase because of the changing working times, increased comfort expectations and global warming. With more air conditioning units, the electricity demand has been rising thereby increasing the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy. A drastic change, therefore, should be implemented in the energy structure of the developed countries. Environmentally friendly and energy efficient technologies should be introduced in which the environmental impact of the conventional air conditioning system is minimized. Solar radiation as a sustainable energy resource is one of the most available forms of energy on the earth surface which could reduce the fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emission to the atmosphere. Solar cooling is a possible technological alternative to conventional air conditioning systems that has recently attracted a growing interest. A solar assisted absorption cooling system as a sustainable solution for cooling systems could provide both heating and cooling of a building. Since the solar energy is available for only a fraction of the day and its availability depends on several factors such as latitude and sky clearness, the storage of it is an important concern. Thermal energy storage is a practical way in conserving the solar energy as it can reduce the discrepancy between the energy supply and demand. Latent heat storage units (LHSU) using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are promising candidates as heat storage media. In this thesis, the behavior of a solar assisted single effect absorption system integrated with LHSU was investigated. The mathematical model for the single effect absorption system and the LHSU based on the mass and energy balances and heat transfer equations were developed. The models were implemented in MATLAB and the numerical results were validated with the experimental results from the literature. Based on the cooling demand of a specific building (waiting room in Schiphol airport) the absorption system and the LHSU were designed and the behavior of each system for different control parameters is investigated. For the designed single effect absorption system, variation of the COP and the evaporator heat transfer rate at the different flow rates and temperatures of the external cool water, hot water and the chilled water were studied. The results show that the chilled, hot and cooled water temperatures have significant effect on the performance of the absorption system. For the designed latent heat storage, several numerical investigations were conducted. The impact of the key parameters e.g. the mass of PCM, the number of tubes inside the PCM container and the radius of the tubes, on the thermal performances of the latent heat storage and the melting time duration were studied. The behavior of the designed latent heat storage unit in charging process with varying solar collector field area was studied subsequently. The discharging process of LHSU for the maximum cooling demand of the building was investigated. It was observed that the designed LHSU could provide the requested hot water temperature for more than 10 hours which is sufficient for driving the air conditioning system.","Air conditioning; Solar; Absorption; Latent Heat Storage; Phase Change Material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Davis, C. (mentor); Ravesteijn, W. (mentor)","2011","Energy and the environment are major issues of discussion in the last years. Security of energy supply in the future is questionable, as energy reserves are depleting. Moreover, damage has been caused to the environment by human actions. Therefore, sustainability has become a major challenge. Scientists and researchers around the world are dedicated to research towards a more sustainable future. However, thinking and working in parts is not always the best way to tackle problems. Integration is a promising idea, which can assist towards accomplishing energy and sustainability goals. Integration is oriented towards systems thinking and can be defined as the combination of energy sources, energy production methods and technologies as well as of the research and policy sectors, aiming at sustainable development. There have been distinguished 6 forms of integration in (Hemmes, 2009) and, based on the work on this thesis, 9 categories of integration have been defined in total: integration of components into a system, integration of energy sources into multi-source multi-product energy systems, integration of industries into ecoparks (Industrial Ecology), integration of new technology into existing technology, integration of sectors, integration of functions, integration of sites, integration of renewable energy into products, integration of sustainability into energy systems design. Multiple examples are given for each category of integration. Literature research as well as a free brainstorming session were used in order to retrieve as many examples as possible. The categorization of integration options was examined from three different points of view: definitions, scale and ownership. The various effects that integration might have are a matter of discussion as well. As it was pointed out, integration can lead to innovative ideas and creative solutions, the generation of niche markets, the creation of new regimes, the introduction of new technology, without renouncing the old one, and the decreased dependence on conventional forms of energy. However, acceptance of new products and regimes is questionable, and the cooperation and responsibility sharing between various parties is also important to consider. Moreover, it is possible that integration will lead to more complex systems and higher product costs or even create ‘lock-ins’ for the further penetration of renewable energy. Nonetheless, in order to enhance the positive results of integration, the way that research is organized needs to change. It is proposed that international cooperation is increased and multidisciplinary teams are created, in order for more communication between researchers to take place. Funding is considered to be crucial. Additionally, the connection between research and applications and the provision of motivation to the private sector are essential. Focus is given on one integration category, namely the multi-source multi-product energy systems. Multi-source multi-product systems (MSMP) are energy systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Inputs in MSMP systems can be renewable or conventional forms of energy. Outputs may also vary: electricity, hydrogen, heating power, cooling power, etc. MSMP energy systems have a lot of advantages, among which the increase of energy efficiency, the reduction of CO2 emissions, the facilitation of renewable energy penetration, the reliability of energy supply, and the flexible utilization of the energy carriers. A category of MSMP energy systems are the hybrid energy systems, which have a combination of renewable and non-renewable energy carriers as input. The interface between the inputs and the outputs of a MSMP or hybrid energy system is the energy hub, where direct transmission, conversion or storage of energy takes place. MSMP energy systems can be studied in two ways: the first option is to choose a flowsheet software and the second option is to construct the conversion matrix of the system. The conversion matrix is a matrix which shows how the inputs of the system are transformed into its outputs. Two different ways of constructing the conversion matrix of the system will be presented and evaluated. It was proved that the approach presented in (Geidl, 2007) was far broader and easy to use, and was thus preferred by the majority of scientists in the field. In order to get more insight on integration and MSMP energy systems, a hybrid energy system is studied. The energy system under study derives from the integration of solar thermal energy and a conventional combined cycle power plant (Integrated Solar Combined Cycle or ISCC). In such a power plant, the solar heat is used at the steam turbine cycle and not at the higher combined cycle efficiency. In this thesis, the ISSC power plant is studied by applying the superheating principle and by using a software developed by TU Delft, CycleTempo. The superheating principle is actually the heating of the steam into a higher temperature, before it enters the steam turbine. The results of the model show that superheating of the steam, at the point of the power cycle where the steam exits the heat recovery system, has a positive effect on the system’s efficiency. However solar tower or dish solar thermal technology should be chosen for the solar field in this case, since they can reach higher temperatures than the parabolic mirrors. ISCC power plants around the world are presented as well. Some of these plants are newly constructed, whereas in other cases the combined cycle power plant existed in advance. Moreover, in the ISCC projects so far, a lot of different parties have cooperated, sometimes not without problems. Therefore, a stakeholder analysis is carried out, which shows the relations between the actors and stakeholders, their interests and the critical points which need special attention during the integration procedure. It is observed that in all cases a similar approach is followed and the consistency of the stakeholder group does not change much. Additionally, interviews with people that participated in integration processes were carried out, in order to gain additional information. The interviews validated the stakeholder analysis results and gave insight to the integration procedure. The main policy advices that emerged from the stakeholder analysis are that, first of all, the problem owner should have a clear vision of what they want to achieve and, secondly, that the thorough knowledge of all the aspects of the situation at hand and a diligent risk analysis can prevent future problems. Integration offers various options for the utilization of renewable energy sources. Our hypothesis is that integration can accelerate the penetration of renewable energy sources and lead the way of transition to energy production based totally on renewable energy sources. This argument is elaborated on in the final chapter of the thesis. It is found out that although integration is a valuable tool in the penetration of renewable energy, it should definitely be supported with additional policies.","integration; sustainability; integration options; multi-source multi-product energy systems; solar thermal energy; renewable energy sources; stakeholder analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology Dynamics and Sustainable Development","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor); Goverde, R.M.P. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); Le Mandat, G. (mentor)","2011","The Paris metro network operated by RATP is well-known all over the world for its complexity and high level of efficiency. Since most of its equipment dates back from the 1970’s, it is undergoing an important modernisation plan, among which the renewal of all the equipment involved in traffic control, both on the lines and in terminals, within the Operational Control Centres (PCC). This new PCC system has now been implemented on lines 13 and 3, and although the operators of those lines are generally pleased with the technical features of the new PCC, they remain somewhat doubtful regarding its efficiency on automatic traffic regulation. The objective of this project was to detect if indeed those mixed feelings were founded by studying the specifications of the new system as well as its impact on operations through an analysis of the operational data. Although it was not a primary objective of the PCC project, it is hoped that this new system can help improve traffic regulation performance, and through this the overall quality of passenger service which is very much related to how regular the traffic of a metro line is. Public transport in Ile-de-France is governed by the public authority STIF. Every four years, a new contract is signed between STIF and RATP regarding operations in the metro network. This contract defines the total number of kilometres that need to be produced every day of the year on each line, but it also sets quality indicators among which two are directly related to traffic regularity: passenger waiting time and production during peak hours, the latter having been introduced in 2008. Production and quality of service are rewarded or penalized financially. RATP therefore has strong incentives to both produce the contractual number of train*kilometres, but also to ensure a regular traffic on their line. In order to operate the lines according to those contracts, theoretical timetables are built according to a number of constraints such as headways to be implemented, running times, dwell times, buffer times at terminals. Although those timetables are never communicated to the passengers who are only given the maximum waiting time depending on the time of day, they are the basis of operations in the metro lines. In reality, it is almost impossible for the metro lines to respect those theoretical timetables because of all the incidents, but also because it is very difficult to predict the time needed to be spent at stations. With more passengers, the trains needs to stay longer in stations, thus creating additional delay on the whole line. The later a train is, and thus the more space there is between it and the previous train, the more passengers will be waiting for it, and the more time it will have to stay in the stations. The traffic on a metro line as busy as the ones in the Paris metro network are therefore highly unstable and a single incident can completely disrupt the traffic on the whole line for a very long time. This is especially true of lines where trains are running very close to each other (down to 95s at peak hours on line 13). Because of this, it is very important to implement the appropriate regulation strategies. At RATP, the main objective of the regulation actions is to maintain a regular interval between trains at departure and on the lines while still trying to recover from delay in terminals. Before the new PCC system was implemented, traffic on the line was overseen by the traffic controllers who were all located in the Bourdon building and used button-control panels, while departures from terminals was overseen by the departure chief in the terminals. In the new system, not only have the equipment been renewed, operations on the line have also been re-organised and the regulation strategies are now the responsibility of the computerized system. Traffic regulation on the line is still the responsibility of the traffic controller, but he is now located at the decentralised PCC, closer to the lines. With him are also the two terminal managers who now oversee all train movements in their terminals from the PCC. As for the calculation of departure times, whereas it was before the role of the departure chief, it is now the computer that calculates them according to the general decision made by the terminal manager who can choose between a no-regulation mode, a constant headway mode and a recovery mode. The latter is based on the former strategy that consisted in distributing the delay among trains in order to ensure regular departures in the line when there was a disruptive train causing delay at departure, and headway reduction in order to recover from the delay when the disruption has disappeared. When it is not possible anymore to recover from delay with those recalculation methods, namely because the accumulated delay is too important, the last resort of the terminal manager is to cancel some departures, thus leading to the so-called “lost laps for schedule compensation”. After studying the specifications of the algorithm for the calculation of departure times, it was concluded that they were in line with RATP’s requirements. However, those requirements date back from almost ten years ago, and the needs of the line operators have evolved ever since then, especially with the introduction of the “production during peak hours” criteria, which might already explain the mixed feelings of the operator regarding the system’s regulation functions. Although the operators are not completely satisfied with the system’s performance, it needs to be stressed out that they are overall quite happy with the new equipment. Furthermore, the new organisation ensures a much better communication between the various actors of traffic regulation which is much appreciated. However, traffic controller do feel a loss at being now separated from the other lines, and the terminal managers at being separated from their terminals for they do not have direct communication with the drivers anymore. As for the actual impacts of the system on operations, it was possible to conduct a performance evaluation using the operational data provided by the IGT and OSIRIS software, specifically developed for RATP. Among the various methods that were considered for this data analysis, the most efficient one was to assess the number of lost laps for schedule compensation as opposed to the number of incidents, or to the total delay on the line per day. Indeed, on days with the same amount of delay, more cancelled departures mean that the system is not able to recover from delay alone, and is therefore less efficient. Various periods before and after the implementation of the new system were thus compared. The first conclusion of this study was overall that the situation on the lines had not particularly been improved with the implementation of the new system, neither had it worsened. Although this conclusion is already quite satisfactory, as it was never an objective to improve the operational results of the lines, it still needs to be taken into context. Indeed, the operational environment of the lines nowadays are very different from what they were even 5 years ago for the passenger flows and the number of scheduled trains have increased, and other modernisation project have been or are being implemented at this time. It is very likely that the old system would not have been capable of handling those changes, and would not have had as good operational results as the ones observed with the new system. Unfortunately, this is only a guess that can never truly be verified. It was also observed on both lines 13 and 3 than the implementation of the new system was always followed by very difficult periods for the operators and that problems regarding parameterization had occurred quite often, especially on line 3. A simple model of the calculation of the algorithm on line 3 was thus built in order to try and study the impact of parameter changes. The outcome of this study was not only that a more precise calibration of parameters was necessary to improve the efficiency of the system, but also that the main calculation of the algorithm could very well be modified in order to better fit the evolving needs of the lines. A first recommendation for the improvement of the system is therefore to conduct a more extended study on this option. Furthermore, the specific characteristics of the lines and the evolving needs and structures should be better taken into account. Finally, another improvement could come from a better training and support of the operator who, as it is, does not have a good enough level of understanding of the system, which leads to misinterpretations and misuse on his part.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Well-known navigation services, such as TomTom, Garmin and Google Navigation, are dominating the market for outdoor, road based navigation. The fact that such applications are able to determine a location on a platform has always fascinated the author. Simple location determination is further utilized in specialized applications and functions, such as SportyPal, which logs the movements and interpolates several units, or the geotagging of photos. And so, this further piqued the interest to investigate matters in the indoor environment, as one has to look beyond what one sees. However, navigation as a word can also be used as a metaphor to describe one man’s life journey. How can one navigate as a human being? On the paths of life, one has to navigate through a web of complicated matters by fulfilling expectations and by making decisions that will influence your future. Decisions might be based on past experience and/or knowledge, there is no ‘turn back’ option, and things might heavily alter the path of life in unforeseen circumstances, both positive and negative. Navigation is then based on the abstract level. The author, too, almost navigated towards another direction.

(mentor); Nikookar, H. (mentor)","2011","Cooperative communication is a technique to use nodes in the wireless network as relays to forward information to the destination. Cooperative communication technique relies on the relay selection and power allocation process to optimize its performance since not all available nodes are beneficial to use for forwarding. Game theory is a branch of mathematics theory which tries to model the behavior of a player in strategic situation, or games, when dealing with other players’ choices. In the cooperative communication networks, the game theoretical approach has been shown to be a good means to solve the relay selection and resource allocation problems which have multiple objectives. In this thesis we analyze the relay selection and resource allocation using pricing game in a cooperative wireless communication network with interference. Using simulation results we show that interference affects the relay selection and resource allocation process. From the relay selection result we also find that the number of selected relay nodes influences the optimization process and when the number of selected nodes is large, the source node significantly suffers from payment to relay nodes. We propose an algorithm to limit the number of selected relay nodes and to keep the benefit of the source node. We also propose an evolutionary game approach for resource allocation in cooperative wireless networks. The method has flexibility in optimizing the system based on preferred objectives. The evolutionary game approach is based on evolutionary programming, where the behavior of each node is modeled to mimic the biological evolution process. Results of this study can be used in a wide range of wireless sensor networks where power, bandwidth, and other resource constraints are present. The proposed scheme provides a flexible relay node selection given the resource constraints of the wireless network.","Cooperative Communication; Game Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","People invest in projects to make a profit. If the cost of investment is larger than the revenue, a rational person would not invest. Though these two statements may seem trivial, the reality is that it is often difficult to know what the expected costs and payoffs are. Like with any prediction in the future, there is always a level of uncertainty. The amount of available literature which qualitively deals with risk, greatly outnumbers the available literature on quantitative risk. Through mathematic modelling, we can attempt to quantify this uncertainty and bring it to a minimum. In addition, this allows us to find an optimal investment strategy (Should we invest now? And if so, how much? Or should we invest later or drop the project altogether?). The relevance and importance of such a strategy is obvious to anyone considering investing into a project whether it is in researching a new medicine, planning construction for a new library or producing a new electronics device. Though each mentioned example deals with different types of project-specific problems, it will become apparent that the model we find has a wide range of application. This paper is divided into three parts. First there is a finance part which gives some background information and applies stochastic calculus to derive the main equation for investment opportunities. In the second part, the equation is solved numerically, and the role of the various parameters is discussed. This is then applied to a fictional company considering a large investment project.","investment; linear complementarity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-17","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Inter-organizational collaboration for new product development is increasing all over the world due to soaring Research and Development costs, and the uncertainties posed by the new technological products and processes, companies are reluctant to spend all their in-house resources and are searching for new strategies for innovation , like inter-firm technological collaborations. The main advantages of such collaboration are as follows:  Strategic planning  Risk and Cost sharing,  Alternative technological solutions,  Complementary resources,  Joint learning But there are certain disadvantages that are related to inter-organizational collaboration, some of which are as follows:  Suppression of alternative R&D pathways;  The risk of creating dependencies between parties;  The risk of leakage of proprietary knowledge(strategic Intellectual Property) through other partners Intellectual Property is a strategic asset to a company not only providing technological competence, but also increases the reputation of the company along with the provision of tradable assets. Hence nurturing and protection of IP is very crucial for an industry to excel in its field. But inter-organizational collaboration create a paradoxical situation regarding IP, as all partners wish to expose as little of their in-house IP for new product development but reap the IP benefits of the developed product as much as possible. The main focus of the master thesis is on the risk of leakage of propriety knowledge, which relates to the IPR management in inter-organizational collaboration. The scope of the thesis in focussed on the contract negotiations process that leads to a developer agreement between the collaborating parties for a new product development. The main objective of the research is to manage the conflicting situation of cooperation and competition in collaborative projects with the development of a process design for IPR management during contract negotiations. The research is based on a framework called the 'Design Science‘ approach. The design science is an iterative process that takes business needs of the organization as an input to build a solution or recommendation, based on the knowledge base available on the state-of-the art methods, and which is to be improvised(which will be the scientific/research contribution) to tackle the specific problem/s of the organization. The developed solution (which is referred as design) is evaluated and refined based on the evaluation results After the research overview is presented, the case-study provided by the Company A is discussed in detail, and the various challenges faced in that real time collaborative project are studied and taken as an input for designing a process for contract negotiations Several interviews with IP Managers, project managers and Engineers were conducted to identify the business needs of the Company A with respect to the IPR management related to the contract negotiations in collaborative projects for new product development with external partners. Also a comprehensive literature search was performed to have a knowledge base of the requirements for a successful IPR management not only limited to contract negotiations. Based on the pointers received in these interviews and references from literature a comprehensive survey was conducted among several employees in various global offices of company A to test the generality or locality of the problems related to IPR management, and several key factors were identified as the most influential criteria for IPR Management in contract negotiation, which are as follows: The IP Organizational structure of Company A  IP Awareness of the Project team members that are involved in the contract negotiations  Trust and common Understanding together with Due Diligence The relevance of these criteria to contract negotiations is explained in detail, with further knowledge from literature and exploration of the actual scenario in the business environment , with the help of workshops, questionnaires etc. After gathering insights from the literature and the exercises in the business environment, a process design is developed for IPR Management in contract negotiations. The process design is based on the design science framework and hence requires continual improvisation. Hence the design and evaluation of the process is not sudden but iterative. The first process design illustrating the base line process which is improvised to a desired process for contract negotiations, which is further improvised to a process with role descriptions, and this model is finally improvised to a comprehensive BPMN model. Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) is a global standard to design business processes and activities. At each of the improvisation iterations, the model is evaluated and the feedback received is incorporated in the subsequent iteration and the final process design is evaluated in the same way along with its effect on the key factors identified. The final process is divided into four stages such as  Estimation Phase  Preparation Phase  Negotiation Phase  Execution Phase These phases are explained in detail in order to address the problems identified in the beginning of the research and are designed to be adherent to fulfil the identified criteria such as IP awareness, Trust etc. The concluding chapter provides answers to the research questions posed in the beginning of the report, and concludes the master thesis with the following recommendations to the company A. The Organizational structure of Company A has to be made visible, supportive and top-down in nature, with the involvement of at least few high level administrative personnel  The IP awareness among Engineers has to be increased with training programs, IP Coaches, workshops and job rotation  The importance of trust and common understanding with due diligence has to be emphasized heavily among the project team members involved in collaborative projects with external partners and they should be trained in negotiation skills  Project plans should be modified to allot specific time and resources for IPR Management during for the contract negotiations, and the documentation of the process has to be standardized , in order to simplify the task for a new project team that takes over the project.","New Product Development; Intellectual Property Rights Management; Contract negotiations; Design science","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-23","Technology, Policy and Management","TBM","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Companies look for agility in their business for flexibility and adaptation with respect to changing environments. They seek to make use of the market competencies and deliver customer-centric services to gain the competitive advantage by providing a one-stop mall where customers can experience several kinds of integrated services. With the opportunity of Integrated Service Delivery (ISD), companies can support clients in an integrated environment possibly reducing cost and time. Doing so, service providers face a number of challenges related to organizational integration, resistance towards change and being customer-centric. With a structured process, collaboration and coordination of activities in ISD can be efficient, reducing the complexities in those challenges. Research has shown adoption of Agile methodologies has reduced complexities in software development and focused on collaboration and coordination to achieve performance gain. Therefore, in this case, adopting Agile management principles will be highly beneficial in ISD. To the best of our knowledge there has not been research on how to manage the service lifecycle of ISD in a holistic view and focus on the collaboration of parties involved in the process and coordination of activities, by working in an Agile approach. Therefore, the main research question of this research is: ""How can Agile management and service development principles be incorporated together for effective collaboration between parties and coordination of activities in Integrated Service Delivery?"" Following a design science research methodology and case study research, this research was conducted to develop a conceptual process model, namely Agile Process for Integrated Service Delivery (APISD), which was evaluated by three cases conducted in three organizations. From the case study findings, the APISD model was enhanced. Furthermore, an illustration of APISD was given to materialize the model in practice.","Agile Methodology; Integrated Service Delivery; Scrum; Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Information and Communication Technology","",""

Therefore a lot of research is being performed to the inuence of atmospheric conditions on the aerodynamic and structural behavior of wind turbines. Typical atmospheric conditions that are relevant for wind turbine design are gusts, vertical velocity shear, direction change and turbulence.

(mentor); Heuck, F.C.A. (mentor)","2011","This master thesis is conducted as a part of the PhD research of Hugo Perez and Friedjof Heuck. In this work a method is proposed and tested to remove nanometer-sized particles from, for example, mask-blanks used in EUVL. The working principle of the removal tool – let us call it a nano-swiffer – are the adhesion forces of a PDMS pyramid. This pyramid is fabricated by vacuum casting and the advantage of this is the use of moulds, such that in an economical way multiple pyramids can be made. One mould consists of thousands recessed pyramids resulting in a stamp with a negative copy of these pyramids. The goal of this master thesis is to design and fabricate a silicon mould, and with this mould fabricate and inspect the PDMS stamp. Stamps with different mechanical properties are produced – by changing the process parameters of the fabrication process of PDMS – in order to find the best properties to remove contamination. The influences of the different process parameters are inspected and discussed. Furthermore, several inspection methods and its equipment are discussed. Finally, AFM is chosen as inspection method to inspect the radius of the apex of pyramids and its stiffness. This decision is based on the results gathered during practical hands-on. The results of the inspections shows that after each casting traces of PDMS are left behind in the mould, resulting in descending radiuses of the apex. A recommendation to this problem is proposed in the manner of a release layer. The analyses of data acquired with the stiffness measurements shows that an increase in curing agent in the composition of PDMS results in an higher stiffness. Further, by accident, an increase in stiffness is noted as older the PDMS gets. This process is called aging. This could be important if a soft pyramid is needed; within a week, the stiffness is increased by 20%. In addition, the influence of the curing temperature is observed and the conclusion is that by an increase in curing temperature, an increase in stiffness is noted; PDMS cured at 120° C had a 51% higher stiffness than PDMS cured at room temperature. A setup for bonding a PDMS pyramid to an AFM-cantilever is made, but unfortunately, there were some pitfalls. It turned out that cutting out individual pyramids was fairly cumbersome. Interaction forces made it very hard to handle the pyramids such that it was pointing the right direction. On the other hand, the oxygen plasma bonding process was successful. Due to the troublesome cutting process, the final cleaning setup could not be tested such that useful conclusions could be drawn. Alternative, more complicated cutting processes are proposed, like focussed ion beam.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

This technique is inspired by techniques commonly used in temperature sensors based on bipolar transistors. While it leads to higher temperature errors than existing electrical techniques, which use the linear relationship between voltage and temperature at a fixed current, the proposed technique has the potential to significantly reduce calibration costs, as it requires calibration at only one temperature instead of two for existing techniques. Measurements of commercial high-power LEDs show that temperature errors can be reduced by using differential measurements around a fixed voltage-bias point instead of the more commonly used fixed current-bias point.","light-emitting diode; led; temperature; measurement; junction; diode; differential","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory","",""

(mentor); Van Daalen, E. (mentor)","2011","This research analyzes the effect of market differences between advanced and emerging economies on the diffusion of alternative vehicle platforms (AVPs). A system dynamics simulation model was built and used to explore this transition case. This model considers two generic regions resembling advanced and emerging economies, and three generic vehicle platforms: incumbent platform (gasoline vehicles), hybrid platform (hybrid-gasoline vehicles) and radical platform (electrical vehicles). In addition, the model considers the interaction of several feedback mechanisms (Social Learning, R&D, Learning by Doing, Network Externalities and Scale Economies); as well as technical factors of the vehicle platforms, consumers’ preferences and car manufacturers’ behaviour. The analysis of several simulation experiments shows that market differences between advanced and emerging economies can influence diffusion patterns of AVPs in three main ways: First, the difference between the income level of consumers of advanced and emerging economies creates a systematic delay in the diffusion of AVPs in emerging economies. As a result, hybrid-gasoline vehicles diffuse earlier in advanced economies than in emerging economies. The diffusion of hybrid-gasoline vehicles in the advanced economies enhances its diffusion in the emerging region due to a global reduction in their purchasing prices and due to their technical improvement. Second, the difference in speed of growth of each region’s vehicle market has the potential of creating a strong market niche for electrical vehicles in the emerging region. In advanced economies, electrical vehicles find strong barriers. On the one hand, consumers driving gasoline or hybrid-gasoline vehicles are more reluctant to adopt the unknown developing electrical vehicles. On the other hand, the growth of the vehicle market is expected to hardly grow. Thus, in advanced economies most vehicle sales are replacement sales. In the emerging region, the opposite occurs, the vehicle market grows steadily and high number of vehicle sales are from consumers that for the first time purchase a vehicle. First time vehicle buyers do not favour any particular vehicle, thus there are greater chances that they adopt AVPs if these meet their economic and proficiency criteria. As a result, electrical vehicles find a strong market niche in emerging economies, which can compensate for the stagnation of the vehicle market in advanced economies. However, how this market niche is exploited depends significantly on consumers’ preferences and consumers’ familiarity with AVPs. In this regard, if consumers only consider the vehicle’s purchasing price in their adoption decisions, the transition towards AVPs becomes less likely, especially in emerging economies. On the contrary, if consumers consider in a more balanced way all the attributes of a vehicle (e.g. purchasing price, cost of fuel, fuel efficiency and driving range), the transition towards electrical vehicles becomes more likely in both regions. In this case, emerging economies can inject a strong impulse to the global diffusion of electrical vehicles. Third, differences in consumers’ preferences between both regions can significantly influence diffusion patterns. On the one hand, if consumers in advanced economies are interested in vehicles’ proficiency and consumers in emerging economies are only interested in vehicles’ purchasing price. Then, in advanced economies, hybrid-gasoline vehicles penetrate this market at high levels, but electrical vehicles stagnate. In emerging economies, the hybrid-gasoline vehicles penetrate at modest levels due to the impulse received by its diffusion in advanced economies, but electrical vehicles fail. In this case, conventional gasoline vehicles benefit from the growing vehicle market in emerging economies. On the other hand, if consumers in emerging economies are proficiency oriented and consumers in advanced economies have a purchasing price orientation. Then, advanced economies lag behind in the diffusion of AVPs. In emerging economies, the diffusion of AVPs is also delayed due to the lack of the initial impulse of advanced economies. However, in this case, electrical vehicles find a strong market niche in emerging economies and penetrate this market at high levels. It also has been found that if R&D resources are early allocated to AVPs, both the car manufacturers and the consumers discover earlier the potential of the each vehicle platform. This reduces the initial systematic disadvantages of AVPs against gasoline vehicles, increasing the possibilities of their global diffusion. It has also been found that if the development potential of the three vehicle platforms is comparable, then market differences have a strong influence in the diffusion of AVPs. However, the more unbalanced the development potential of the three vehicle platforms is, the less determinant market differences become. This research shows that the process of diffusion of AVPs can be enriched and strengthened if it is seen as a complementary process between advanced and emerging economies. Policy areas of concern are the support to the R&D of AVPs, the development of fuelling infrastructure for electrical vehicles and the encouragement of consumers to consider in a more balanced way all vehicle’s attributes in their adoption decisions.","Alternative Vehicles; Sustainability; Technology Transitions; System Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-16","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","MSc Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2011","Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative condition of the macula, which results in a loss of vision. AMD is a common contributor to vision loss in adults over the age of 50. In Western countries, AMD affects nearly 30% of the individuals over the age of 75. In the Rotterdam Eye Hospital an experimental surgical procedure has been developed to cure patients suffering from this disease. However there are still various problems associated with it. This thesis presents an instrument prototype, to be used in this surgical procedure, which would overcome these shortcomings. The working principle of the instrument presented is the “Indirect Heat Induced Attachment and Detachment (HIAD)” principle which has been developed at the BioMedical Engineering Department, at Faculty of 3mE, TU Delft. It is a heat based principle in which short heat pulses are used to attach/detach a tissue graft during the surgical procedure. During the course of this thesis, the feasibility of a micro machined device (based on the HIAD Principle) is tested. Numerical simulations have been done to understand what happens when heat pulses are given by a heater placed on the instrument to penetrate into the tissue. Tissue damage due to heat is a major concern and is studied in further detail through these simulations. The instrument is then fabricated using a modified Flex-to-Rigid (F2R) foil technology. Polymer foils fabricated by the F2R technology are extremely thin and would require reinforcement to be suitable for this project. Two methods to provide reinforcement are suggested: inclusion of polyimide beams in various patterns and free standing silicon beams inside polyimide columns. The idea of having polyimide beams to reinforce the foils has been successfully demonstrated by fabricating a number of samples. Tests have been done to check the effectiveness of this method. The idea of including silicon beams inside the polyimide beams could not be realized successfully. Suggestions are given as to how this can be proceeded with.","Microfabrication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","ECTM","","MSc Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2011","Due to rapid and continuous technology scaling, faults in semiconductor memories (and ICs in general) are becoming pervasive and weak of nature; weak faults are faults that pass the test program (because they do not lead to erroneous behavior of the system). Nevertheless, they may cause a system failure during the application. This causes the number of escapes to increase while it becomes increasingly difficult to determine the nature of the failures. Components with weak faults which fail at board and system level are sent to suppliers, only to have them returned back as No Trouble Found (NTF). The conventional memory test approach assumes the presence of a single defect a time causing a strong fault (which leads to an error in the system), and therefore is unable to deal with weak faults. This thesis presents a new memory test approach able to detect weak faults; it is based on assuming the presence of multiple weak faults at a time in a memory system rather a single strong fault at a time. Being able to detect weak faults reduces the number of escapes, hence also the number of NTFs. The experimental analysis done using SPICE simulation for a case of study show e.g., that when assuming two simultaneous weak faults, the missing (defect) coverage can be reduced with up to 10% as compared with the conventional approach.","memory test; fault models; strong faults; weak faults; defect injection and circuit simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Heijnen, P.W. (mentor); Kwee, Z. (mentor)","2011","Patents are often taken as an indicator to measure innovativeness, because they are a lot easier to obtain than most others. There is a complication though, which is that patents are not a direct measure of innovativeness: the fit between patents and innovativeness is biased by differing propensities to patent. The propensity to patent was analyzed in the 1980’s and 1990’s, but results vary and more recent research focuses mostly at specific case studies. With the availability of the CIS (Community Innovation Survey) databases of 2000 and 2004 there is a good opportunity to test again, in a structured way, which factors are important for the propensity to patent. For this research CIS data from three North-Western European countries were analyzed: Belgium, Norway and Germany. Descriptive results show that the propensity to patent varies greatly among different types of innovation, and especially when looking at the difference between goods, services and processes. Process and service innovations turn out to be rarely patented, with average patent propensities of respectively 7.6% and 9.6%. Moreover, descriptive results confirm that the propensity to patent differs across industries. Next to that a logistic regression analysis was performed. This analysis tested existing hypotheses and explored new factors that came available in the CIS questionnaires. By only including those enterprises in the analysis that actually had innovative output, factors could be determined that increase the propensity to patent these innovations. Factors that were found significantly relevant include EU funding (+), having a new to market innovation (+), cooperation arrangements with universities (+), having a local/regional market (-), having a market outside Europe (+) and using private R&D institutions as information sources for innovation (-). On top of those it was confirmed that patent propensity is higher in specific industries and countries, as well as for different types of innovation, even when correcting for the aforementioned factors. Results provide a comprehensive overview of the importance of, and some correlations between, firm level, industry level and country level factors of the propensity to patent. These results can be used to improve patent based innovation measures, as well as to provide additional insights into appropriability conditions between sectors.","innovation; propensity to patent; innovation indicators; CIS; patents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Economics of Innovation","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Talmon, A.M. (mentor)","2011","The Atrato River in Colombia should be navigable for bigger vessels when generating a corridor which should link the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. A likely segment of the river that forms a critical point for navigation is the point of bifurcation where the river is divided in the Montaño and Murindó branch. Both branches should be reasonably navigable, but bifurcation morphodynamics possibly render the water depth in one branch smaller than the draught of the vessel. It is noted that the Montaño branch is considered the main corridor, as this branch is shorter and generally wider. The main objective is to model and understand the morphology that evolves around the river bifurcation and discuss possible measures for creating a sustainable navigable channel. In order to create insights in these morphodynamics, a computational model has been set up. Using the software package Delft3D, a 2DH morphodynamic model of the area around the bifurcation has been made. Due to the lack of sufficient data available, a thorough morphodynamic calibration and verification is impossible. It was shown that the model predicts a development to a stable, but often highly asymmetrical discharge division. The model attains this equilibrium after 50 years of morphological modelling. This suggests the bifurcation is unstable. The evolution to an asymmetrical discharge division is mainly governed by the imposed downstream boundary water levels because a head difference over the branches determines the division of flow over the branches. The calibrated model assumes no backwater effects, which means that the shorter Montaño branch (83 km) has a larger water level gradient than the Murindó branch (91.5 km). It was shown that the unknown head difference over the branches greatly influences the global development of the branches (i.e. aggradation /degradation). Because only one bathymetrical survey was executed, erosion and sedimentation rates are unknown, which further decreases the possibility of accurately modelling the area. An important result is that when imposing the same water level gradients in both branches, the model still predicts a development to a highly asymmetrical division of flow discharge (i.e. 75% through the Montaño branch). This means that local geometrical phenomena influence the division of flow and sediments. The sharp angle of offtake of the Murindó branch results in flow separation which in turn causes a sediment trap at the entrance of this branch. As a result, the cross-section reduces significantly, which means less discharge is directed through this branch. Another phenomenon is caused by the present river bend just upstream of the point of bifurcation. This leads to a gravitational pull along the transverse slope which initially leads to an increasing bed load transport through the Murindó branch. Another local phenomenon is the Bulle effect which leads more bed load through the Murindó branch due to the river bend formed by the upstream bend and the offtaking channel. Discussing possible solutions is sometimes hypothetical as the global evolution is sensitive to the unknown downstream boundaries. The possibility of two different bend cut-offs are discussed. It was shown that the angle of offtake greatly influences the division of flow discharge and sediments. Decreasing the offtake-angle of the Murindó branch from 90° to 30° means the Murindó branch gets dominant (60% flow discharge through this branch instead of 20%). As the internal connection between the branches can result in significant backwater effects, it can be a simple solution to cut off this connection. In conclusion, the present available data prove to be insufficient. Measuring stage and discharges in both branches, river bed profiles and sediment characteristics can indicate which branch will be dominant and enable future decision making.","unstable bifurcation; navigability; Atrato River; morphological modelling; backwater effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","River Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","The Colombian government aims to establish a connection that bridges the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The new connection will largely take place on the current Atrato River, which has not yet been upgraded for a more extensive use of navigation in the near future. A bottleneck in the river is the delta area. Without structural dredging activities the river is completely inaccessible. This study investigates the morphodynamics of a river mouth of the Atrato delta, in order to improve its accessibility to provide navigation in the future and to minimize the dredging activities. In short, the main objectives of this study are (1) to gain insights into the morphodynamics of the delta, (2) to develop a hydrodynamic model on an unstructured grid, (3) to develop a morphodynamic model on a structured grid and consequently (4) apply these models to investigate measures that aim to improve the accessibility of a river mouth. In this study an approach is used to model the hydrodynamics first at a large scale and subsequently modelling the morphodynamics at a more detailed level. A hydrodynamic model is set up with an unstructured grid, which appears to be a powerful tool to model a topographical complex area such as the Atrato delta. The hydrodynamic model gives insights into the hydrodynamics of the delta and is capable to create specific time-dependent boundary conditions for the more detailed morphodynamic model. This approach solves the problem of enormous backwater adaptation lengths, which are initiated by the tidal movement and a large amount of bifurcations. Subsequently, a model with a structured grid has been set up to simulate the morphology around a river mouth. The morphodynamic model is able to identify the major processes that cause sediment deposition. The key process appears to be the sudden spreading and deceleration of the riverine water when the river flows into the Golfo de Urabá. As the result of the relative strength of the outflowing fresh water compared to the tidal power, the flow velocities are almost constantly located seawards. This explains the low sediment deposition rates in the river part of the delta. The enhanced flocculationin saline water results in a compact zone of sedimentation. This report discusses four possible measures that aim to improve the navigability in the delta and to minimize dredging activities. Modelsare set up to simulate their effects on the delta hydrodynamically as well as morphodynamically. The modelled measures are (1) a sand trap, (2) an artificial outlet channel, (3) sediment diversion channels and (4) the artificial extension of a river mouth. The model forecasts that none of the investigated measures will avoid dredging activities completely. A navigable artificial river mouth situated more upstream in the river even leads to closuresof the current river mouths. Of the examined measures, the implementations of a sand trap and sediment diversion channels raise the most potential to reduce the sediment supply to the current river mouths, without deteriorating the navigability in other parts of the river. The artificial extension of a river mouth with breakwaters does not decrease the sediment supply towards the river mouths. However, the sediment deposition process takes place in deeper water, which minimizes the dredging maintenance for at least several years. The findings of this study should be regarded as the first step in the extension of knowledge on the morphodynamics of the Atrato delta. At this stage the models will help to understand the morphodynamics at the delta in more detail and hopefully encourage the collection of more valuable data. For that purpose a measuring and monitoring program is presented in this report.","delta; navigability; morphodynamics; river mouth; unstructured grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The lack of controllability of the output of solar cells and wind turbines conflicts with the requirement that suppliers match their production with the demand at all times. Our solution is to drop this requirement and instead use flexibility on side of the consumer to align the demand with an optimal production schedule. In this thesis, we first investigate this scheduling problem. We then consider the setting in which consumers and suppliers have private information about their jobs and costs. In this context we propose the Transfer Redistribution Mechanism, which is budget balanced and individually rational. Under the assumption that consumers report truthfully, the mechanism is efficient. We conjecture that in practice truth-telling is a best strategy for consumers. We present experimental results that show that increased flexibility of jobs reduces the costs of suppliers. Furthermore, the consumers are found to benefit when the flexibility of their jobs is increased, thereby supporting the conjecture that truth-telling is a best strategy.","mechanism design; scheduling; auction; mechanism; energy market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics Group","",""

By deploying wireless sensors in sports, various dimensions of use-case scenarios become obvious which include monitoring sports players to help assess their fitness levels during training sessions and during play, enhance game strategy and provide TV broadcasters with lucrative statistics for the audience. As a first step to realize these use-cases, a platform to create such applications is needed to rapidly prototype devices as a proof of concept. However, to monitor professional sports players and to help make scientific analysis, a deluge of information is needed with less error margin. In this thesis, a wireless sensor platform is designed and developed, customized for creating prototypes of nodes for the sports players. Multiple gateways can be used along the boundary of the play-field to cover the entire playfield and with the mobile sensor nodes making hand-off between the gateways based on their proximity. A time-sharing mechanism is used by the nodes to gain access to the channel and is centralized at the gateway. The gateway provides authentication to which sensor node can transmit data in a round-robin manner. Experimental results show that the packet losses are around 1% with varying cases explaining that only one node communicate with the gateway at any point of time. One of the major drawbacks of such time-slotted protocols is the latency due to the failed nodes and in this protocol a mechanism is devised to mitigate this latency. The net data-rate is also enhanced by transmitting multiple packets in a time-compacted slot without linearly increasing the slot-width.","Wireless Sensor; Sports","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); Kwee, Z. (mentor); Rook, L. (mentor)","2011","Nowadays companies hold increased amounts of cash (Dittmar 2008; Schauten, van Dijk and Van der Waal 2008). Literature gives two contradictory theories that may influence the valuation of these cash holdings by investors in the market. The pecking order theory predicts that managers have more information about the state of the firm than outside investors and therefore outside investors require a premium on the money they invest in the firm (Myers and Majluf 1984). This premium is referred to as information costs because it reflects the additional amount of money firms are charged for by investors to compensate for the information gap that exists between investors and the managers of the firm. Contrary to the pecking order theory, the agency cost of free cash flow theory predicts that managers do not always have the intention to maximize shareholder value; they rather use the company’s cash to maximize their own utility (Jensen 1986). The costs that arise from agency problems are referred to as agency costs. Although the pecking order theory itself does not predict how the existence of information asymmetry may affect the market value of cash holdings, it can be argued that because firms have to pay a premium in case of external financing, investors will appraise the capital that is internally available to the firm. Therefore, information costs are likely to have a positive influence on the market value of cash holdings. On the other hand, based on the agency costs of free cash flow theory, it can be argued that when investors believe that a firm experiences agency problems they are likely to have a negative perception on the market value of cash holdings. This study aims to investigate the relevance of these contradicting theories in the eyes of the investor by analyzing the impact of information costs and agency costs on the market value of firms’ cash holdings. In an attempt to answer this issue, a longitudinal quantitative study is performed on a sample of firms traded at NYSE Amsterdam Euronext. We performed an extensive literature review to give a clear and logical presentation of the relevant research work done thus far. Based on literature findings we developed a conceptual model. The conceptual model showed the predicted relationships among variables. The operationalization of the variables was established after careful evaluation of suggestions given in the existing literature. Based on the predicted relationships in the conceptual model we developed seven hypotheses which were statistically tested by the performance of various cross sectional multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis.","investment policy; invesment management; cash flow policy; cash holdings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-21","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Management of Technology","",""

The task of question classification is to predict the entity type of the answer of a natural language question. Question classification is typically done using machine learning techniques. Different lexical, syntactical and semantic features can be extracted from a question. In this work we introduce two new semantic features which improve the accuracy of classification. Furthermore, we developed a weighed approach to optimally combine different features. We also applied Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique to reduce the large feature space of questions to a much smaller and efficient feature space. We adopted two different classifiers: Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found that applying LSA on question classification can not only make the question classification more time efficient, but it also improves the classification accuracy by removing the redundant features. Furthermore, we discovered that when the original feature space is compact and efficient, its reduced space performs better than a large feature space with a rich set of features. In addition, we found that in the reduced feature space, BPNN performs better than SVMs which are widely used in question classification. We tested our proposed approaches on the well-known UIUC dataset and succeeded to achieve a new record on the accuracy of classification on this dataset.","Question Classification; Question Answering Systems; Lexical Features; Syntactical Features; Semantic Features; Combining Features; Support Vector Machines; Back-Propagation Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Media and Knowledge Engineering","","Computer Science","",""

An example of such a data set is the AHN2 data set, which contains a high-density point cloud for the Netherlands. The direct visualization of these point cloud data sets is important because it provides the first step in understanding them. However, the size of these data sets prevents them from simply being displayed, let alone from being explored interactively. As such, they present a challenge in visualization. In this thesis, we describe the methods used by earlier works to beat this challenge. These methods involve the use of space driven spatial data structures to provide efficient out-of-core access to the point cloud data set, and the alleviation of one or more of the bottlenecks in the point cloud visualization pipeline to improve interactiveness. Choosing to use a different approach, we present a method to interactively visualize these point cloud data sets using the concept of visualization on a budget. We reduce the complexity of a point cloud visualization by using continuous level-of-detail, and we minimize its impact on the effectiveness of the visualization by using a point analogue of visual importance, for which we present a metric. The complexity of the visualization is automatically adapted to maintain interactiveness. As a result, the visualization always consists of those points that, for a given metric, best represent the point cloud data set for the required interactiveness. We present a prototype toolchain that includes the implementation of our method and demonstrate its performance on a variety of point cloud data sets. We describe its performance characteristics and present a preliminary user study for the method. We evaluate initial results and conclude that our method works, and propose the development of a better metric that does not require user intervention. We end by showing that the prototype toolchain can be used to continue research on this promising method.","computer graphics; visualization; point clouds; LiDAR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Computer Graphics and CAD/CAM","",""

Er blijkt wel een andere methode te zijn om uit het Heston-Hull-White model een vergelijking af te leiden. In de rest van het verslag werken we verder met de modellen van Black-Scholes en Heston. In sectie 4 worden een aantal details van het Heston model besproken. Zo tonen we aan dat er geen directe coördinatentransformatie bestaat die de numerieke implementatie vergemakkelijkt. De modellen worden numeriek geïmplementeerd in hoofdstuk 5. We maken hiervoor gebruik van eindige differenties. In sectie 6 worden de resultaten voor de modellen getest. Hierbij ontdekken we dat de randvoorwaarden die aan het begin van het verslag zijn geïntroduceerd, problemen opleveren bij numerieke implementatie. Vervolgens leiden we nieuwe randvoorwaardes af, die beter presteren. Het hoofdresultaat van het onderzoek is een verzameling randvoorwaarden die goed functioneren bij het numerieke schema. In sectie 7 worden deze en andere conclusies gepresenteerd. In de Appendix zijn overige wiskundige details en MATLAB programma's te vinden.","Heston; optie; eindige differenties","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-08-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Orbital fat is the soft tissue inside the eye socket, or orbit, that surrounds the eye muscles, eyeball, optic nerve and blood vessels. It plays an important role in the mechanical operation of the eye during eyeball rotation. Knowledge of how this orbital fat behaves is limited. It is important for surgeons to improve this knowledge to make better informed decisions before and during eye surgery. Visualization of the deformation of orbital fat can improve this knowledge. Herein lie two problems. First, we do not have accurate and detailed information on how the orbital fat deforms. Second, we do not have a visualization method that provides the necessary insight into orbital fat deformation data. We obtain deformation data by deriving it from a sequence of MRI volumes that represent the rotating eyeball. We do this by using a method from the optic ow family, which uses the changing tissue boundaries in the MRI data to locally extract deformation data. We visualize this deformation data using a particle-based method. In particle-based visualization, a large number of tiny, point-like particles are placed inside part of the volume. The positions of individual particles are affected by the deformation data. We smoothly animate the particles as they move through the orbit while the eyeball rotates, giving a detailed impression of the deformation of a subvolume of orbital fat. Demarcation of where inside the volume to place the particles is called region of interest (ROI) specification. We developed a method that uses anatomical information from the MRI volumes to specify sensible ROIs. We implemented our solutions in two software tools that work together to allow quick exploration of deformation from a sequence of MRI volumes. Experts in the fields of ophthalmology and biomechanics have expressed that our visualization software is a significant improvement over previous techniques and that the software should continue to be developed.","visualization; orbital fat; deformation; optical flow; region of interest; CUDA; GLSL; MRI; Lucas and Kanade; VTK","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Computer Graphics","",""

(mentor); Babal, P. (mentor); Zeman, M. (mentor)","2011","This thesis studied the characteristics and applications of n-type silicon oxide (SiOx) produced through plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition were studied through. n-type SiOx has shown excellent results in various applications of solar cell technology including back reflectors and intermediate reflecting layers. These results can aid in making amorphous silicon cells thinner. Thinner cells are not only cheaper and less resource intensive but are known to be much less susceptible to degradation, which is a major research goal in amorphous silicon solar cells. This thesis used three experiments to characterize and utilize n-type SiOx. First, the effects of varying deposition parameters of SiOx films were analyzed. SiOx layers were then applied as back reflectors of p-i-n amorphous silicon solar cells. Finally, SiOx was integrated into a two-period, one-dimensional photonic crystal. Forward power, pressure, CO2 flow and PH3 flow during deposition were varied to study their effects on SiOx films. Optical and electrical characteristics, as well as the deposition rate, of the films were measured as each deposition parameter was varied. Raman spectroscopy was also used to analyze the crystalline silicon structures in the material. These measurements showed that an increase in the oxygen content of SiOx enhanced its optical characteristics, while decreasing its electrical characteristics. CO2 flow as well as power and pressure had significant an impact on the oxygen content. Furthermore, it was found that increasing PH3/SiH4 flow ratio above 0.024 decreased the doping concentration of the SiOx film and had adverse effects on both the conductivity and activation energy of the films. Raman spectroscopy results suggested that the SiOx contained 5-7 nm crystalline silicon features. SiOx layers were deposited on amorphous silicon cells using both a p-i-n-SiOx configuration, as well as a p-i-SiOx configuration that contained no n-type amorphous silicon layer. In addition to varying the SiOx deposition parameters, the thickness of the n-type amorphous silicon layer was also varied. These cells were measured in a solar simulator and an external quantum effficiency setup. The p-i-n-SiOx solar cells achieved an initial efficiency of 10.8 % and a JSC of 16.65 ma/cm2. This was a relative efficiency enhancement of 15.3 % and a relative JSC enhancement of 17.5 % over standard p-i-n solar cells. p-i-SiOx cells achieved an initial efficency of 9.85 % and JSC of 16.55 mA/cm2. Degradation tests showed stabilized efficiencies of 8.2 % for p-i-n-SiOx cells and 7.9 % for p-i-SiOx cells. The external quantum efficiency results showed significant improvement of p-i-n-SiOx cells over p-i-n cells in the red spectra, which are attributed to enhanced reflection. There was also significant improvement in the blue spectra, which is attributed to enhanced electron collection at the back of the solar cell. SiOx was also integrated into a photonic crystal using n-type amorphous silicon as the second material. The photonic crystal was designed through careful tuning using the Advanced Semiconductor Analysis (ASA) simulation package. The results were very promising and showed how photonic crystals can be finely tuned for specific solar cell applications such as an intermediate reflecting layer for a micromorph cell.","solar cells; amorphous silicon; thin film; Raman; silicon oxide; doping; plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; PECVD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technologies","","52, 4.37"

(mentor); Fitch, R.A. (mentor); Tolud, I. (mentor)","2011","Rituals is a ten year old brand selling home and body cosmetics. The products are inspired by authentic Eastern rituals, like the Hammam steam bath ritual and the shaving ritual of the Japanese Samurai warriors. Due to the rapid growth of the company, there has been limited time to evaluate the furniture used in the stores and to work on an ideal concept. Analysing the context, literature, trends and similar brands and stores combined with research involving customers, the stores showed several weaker and stronger points. These points could be used to improve the efficiency of the stores, the brand experience and the shopping experience. When comparing Rituals with brands like The Body Shop, Sabon, L’Occitane, Lush and Kiehl’s it becomes clear that Rituals has something that differentiates them from the other brands: the Eastern rituals used as inspiration for the products. This differentiation could be a used to strengthen the competitive advantage. By communicating these rituals a sense of value could be created and the brand experience would be improved. The research participants describe Rituals with words like luxurious, sophisticated and quality. However, the shops are at first experienced as uninviting, dark and inconspicuous from outside and overwhelming when inside for the first time. This dark look is a part of Rituals and distinguishes Rituals from other shops, but it also creates a lack of clarity of offer and discourage people from visiting the stores. The store visits also pointed out several things that could be improved in order to increase the efficiency of the work of the employees and so the shopping experience. In order to create a new concept several pieces of furniture were designed and redesigned with the goal to improve the discussed issues. These designs include small changes, but also for example a new cash register. This design is focused on improving the efficiency and the interaction between employee and customer. To improve the clarity, concepts were created to improve the communication toward the customer outside the store, through the shopping windows and through the furniture used inside the store. Additionally a thematic concept was developed, showing the origin of the products. Finally a proposal was developed to improve the adjacencies in the stores. This proposal should also give the stores a more organized impression. Of three of the designs prototypes were made. Testing and evaluating these prototypes made it possible to improve them again and again.","retail; design; cosmetics; furniture; interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); De Reuver, M. (mentor); Warnier, M. (mentor); Nikayin, F. (mentor); Wegbrands, P. (mentor)","2011","Cloud computing market is expected to grow rapidly in the next five years. Even though Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service solutions will dominate most of the market, Platform-as-a-Service solution is forecasted to have the fastest-growing segment, especially in Western Europe. On the other hand, cloud computing is also argued to be the new playing ground for Telecommunication industry. As the industry facing a threat for just being the network “bit piper”, telecom operators might find a new revenue source within the cloud computing domain. The issues explained above have led us to conduct a research that aimed at two objectives. First is to give guidance to larger enterprise companies in the Netherlands on how to capture values from PaaS offering. Second, this research aimed to identify whether telecom companies could create particular new business value and opportunities from the PaaS service provision. Therefore this study raised a challenging main questions: “What factors are important for large enterprise clients to adopt Platform-as-a-Service in order to capture the business value that is offered from Platform-as-a-Service offering, and what are the strategic implications of the Platform-as-a-Service adoption for Telecom industry?” To answer the main questions, five research sub-questions were formulated. A theoretical approach from business model literature is used to guide answering the main research questions. A conceptual model of PaaS adoption factors was developed, which is based on the STOF business model framework. Analysis of PaaS market in the Netherlands was conducted among 9 client companies and 3 PaaS provider companies, in order to validate the conceptual model. The results showed that the PaaS market in the Netherlands are still immature, thus making the validation of the conceptual model for PaaS adoption hard to be generalized. Modification of the analysis approach was taken that enable us to analyze the conceptual model for SaaS adoption as well. Our study found that there are several factors within the Service domain that are important for clients when they consider which applications to be moved to PaaS or SaaS environment. The most important factor is criticality of application that wants to be moved to the cloud. These factors from the Service domain influence client’s technical requirements on Security, Quality of Service, and System Integration issues. Furthermore, our research found that there are several factors that client take into account when they about to choose PaaS and SaaS providers. These factors serve as assessment framework whether the providers’ profile can meet clients’ requirements. Our finding shows that Branding is the most important factor of PaaS and SaaS providers. Branding is important because it is closely associated with trustworthiness. Moreover, trust also becomes really important, because in PaaS and SaaS implementation clients are losing control of their application data. In addition, our finding also shows that the factor of data location is really important in PaaS and SaaS adoption. A key stakeholder, namely the regulators, drives this data location factor. We also found that clients perceived system integrators and network providers as the other important key stakeholder in the provision of PaaS and SaaS services. Furthermore, our study also found that telecom companies could play two roles in cloud computing domain in order to create new business value, and hence making new revenue source. The first role is to be Cloud service provider. This role means that telecom companies could exploit their main resources of Internet network infrastructure to deliver a guaranteed and high level end-to-end cloud services (both PaaS or SaaS services). The second role is to be Cloud service broker. This role exploits telecom companies’ resource of broad customer base and customer relationship in order to mediate cloud providers and the clients. Being cloud service broker enables telecom companies to gain monetary incentives by means of revenue sharing. Our study concludes that clients need to take into account factors in the four domains of Service, Technology, Organization, and Finance in order to capture the value of PaaS and SaaS offering. On top of that, clients need to take into consideration the regulation applied in order to legally implement cloud computing solutions. Clients also need to acknowledge the importance of system integrators and network providers in utilizing cloud computing services. This study adds several main contributions to the literature. Firstly, this study has made the first attempt to construct an adoption model for PaaS and SaaS specifically. Secondly, this study has contributed to business model theory, particularly by extending the applicability of STOF model. Thirdly, this study confirms the existing literature that describes key stakeholders on cloud computing. On top of that, we contribute by adding Network Provider as another key stakeholder. Nevertheless, this study bears some limitations. Due to small sample size, this research serves as means of first validation of the constructed model. We are aware that further research can be conducted to do more extensive validation by means of survey research. However due to the immaturity of cloud computing market, especially PaaS, we suggest that further research on PaaS is better to be conducted later to wait for the market to be developed. Besides the sampling issue, our research was not able to validate our findings on telecom companies role in cloud computing. Further research could focus on validating our results empirically through involvement of industry experts.","cloud computing; Platform-as-a-Service; Software-as-a-Service; business model; market adoption; telecommunication industry; adoption factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2011","The stratigraphic and tectonic framework of the Brent Group and their respective depositional environments is well studied and documented in the literature. The lower progradational Brent deltaic sequence is the response of a high sediment supply rate outpacing the accommodation space rate caused by subsidence and an overall sea level rise stage. These types of systems are typically overfilled basin systems and their facies distribution and stratigraphy are considered be governed by autogenic processes. This implies that the main (fluvial, climatic and basinal) forcing conditions were steady making these formative processes greatly dependent on the geometrical characteristics of the receiving basin and the river delta. While wells and seismic data give a good overview of the stratigraphic sequences, there is still insufficient understanding of the detailed stratigraphic characteristics and facies development within the Brent’s deltaic sequences as response to steady forcing and specific-local scale conditions. This research will focus on the effect of the antecedent bathymetry over which the delta prograded. This antecedent bathymetry is formed by the top of the Oseberg Formation, a coarse grained fan delta. The research objective of this MSc. project is: How the geomorphological evolution, sediment partitioning, facies evolution and stratigraphic response are affected under variable bathymetric conditions by (1) changes in the shoreline direction with respect to the Oseberg´s Fm. pinch out and (2) variable substrate erodability. To address the research objective, a downscaled Brent fluviodeltaic model was created for the Huldra area accounting for the bathymetry generated by the Oseberg Fm. pinch out and also the presumed steady forcing conditions. Published data and data available from STATOIL ASA were used to constrain the basinal and fluvial forcing conditions and the initial bathymetry prevailing in the studied area during Early Jurassic times. Numerical experiments using a hydrodynamic model (Delft3D) show that progradation over the pinch out (shelf edge) can occur under steady sea level condition, producing lobate geometries and basinward sediment sand prone wedge accumulation reaching up to 25 m of thickness. Furthermore they also shows that at, for the anticipated wave climate, no wave induced reworking or transporting of the sand-size grain sediments occurred below 5m water depth because the near-wave orbital velocities are below the threshold transport value. Changing shoreline orientation impacts the wave spreading angle and thereby the affects the interplay between river and basinal forcings. These influence the near coastal reworking pattern as well upstream characteristics of the prograding delta (such as channel avulsion, shifting and abandonment). The numerical experiments including the erodability of the substrate show a large impact on the evolution of the delta. It controls the geometry of the distributary channels. A non-erodible substrate generates wide channels while an erodible substrate produces deeper yet narrower channels since incisions can occur. In addition, it provides a variable but limited sediment source to the delta and the shelf coming from the eroding river bed. While Delft3D is a hydrodynamic model generally applied for engineering scale problems, this study shows it can also be applied to a more geological context. In this aspect we were able to produce new and more geological visualizations not produced before with Delft3D including chronostratigraphic bed level changes, facies model, wheeler diagrams, and reservoir geology maps.","Delft3D; Process Based Forward Modelling; Brent Group; Deltaic Systems; Wave-dominated deltas; Autostratigraphy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Section Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); Kornmann, C.M. (mentor)","2011","This report describes the design process of a new car safety device developed at LifeSafety Products B.V. located in Zoetermeer, the Netherlands. Life Safety Products B.V. has been dependant on their number one selling product, the LIFEHAMMER®. Now they want to invest in the development of new products in the field of car safety, in order to become less dependant on a single product and to show the branche that they are an innovative company truly worthy of the slogan “Number one in car safety”. Based on consumer research and internal discussion, Life Safety Products B.V. will benefit from a product that provides a safety net in case the user requires help and is somehow unable to communicate this need for help. The proposed design concept “SOSafe” provides a double safety net by alerting both other road users and the emergency services. It also functions as an emergency light system. The design blends in with car interiors enough to be aesthetically desirable, yet attracts enough attention to be easy to find in case of an emergency. The SOSafe system is a stand-alone product. This makes sure it will function even when car electronics fail. The SOSafe system is linked to a web service that sets preferences to the system and contains additional information about the user, allowing the emergency services to send more personalized help. The SOSafe system activates in case of crashes or entering water. It can also be activated manually. When activated, it emits pulses of light that attract the attention of other road users, and functions as an emergency light system. At the same time it sends an emergency message to pre-defined contacts, such as the emergency services. This message contains the GPS location of the accident and information that allows the contacts to make a phone call to the SOSafe user. This project was carried out in two parallel design paths; the functional and aesthetic path. The functional path deals with the creation of a reliable, easy to use product, whereas the aesthetic path deals with creating a product that is desireable, innovative, understandable and fits automotive interior as well as the new Life Safety Products product portfolio. These paths come together at the final concept proposal. This proposal is used for a survey that yields recommendations for further design optimalisation after this graduation project has finished.","automotive; safety; product design; GPS; GSM; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-08-03","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this research, the influence of internal syn-sedimentary structures on the pattern of deposition and distributions of deltaic clastic reservoir deposits in the Tomboy Field Area, offshore Nigeria is investigated using seismic modeling attributes (deposit thickness, root mean square (RMS) and maximum amplitude, structural contours, time slices, reflection intensity) and well logs. Seven fault modeled surfaces created from mapped seismic horizons in Agbada Formation were depth converted with pseudo interval velocities generated from layer cake velocity model to analyze the effects of structural deformations on depositional pattern. Results obtained indicates that depositional and tectonic control of clastic reservoir developments are mainly influenced by thickness and weight of the prograding clastic sediments, the shale diapirs geometry that triggered up fault formations and mini basins, the shape of the faults, the proximity of sediments load to the mobile shale layer, and the rate of basin creations, deposition and destructions of accommodation space. The stacked onlap relationship and stacked erosional channel observed in seismic and well data suggest that the geometry of the shale structures influences sedimentation patterns. Evidences from structural contours and reflection intensity maps reveal complex structural deformations at increasing depth and proximity to the mobile Akata shale. The presence of roll over anticline at the downthrown side of fault F1, Fault F7 and F3 suggest that the upwelling of Akata shale triggers up the creation and destruction of accommodation space. Results from time slices, reflection intensity and their cross sections shows that sand deposits with high amplitude are trapped at the roll over structures at the downthrown block of growth fault, F3, F1 and synthetic faults F7, and that the formation of fault, F3, F1 and F7 with respect to thick prograding delta front has created ‘graben’ like depression most likely due to changes in slope equilibrium profile by the uprising mobile shale layer. Turbidity current by hydraulic jump model emanating from these topographic highs has been proposed to fill these basins. Evidences from window based isochore thickness map shows that increasing sediment thickness is associated with the downthrown side of fault F3, F1 and F7 where roll over anticline structures are formed and grows larger within areas where great fault interplays occurs. As analyzed from root mean square (RMS) and maximum amplitude, higher amplitudes occurs mostly at the roll over structures at the downthrown side of fault F3, F1 and synthetic faults F7. The ratification of the roll over structures at the downthrown block of growth fault F3, F1 and synthetic faults F7 as reservoir sand deposits by seismic modeling attributes is further validated by critical evaluation of the gamma ray and resistivity logs at this mapped interval. Results shows that these sedimentary fills are mainly channel fills, distributaries channel fill, tidal channel and point bar, stacked vertically with an upward coarsening sequence which are generally blocky, cylindrical shaped, with sharp contact at the top and base to the shale interval.","mud diapirs; seismic attributes; reflection intensity; structural contour maps; RMS amplitude; maximum amplitude; time slices; isochore thickness; progradation; gamma ray; resistivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Applied Geology","",""

The size and the complexity of todays Integrated Circuit designs though may exceed the size of the programmable devices used by the emulator in order to map the design under test. Therefore, in order to create a prototype of emulator and the design under test, we need to find a way to partition the whole design on the several programmable devices of the emulator.
