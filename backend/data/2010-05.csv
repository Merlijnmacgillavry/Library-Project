(mentor); De Jong, J. (mentor)","2010","The software development has changed dramatically the last two decades. Software was primarily built in house 30 years ago, aiming to fit the needs of a specific user. During the 80’s the tendency changed with the foundation of software houses that were specializing in the development of “off the self” software, fitting the needs of a wider group of users, thus achieving scale economy, cheaper software with better quality. The last years, the explosion of the internet usage has transferred all applications to the “cloud” exploiting the faster and cheaper than ever hardware and netware. Furthermore, software systems such as Content Management Systems and Enterprise Resource Planning have transformed information system development into a process that connects the right components of functionality together. However, no matter what the advances are, tailored software is still required. Organizations, like businesses and institutions, with a variety in characteristics like delivered services, size, people, business processes and operating rules will always have a need for a customized system that fits their needs. Thus, building software has become more complex not in terms of available technological solutions but in terms of determining user needs. There are still excellent flawless software systems that solve the wrong problem. Therefore, enriching software engineering processes with business modeling techniques has been one way to cope with this problem. One of the most famous software engineering processes is the Rational Unified Process (RUP) which includes its own business modeling technique. In this thesis we try to combine DEMO and RUP in order to exploit the advantages of both methodologies which will ultimately assist practitioners in the development of quality software that solves the right problem. Our effort starts with the identification of a common scientific background, continues with devising a framework of assisting the combination and study of the methodologies. Then, the combined methodology is used in a case study in order to test in practice the new methodology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-05-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Information Architecture","",""

However, currently no method exists that allows in vivo testing of the Na/K pump. Therefore, this study developed a test based on repetitive nerve stimulation at single motor units. In order to evaluate the Na/K pump functioning, measurements were taken at various frequencies. Low frequency stimulation was applied to record the recovery cycle of a single motor unit at which no Na/K pump influence is expected. Stimulation trains of physiological frequency perturbed the Na/K pump and led to hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. Hence hyperpolarization leads to a decreased neural excitability, a threshold change can be recorded. Since both stimulation at physiological and low frequency led to a threshold change, a model was introduced to discriminate the influence of the Na/K pump. During the recordings at physiological stimulation frequency a remarkable phenomenon was noticed which was identified as neural bifurcation.","Na/K pump; repetitive nerve stimulation; recovery cycle; excitability model; neural bifurcation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Zitha, P.L.J. (mentor); Andrianov, A. (mentor); Matsuura, T. (mentor); Namdar Zanganeh, M. (mentor)","2010","Increasing demand for oil in the near future implies the need for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods to produce the remaining oil after primary and secondary production. Miscible gas injection has an excellent microscopic sweep efficiency; however due to density difference, high gas mobility and reservoir heterogeneity, the macroscopic sweep efficiency can be poor. The application of foam, which is a dispersion of a gas in a liquid phase with surfactant, greatly reduces the gas mobility. This minimizes gas override and gas channeling through high-permeability layers, thus increasing the macroscopic sweep efficiency. Fractional-flow theory provides key insights into one-dimensional miscible foam displacements. First-contact-miscible and multiple-contact-miscible displacement simulations show that foam is able to displace all the oil in the reservoir, and with sufficient grid resolution, the simulation converges towards the fractional-flow solution. Numerical dispersion introduced by the simulator affects the mobilities near the miscible front. In multiple-contact-miscible displacement simulations with insufficient grid resolution, numerical dispersion can cause loss of miscibility. Two-dimensional simulation shows that applying sufficient grid blocks to mitigate the effect of numerical dispersion for a multiple-contact-miscible displacement is, however, not feasible due to the enormous number of grid blocks and amount of time required to simulate each case. As a result, our 2D simulations of the multiple-contact-miscible case is more like an immiscible case than it is like a first-contact-miscible case. In both immiscible and multiple-contact-miscible displacements with insufficient grid resolution, there is a slowly advancing region of zero oil saturation as hydrocarbon is dissolved into injected CO2. Our results show that when oil has a detrimental effect on foam, as modelled in current simulators, it affects only immiscible foam displacements. In a miscible displacement there is only ever one nonaqueous phase present at any location; if it is ""gas,"" there is no oil to destabilize foam; if it is ""oil,"" there is no gas to generate foam. Thus, the effect of hydrocarbons on foam in miscible displacements is to destroy foam at the point where the simulator defines the nonaqueous phase to be ""oil"" instead of ""gas."" For immiscible displacements, foam sweep efficiency decreases greatly if the injected foam is not stable at the oil saturations encountered in the reservoir. Pressure variation causes in-homogeneity in densities and gas viscosity in the mixed zone for compressible CO2 not accounted for in Stone's model for gravity segregation. Nevertheless, Stone’s model is able to predict the segregation length for water and gas fairly accurate for first-contact-miscible, and certain multiple-contact-miscible displacement cases for co-injection and SAG injection, if one uses fluid properties from the middle of the mixed zone. For first-contact-miscible displacements, the steady state assumed in Stone's model is achieved relatively quickly. For immiscible displacements, there are two regions in the mixed zone, as in the 1D displacements: a slowly advancing region of zero oil saturation, and a region of gas flow with immobile oil present. The segregation length calculated from fluid properties in the inner zone of zero oil saturation could be greater or less than the actual segregation length. At fixed injection rate, modified SWAG injection (simultaneous injection, with water injected higher in the formation than gas) results in up to 71% longer segregation distance compared to co-injection for first-contact-miscible displacements, 110% longer for multiple-contact-miscible displacements, and 130% longer for immiscible displacements, when injecting same amount of fluids at same injection rates. In layered reservoirs, placement of surfactant into lower-permeability layers is a key challenge to sweep efficiency. However, both layered reservoirs show very similar sweep efficiencies.","Foam; EOR; Modelling; MoReS; CO2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In the past few years, a new spirit for the exploration of the Solar System spread among the space community and reaching the Moon has been set as the first step of this new program. In this frame, going back to the Moon is needed to familiarize with a new way of living in a different environment, adapting to it and testing new technology. It is also true that, at the rate we are consuming the terrestrial resources, we will soon run out of them. This will put us in front of a dramatic change in our life style. Moreover, it is not unlikely that an asteroid could impact the Earth, causing extinction of many species and difficulties for survival. Then, these unpredictable reasons increase the importance of exploring and adapting to new extraterrestrial environments. Therefore, a feasibility study of a mission to the Moon to set up a permanent base has been carried on. The first part is concerning the delivery of the lunar payload into a LEO parking orbit. For this, the analysis of the capabilities of existing launchers is performed. The ascent trajectory problem is tackled by formulating it as an initial value problem (IVP), in which, given the launcher’s initial conditions, the state vector is propagated following a control law optimized to give the largest payload mass. Moreover, the launcher is subject to constraints dictated by the mechanical and thermal properties of the launcher itself. The optimal control law is sought by means of a Particle Swam Optimization method, which simulates the behavior of a flock of birds searching for food. Single and multi-objective optimization is performed. Single-objective optimization aims at maximizing the payload mass satisfying path constraints and the boundary constraints dictated by the orbital elements of the final orbit. Multi-objective optimization aims at maximizing the payload mass and minimizing the error on the final orbit simultaneously. Other experiments include the optimization of the two aforementioned objectives and the minimization of the violations of the path constraints. It has been found that, to fulfill the requirements of the lunar campaign, a very tight schedule and international cooperation is needed. Yet, existing launchers can be used for this mission for cargo expeditions. However, it is strongly suggested to commence development of a manned launcher and a spacecraft capable to land and host astronauts for multiple days on the Moon.","Moon; Solar system; Trajectory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-02","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

(mentor); Gattol, V. (mentor)","2010","In 2009, Evening Breeze acquainted a graduate student from the Delft University of technology to support the launch of their innovative Evening Breeze Canopi to the consumer market. In the initial assignment, Evening Breeze wished for winning strategies and tools for a successful introduction of the Evening Breeze Canopi in the consumer segment through exclusive retailers. After an explorative phase, with mutual communications between Evening Breeze and the author, this assignment was rewritten, aiming at a winning market introduction strategy and optimization of the Evening Breeze Canopi and product portfolio for the Dutch consumer market. By entering this consumer market Evening Breeze found itself on a new territory, while coping with a lack of knowledge on consumer marketing and addressing consumer needs. In an elaborate analysis phase, the Dutch market was studied and relevant competitors were identified, after which the sales volume and -prospects for air-conditioning systems were analyzed. Furthermore, an internal analysis on company strengths and weaknesses, the product and all relevant stakeholders was performed to map the internal environment. The analysis phase was concluded by identifying potential partners in entering the Dutch consumer market and studying the Dutch consumers and -households. As the analysis phase did not provide sufficient data to make a proper and valid analysis of the Dutch consumer, an additional consumer research was set up to study the consumer needs, -wishes, -perception and -behavior towards Evening Breeze- and competitive products. The consumer research indicated multiple areas for product optimization, which were materialized by proposing initial and conceptual solutions. The consumer research was followed by a phase in which the strategy for the Dutch consumer market introduction of the Evening Breeze Canopi was set up. In this phase, initially the objectives for Evening Breeze in terms of sales volume, proposed product optimizations, price perception, availability and brand awareness were set up. Then, various strategic entry alternatives were identified, selecting the most favorable one for Dutch consumer market introduction. The selected entry strategy required cooperation with various partners to realize an optimal launch to the Dutch consumer market. A partnerships proposal was suggested, based on a selection of the potential partners identified during the analysis phase. In addition to a strategy for Dutch consumer market introduction, future product- and market development strategies were proposed to increase future sales volume and Evening Breeze revenues. During the commercialization phase, issues related to product positioning, pricing strategies, distribution and promotion were discussed. Also, the report contains a minor business case, providing readers with an overview of the costs and revenues of Dutch consumer market introduction. The graduation project concludes with a suggestion for the promotional materials to be developed, incorporating the findings from the analysis, consumer research, strategy and commercialization phases of the graduation project. An informative poster, a triggering window display and a brochure were developed, which give an indication on the mood and values that should be communicated by the promotional materials to realize an optimal market introduction that yields the most successful results for Evening Breeze.","consumer market; launch; introduction; strategy; commercialization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","The speed at which electric vehicle batteries can be charged usually depends on the available charging power. At low temperatures however, another bottleneck appears when the battery is unable to accept all available charging power. The charging speed is then limited by the battery. To fix this, the battery could be equipped with a heater so that the charging can take place at a higher temperature. Using an experimental approach, the author tried to answer the following questions:  How does temperature influence charging speed and battery degradation?  What are the positive effects of the usage of battery heating?  Is battery heating using AC an effective method from a battery point of view?  Does AC heating cause battery degradation? The most important conditions that apply in this project are:  Evaluated battery technology is LiFePO4. This is one of the best suitable technologies for EV purposes today due to its high energy density, high power density and safety.  The experiments are focused on Ultra Fast Charging (15 minutes). Battery heating can create a significant advantage in this operating mode. Results Measurements revealed a rapid decrease of charging performance below 10ºC. Charging performance decreases to 70% at 0ºC to as low as 20% at -20ºC compared to the 25ºC level. Ageing effects also showed a strong relation with temperature. Ultra Fast Charging at 0ºC results in a five times higher ageing rate than doing the same at room temperature. The available charging power is a practical power source for heating. Converting this power into a square wave using power electronics resulted into a battery current of about 17,5A RMS per 18650 cell. Although this current level is rather high (~16C), measurements showed only little negative effects as a result of prolonged exposure to this current level. Conclusions Temperatures below 10ºC significantly limit charging speed and battery lifetime. Due to this effect, AC battery heating is able to improve performance below 10ºC. The performance improvement was determined as 25% at 0ºC and even more at lower temperatures. Due to a significant increase in ageing effects below 10ºC, also battery lifetime can be improved in an important amount. Effects on battery lifetime due to the (AC) heating current and thermal cycles were found to be minimal. From the battery point of view, AC heating thus seems a good technique to improve performance and lifetime at low temperatures.","battery; low temperature; LiFePO4","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Processing","","","",""

In this work a specific technique is studied that makes use of transmitted and reflected light from a thin layer. The material properties of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), silicon and nanoparticles are extracted by fitting a mathematical model on these measured spectra. This model consists of sub-models that describe the physical properties of the layer such as the bandgap of the material or the free carrier absorption. A close fit of the model on the measurements then reveals all these parameters. The modelling is done with the aid of a software package called SCOUT. In this software all the sub-models are available as `building blocks' and one can compose the right interface for a certain material. This method of characterization turns out to be a highly accurate way to obtain material properties. The fitting results of the model on the measured spectra are accurate for all studied materials and an error analysis shows that a unique solution is found for all the parameters. The obtained properties are comparable to values found in literature and results obtained with state of the art characterization techniques. The creation of a specific interface in SCOUT for each material has provided the PVMD group with a powerful tool for optical characterization on which further research on material optimization can be based.","Silicon Solar Cells; Characterization; Spectroscopy; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Photovoltaic Materials and Devices","",""

It focuses only on pollutions to the air by greenhouse gasses. There is a strong focus on these gases caused by intergovernmental alliances that restrict the amount of emitted gas. These agreements have been made, as a result of the widely accepted idea that an increase of the emissions of the greenhouse gasses will have a negative effect on the global climate. The basis of the research is a case study situated in at the shore of Scheveningen, and concerns five different coastal protection systems to be analysed. To all of the designs an a mount of carbon dioxide per running meter will be attributed: A Carbon Footprint. The five designs concern a beach nourishment and a dike with an altering revetment of concrete columns, riprap, asphalt and elastocoast. The case study provides a broad view of some of the most common protections at the Dutch coast. The outcome makes a direct comparison between the systems, based on the same boundary conditions, possible. All activities that consume energy and that are contributing to the production of a final product, together form the emission of a product. An amount of energy is, dependent on the energy source responsible for a specific emission. Emissions linked to a certain energy source are therefore very influential in the ultimate emission of a whole product. Different databases however stick to different values for these specific emissions. The differences in specific emissions combined with a number of other factors cause a deviation in emissions of similar products. When the ‘Cradle-to-Grave’ principle is applied for the before mentioned five designs at Scheveningen the following ranking can be found: concrete columns, beach nourishment, riprap, asphaltic and lastly the elastocoast revetment. Because of the large range in emissions the only conclusion that can be drawn from the Carbon Footprints determined in this thesis is the ranking presented here. Because of the uncertainty in the applied emissions, established in this research, no absolute figures should be adapted from this work.","carbon footprint; dike; beach nourishment; Scheveningen; energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Neger, A.J. (mentor)","2010","In hospitals, care homes, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities patients and residents are dependent on the care of the nursing staff. They need to always be able to communicate with a nurse if they need help or when they want something. For these purposes Nurse Call systems and their associated products are used. Currently, patients in a hospital can call a nurse by using the handset by their bed. However, user research showed that these handsets are often difficult to reach and patients ask each other to call a nurse when they can´t call themselves. Because of the trend towards individual rooms in hospitals, patients will need to always be able to call a nurse on their own. Patients in a hospital will be in the same situation as the residents in a care home. These residents have transmitters that they wear which always allow them to call a nurse when they need assistance. However, these transmitters are not suitable to be used in hospitals. At the moment there are no transmitter like products available that would fulfill the needs that hospitals would have for these kinds of products. A new Nurse Call product with complementary products has been designed. Solo is a personal device that the user wears. By pressing the button, a nurse can be called. Link is a speech device that is installed in locations where it is desired that the nurses can talk with the patients when they call. Base is used to store and recharge a Solo when it is not being used. A management system will keep track of each Solo by monitoring its status and location. The nurses can assign a Solo to an individual patient and modify the settings if needed. The management system can warn the nurses if a Solo is lost or if the battery is low. For people with visual and/or auditory impairments Solo can provide additional auditory and/or tactile feedback. For people with dementia, Solo can be used for wanderer control so that they remain in the areas where the nurses can observe them. Removal detection alerts the nurses when a Solo is removed from the body of the patient. Solo is worn by placing it in an exchangeable shell. Using the different shells, Solo can be worn around the wrist with an ID-strap or wristband, as a necklace or with a clip. When a patient calls, the nurse receives a message on the phone. The nurse can see who is calling and if the patient is near a Link, the nurse can easily talk with the patient. This way, the nurse can determine the urgency of the call, let the patient know that the call will be answered and see if it is necessary to pick up something on the way over to the patient. The concept has been tested with users, both patients and nurses, and was considered to be a better alternative to the current Nurse Call products.","design; nurse; patient; resident; hospital; care; nurse call","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","Nowadays silicon solar cells are widely used to produce electric energy. However, considering its efficiency, there is room for improvement. The solar spectrum ranges from 300 nm to 2,500 nm, whereas the band gap of the silicon solar cell converts only a small band around 1,000 nm at full efficiency into electricity. The spectrum below the band gap is not absorbed at all, and the spectrum above the band gap is fully absorbed, but is converted into electricity with high thermal losses. This spectral mismatch causes a major loss of energy. The first approach to overcome this mismatch is to adapt the solar cell to the spectrum by stacking multiple solar cells with different band gaps on top of each other. The second approach, on which the focus of this research is, is to adapt the solar spectrum to the solar cell. The latter requires up-conversion of the spectrum below the band gap, essentially making one higher energy photon that can be absorbed out of multiple lower energy photons that cannot be absorbed. Above the band gap it needs down-conversion of one higher energy photon in two lower energy photons. Down-conversion (or quantum cutting) can be achieved by a crystal doped with a lanthanide ion and an Ytterbium ion. The lanthanide will absorb the high energy photon. Thereupon the energy is transferred to two Ytterbium ions via a resonant energy transfer process. Finally the Ytterbium ions will emit the two required photons with the band gap energy of silicon solar cells. In this research the lanthanide ions are doped in a NaLaF4 host crystal. First the absorption spectra of the different lanthanides are determined. Based on these spectra predictions have been made about which lanthanide-Ytterbium combinations in NaLaF4 might show downconverting properties. By measuring the emission spectra of these combinations the predictions have been verified. This work showed that down-conversion with NaLaF4:1%Dy3+,5%Yb3+ is possible. This is so far the most promising material for improvement of silicon solar cells, as shows the downconversion aimed at. Other down-converting materials proved to be less useful as light with wavelengths below the band gap was a by-product, which is not the case with Dysprosium. Finally the combination of Praseodymium and Ytterbium, showed no Ytterbium emission. This is in contrast to what is reported before about other Praseodymium Ytterbium doped host crystals, and therefore casts doubt on these reported down-converting properties.","Quantum cutting; Dwon conversion; NaLaF4; Solar cell; PV cell","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","RRR","","RD&M","",""

(mentor); Van Rijn, H. (mentor); Van Abel, B. (mentor)","2010","For people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) it is usually hard to find a job and stay employed: only few of them have a paid job. Often a person with ASD is capable of performing professional activities, but encounters problems with the social context of a job environment. People with autism have impairments in socialization, communication and imagination. These lead to problems with social interaction, misunderstandings and reduced empathy. In a professional context this might cause tension between employees with autism and their coworkers. Furthermore, these problems lead to a lot of tension in the person with autism himself. This tension decreases the level of functioning and reinforces the impairments. When tension builds up people with autism might respond in an undesired way, which eventually might lead to them getting fired. To stimulate job participation of this group, the Leo Kannerhuis started a number of projects. This graduation project, executed at Waag Society in Amsterdam, covers the design of a stress monitor for employees with autism. The stress monitor should raise awareness on the stress the user experiences during a day at work and it should help the user to deal with this stress. This project explored the technical possibilities to measure stress as well as the user’s context in order to develop an appropriate design proposal. Experts were involved in the fields of autism, stress, physiology and sensor technology. Furthermore, clients of the Leo Kannerhuis were involved as representatives for the target group. In multiple sessions their context and wishes were explored and finally the concept models were evaluated. The involvement of all these people was very valuable in this process and helped to develop a design proposal. Heart Rhythm Variability (HRV) turned out to be the most reliable indicator of stress. From user studies it became clear that it is important to the target users that the solution is not stigmatizing. Some employees with autism do not even want their coworkers to know that they have an ASD. Integrating an electret microphone in a wrist watch is proposed as a solution to measure HRV in a non-stigmatizing way. From HRV the user’s level of stress is deduced and the user is informed on high levels of stress using the ‘pebble’. The pebble is a stone-shaped object that attracts the user’s attention by means of a vibration signal and informs the user on the stress measured by means of colored lights. Furthermore, it provides the user with a breathing pattern in order to relax in times of stress. The user is also provided with the possibility to respond to the measured stress level by adjusting the stress color according to his feelings. On the long term, this self-reflection might even help the user to identify indicators of stress himself. The design of the pebble allows the user to choose the preferred way of using it. The pebble can be put in the user’s pocket to avoid a stigmatizing effect, or it can be placed on one’s desk to involve coworkers in dealing with stress. All stress data is recorded and can be accessed via a personal reflection website. Most people with autism have a job coach that visits them at work regularly. The visualization of stress data can be used in these meetings to identify problems and reflect on them. In the long term it might even help to try and avoid stressful situations. An appropriate job increases self-esteem and contributes to the perceived quality of life. This report presents a design proposal as a direction for further development. Hopefully the continuation of this project will help people with an ASD in their daily work.","Autism; Stress; Biofeedback; Job participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this work an electro-osmotic micro pump is developed. The scientific novelty of this work is the fabrication of the electrodes, which are constructed inside micro fluidic channels by means of electro less silver deposition. The fabrication process of the electrodes is based on pumping Tollens solution through micro fluidic channels. While the solution reacts, silver is formed which adheres to the sidewall of the channel. The top fraction of the silver in the channel is then transformed further into silverchloride. This way silver/silverchloride electrodes were formed that can transfer current based on a redox reaction. The benefit of this production process is that electrodes can be fabricated in a closed micro fluidic chip, such as the SFM-micropipette as is developed in our group. The theory behind electro-osmotic and electrophoretic phenomena is explained in the first part of this work, followed by the principles and relations that are important for electro-osmotic pump design. From this knowledge an electro-osmotic pump was designed in which the electrodes could be formed in the described manner. The properties of the pump were calculated and a prototype was fabricated. The fabricated prototype was evaluated in an experiment. Fluorescently labeled beads were inserted in the pumping channel and the movement of the beads was analyzed under the microscope. The experimental results show that a direct relation between the movement of the beads and the applied potential. Movement of the beads was observed under the threshold potential for hydrolysis, indicating that the current transfer takes place by a redox reaction. For all the potentials applied the velocity of the beads was circa 75% of what was expected. Also the current was lower, circa 40% of what was expected.","Electro Osmose; Pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bierbooms, W.A.A.M. (mentor); van Nood, N. (mentor)","2010","An increasing interest arises to harvesting the strong winds in deeper water offshore locations. In deep waters, a floating foundation is required. A problem is that these floating foundations must be large and are expensive to build. Another problem is the cost of wind turbine maintenance. Vertical Axis Wind Turbines are of interest as a potential solution for these issues. VAWT technology can lower maintenance demands. Also, it can be designed to have a relatively low centre of gravity, and load reducing alternative anchoring topologies can be used. However, these characteristics come at a price. Characteristics of VAWT make the generator and rotor heavy and expensive. The question is whether the benefits of VAWT can outweigh its downsides in the floating wind domain? This thesis is focused at answering that question. Two concepts for floating VAWT have been defined. The first is based on a typical floater and popular VAWT technology; a „Trifloater-mounted-straight-bladed‟ VAWT (1). The second is a novel concept that was created during this research; a „Taut-moored-curved-bladed‟ VAWT (2). An automated design model has been created. This model was used to generate designs for the concepts. An aerodynamic BEM model and hydrostatic model were created to predict forces acting on, and deflections of the floating system under environmental loads, and this was used as a sub-model to the design model. Lifetime cost estimates for the designs have been compared to those for a comparable floating HAWT. Both concepts are variable speed machines. For concept 1, a relatively low Aspect Ratio, and high floating system allowable pitch angle were found to be optimal. Also, for both concepts, a relatively high rated wind speed was found to be optimal. For concept 2, hydrostatic analysis shows that the innovative anchoring system is feasible in the idealized static cases. It was found that for both selected concept designs, the weight and cost estimates for the wind turbine alone are significantly higher than that for the comparable floating HAWT, as expected. For concept 2, the floating foundation dimensions and costs are significantly lower. The combined total lifetime cost estimate of concept 1 is higher than that for the reference floating HAWT, and for concept 2, the lifetime cost estimate is slightly lower. There is uncertainty in the maintenance cost analysis; this is advised to be executed in more detail. Based on the cost analyses performed here, it is unlikely that further development of concept 1 shall result in a major cost decrease when compared to state-of-the-art floating HAWT. For concept 2, there are uncertainties regarding technical feasibility, but it shows potential for further cost improvement and it is advised for further developing research. Finally, recommendations are also given for lowering the cost of floating HAWT‟s.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","","",""

Existing technologies are reviewed to explore their approaches. Many of these technolo- gies have Speech-act theory as their theoretic base, or build upon other technologies that do so. This led to communication frameworks having vast and unclear performative sets and lacking formal semantics. This thesis goes back to the core of communication by regarding communication from a linguistic perspec- tive. This approach inspires syntactical representation of communication constructs and also leads the way to specifying a formal semantics for those communication constructs. This semantics does not have a receiver of a message refer directly to the mental state of the sender, but rather specifies how a model of that mental state can be deduced from the communication. These mental models are implemented as language constructs which the agent programmer can use to have the agents reason about the beliefs and goals of other agents. Finally the necessary middleware elements are implemented into the GOAL interpreter to allow a system of multiple agents to be distributed across multiple platforms or hosts.","agent communication; moods; GOAL; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

The determination of the pure component solubility is one of the key steps in co-crystal screening: the region in the phase diagram in which the co-crystal is formed, depends on the solubility of the pure components. The UNIFAC model can be used for preliminary estimations of the solubility. RS-atenolol and DL-amino acids were used for co-crystal screening. RSatenolol forms a solid solution and DL-amino acids form a racemic compound or a conglomerate. RS-atenolol and L-malic acid (L-MA) form a salt, which is very stable in ethanol at low concentration of L-MA. Atenolol with dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid forms two liquid phases in ethanol: a liquid and a viscous oil phase. No crystals could be obtained from this combination, even not at long storing at room temperature. Only hydrophobic amino acids formed co-crystals during cooling crystallization. Due to steric hindrance, only D-L combinations of amino acids can be co-crystallized, this leads to separation of enantiomers. Separations were performed for DL-Val with L-Phe and for DL-Phe with L-Phe and L-Leu.","co-crystallization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","IRS","",""

(mentor)","2010","One way to prevent collisions and deadlocks between agents on infrastructures with capacity constraints is to use context-aware route planning algorithms. In context-aware route planning, there is a set of agents each planning a conflict-free route from a start location to a destination location on a common infrastructure. If a sequential approach is used for route planning, finding an optimal conflict-free route for a single agent can be done in polynomial time by allowing agents to place reservations on infrastructure resources for the intended periods of occupation. In the multi-stage variant of the context-aware route planning problem, there is a sequence of locations to be visited by an agent instead of just a start and destination location as in single-stage route planning. A straightforward approach to the multi-stage route planning problem would be concatenating subsequent routes found by a single-stage algorithm. However, this solution is incomplete and sub-optimal in case of context-aware route planning. Therefore, we developed three multi-stage route planning algorithms that always return an optimal route for a single agent, given a set of reservations made by previous agents. The results of our experiments show that one of the multi-stage algorithms is suitable for use in practice, since the cpu-time needed to make a route is at most a few tenths of a second.","routing; agents; collision; infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

One of the proposed battery systems is a reconfigurable battery, of which little knowledge was found to be available. This reconfigurable battery system offers interesting advantages for charging systems so more knowledge was desired. Battery reconfiguration means that a battery is divided into multiple, identical modules, which can be connected in series and in parallel.

(mentor); Van de Graaff, J. (mentor); Walstra, D.J.R. (mentor); Westra, M. (mentor); Elzinga, T. (mentor)","2010","Introduction Dong Lam Cement Factory is developing a new clinker plant in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Vietnam. The clinker has to be exported towards Ho Chi Minh City, where it is grinded into cement and used for the construction industry. For the clinker production coal is needed and has to be imported. To make the in- and export possible a new dedicated seaport is required to allow for 15,000 dwt clinker vessels and 7,000 dwt coal vessels. Objective The objective is to design a port with sufficient capacity to handle the predicted cargo flow and which offers acceptable conditions for the ships to enter. The effective berth and hinterland capacity have to be determined such, that turnaround times are within limits. To create safe conditions, the vessels need to have enough space for manouevring in the wet port area. These manoeuvres can be seriously disturbed by wind, wave, currents and siltation on the long term. To ensure the workability of the port these effects have to be limited. Analysis To determine the effective berth capacity the queuing theory is applied. In phase 1 and 2 one clinker and one coal berth satisfy with effective capacities of respectively 700 and 175 t/h respectively. In phase 3 two clinker and two coal berths are needed with the same loading/unloading rates. To get insight in the environmental boundary conditions, field data is collected and analysed thoroughly. In Vietnam the wind climate is governed by the South-East Asian monsoon system, with a dominant SE direction and strong NNE winds. The wave climate is directly influenced by the wind climate and shows a similar pattern. With regard to extreme conditions, once a year a tropical storm lands in the vicinity of the port site. These storms are accompanied by strong wave conditions, coming from E to SE direction. Having frequent waves from the NNE and SE, littoral transport is generated in north- and southward direction. Nevertheless, the northward transport is clearly dominant. Currents are heading SE for most of the time. Synthesis Four different layouts are developed for phase 3 of the project. Two of them are dismissed in an early stage, because of unfavourable conditions. The other two layouts – the 'coastal' and 'offshore' alternative, are evaluated with a cost-value approach. In this approach the value of each design is assessed by means of a MCA. Evaluation The following criteria are taken into consideration: navigation, tranquillity at berth, coastal impact, sedimentation, ease of cargo handling, safety and flexibility. Regarding navigation and wind, wave and current hindrance, no significant differences are found. It turns out that the most important difference is found in the coastal impact. The coastal alternative will cause erosion along 7.5 km of coastline with a maximum retreat of 100 m. Instead, the offshore alternative affects 'only' 3 km with maximum retreat of 70 m. The other element of the cost-value approach is the costs. The investment costs for the coastal alternative are 64.1 M$, which include the dredging works, breakwater and quay construction. The costs for the offshore port amount 77.5 M$, which entails the dredging works, breakwater, jetty quay and trestle construction. The relative low costs for the coastal alternative are achieved by applying the cut-and-fill balance; the dredged sand is used as breakwater foundation. Maintenance dredging costs are 1.75 M$ and 0.9 M$ for respectively the coastal and offshore alternative. To finish the cost-value approach the value/costs ratio is taken for both port layouts. The coastal alternative (0.9) turns out to be a better port layout than the offshore alternative (0.77).","port; wave model; morphological model; typhoon; monsoon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

For over 30 years, KICI’s core business is organising the collecting of used and unwanted clothing. This is mostly done via the 800 KICI containers in the public space. Additionally, clothing can be collected during collecting events or directly via retailers. The collected clothing is sold to sorting companies which sell the wearable and fashionable clothing to Africa and Eastern Europe. The non-wearable clothing is processed by other companies and currently used in low grade applications such as cleaning cloths, non-woven sheet material and insulation material. The second hand clothing which can be worn again (wearable) is the most profitable activity, but the amount of wearable is decreasing for years. The non-wearable part is increasing, but is barely profitable. This trend threatens the existence of KICI in the long term. The assignment was to examine the options for higher grade applications which could eventually lead to an increase in demand for non-wearable clothing and secure the future of KICI and its partners. The solution must found with sustainability in mind. Early on the option of constructing a composite out of textile materials was identified as a promising possibility. Producing and strength testing material samples revealed that Acrylic based composites perform equally or better than the main competitor: non-woven hemp based composite. A Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) showed that the eco-impact (so-called eco-cost) of such a material is lower than glass fibre, but slightly higher than the hemp composite. The ecocost is largely determined by the choice of resin. Most commercially available resins consist entirely or partly of oil based monomers. Better, so-called bio-based resins are under development and will reduce the impact of composites considerably. An estimation of the material cost price revealed that the non-woven textile composites are slightly more expensive than the non woven hemp variant but the composites with woven textile fibres are cheaper, while offering better tensile strength. A new indoor collecting container was chosen as the product which will demonstrate the material. . This container can counter the trend of decreasing wearable clothing temporarily, while demonstrating the material and convincing partners for future products. Alternatively, if KICI can find a committed partner, another product could take the role of material demonstrator. NPSP, a composite manufacturing company, has shown interest in such a product in the form of a counter for a clothing shop. In combination with the other KICI innovation projects, such as the pressed non-woven sheet material and the development of the Identitex automatic sorting machine, the textile based composite can provide the needed stimulus to increase the value of the recycled fibres and ultimately secure the future for KICI.","Textile; Composite; KICI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

ForBuS is based on extensive literature research where the closed loop management system of Kaplan & Norton (2008) is used as basis. ForBuS is an addition to this model as it eases the first two steps of the model, strategy forming and strategy translation, with a practical approach. Out of this theoretical background a theoretical model has been formed to cover the essences of business strategy forming. The design of the tool is based on a preliminary research and six different steps, which contain several different activities. These activities were created from the theoretical background of business strategies and three focus areas. These focus areas, Internal, External and Organizational Variables, have a major contribution in the forming as they reflect the content of a business strategy. Preliminary research is conducted to gain more insight in the company. This is done with desk and action research in the mentioned three focus areas. Customized visuals are created to support the various steps within ForBuS after this research. The first step is the value, mission and vision. By creating future scenarios and describing the ethics, the company tries to describe the values, vision and mission for the company. The second step covers the strategic analysis. This is a important step as various activities are used to assess all three focus areas (e.g. customer analysis, product portfolio analysis and Trends & Developments). Within these activities different techniques are used in combination with the created visuals. The third step involves the strategy forming. Here the findings of the strategic analysis are combined with business strategy factors and the formulation of the business strategy itself. A short evaluation is conducted after this. The forth step is the strategic mapping. Translating the business strategy in strategic objectives is the first step to make it tangible for the company. Complementary objectives can be combined into strategic themes. The fifth step is the balanced scorecard, which translates the strategic objectives into activities, resources, targets and people. The sixth and last step are the strategic initiatives. Clear descriptions of the actions are given to give input to the planning and implementation within the company. Van Egdom B.V. served as test case company. Van Egdom is a leading Dutch water attraction and water treatment manufacturer in the Netherlands. Active in the water leisure industry and with more than 50 years of experience and 5000+ projects world wide a well know company in the market. Van Egdom can serve any customer in the world with a turn-key approach based on an unique set of competencies and an extensive network. Only the preliminary research and the strategic analysis were conducted during the implementation at Van Egdom. Due to high season only two workshops were given. The fifth and sixth step are not covered in this graduation report due to limited time. The reactions on the first two workshops were positive and promising Participants saw the potential usefulness and would like to complete ForBuS during the low season. Although the participants might need to gain more experience in some activities, the overall performance was relatively good seen their inexperience with business strategy forming. Still some recommendations need to be made for ForBuS. The role of the facilitator is very important. He will be in charge of the used information and choice of participants. It is key to choose a competent facilitator to guide ForBuS, who has the appropriate knowledge in the usage of ForBuS and creative facilitation. Applying ForBuS at other companies and implemented by own employees is another recommendation. The graduate has been both developer as facilitator of the ForBuS workshops. Overall fine tuning of ForBuS can be done after the tool has been fully implemented at a couple companies.","business strategy; tool; Kaplan & Norton; Closed Loop Management System; strategy; strategy forming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Creusen, M.E.H. (mentor)","2010","Being a road?maker is a physically hard job. Annually, about four hundred employees in the paving branch become disabled due to the labor conditions. The current legislation concerning the labor conditions of road?workers is in force since January 2010. The starting point of these legal ground can be described as ‘’mechanical, unless’’. These legal grounds are based on the current proven technology. In case of repaving this means that repaving has to been done mechanically unless it is technically not possible. For that reason a lot of effort is invested into mechanization of the paving process. At present there are several proven techniques available for road construction. The development of machines aimed at improving the mechanically repaving process lies behind. Therefore, Boots Machinebouw & Constructies, abbreviated Bomacon B.V., wants to develop a machine for repaving of roads. This machine will has enable to transform used stones into a mechanical package, in order that these are suitable for repaving mechanically. As a result of the fact that concrete stones are being supplied by hundreds of different subcontractors and because the sale, supply and handling numbers of the stones are confidential at umbrella organizations, it is very difficult to divide the market into specific types of stones. The market for brick stones however is comprehensible due to the small number of suppliers. Furthermore, due to the complex market with many different parties involved, it is unclear what the market size is and who the competitors are. It is also unknown who the customer of the machine will be. Before Bomacon wants to start the engineering, they want to investigate if there is a market for the machine which has to be developed. A market research will provide more information about the product specifications. To acquire this data about the paving branch, there has been contact with parties involved; such as paving companies, suppliers of machines, legislation services, communities, contractors and branch organisations. Currently, there are six immediate rivaling companies active in the Netherlands; namely the IGMS Group, Brickclean, Eagle, Sijnja, Nimatech and Vanku. Although their machinery is all produced for the repaving branch, they vary in operation. Moreover, at present there are no machines available at the market that have the correct sales price?capacity proportion and are ergonomically correct at the same time. Through Porters five strengths analysis it has been established that for the company Bomacon it is most appealing to enter into the repaving branch as manufacturer of a repaving machine. Sixteen potential customers (subdivided into three groups; repaving companies, stone dealers and stacking companies) have been interviewed to inventories the whishes and demands of the (Bformat) machine. There is difference in the way potential customers would like to use the Bformat. Firstly, the machine can be used on a deposit, i.e. the machine will form stones on a pallet. Secondly, it can be used on streets. This means the stones are being processed into the street. In the latter example it is not necessary that for the stones to be formed on a pallet. After the development of the Bformat, it will need to be introduced into the market. For that reason a company strategy and a price strategy have been drawn up. A suitable brand and product name have been produced after walking through an six step action plan. The brand name will be Stonematic and the product name will be Stonematic 350. The choice for this decision is based on an extensive literature research. Finally Bomacon has been provided with a indication about how best to communicate with potential customers.","repaving","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-21","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Neger, A.J. (mentor); Sintnicolaas, J. (mentor)","2010","Founded in 2006 by the head of design Jan-Willem Sintnicolaas, Van Nicholas started as a family company. Nowadays, the team is extended by several employees. The founder, Jan-Willem Sintnicolaas, was the main European importer of Airborne Bicycles (USA), until the bankruptcy of Airborne in 2006. Owing to this Van Nicholas Bicycles has mastered more than ten years experience in titanium bicycles. Van Nicholas want to design and create the best possible Titanium frames for their intended application: making bikes go fast. Nowadays Van Nicholas creates bicycles for several applications: road, multi-sport, touring/cross and mountain. Emphasizing mountain biking, shows us that since the development of the sport in the 70’s, many new subtypes of mountain biking, such as Cross-country (XC) biking, All-mountain (AM) biking, Trail biking, Freeride (FR) biking, Downhill (DH) biking, all-day endurance biking - mainly road biking, Dirt jumping, Single-speed, Mountain-cross - also known as 4-cross racing (4X), Dual slalom (DS) biking, Short-cross (SC) biking, North shore biking, Indy-cross (IX) biking and Circle dirt track racing, have been developed. When using a normal mountain bike or a hardtail bicycle (a bicycle with only front fork suspension) on rough terrain, the rider will not be protected from the roughness of the terrain. Although comfort, safety and efficiency are very important when cycling on such roughness terrain. A full-suspension bicycle can offer those three factors and is generally regarded as the master of (downhill) mountain biking. The assortment of Van Nicholas however did only offer hardtail mountain bikes. Because of this ‘hardtail’ assortment Van Nicholas only addressed a part of the whole mountain biking segment. Introducing a full-suspension bicycle to their assortment allows Van Nicholas to address a much bigger segment. In order to design and develop a full-suspension titanium bicycle you have to deal with these three factors of comfort, safety and efficiency. Making the bikes rear wheel move up and down while still retaining good pedalling and braking performance is a technical and very difficult issue. According to Jon Whyte, described as the ‘father of the full-suspension mountain bike’, developing Formula 1 suspension was relatively easy in comparison. Moreover, from literature it is known that other bicycle manufactures take up to 1,5 a 2 year to develop a new full-suspension bicycle. Furthermore, there was the patent issue. All the suspension geometries, with exception of the single-pivot and faux bar designs, are thoroughly patented. From the company owner it was known that Van Nicholas Bicycles did not want to invest in a patented suspension system. Using someone else’s suspension system might not have quite the same cache, but it does save a lot of time, money and effort for other things. Even when using someone else’s suspension system a lot of difficulties are involved. From the mentioned issues, it could be concluded that introducing a full-suspension bicycle based on an existing suspension system without a patent, was the best solutions for Van Nicholas Bicycles. With the results of the research study, a questionnaire was developed. A group of 80 different mountain bikers were asked to fill in a questionnaire with more in-depth questions. The results of this second research study, led to an identified target group, namely a mature, more experienced biker with an age between 20 and 55 years old. This report shows the development of a full-suspension titanium bicycle for Van Nicholas bicycles, namely the Oreios. The Oreios is a full-suspension titanium bicycle based on an existing suspension mechanism, namely the single-pivot suspension technology. This suspension technology is patent free and could be used under any conditions. Within this full-suspension bicycle several own designed components are used, such as the rocker-arm, dropouts and of course the main frame of the bicycle. The other components are Original Equipment Manufacturer components, such as the rear shock, front fork, wheels and many more. The design of the bicycle is designed around these OEM components, without losing the single-pivot suspension technology and the brand style of Van Nicholas. Furthermore, the design is based on the demands and wishes of the intended end user, a 36 years old and experienced biker. The delivery of a possible prototype frame could take up to 6 weeks of waiting time. Therefore, the choice was made not to make a prototype of the full-suspension bicycle. Instead of a working prototype, a 3D model was made. Analyzing this 3D model, using Linkage 2.0, Solidworks and Cosmosworks have led to an optimized design. Moreover, realistic images of the product were made to convince the company and intended users of the Oreios full-suspension bicycle.","Mountain Bike; Full-suspension mechanisms; Titanium; Van Nicholas Bicycles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Within this framework, two components are presented and proposed as solutions for the aforementioned problems. The first is a hardware/software platform for privacy protection of end users of RFID systems. It selectively jams the electromagnetic signals used for communication between components of an RFID system, thus preventing undesired access to private data. The second component is a circuit that can be integrated in RFID chips in order to enhance their level of security. It generates a digital signature using properties of elliptic curves that cannot easily be reverse engineered, thus offering trustworthy means of authenticating the hosting chip. Both components take the attributes of a typical RFID system into account, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing acceptable solutions for existing RFID systems.","RFID; Elliptic Curve; RFID Guardian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","The workability of floating construction equipment is one of the elements in the construction phasing of the design of the Ashdod port extension in the south of Israel by DHV Consultancy and Engineering. Waves play an important role in the workability of floating equipment, since they induce motions to floating equipment with the possibility of adverse effects on the workability. For the purpose of assessing the workability of this equipment in relation to the wave climate during several critical phases of the construction, wave modelling should provide insight. A recent development is the availability of Boussinesq-type models for this type of studies. Boussinesq-type models are phase-resolving, which means that they describe the individual wave behaviour. This gives Boussinesq-type wave models the capability of describing wave propagation in relatively shallow regions (e.g. harbours and foreshores), where nonlinear effects and dispersion play an important role. Boussinesq-type wave models are suited to deal with complex harbour geometries, including modelling of diffraction, partial reflection and wave-wave interactions. In this study, it is investigated whether TRITON, an experimental Boussinesq-type wave model currently under development at Deltares, is suitable for the purpose of workability assessment of floating equipment. The suitability of TRITON depends on aspects like the applicability of Boussinesq-type models in general, the correctness of results and the computational effort for TRITON. As part of this study, the results of TRITON are compared with measurement data from a physical scale model of Ashdod port, which was mainly set-up for measuring moored vessel motions. For the validation of TRITON for the purpose of workability assessments, the Ashdod port extension is used as a case study. The plausible floating equipment scenario for the construction phasing of the Ashdod port extension (consisting of typical dredgers, stone dumpers and crane barges) is sensitive for primary waves within a peak period range of 5-12s. The estimation of the workability limits of the plausible equipment is based on a combination of ship motion theory, information from contractors and personal communication with experts. Based on the present study, TRITON is considered technically capable for the purpose of workability assessments in port applications. The appropriateness for using TRITON in this type of application is however limited by the application range of TRITON – due to the mathematical background of Boussinesq-type models – and by computation times.","wave modelling; port construction; workability; Boussinesq","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","msc thesis","",""

(mentor); Busoniu, L. (mentor)","2010","Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. In RL an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with an environment. The reward is used to improve the policy. Conventional methods of reinforcement learning perform well for simple tasks, but as the task becomes more complex, these methods fail to converge fast or converge to a suboptimal policy. Hence, new methods of RL are needed that can handle complex tasks. As humans, we simplify a task that is difficult to learn by first learning simplified versions of the task, before moving back to the original task. This idea of starting from simpler tasks and gradually increasing complexity, until the original task is solved, can also be exploited in RL, where it is called shaping. In order to accelerate learning in the original task, shaping methods transfer the knowledge and experiences from the easy task (source task) to the original task (target task). It is believed that the process of gradually increasing the complexity significantly reduces the difficulty of the learning problem. However, sometimes the total required time to solve the easy task plus the original task is larger than starting from scratch. In order to reduce this time, an essential decision in shaping is when to transfer learning from an easier task to a more difficult one. Transferring too early may mean the controller has not learned enough in the easy task, diminishing the usefulness of shaping. Transferring too late could make the controller waste learning time in the easy task, without making significant progress toward solving the original, complex task. If we switch the task at a proper point then the total learning time will decrease. The first part of this thesis is devoted to a thorough empirical study of the shaping methods. In the next part we try to find a suitable performance index that can be used as a switching criterion to reduce the total time needed to learn a task.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Strydis, C. (mentor)","2010","As we move towards an aging population, it is likely that an increasing number of people will require an increasing diversity of implants, but at a lower cost to the society. Also, as computer technology progresses, smaller, more powerful, and less battery intensive implants can be designed. However, present implant design methodology is highly inefficient at meeting these goals as it suffers from non-reuse of existing knowledge by relying heavily on custom designs and ASICs. The SiMS project was started with the goal of creating pre-designed, pre-tested, and pre-certified toolbox of components for biomedical implants that can be assembled in a modular fashion for various application scenarios. One of the most important components in such a tool-box is the processor. Designing such a processor is a non-trivial task and previous work has concentrated on studying the effect of changing the processor input-parameters (such as caches), one parameter at a time. The present work represents a shift in this methodology, as we now allow co-variation in all possible input parameters in order to find optimal configurations in terms of the output objectives - power, performance, and area. Towards this end, we implement ImpEDE -- ""Implantable-processor Evolutionary Design-space Explorer"" -- a framework that performs multi-objective optimization of processor parameters, and hence gives as output a Pareto optimal set of processors. The framework consists of a cache simulator and a cycle-accurate processor simulator running benchmarks and workloads designed for medical implants, in order to simulate the optimization objectives. A popular, highly configurable, multi-objective genetic algorithm, NSGA-II, performs the actual optimization. Supporting scripts add modularity by acting as the interface between the genetic algorithm and the simulators, enabling easy replacement with new simulators. The whole framework is parallelized such that extra computation cycles of the idle laboratory CPUs can be utilized, thereby giving a considerable speedup without requiring any special hardware. We perform experiments on the non-dominated solution fronts evolved by the framework on a sub-set of benchmarks, in order to optimize parameters of the genetic algorithm, with an aim towards speeding up convergence. We also examine the effects of changing the workload size run by the benchmarks. A solution Pareto optimal front consisting of optimal processor configurations across all benchmarks is found. This front is used as a reference in order to characterize the benchmarks in the ImpBench suite. Finally, the objective space of the reference front is compared to existing implant designs, and a set of ""generic processors"" are chosen such that all the existing implant applications studied can be covered.","implant; pareto; genetic algorithm; design-space exploration; optimization; power; area; energy; processor; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

Dit is een positieve ontwikkeling, maar bemoeilijkt onderzoek naar de verkeersveiligheid. Er zijn immers minder (recente) ongevallen om te bestuderen. Daar komt bij dat de kwaliteit van de ongevallenregistratie afneemt, waardoor het lastig is om risico’s in kaart te brengen. Een ongevalmodel legt een relatie tussen bepaalde (verkeerskundige) kenmerken van een weg of kruispunt en het aantal ongevallen. Voor het gebruik van een ongevalmodel zijn geen ongevaldata nodig, alleen de verkeerskundige data van de te onderzoeken locatie. Voor opstellen van het ongevalmodel zijn wel ongevaldata nodig. Hierdoor is het een instrument om, zonder ongevaldata, een uitspraak te doen over de verkeersveiligheid. Tevens kan een ongevalmodel gebruikt worden om mogelijke maatregelen te vinden, doordat het model inzicht geeft in de invloed van de verschillende kenmerken. In deze studie is een aantal ongevalmodellen opgesteld voor enkelstrooksrotondes. Meerstrooks- en turborotondes vallen af, daarvoor zijn te weinig data beschikbaar. De studie is uitgevoerd in samenwerking met het Stadsgewest Haaglanden. In een dataset zijn alle enkelstrooksrotondes binnen het Stadsgewest Haaglanden opgenomen waarvoor minimaal 2,5 jaar aan ongevaldata beschikbaar zijn. Er is gebruik gemaakt van ongevaldata van de periode 2003-2008. Dit betekent dat de lengte waarvan de ongevalhistorie bekend is kan variëren van 2,5 jaar tot 6 jaar. Om de rotondes met elkaar te kunnen vergelijken, is het totaal aantal ongevallen per jaar en het aantal slachtofferongevallen per jaar berekend. Deze twee variabelen zijn de afhankelijke variabelen voor de ongevalmodellen. De parameters van de modellen zijn geschat met behulp van de kleinste kwadraten methode. Om de resultaten te verbeteren is een weging toegepast aan de hand van het aantal jaren ongevalhistorie. Rotondes waarvoor een langere periode aan ongevalhistorie bekend is geven een betrouwbaarder gemiddelde en tellen zwaarder mee. Alle modellen moeten, gezien het aandeel verklaarde variantie (R2) en de grootte van de dataset, indicatief benaderd worden. Hierdoor kunnen de modellen niet gebruikt worden voor kwantitatieve uitspraken. De modellen kunnen daarentegen wel gebruikt worden om te bepalen welke kenmerken het meest van invloed zijn op de verkeersveiligheid en welke maatregel het meest effectief is. De modellen zijn vergeleken met de richtlijnen voor het ontwerp van een rotonde. Hieruit is gebleken dat de richtlijn mogelijk een te grote afstand tussen de rotonde en de fietsoversteek aanbeveelt als fietsers uit de voorrang zijn. Het ongevalmodel maakt echter geen onderscheidt tussen de voorrangssituaties, dus een directe uitspraak is niet mogelijk. Verder onderzoek is daarentegen gerechtvaardigd. De richtlijn voor de voorrangssituatie komt ook niet overeen met de uitkomsten van de modellen. Net als in andere studies, blijkt ook uit het model dat het veiliger is om fietsers zowel binnen als buiten de bebouwde kom uit de voorrang te houden. Volgens de richtlijn dienen fietsers echter binnen de bebouwde kom in de voorrang te zijn en buiten de bebouwde kom uit de voorrang.

(mentor); Jellema, A.H. (mentor); Ferwerda, J.A. (mentor); Van Uden, J.C. (mentor); Versluis, S. (mentor)","2010","What if you mix (indoor) gaming with outdoor play? Nowadays children spend much more time indoor instead of outside, playing with friends. Outdoor play is good for both physical as mental development of children, and this problem was the foundation of this design project. Two years ago the idea was risen by Auke Ferwerda to develop an outdoor game console, which in the end has led to ten working models. These products however were mainly developed to obtain functioning prototypes, without having to invest in mass production. The current product is a shoulder band that contains positioning technique, for which four external antennas are needed. The feasibility was leading in this design process, not the user. For this reason a new design track was started with focus on the end user, and that is what this graduation report is about. The assignment was to design a new outdoor game console, which invokes an outdoor game experience that is fun and appealing for children of the age 8-12, and is more physical active than playing indoors. Children should all have their own device to create personal feedback, to be differentiating from the current competition. The end product should be used in the existing neighbourhoods of the Netherlands. It should be possible to play many various games with the designed product, to address a broad target group and to make sure the console remains interesting over time. The to be designed experience will be a mix of the world of gaming as well of outdoor play. A design process was chosen that is based on designing a new experience. When you want design an experience it is important to know the user and its context. For that reason the ViP method was partly used, to research the context and to generate visions about how the product should interact with the user. Together with more conventional idea generation techniques, this resulted in four and ultimately one final concept. A large part of the design project was spend on the research; literature research as well as user research. Many hours of observations were carried out at a primary school, combined with in-depth interviews, creative sessions and play sessions. The goal of this qualitative research was to discover how children nowadays experience outdoor play and gaming; what makes it fun, what are the needs. A good understanding was gained about the context of the user, and the following interaction visions were stated: - encourage - simple - ‘cool’ - trustful - free - Analyses of the context eventually led to more concrete design directions like: the console should offer more complexity and depth than current outdoor games, it should trigger the fantasy and creativity of the children, it should not hinder social communication and should help to find playmates in the neighbourhood. After a long design track, with much focus on the appearance of the product, the communication of game signals and of course the introductory game, the final concept came into life. The end product is a handheld product named the ‘Blop’ and is a stick that communicates through a ring of LED light, sound and vibration. You can operate the stick with three buttons and a turning wheel for changing settings for example. The main operation of this device is however is done by making gestures with it. The final shape has been developed with feedback of the children. They seem to like organic shapes the most. The result is that the Blop has an organic design with an own identity, playful but mature enough to be considered as a console. The two buttons that are located at thumb and index finger are easy and fast to operate. The top button indicates that there is no need for delicate handling - just hit the top and start playing! The Blop has a soft ring to protect it from impact and the bottom has a soft and round shape as well. The organic body fits comfortably in a child hand, and can be firmly held in the fist while running around. To protect the Blop even more a strap is enclosed as well. There was chosen for a handheld product because the feedback of light, sound and vibration is well communicated this way. It encourages to interact with it, and gives the possibility to use gestures as an input. Besides, a stick can be many things in a child’s imagination - a sword, gun, racket, whip, paddle... you name it! The home station of the Blop is not only for charging the device, but is mainly the gate for connecting easily with your friends. The home station is provided with Internet access, so it will connect through your online profile with your friends. Once you arrive home, you press the main button while its in the station. The home station will check if your friends are home. If they are, your blop will light up and start making noises! You can call them over VoIP, or summon him to play through the blop. The game that will be sold together with the blop is an adventure game. First the children will adapt their avatar in front of the PC, and choose skills and powers - this will help them get through the mini challenges that wait ahead. Once they start playing, the children will have to move from home to home (plastic discs) and complete several mini-challenges to reach the secret treasure. At every home you can collect a star (a light that lids up), and if you’ve collected enough stars you can win the level! If you meet your friends at a home you can battle them or cooperate to win extra stars or even a secret key... Are you ready to row, fight, swim and puzzle your way through the levels??","children; play; outdoor; gaming; game console; experience; outdoor game experience; kids; child; game; physical; active; communication; Ultra Wide Band; gestures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","The aviation industry faces a number of challenges: it needs to produce safer, quieter and more efficient aircraft to meet the demands of the airlines and increasingly strict regulations. At the same time, engineers are becoming more scarce because the retirement age of the `baby-boom generation' is approaching. The department of Systems Engineering and Aircraft Design (SEAD) at Delft University of Technology has been developing methods to support aircraft design in order to meet these challenges for the future. One example of such a method is a generic aircraft modeling application, based on Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) techniques, called a Multi-Model Generator (MMG). The ICAD system was used in the past to create such an MMG. Unfortunately, this system has been discontinued. To continue research in this area, there was a need at the SEAD research group to develop a new MMG. The research group has selected GDL as a new KBE system. This system has been used to develop a new MMG. By starting the development work of the MMG as a clean-sheet design, opportunities existed to improve the modeling capabilities of the MMG. One such improvement is the modeling of fully curved wings in a practical way. A wing design procedure has been developed which is intuitive to aircraft designers, based on the planform shape of the wing and its dihedral and twist distribution. Airfoils of any shape can be used in any orientation on the wing. Accurate wing surfaces can be created for several aircraft configurations, including unconventional ones like the box wing and blended wing-body (BWB). The MMG also offers the capability to produce consistent analysis models. The foundations for aerodynamic and structural analysis modules have been laid. For this thesis work, an interface to the 3D panel code VSaero has been developed and tested for clean wings. Procedures to model wings with moveables and 'intersected' wings (e.g. wings with a pylon or fin attached to them) have been developed. With the new MMG, a large reduction in design time can be achieved. It enables the designer to obtain more knowledge about a design in an early phase of its development and eliminates repetitive, non-creative tasks. This is a step towards the further development of unconventional aircraft configurations, which have the potential to become the aircraft for the future.","KBE; Multi-model generator; MMG; VSaero; Aerodynamics; Knowledge-Based Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","","",""

(mentor); De Voogd-Calessen, H. (mentor); Bodlaender, M. (mentor)","2010","Executive Summary This summary shows the “reason to believe in”, and the design process of the Vital Signs Camera (Visica) for athlete swimmers. This is a complete product development project for Philips Research and is my graduation project for the Msc program Integrated Product Design from the faculty Industrial Design at the Delft University of Technology. Camera based HR will improve swim training Camera based heart rate (HR) measuring by means of the Vital Signs Camera (Visica) will improve the trainings of Olympic swimmers. Marcel Wouda said: “I want to use HR to individually tailor the athlete’s training load. If Visica works, it will improve the trainings.” My literature research, observations and interviews with top athletes and coaches of the Dutch national swim team showed that swim coaches still rely on time based training in regular trainings. This might lead to under-training or over-reaching of individual athletes. Lactate and VO2 measurements have proven to be too invasive to use on a regular basis. In land sports, HR is used to monitor and control training intensity, but in elite swimming existing products are too inconvenient. Visica uses the changes in colour of the skin caused by differences in light absorption by the blood due to the heart pulse. The swimmer can now measure his HR during the natural pauses in interval training, without on body sensors. The coach gets direct feedback on the athlete’s HR on his laptop or PDA, enabling him to optimise the training load. Measured data can be stored in a database and on a personal athlete weblog for later analysis and to track individual training progress. Start block version is Dominant Design Feedback sessions using product sketches shown to the end users, made it clear that the new HR technology has a dominant product design preference in the form of a start block version. This version blends in with the swimmers environment, giving feedback on HR at a place where they rest during interval training. Sense & simplicity in User Interface design I designed a simple user interface that contains 3 basic elements: a camera view window to give the swimmer feedback on his position in front of the camera, a HR value and pace clock. This last feature is a counting clock currently situated on the wall of the swimming pool showing the swimmer when to swim again. By integrating it in the UI I created an extra motivation for the athlete to look at the product screen and in the camera. Enthusiastic users The Mock-up I designed was enthusiastically perceived during a user test. Swimmers kept using it even though the HR measurement software was not optimised yet. The test showed the practical use of the Visica during regular swim trainings. It helped to create the optimal screen and camera angle. Furthermore it showed that the end users appreciated the UI with HR, pace clock and camera view window. The success of the Mock-up test was underlined by the reaction of the swimmers: “This product can help to control training goals and is much more user friendly then HR belts”. The future with Visica The Visica will enable coaches to develop currently absent heart rate zones, tailored for swimming and individual athletes. In doing so the product will help coaches to optimise and improve swim trainings and create top athletes that can push the limits.","Design; User-centered Design; Medisign; Heart Rate Monitor; Swimming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","Understanding the Sun's natural processes helps us to understand how the Earth responds to the Sun's variations and helps improve our ability to predict its behavior. A probe in polar orbit around the Sun would be able to help provide a more complete picture of the Sun by studying coronal features from various angles, by linking particle and field observation to images of the Sun, by determining the magnetic structures and convection patterns in the polar regions of the Sun, and by following the evolution of solar structures over a full solar rotation. Previous theses have tackled the transfer from Earth to Solar Polar Science Orbit by using solar sails to propel the spacecraft. An alternative is a spacecraft using solar electric propulsion. This offers the advantage of a spacecraft that is more maneuverable, less mechanically complex, and is based on proven technology. Unlike the solar sail spacecraft however, this requires the spacecraft to carry propellant onboard to perform the transfer. An almost entirely analytical implementation is constructed, featuring the use of the shape-based approach (exponential sinusoid) to model the transfer. The implementation connects multiple shapes by way of gravity assist at specified planets, and uses Edelbaum's theory to model the remaining necessary inclination change, to investigate a transfer from Earth to a solar polar orbit at 0.4 AU distance from the Sun. An optimal solution is sought using an optimization strategy consisting of a random (Monte Carlo) method to perform an initial exploration of the search space, a global (Genetic Algorithm) method, and a local (Nelder-Mead) search method to refine the optimum located by the global method. The goal is to minimize propellant mass and transfer time, while maintaining a realistic transfer that does not violate various imposed constraints (such as departure and arrival velocity). Two solar electric propulsion options are offered (one performing a swing-by at Venus and another performing a swing-by at Jupiter), and compared to a reference solar sailing design. After experimentation it was found that the model is useful for simpler transfers, but a more involving implementation (using multiple separate coasting and thrust arcs) is required to give it the means to tackle more intricate problems. In addition, a more in-depth exploration of the inclination change maneuvers would be beneficial (especially with regards to a distance constrained maneuver).","Sun; Solar Polar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-02","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

(mentor)","2010","Since the completion of the Eastern Scheldt project in 1987, in the south-western part of The Netherlands, there has been a decrease of tidal volume, range and current in the Eastern Scheldt estuary. This has led to morphologic changes in the basin. The channels are in demand of sediment and as the Eastern Scheldt barrier itself blocks most of the sediment transport from the North Sea to the basin, this sediment comes from the intertidal areas inside the basin. As a result, the intertidal areas inside the Eastern Scheldt basin are eroding with consequences for ecology, safety, shipping, recreation and fishery. One of the larger shoals in the Eastern Scheldt is the Galgeplaat. The Galgeplaat is eroding at a high rate. So far the governing processes behind channel-shoal interactions for accretion or erosion of intertidal areas such as the Galgeplaat are not exactly known. The main objective of this research is to get more insight into these processes. A conceptual model of the Galgeplaat is developed which explains the morphologic changes of the Galgeplaat, since the closure of the Eastern Scheldt, with the occurring processes. First, a data-analysis is performed to determine the morphologic changes of the Galgeplaat for the last two decades. After that, a detailed 2DH Delft3D model is set up for the Galgeplaat, including tide, wind and waves to determine the effect of each process on the intertidal area. For wave simulations an online coupling is made with SWAN. The model is roughly validated for water levels, flow velocities in magnitude and direction and wave heights. Several simulations of a spring-neap cycle are performed including the different processes of tide, wind and waves. These processes are switched on or off to stipulate the influence of each process. It is believed that tides are responsible for shoal accretion and waves cause degradation of intertidal areas. This was the case before closure of the Eastern Scheldt and shoals like the Galgeplaat were in morphodynamic equilibrium; there was no net accretion or erosion over time. A performed simulation with today’s tidal characteristics does not show shoal accretion. A simulation conducted with increased tidal velocities, which is thought to represent the tidal flow before the closure, shows that shoal accretion above mean low water does occur. Simulations confirm that waves are the main driving force behind the degradation of intertidal area of the Galgeplaat. During both calm and storm weather conditions the intertidal area is eroding. During calm conditions this erosion is limited, while during storm conditions there is severe erosion. During storm conditions the sediment, brought into suspension due to wave breaking, is mainly transported by the dominant wave-induced currents from the shoal into the channel. The main conclusion of this research is that the tide in the Eastern Scheldt does not have enough shoal building capacity to withstand the destructive forces of the waves. This results in rapid loss of intertidal areas, such as the Galgeplaat. Local nourishments might be able to maintain the intertidal area and thus preserving the values of these areas.","Galgeplaat; Eastern Scheldt; Intertidal area; Delft3D; Channel-shoal interactions; Conceptual model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Verbraeck, A. (mentor); Van Houten, S. (mentor)","2010","The goal of this project is to develop a workforce planning tool. A workforce planning tool is a decision support system (Keen and Sol, 2008) that enables Accenture to make better informed and faster decisions about its future workforce. The workforce planning tool has been developed with a design science approach. This approach is an iterative process where advancing insights dictate the direction of the project (Hevner et al., 2004). This process is especially suited for projects where the end result cannot be clearly defined beforehand because the iterative nature of this approach allows working towards a good solution. Chapter 2 concludes that in order to be able to effectively optimize the organization’s performance, workforce planning can help gaining an understanding with the internal and external dynamics of the workforce of an organization. With these insights a workforce that is better equipped to achieve the business goals can be created. In section 1.5 it is argued that a decision support system should support its users with making better decision not replace them. Not everyone is an expert when it comes to using IT systems. Therefore, according to section 4.5, a decision support tool needs a good looking and clear interface to improve the tool’s usage. A simulation model forms the basis of the workforce planning tool. Discrete event simulation has been picked as the most appropriate method of inquiry for the workforce planning tool Chapter 3 concluded it was best suited to meet the demands that the problem situation put forward. The workforce planning tool is tailored to Accenture’s organization. In chapter 4 several analyses have been done to reveal the structure of Accenture’s organization and its goals. Successful adoption of the workforce planning tool by the organization requires an adoption strategy. In order to determine the best strategy insight is needed into the strategic behaviors of the people influenced by the workforce planning tool. In section 3.1 it is argued that Input data and output data that is used for communicating the tool’s results is very important for the tool’s success. Managing this data is thus an important aspect of the design. Supporting Strategic Workforce Planning 7/117 The Figure below shows what elements the workforce planning tool should have. This Chapter will further specify how these three elements are designed and implemented. THREE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS FOR THE ACCENTURE WORKFORCE PLANNING TOOL The figure below shows a part of the final results of this project. At this screen it is possible to select what experimental scenario the user wants to run. In order to change the scenario’s parameters navigation to other screens is required. MANAGING THE SCENARIO’S The model within the tool has been validated in several different ways. A face validation where the models basic functionality was checked has taken place. For this purpose a special testing mode has been developed. The input of the parameters has been checked. Accenture’s experts evaluated the model’s results for correctness. Added to that a historical data analysis has been done to see if the tool was able to recreate what happened in the past. These tests have all improved the reliability of the tool’s results in their own way. Finally this study has produces several recommendations: 1. Include skills of employees in the tool. 2. Do some research on how the employee demand is calculated. 3. Structure knowledge resources. What skills are present in the current day organization? 4. Improve portability of the workforce planning tool.","workforce planning; simulation; decision support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-05-09","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Management","","","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor)","2010","Young parents nowadays often struggle with the switch from breastfeeding to toddler nutrition and the introduction of new foods to their child in the toddler phase (1 till 3 year). Parents are uncertain what is required in terms of good and healthy nutrition. In addition, parents often experience another big problem; toddlers are often poor eaters which is caused by development changes that occur at this age. Toddlers who have been good eaters often begin to reject new foods and become neophobic (tendency to dislike anything new). As a result of this parents experience much insecurity when it comes to introducing new foods and to what extent following their own intuition is right. Parents really desire confirmation that they are doing the right thing. This report describes the development and evaluation of an interactive book for toddlers: “What kind of vegetable will Daan eat today?” This book creates a positive moment around vegetables aiming to support parents in making toddlers more familiar with vegetables and to stimulate toddlers to try/eat vegetables. The user context was studied by means of a context mapping study to gain insights and understanding in the mealtime experience of parents with a toddler. The idea development process included two in-between evaluations showing scenarios of different product ideas to parents and experts in designs for children. The outcomes of these evaluations led to the idea of an interactive book about vegetables. Two ideas were chosen to be developed further in terms of features and technology. These two concepts led to the final concept of an interactive book which makes use of the matrix codes, a camera and audio feedback elements of augmented reality. The interactive book concept is a combination of a regular printed book with a doll: the book contains images with barcodes and the doll contains a camera, software and a speaker. The book consists of two parts. The first part is about the character Daan who is going to eat a vegetable, but the toddler has to help him choosing the right vegetable and has to help Daan finding this vegetable in the vegetable field, in the supermarket and after cooking. In the second part of the book vegetables are linked to a funny name or story. Through scanning the barcodes of images with the doll audio feedback is given to the toddler through the doll. The interactive book was evaluated by six parents and their toddlers. During this evaluation parents had to read the interactive book together with their toddler. The parents were interviewed about the concept afterwards. Parents thought this book created a positive moment around food and thought it would help them to convince their toddler to try/eat vegetables. Toddlers understood the combinations of the doll, the book and the audio feedback well and were enthusiastic. The results of the test were used for recommendations in terms of design, further research and recommendations for Philips.","Toddlers; Mealtime experience; Interactive book; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

In order to find what the qualities of Homemade Cooking were and what kind of product would be interesting to develop three studies were carried out during this eight month thesis project: a contextmapping study (qualitative), a questionnaire study (quantitative) and an evaluative study (qualitative). The contextmapping study revealed wishes of the users and their view on what Homemade Cooking is. This resulted in a list of qualities that can be attributed to Homemade Cooking. These qualities were subsequently validated using the questionnaire study. This study showed that Homemade Cooking is: healthy, tasty, happy, friendly, informal, safe, open, honest, retro and human. The same questionnaire also presented the respondents with four design concepts (based on the results from the contextmapping study). Out of four concept proposals one concept proved to be the most promising for the respondents because it fitted the most with Homemade Cooking and their households. The qualities of Homemade Cooking were subsequently taken into account to detail the design on a sensory level (e.g. materials, visual appearance, sounds). The result is the Steammet. The Steammet is a (modular) two person tabletop cooking device which can steam, grill and broil food. The products curvature and materials was designed to allow for a friendly look and feel, while the use of silicon materials muffles the sound aiming to create a friendly auditive character. A look and feel prototype was constructed to be used in the evaluative study. The evaluative study showed that the Steammet can be seen as a product which communicates Homemade Cooking quite well while the participants were enthusiastic about the product’s functionality.","product experience; multi-sensory design; homemade cooking; vision in product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The Dead Sea is a tectonically active area with a subsoil consisting of at least eight meters of salt. It is a challenge to construct in this kind of environment, especially since no design criteria exist for constructing on and with salt. Driven by these challenges, the main objective of this thesis is to determine the possibility of using salt as a construction material in this environment. The behaviour of salt is affected by external influences which cause differences in strength and deformation properties due to changes in particle sizes, as a result of bonding between particles (cementation). The fact that the properties of salt can be changed by the surrounding environment makes it difficult to describe the behaviour of salt in general, but on the other hand it enables the possibility of influencing the parameters. The process of particle bonding and its effect on the strength of salt cannot be quantified at this stage, but based on the current knowledge it is expected that, due to compaction and cementation, salt could potentially become very strong material when it is used in a construction. Regarding the expected behaviour of salt as described above, it is believed that salt would be a suitable construction material. Within the framework of salt constructions options for using salt are found in various elements of the design. he suitability of salt as construction material should be verified when better bounds can be placed on the range of geotechnical strength properties that may be assigned to granular salt and the effects of cementation. Overall it can be concluded that using a salt based design for hydraulic structures in this kind of environment could be very promising.
