Due to their size, the mudmats have a significant influence on the hydrodynamic behaviour and installation requirements. It is proposed to change the design of the mudmats from a near solid design to a perforated structure in order to reduce the total loads.<br/>When describing the hydrodynamic behaviour of a structure in a body of water, two terms are of importance: the added mass and added damping. For solid flat plates there is much data available to compute the coefficients for models. However the coefficients are influenced by the degree of perforation and the presence of boundaries. Since there is little information available where the presence of a boundary is combined with a perforated structure, it is proposed to conduct experiments to elaborate on the hydrodynamic behaviour of a perforated structure close to an impermeable boundary. <br/>A total of six scale models were constructed with a perforation ranging from 0 up to 75%, these models were oscillated in the water with different amplitudes, from 10 mm up to 160 mm. These oscillations were performed at different frequencies, from 0.2 Hz to 2 Hz. These tests were performed in still water and subjected to a uniform current of 5 mm/s and a current of 20 mm/s. All data obtained with these experiments was collected and analysed.<br/>The first conclusion drawn from the analysis of the experimental data is that both the added mass as the damping decrease with an increasing perforation. The added damping is found to be larger for high excitation frequencies, however the difference decreases for increasing perforation ratios. The added mass is smaller for high frequencies, but this relative difference does not decrease for larger perforation ratios. Where the damping is not significantly affected by the presence of a current, it is observed that the added mass decreases when a current is present and this effect is larger for lower perforation. The added damping shows linear behaviour when plotted against the amplitude of oscillation, except for experiments where the smallest amplitudes are tested in combination with a low excitation frequency. For the latter experiments a more quadratic behaviour of the damping is observed. <br/>The majority of the energy is found at the excitation frequency. For the added damping it is noticed that similar trends are distinguished for the first order and third order, the energy at three times the excitation frequency. At two times the excitation frequency there is only little energy found for the added damping. For the added mass there is no significant trend observed when comparing the first, second and third order energy at the load signal against the perforation. It is however found that there is a similar trend in the dependency of the added mass on the excitation frequency in both the second and third order, although the energy is decreasing for higher orders.<br","Hydrodynamic behaviour; added mass; added damping; perforated sheet; seabed proximity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In the literature, it has been noted that often path planners are the last step in the planning module of autonomous truck-trailer vehicles, which results in a collision-free track. A trajectory generator can improve this path by making it smoother, which improves passenger comfort and decreases stress on the engine. The available trajectory generators are in their majority based on large number of optimizations, which limits their real-time applicability. This research aims to create a computationally efficient parametric method for trajectory generation that leads to a continuous motion of the vehicle. Using cubic splines, a unique method of parametrization is applied such that a custom velocity profile is defined along the trajectory. Together with choosing appropriate boundary conditions for each path segment, a trajectory is generated that proves continuous reference tangent angle and yaw rate, while following a velocity profile that is continuous in acceleration. This leads to a continuous longitudinal and lateral motion of the truck-trailer vehicle. While continuity conditions are achieved, simulations results showed high reference yaw rate peaks, which could be difficult to track under non-ideal circumstances. An alternative generator was designed based on quintic splines, such that yaw rate peaks can be limited. However, this minimization leads to oscillations of the reference trajectory. A trade-off needs to be defined to balance between minimizing peak yaw rates and oscillations. Closed-loop simulations using a kinematic truck-trailer model show that tracking the generated trajectory lead to continuous steering wheel and velocity input signals. Furthermore, the trajectory was smoothly tracked without the use of an optimal controller. Eventually all research goals have been achieved. Further studies could analyse the performance of the proposed trajectory generator using a dynamic truck-trailer model such that effects of wheel slip and load transfer can be investigated. It is also of interest to analyse the trailer behaviour when tracking the trajectory.","Trajectory; Generation; Truck-trailers; Splines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These kinds of irregular changes can have impacts on drinking water distribution systems with accumulated material, leading to chemical, physical and microbiological deteriorations in water quality with (in)organics release and biofilm detachment. Household connection pipes (HCPs) are the last obstacle reaching customers’ taps. The long stagnation time, non- continuous flow, high surface to volume ratio and high water quality deterioration potential make the HCPs deserve more attention. In this study, the impacts of changing supply water quality from conventional treated groundwater to reverse osmosis treated water on aged HCPs were studied.<br/>Aged HCPs were collected from customers and used for building test rigs in the lab. Three types of water quality were supplied to these HCPs, including Kamerik water by conventional treatment (KA), remineralized RO permeate (RE) and mixed water (MX, 70% RO permeate and 30% KA). Water samples were taken every week and the biofilm were compared before and after switching supply water from KA to MX and RE to reveal the potential changes on water quality and accumulated material in pipes. Whether and to what extent the deterioration would occur in the aged HCPs could therefore be determined.<br/>Changes of water quality revealed that the release of ATP, Aeromonas, Fe and Al may happen in the first 8 weeks and then become stabilized again, no effects on As and Mn, and no release of Ca were observed. From the study related to changes of pipe harbored material, the results showed that less bacterial activity and elements’ accumulation (except for Ca) were observed, suggesting the impacts of changing supply water not only represented by the accumulation of bacterial, but also by inorganic material.","drinking water; Water quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Important changes include the inﬁltration of precipitation, the parametrization of the soil hydraulic functions and the formulation of the soil water extraction by vegetation roots. The performance of the improved LSM version is validated using ofﬂine simulations and observations from the CESAR meteorological observatory in Cabauw (Netherlands), during the year of 2015. An optimal parameter set for this location set is obtained from both satellite retrievals and in-situ observations. In particular, the seasonal dependence of both the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the roughness lengths for heat and momentum is prescribed to the model.<br/><br/>The ofﬂine simulations determined that the improved version of the LSM is able to model the surface ﬂuxes during the year of 2015 with an accuracy of 10 W/m2. This accuracy was found to be strongly dependent on the chosen land surface parameters such as the LAI, the roughness lengths, the soil textures and the vegetation root proﬁles. Furthermore, the lower boundary for soil water transfer, set to free drainage, was found to cause too much vegetation stress after an extended simulation time.<br/><br/>Finally, the LSM is tested in a fully-coupled mode during three different meteorological events observed at the CESAR observatory. Firstly, stratocumulus simulations conﬁrm the importance of the surface evaporation on the development of the stratocumulus layer, which is considerably reduced compared to simulations that assume the surface to be saturated with water. Secondly, the growth of the clear convective boundary layer was found to be greatly affected by the partitioning of the surface ﬂuxes, as the sensible heat ﬂux plays a key role in entrainment. Although the modelled sensible heat ﬂux was found to be in agreement with the observations, the growth of the boundary layer was still substantially underestimated. Lastly, it was found that it is possible to model the main development stages of radiation fog in DALES, despite the fact that the modelled fog layer appears to be too persistent.","Land surface model; Atmosphere; validation; Remote Sensing; Coupling; Cabauw; CESAR; DALES; large-eddy simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","51.970278, 4.926111"

Areas of improvement involve optimizing port time. Currently Jumbo Maritime<br/>requires the onboard cranes to open the hold, decreasing effective use of the cranes. Furthermore an expensive load shifting system is needed when a piece of cargo heavier than 900 tonnes has to be loaded on front of aft of the ship, due to crane limitations.<br/><br/>In this report a study is done into an integrated solution for both issues experienced by Jumbo Maritime. A system that is able to open the hold and to shift a load to front and aft of the vessel. First, specifications of the new system are defined, after which a literature study is done exploring the options currently available in the industry.<br/><br/>After that, multiple concepts are generated, after which an integrated system is selected using a comparison method between concepts. The concept selected consists of a load shifting system using the hatches. Opening of the hold is accomplished by rolling the hatches to the aft where a stacking system is located. First the concept is dimensioned and further designed. The new design incorporates a new seafastening design of the hatches, one of the major challenges encountered in the assignment. The new design is evaluated in<br/>structural sense using the finite element analysis program ANSYS to prove its feasibility.<br/><br/>After structural feasibility is proven, the design is tested to its functional requirements and implications on operations for Jumbo Maritime are considered. The new system could reduce the minimum opening time<br/>of the hold by a factor two and could save around half a million euros on skidding rental costs yearly. As the system is autonomous, the risks involved for humans decrease significantly, beneficial for Jumbo Maritime’s<br/>goal of zero Lost Time Injuries. Furthermore the impact on the stability of the vessel is minimal, so there is no impact on cargo loading operations.<br/><br/>An economic analysis is conducted to see if it is attractive for Jumbo Maritime to convert the current system onboard of the J1800-class vessels. Considering conversion rates of €4/kg for the structural conversion costs, a total conversion time of 33 days, it is proven that it is beneficial for Jumbo Maritime to convert the current vessels, with an overall value investment ratio of 1.04 and the payback time being 5.3 years.<br/><br/>Overall is concluded that a new integrated system for load shifting and hold opening is attractive to further investigate for Jumbo Maritime, both for their current vessels as well as new build vessels.","Load shifting; Preliminary design; Jumbo Maritime; Design methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-31","","","","","",""

Current prevention and treatment procedures are not sufficient to prevent IAI, with a tremendous impact on patients’ quality of life. Preventing IAI at the source of the infection, increases the effectiveness while simultaneously the quantity of the antibacterial agents can be reduced. By synthesising an antibacterial surface, the implant prevents bacteria from adhering to the implant surface as well as infection of the surrounding tissue. Silver and copper nanoparticles have limited reports of resistant bacteria. Combining both agents could aid in the combat against antibacterial resistance by attacking the bacteria with multiple mechanisms. Combining this novel prevention technique with additive manufactured implants, allow it to be compatible with the advancements in orthopaedic implant production. This study demonstrates the synthesis of self-defending implants by simultaneously incorporating silver and copper nanoparticles in a titanium oxide surface grown on additively manufactured Ti6Al4V implants. <br/> Methods: Porous Ti6Al4V implants were designed and manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM). Using plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) a titanium oxide layer was grown on the entire implant surface. By addition of silver and copper nanoparticles along with calcium and phosphate in the PEO electrolyte, multifunctional surfaces were formed on the implants. The nanoparticles were added in silver to copper ratios of 0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, 100/0 and 100/100 to obtain several implant groups. The implant surface morphology was analysed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The composition of the oxide layer was analysed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), to demonstrate the incorporation of both silver and copper nanoparticles in the different silver to copper ratios. silver- and copper-ions release of the implants was measured in a biomimetic environment to characterise the in vitro ion release activity over one month. Subsequently, in vitro antibacterial experiments were performed, against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a resistant and recurring pathogen in IAI. First, the antibacterial leaching activity was measured using a zone of inhibition assay. Secondly, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of silver-, copper-ions and the extent of synergy between the silver and copper ions was measured using a checkerboard assay. Finally, the bactericidal activity of the implants was quantified with a colony forming units (CFU) assessment.<br/> Results: The PEO process resulted in the formation of an oxide layer with simultaneous incorporation of silver and copper nanoparticles. SEM and EDS analysis showed that the silver to copper ratio added to the electrolyte determined the nanoparticle ratio present in the oxide layer. The ion release showed silver- and copper-ions releasing over one month. The implants with both silver and copper nanoparticles showed a lower release of silver ions and a higher release of copper ions with respect to the implants with a single nanoparticle. The antibacterial leaching activity assessment showed limited leaching for the copper implants, good leaching for the silver implants and a decreasing leaching area when silver was combined with copper. The MIC of silver ions was 0.016 mM, of copper ions, 10 mM and combined 0.002 mM silver- and 5 mM copper-ions. Finally, the CFU assay showed adhering bacteria on all implants after 24h incubation and no inhibition against non-adhering bacteria.<br/> Conclusions: The PEO process allowed for the simultaneous incorporation of silver and copper nanoparticles in the formed oxide layer, without affecting the porous geometry of the SLM manufactured implants. Combining silver and copper nanoparticles in the oxide layer promotes the cumulative Cu2+ and inhibits the Ag+ release. The Ag and Cu nanoparticles present in the implants did not prevent bacteria from adhering to the implants.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The domestication of dogs was probably initiated over 15,000 years ago, when presumably proto-dogs took advantage of carcasses left behind by our hunter-gatherer ancestors and might have offered protection in return (Thalmann et al., 2013). This has resulted in a relationship, purposeful for both dogs and humans. Humans have increased the dogs’ chances of survival, by ensuring a more steady supply of food and providing them with shelter and protection. It has also given dogs the opportunity to fulfil different purposes in our lives. During the time that has elapsed their roles have varied from providing a source of transportation, food, body warmth, companionship and aid during hunting (Manwell &amp; Baker, 1984). The purpose a modern dog has, is either to fulfil a ‘companion’ or ’utilitarian’ role in our lives. Although these are meaningful purposes, there are opportunities for making the relationships, in which a lot of potential is already embedded, even more purposeful for both humans and dogs.

For p+ c-Si surface passivation, the influence of thermal ALD Al2O3 film thickness and Forming Gas Annealing on Al2O3/SiNX stack is studied. Also an optimal p+ surface with 123 Ω/sq sheet resistance is formed by boron ion implantation approach, which provides space to play with the trade-off between surface passivation and lateral carrier transport for emitter and front/back surface field. <br/>Applying optimized results, bifacial solar cell fabrication enables only one-time high temperature annealing for both highly doped poly-Si and lightly doped c-Si activation.

The sign gantries have in total four oblique columns instead of two straight columns and have a triangular shaped spatial truss beam. The design loads that are currently taken into account include the effects of the self weight, natural wind and settlements. This research focuses on the structural response to vehicle induced wind loads.<br/><br/>The vehicle induced wind loads cause a vibration of the truss beam mainly in its first horizontal mode. The vibration of the beam can be modelled by discretizing a simply supported Euler-Bernoulli beam with rotational springs at the supports that take into account the rotational stiffness of the columns. From literature the vehicle induced wind load is characterized as a pulse load, which is applied to the discrete beam model. The mass, stiffness and damping matrices are used to compute the structural response numerically in the time domain using MATLAB. This numerical calculation model is verified and fitted to the full scale measurements. The measurements were performed with multiple video cameras that were focussed on specific details of the structure and the vehicles that pass the structure. It was found that it is possible to approximate the amplitude of vibration in time using a single pulse load for trailer trucks and trucks.<br/><br/>The stresses in the structure are calculated by applying a deformation that was caused by vehicle induced wind loads to a calculation model with bar elements in MatrixFrame. These stresses are compared with the cut off limit for fatigue detail classes. Based on the preliminary measurements and the calculation model it can be concluded that no fatigue damage is caused by vehicle induced wind loads for the newer series of structures (2012). The older series (2005) could encounter fatigue damage, but it depends on the span length of the beam.","sign; support; structures; steel; fatigue; truck; induced; wind; loads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

Soil material damping is an important input parameter for modelling the structural response and energy dissipation, especially for embedded and lightly damped structures, as in particular for offshore wind turbines. Non-invasive in-situ measurements like the multichannel analysis of surface waves, offer cost-effective solutions and estimations over a wider volume of soil. This research aims to demonstrate that MASW technique can be used to generate a reliable in-situ estimation of the soil damping in marine environments in the depth range of 0-30m.<br/>A unique and high-quality dataset has been made available through a collaboration with the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI). Shear wave data are rarely available for offshore site investigations and have not been used before for a damping inversion from real surface waves measurements. Moreover, also the horizontal soil response was recorded in this measurements which allow for reducing the uncertainties of the results obtained by using the Scholte wave model. Therefore, two forward waves models are implemented in Matlab to reproduce both the in-line and cross-line measurements.<br/>A reliable shear wave velocity profile is derived via the stiffness inversion method, after which the damping inversion is performed. A modal damping inversion method is developed and it uses a novel modified random search algorithm in order to estimate the material damping profile over depth. The attenuation coefficient is chosen as the reference parameter for the damping inversion and the misfit function for the damping inversion is defined as the normalized difference per frequency of the attenuation curves. The measured attenuation coefficient is extracted based on a modified half-power bandwidth method. The modelled attenuation curve is retrieved as the imaginary part of the complex wavenumber. The wavelet compression technique is employed to reduce the number of roots used in the inversion for both the experimental and the theoretical curves. The identification requires solving an inverse problem with a global optimization method. To get a better understanding of the model and computational time, a combination of sensitivity studies, behaviours of the phase damping ratio curves and layer reduction were performed. Then, synthetic<br/>inversions are run to verify the validity of the proposed technique. Finally, the<br/>method is applied to the aforementioned collected data and two damping profiles (Scholte and Love models) are computed and they show good agreement in terms of both trend and magnitude.<br/>The frequency dependence of the material damping ratio of the soil is analysed<br/>from the use of measured surface wave data. A novel technique is proposed for retrieving this relation starting from the results of the damping inversion and it shows that the material damping ratio is independent from frequency. Then, two new alternative approaches are proposed, which are based on a simplification of the traditional dependency relation. The first confirms the frequency independence of damping while, although it seems very promising, the second one cannot be tested due to computational limitations. The demonstrated frequency independence of the material damping is only valid based on the frequency ranges available in the dataset and cannot be generalized to cover all scenarios.","MASW; Damping Estimation; Attenuation Analysis; Frequency dependence damping; Damping Inversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-31","","","","","",""

Traditional approaches usually rely on how a given feature or features change between successive images in a sequence. However, a single static image might contain motion information that could potentially be lever- aged to estimate the optical flow. It can be hypothesized that motion blur and context of the scene are two sources of mo- tion information in static images. This research work has two main goals, one is to investigate the prospect of using a learning-based framework to model a mapping directly to camera ego-motion velocity. The second goal is to ana- lyze the contributing features in learning such a mapping.

The company, for which the project was executed, is mainly focused on manufacturing flight-deck seating for the airline industry (pilot seats for airliners). Their biggest and main client is Boeing, for which they provide all airliner flight-deck seats.<br/><br/>A graduation report ‘Back injuries among KLM pilots’ (Vaart, 2009), showed that the graduation company’s flight-deck seat pan and backrest contour does not provide a good sitting posture. They both initiate a slouched seating posture, which can lead to severe back problems (Al-Eisa, et al., 2006). Due to the lack of ergonomically designed flight-deck seats, pilots seemed to be more absent compared to other airline employees. In fact, KLM pilots report much more absenteeism (5,8%) due to back problems than the average KLM employee (4,4%) (Vaart, 2009). <br/><br/>The first goal of the master thesis was to highlight multiple ways of improving the flight-deck seats in order to reduce discomfort among airline pilots. This was achieved by analysing the seat, analysing the flight-deck, interviewing pilots and by co-operating in an extensive user research on Boeing 737 aircraft. It appeared that most airline pilots are obligated to use tablets, for filling in checklists and doing calculations. However, they do not have an assigned place for the tablet on board the flight-deck. Additionally, data from the user research showed that pilots perceive most discomfort in the upper back and often adapt into a slumped seating posture due to reaching for the flight-deck controls, using the tablet or during reading activity. Furthermore, the pilots seemed to have a large area of visual attention, which causes them to move their heads from side to side. These findings lead to the final search area, formulated into the following design goal:<br/><br/>“Designing a tablet holder to reduce discomfort among airline pilots”<br/><br/>The tablet holder design can reduce discomfort among airline pilots while enhancing their work environment and supporting growth towards future technology advances in the flight-deck. The product can be beneficial for the aircraft manufacturer and the airline. It enables the aircraft manufacturer to work towards making airplanes easier to control. Additionally, a platform to incorporate flight-control systems into the tablet could act as the instigator for a distributed, air/ground, socio-technical system. Both aspects that adhere to the growing demand of pilots and which supports the change towards single-pilot operated aircraft. Additionally, the tablet allows the aircraft manufacturer to get rid of a fixed EFB and allows the airline to work towards a digitalized documentation system, which can be accessed through the tablet.<br","tablet holder; flight-deck seat; cockpit seat; aviation; designing for pilots; ergonomics; comfort; discomfort; airline; airliner; Boeing 737","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Offshore standards and design codes provide local buckling checks for combined loading criteria for load controlled and displacement controlled conditions, where a load controlled condition is defined as a case in which the structural response is primarily governed by the imposed loads and a displacement controlled condition is defined as a case in which the structural response is primarily governed by imposed geometric displacements. It is recognised by the offshore pipelaying industry that the condition with the pipeline on a rigid stinger in S-lay is not fully displacement controlled. Using the methods by DNV only allows for situations that are either 100% load controlled or 100% displacement controlled to be checked. In order to account for partially displacement controlled conditions, a method is needed to calculate the level of displacement control in a specific situation and to translate this to a partially displacement controlled buckling check.<br/><br/>This graduation thesis proposes a method to calculate the level of partial displacement control of an S-lay pipeline installation situation using pipe stiffness variations in beam elements. First, a static pipelaying configuration is modelled using beam elements. Next, the same situation is modelled with a different pipe stiffness over the stinger section. The changes in moment and curvature at the rollerbox locations between the base case and the modified model give an indication of the level of displacement control on the stinger. An approach to translate the calculated level of displacement control to modification of the displacement controlled buckling check by DNV is presented. <br/><br/>Detailed finite element models composed of shell type elements are created to validate the proposed method. A first step towards validation of the proposed method has been taken with satisfactory results. The calculated levels of displacement control with the proposed method are within 2% of the calculated level of displacement control in the detailed partially displacement controlled model using shell elements. The use of the proposed method allows the calculation of the level of displacement control using Euler-Bernoulli beam element models and with reduced computational time.<br/><br/>A parametric study is performed using the proposed method to study the effect of most relevant variables in the S-lay configuration on the degree of partial displacement control. The effects of the stinger radius; rollerbox spacing; rollerbox load; lay tension; pipe diameter; and pipe diameter to wall thickness ratio have been studied, giving greater understanding of the partially displacement controlled behaviour.<br/><br/>The research done in this thesis provides an engineering approach to determine the partially displacement controlled conditions in the S-lay configuration using stiffness variations in Euler-Bernoulli beam element models. First steps have been taken to validate this engineering approach with satisfactory results. A method for modifying the displacement controlled local buckling check to account for partially displacement controlled conditions is presented, as well as an understanding of the influence of most relevant pipelaying variables on the partially displacement controlled condition.","stinger; overbend; S-lay; buckling; displacement control; load control; partial displacement control; weak link","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Since localization based on VLC requires active modulation of light sources, this limits the amount of light sources that can be used for localization. Furthermore, in some situations there might not even be a controllable light source present (for example outdoors). To extend the use of light-based localization schemes, this thesis looks into a way to achieve the same result as current VLC localization methods in a passive manner, i.e. without control of the light sources. <br/><br/>Previous work has been done on passive ambient light-based localization by Wang et al.: objects are equipped with unique barcodes, that reflect ambient light in a distinct manner. The reflected light is received by photosensors, from which their ID is obtained. However, this work has focused on identifying large-sized objects in one dimension. Using the same principle for localization of small-sized objects, and in two dimensions, are open challenges that this thesis addresses . <br/><br/>The work presented here forms a proof-of-concept of a passive light-based localization system for two-dimensional, real-time tracking of small-sized objects. In order to achieve this, a special enclosure has been designed, giving simple photosensors the ability to distinguish small-sized objects without compromising their FOV. With this enclosure, a single photosensor can detect barcodes down to 7 cm in size in the test set-up, while distinguishing up to three different IDs. A particle filter has been implemented to combine detections from different photosensors into a single estimate of an object’s location. <br/><br/>The localization system is designed around the robots designed by a MSc student at the Embedded Systems group at TU Delft. By moving these robots at a speed of 15.4 cm/s in a straight line through the test set-up, a localization error of 4.8 cm is obtained.

Injection of CO<sub>2</sub> in the subsurface geological formations can distort local thermal, chemical and geomechanical equilibria. As such, it results in highly coupled (thermo)physical effects in the near wellbore region, referred to as “near wellbore effects”. In this work, qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the near wellbore effects in depleted gas fields on macroscopic scale are provided. The primary focus is on the thermal effects (i.e., Joule-Thomson effect, water vaporization and CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution) and specific chemical effects (i.e., salt precipitation and hydrate formation). Occurrence and the corresponding magnitude of certain near wellbore effects influence the injectivity of CO<sub>2</sub> both positively and negatively. In several occasions these effects can lead to severe reduction of the injectivity. To accurately model these effects, thermal multi-component multi-phase simulations are conducted using both TOUGH2-ECO2MG and CMG-GEM commercial-grade simulators. Important is that these simulations include precipitation of salt and phase changes of CO<sub>2</sub> during repressurization of the reservoir. Extensive sensitivity study on numerous 1D, 2D and 3D reservoirs with various injection parameters and degrees of heterogeneity is carried out. A comprehensive 3D geological model of the nearly depleted P18-4 gas field (located in the Dutch North sea) is also investigated, in order to examine the near wellbore effects in a real-field application. Moreover, the potential control of the near wellbore thermal effects by interplay of controllable operational parameters (e.g. rate, temperature or composition) and the local reservoir pressure and temperature conditions is presented. Results reveal that the high injection rates targeted for real CO<sub>2</sub> injection (i.e., 1.1 Mt/yr) in combination with low initial reservoir pressures (&gt; 40 bar) and a large reservoir volume provide favorable conditions for development of predominantly excessive cooling effects (15 <sup>o</sup>C) near the wellbore. Injection of CO<sub>2</sub> in gaseous conditions at low temperatures can cause such strong cooling that hydrate can form, which can potentially jeopardize the injection process due to clogging of the reservoir. However, as for its specific geometry and well location, the thermal effects are significantly less pronounced in the P18-4 field model. Besides, heterogeneity of the formations plays a key role in the distribution of the appearing effects along the wellbore. Overall, for the considered cases, the injectivity is found to be enhanced rather than decreased by the studied near wellbore effects, with the proviso that the conditions in the near wellbore region remain outside the hydrate formation window.","CO2 injection; Near wellbore effects; Depleted gas reservoir; CCS; Joule-Thomson cooling; Hydrate; Salt precipitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renewable sources will play an important role in future energy generation due to societal developments. These distributed energy resources introduce new challenges to our current electrical power system.

Another challenge is the intermittent nature of renewable sources such as solar and wind energy.

Application of the Blockchain to the electrical power system could oer solutions to some of these challenges that the future electrical power system will face. The main goal of this thesis is to identify the opportunities, advantages and technical challenges of applying the Blockchain to the electrical power system. First, as part of the literature study the Blockchain has been studied and the operation of the Blockchain has been analyzed. The Blockchain has been dened as a collective of technologies that can be described as a database, which is distributed among a peer to peer network, combined with securitization elements relying on multiple cryptographic technologies. Second, the opportunities where the Blockchain could be applied in the current electrical power system were identied. In order to study the application of the Blockchain to the electrical power system four case studies have been introduced. These case studies dierentiate themselves in the level of adoption of the Blockchain and the functionality which could be provided to the electrical power system. Ranging from a local peer to peer trading infrastructure to the entire market being operated via the Blockchain with advanced features such as the control of power ows. Third, the various advantages of applying the Blockchain to the electrical power system have been explored based on the proposed case studies. A distinction has been made between advantages which are inherently linked to the characteristics of the Blockchain and the provided functionality to the electrical power system. Fourth, the challenges of applying the Blockchain to the electrical power system have been analyzed and discussed. Based on the dierent case studies a segregation has been made between challenges attributable to the characteristics of the Blockchain and challenges specically linked to the implementation of the case studies. Last, the practical application of the Blockchain to the electrical power system of the dierent case studies have been discussed.

In this study, four case studies were analyzed and studied in order to identify the dominant aerosol type over the city of Nicosia in Cyprus: 05 April and 07 April 2015 and 17 April and 21 April 2016. More specifically, vertical profiles of the extinction and backscatter coefficient, Ångström exponent, particle linear depolarization ratio and lidar ratio were manually retrieved from the lidar signal for each case study. For the first case, the main aerosol load was observed in the very lower atmosphere, between 0.25 and 1.25 km. The observed aerosol optical properties indicated the strong presence of maritime aerosols. In the second case study, the aerosol layer was thicker and it was observed between 1.6 and 7 km. Analysis of the optical properties showed that the predominant aerosol types within the PBL were mainly maritime aerosols and aerosols from local sources while higher in the atmosphere the aerosol load consisted of dust mixtures. The third case study, on 17th April 2016, was a relatively clean day and a thin aerosol layer was observed between 0.25 and 2.0 km consisting mainly of maritime and urban aerosols. 21st of April 2016, which was the fourth case study, was a dust event case study. The aerosol load, accumulated between 2.0 and 5.0 km, was characterized as a purely dust layer. The results obtained with the manual retrieval method, were compared with automatically retrieved profiles (provided by the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research) and are in good agreement. More specifically, for the vertically resolved extinction profiles at 532 nm the correlation coefficient values ranged between 0.9784 and 1.

The experimental data of the two-story building experiment at the University of Pavia is used.<br/>Two different types of models are made, a continuum model and a beam model, with each two different modeling approaches, the three-zoned approach for the piers and spandrels and a uniform model. The three-zoned approach uses the bed joint tensile strength at the ends of the piers and spandrels, and the maximum tensile strength at the center of those element to simulate rocking and shear failure respectively. The most important results are:<br/> The three-zoned approach in combination with a continuum model was able to describe the failure mechanism of the façade and perform the analysis stable, with a maximum tensile strength adjusted to f_tu=0.08 MPa. Shear failure in the piers was dominant. As a lateral push-over load was used and not a cyclic load as in the experiment, the maximum load of the structure was for most displacements somewhat higher than in the experiment, but the maximum load was 150 kN in both cases. The displacement of 22 mm in the experiment was not reached, but a displacement of 10 mm.<br/> The beam model analysis aborted early as a result of a reduction of the initial load factor. It was found that the fixed crack approach in combination with high shear forces in the structure resulted in a fixed crack coordinate system that was rotated from the beam axis. Principal stresses could exceed the strength of the material and wrong integration points were damaged reducing their strength severely. At this stage a maximum displacement of 5 mm is reached while the force is 165 kN, higher than in the experiment. The structure responds very brittle.<br/> Shear stresses in the beam element model exceeded the strength of the material. Adding shear interfaces in an SLA will result in a more correct failure pattern. <br/> For the beam model, a sensitivity check was done for the mesh size, fracture energy, number of saw-teeth and number of integration points. All values were accurate enough. <br/> A relation exists between an initial load factor reduction and the opening of a crack in the corresponding integration point that damages at an initial load factor reduction. <br/>In conclusion, the results of this thesis confirm the potential of the SLA to accurately approximate the behaviour of an URM structure as it was possible to run a stable analysis with accurate results for the continuum model. The beam model gave similar results in terms of forces and bending moments compared with an incremental iterative approach, but the analysis was aborted early. New developments like a rotating crack approach and shear interfaces will result in a more stable analysis as the right failure behaviour will be followed resulting in a more accurate load-displacement relation.<br/><br","SLA; Sequentially linear analysis; Equivalent frame method; Pavia experiment; Earthquake analsyis; Unreinforce masonry structures; URM; Finite Element Analysis; FEA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

Experience in the past decades has shown that at-plate solar heat panels can play a role in the energy system of the future, in particular in solar collector fields for district heat generation. This thesis concerns the dynamical modelling of such solar district heat plants <br/> (SDHPs). As the upswing of SDHPs occurred rather recently, research on their optimal control is ongoing. The main challenge for control is to adapt to fluctuations in solar radiation and other inputs in an optimal way, ensuring a high and stable outlet water temperature to the grid while minimizing flow fluctuations. Many modelling efforts of single collectors as well as full solar heat<br/>fields have been reported, although mostly in the form of detailed physical models.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a new approach for describing the dynamics of a large at-plate solar field is proposed. We develop a continuous-discrete stochastic state space model suitable for prediction and control. This model form combines knowledge from physics and information from data, thereby allowing for relatively simple formulations while modelling complex dynamics. Retaining a physically meaningful model formulation has additional advantages for model development, as analysis of residuals and outputs can provide information on suitable model extensions. A basic model was formulated and systematically extended in a forward selection procedure, using a.o. likelihood ratio tests. The<br/>model development was based on May 2017 measurements from an Aalborg CSP solar heat plant in the municipality of Solrød , Denmark. The models are implemented using the R-package CTSM-R, which includes parameter estimation methods based on maximum likelihood estimation and the<br/>extended Kalman filter.<br/><br/>It is found that the developed model is suitable for very short term (minutes to hours ahead) to short term (day ahead) prediction, as needed for control and heat output forecasting of a SDHP. It includes several new aspects compared to existing models, the most notable being non-parametric modelling of shading effects and a split of total radiation into diffuse and direct components. Including these elements improves model predictions considerably, and allows for asymmetric panel effciency over the day. Detailed analysis of the model's predictive performance is provided, including a comparison to current ISO standard model and the current Solrød control scheme, as well as a cross-validation on data from different seasons. In future work, the model's performance when using input predictions from weather forecasts should be tested. The model should further be used in a model predictive control scheme in order to improve current SDHP control strategies. This would lead to a smoother pump operation, thereby reducing electricity consumption, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions.<br","Stochastic modelling; Stochastic Differential Equations; State Space Model; Filtering; Solar Heat Panel; Solar District Heat Plant; Maximum Likelihood Methods; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-30","","","","","",""

Therefore, the following mission was stated:‘’I want people to be able to express exclusivity though conduct ,whilst being assured of their personal significance.’’In order to preserve current interaction qualities in a new context, the following analogy for the product-user relationship was described:“Like walking your German Shepherd Dog through the woods’’. During synthesis, an interaction gap was discovered. Current interior concepts aimed at level 4 autonomous diving mainly focussed on technical solutions. Situations were approached as if the customer and car were already cooperating successfully. However, in order to achieve a successful cooperation, both parties first have to trust one another. MIND introduces the artificial intelligence of the car immediately after ordering. During the time it takes to produce the car, referred to as “Transcendence”, the customer teaches MIND his preferences and character traits by allowing it to follow and observe him. MIND proves itself step by step with the assistance of augmented reality. This gradually generates a meaningful relationship between product and user and lowers the emotional threshold to accept future mobility. Feedback on progress made by MIND is communicated by the development of a unique pattern, visible on a physical manifestation of MIND.<br/><br/>- Premium by means of exclusivity is achieved though the developed character of MIND, which is unique and personal to every customer. <br/>- Exclusivity through conduct is achieved by including the customer. Providing effort and being rewarded with something truly personal creates a meaningful experience. <br/>- MIND obtains assurance by proofing its capability in a safe environment, generating confidence. <br/>- The customer is furthermore assured by the transparency of data traffic and storage. <br/>- Personal significance is confirmed through the reactiveness of the pattern.<br/><br/>- MIND is beneficial to the development process at Mercedes-Benz by providing real-time, actual data instead. <br/>- It provides Mercedes-Benz as brand with the opportunity to manifest itself as a mobility provider without the necessity of a physical car.<br/><br/>MIND as a concept provides a train of thought about expressing premium through behavior rather than possession. It can serve as inspiration for smaller-scoped design briefs. It can provide the bridge between user wants and technical developments. Finally, MIND can be applied beyond ownership in shared mobility and public transport systems. Moreover, it can be applied beyond the context of mobility, positioning Mercedes-Benz as life companion rather than mobility agent.","Mobility; Premium; Autonomous driving; personal data; Safety; User Product Relationship; Personal Significance; Exclusivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

A model has been set up to evaluate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a floating barrier in regular waves. The barrier was simulated using a numerical model as wave tank. This numerical wave tank has been preliminarily verified with the linear wave theory, in order to optimise the mesh resolution. The numerical model uses fluid-structure interaction to model the flow around a rigid body, the barrier. The hydrodynamic coefficients were in post-processing determined from the response of the numerical model, with the Morison equation, by means of a least squares method. <br/>The barrier with 2 degrees of freedom, sway and heave, has been compared to model tests performed at MARIN with 3 degrees of freedom, sway, heave and roll.

(graduation committee); van Dalen, Karel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Since the oil price collapse at the end of 2014, operators in the offshore industry experience a decline in revenues and a need for downsizing. Simultaneously, the wind industry is growing every year, as an increasing amount of companies and consumers are investing in green energy. This creates opportunities for Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC), as they have ample experience in offshore installations, operations and maintenance. Currently, in most cases a Jack-Up Vessel (JUV) is used to install offshore Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). With the exception of Hywind, a wind farm of floating wind turbines commissioned with a Semi-Submersible Crane Vessel (SSCV) near shore and thereby protected from large waves, there is little experience in installing large WTGs with a floating vessel in offshore sea states. Current trends in Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) development are the upscaling of WTGs and installations in deeper waters, both resulting in more complex operations. In the current market however, there are many installation operators with lower priced JUVs. Therefore, to compete and make it economically viable for HMC to enter this industry, HMC must be able to install WTGs at a faster rate than the rate of conventional installation vessels. The main objective of this master thesis is to determine the economic and technical feasibility for HMC to enter the offshore wind industry as an installation operator. First, the attractiveness of the offshore wind market is analyzed. For the analysis of the offshore wind market as a business environment the theoretical framework ‘PESTLE’ is applied. Through the application of the ‘Porter’s Five Forces’ model, the competitive position of HMC as an potential entrant to the offshore wind market is analyzed. Second, insight is gained under which conditions it is economically feasible to use a SSCV for the installation of 10 MW WTGs. Different logistical methods are compared in terms of installation time and installation costs, as a function of site particularities, and by comparing the use of a JUV, a purpose-build installation vessel and a SSCV. As the installation of WTGs makes up a significant percentage of the total costs of a project, the workability of the installation vessel is of great importance. To address the technical feasibility, this thesis aims to quantify the influence of wave forecast on the workability of installing a fully-assembled 10 MW WTG with a SSCV. The offshore wind market in the North Sea as a business environment is evaluated to be attractive. Additionally, there is a large potential for building new OWFs in the North Sea and governmental support is significant and assumed to be stable in the future. The trends that OWF development moves into deeper waters and further offshore, as well as the increase in size of wind turbines are all positive for floating installation vessels with larger crane capacity, as many JUVs have reached their maximum capacities. Although the barriers to enter the OWE industry are high, the power of the OWF developers is significant and the price competition among installation operators is fierce, the threat of alternative WTGs becoming mainstream is small due to economies of scale and the enormous potential of new OWF development. It is recommended to enter the market with a HMC SSCV and focus on the installation of extra-large WTGs (≥10 MW) and thereby succeed in the offshore wind market by specialization. Based on the current ECN Tool (version 2.1) and the assumptions made, it is economically feasible to use an SSCV for the installation of completely pre-assembled wind turbines in a large OWF (&gt;1500 MW). In the scenario used in the ECN Tool, the duration of the WTG lift, installation and the SSCV sailing to the next TP should be less than six hours. According to the industry, a great concern is the movement of the SSCV during the set-down, and thereby making it a complex operation with impact loads that are more difficult to predict. Wave forecasting is the key that can take away this concern, however it is still an ‘unproven innovation’ in the industry. With the use of a 2 minute wave and motion forecast, the waiting on weather for the ‘WTG lift’ and ‘WTG set-down’ on the TP can be reduced from 28 hours per turbine to 7 hours for the ‘WTG lift’ and 48 minutes for the ‘WTG set-down’. Subsequently, based on a 2 minute wave and motion forecast, the impact load on the bottom of the tower and the TP can be reduced by 13 % by choosing an optimal sea elevation for the set-down moment. As the average waiting on weather time is relative high for installing the third blade and lifting the WTG, it is furthermore recommended to investigate the influence on wave radar forecast on these steps. The implementation of wave radar technology during the installation process, is to be investigated further.","Offshore Wind Turbine; Wind Turbine Installation; SSCV; Installation Vessel; Workability; Installation Sequence; Installation time; Resonance; Impact loads; Market Entry Study; Offshore Wind Market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-29","","","","","",""

A problem in these systems is often that a mismatch between input and output is present due to variable solar irradiance and energy demand. To compensate for this mismatch storage is utilized to store heat during times when excess heat is present, which is subsequently released when the energy demand exceeds the<br/>solar irradiance input. Phase change materials are a novel concept used to store heat by utilizing the energy required for a phase change and can be added to a heat transfer fluid tocreate a slurry with enhanced heat storage capabilities.\<br/><br/>A study has been conducted to identify characteristics of materials that are suitable for heat storage in a phase change material slurry and selected materials accordingly. This has been done for the specific operating temperature range between 200 ∘C to 300 ∘C. Using these materials a numerical model of a phase change material slurry has been developed to determine which parameters influence the performance of such a system and to establish a system that shows optimal thermal performance. To check if such a system is a good option for heat storage a comparison is made with a heat storage system where the phase change material is stored in a shell and tube packed bed.<br/><br/>A numerical model has been developed using the apparent heat capacity method to model the phase change. An analysis is performed to find the optimal sizing of the phase change slurry system. With use of a test case, a day with variable solar irradiance input and a fixed energy demand, the transient behaviour of the systems has been tested. A second comparison has been made for scaled up systems to limit the costs of the systems.<br/><br/> LiNO3 has been selected for the phase change material, encapsulated with engraved natural graphite, suspended in MarloTherm A. For the test case 91 643 units, a combination of a collector and heat exchanger to the organic Rankine cycle, are required when these are<br/>designed for optimal thermal performance. The total mass of phase change material required equals 6575 kg, including storage. When applying the same sizing to the shell and tube packed<br/>bed model it has been found that it can not meet the energy demand at all times throughout the day. Scaling up this system to more practical dimensions results in less units, 145, but the phase change material mass that is required increases to 99 061 kg.<br/><br/>With the parameters from the test case the transient behaviour of both systems has been analyzed. It was found that a smaller mass of phase change material is required for the phase change slurry system due to the possibility to cycle the phase change material faster between solid and liquid phase. Next to that the heat transfer fluid in the shell and tube packed bed system only contains sensible heat. Therefore less energy can be transferred when the heat<br/>transfer fluid is at the same temperature as the phase change slurry model.","phase change materials; concentrating solar power; heat storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the methods to numerically simulate delamination in a Finite Element environment is through the employment of the Cohesive Elements, which embed the theory constituting the Cohesive Zone Model. Nonetheless, the computational time required to assess delamination simulations by implementing the Cohesive Elements is restrictive, because the presence of a strong stress gradient at the crack tip imposes the adoption of a small-size mesh at the same location. In this context, a sensible improvement is deemed to be necessary, such as to promote these methodologies from an instrument used in academia to an effective solution. A novel type of Cohesive Element is here proposed, aiming to loosen the compelling requirement on the mesh size and, by extension, to reduce the computational time required to achieve numerical simulation of composite delamination.

First of all, a strong urbanization trend is seen. Secondly, cities have to deal with increasing climate changes. These two trends lead to the development of new policies with the aim to sustain the liveability of city centres by making motorized vehicles less dominant in city centres and improve the quality of public space. Such new policy development always takes place in a network consisting of public and private actors, as well as non-profit organisations and societal stakeholders. All these actors in the network are highly interdependent and characterized by different values and interests. In practice these differences lead to strategic choices and actions of actors to stand up for their own interests which cause complex decision-making processes during spatial redevelopment projects. Despite such varying values and interests, to achieve good outcomes of such collective decision-making processes, support of a suggested policy by involved actors in the network is important. However, although trust is considered as an important condition for support and consequential successful policy development, based on earlier studies it can be concluded that the amount of literature on trust in public-private networks” in public administration, public management and policy science is remarkably small. Consequently, it is not clear which governmental interventions can be carried out during decision-making processes in governance networks to steer on trust. For this reason, the goal of this research project is to find out how trust within public-private networks works and if this can be influenced. The following research question is formulated: “Which and to what extent lead interventions to trust within networks during the initiating phase of spatial redevelopment projects in city centres with the aim to make motorized vehicles less dominant and improve the quality of public space?”<br/><br/>This research project starts with literature research to construct a preliminary model that shows how we assume that “trust within networks” evolves during the initiating phase of spatial redesigning projects. During the second phase of the research project three cases in Rotterdam are investigated. Neighbours, entrepreneurs, municipal officials and independent researchers are interviewed. This explorative research leads to a number of observations that improve the model and answer the question which specific interventions and events lead to more or less trust during the initiating phase of spatial redevelopment plans. <br/><br/>It is observed that the initial amount of trust that actors have at the start of the initiating phase, is not significantly changed by current investigated interventions during the initiating phase. Especially the trend of competence trust and collaborative trust seems hardly changed during the process by interventions. The trend of companion trust is influenced by the investigated interventions, but not necessarily in a positive direction. Companion, competence and collaborative trust during the initiating phase of spatial redevelopment projects are already merely subject to overarching, longer term processes that characterize actor networks.","Spatial Redevelopment; Network Analysis; Trust within Networks; Public Support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While such measures are helpful to a certain extent, they are however, easier to by-pass with re-used authentic packaging, fake barcodes and duplicate product numbering. Furthermore, advanced research and new innovations have indicated that it is also possible to have additional levels of security by incorporating similar measures into or on the product itself. Although these novel anticounterfeiting measures offer a unique opportunity to safeguard the customer’s interest at best, they present certain challenges.

This study also focusses on the influence of drying on the macroscopic structure of such barcodes. The bar-codes are produced by physically cross-linking the polymer in specific moulds, converting them into a hydrogel barcode in itself. Altogether, this work provides a qualitative under-standing that such a concept can be developed and that the significant structural changes upon drying is not exclusively governed by the concentration of sodium alginate.","Anticounterfeiting; hydrogel; edible barcode; sodium alginate; drying; thermogravimetric analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Finally, the presence of multiaxiality and non-proportionality has been demonstrated for a number of hotspots and during both operational and extreme conditions.","FOWT; Fatigue; Linearization; Nonlinear; Hydrodynamic; TLP; multiaxial; model development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-28","","","","","",""

Exploitation of seafloor mineral resources could secure the supply of raw materials for the future. However, proposed deep-sea mining (DSM) systems will return wastewater containing fine sediments and other effluents back to the sea via a pipe discharging plumes close to the seabed. Concerns are that the DSM plumes will have significant environmental impacts on the mostly uncharted deep-sea ecosystem. Until today, the environmental licensing procedure for DSM operations is incomplete. Accurate numerical models to predict the behavior of returned DSM plumes are still lacking. <br/><br/>This research aims to support environmental impact assessments for DSM operations. Laboratory tests were carried out to provide validation data for numerical models that can be used to predict the spreading of DSM plumes in the near-field domain. Additionally, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique was used to predict the same laboratory simulations. Wide ranges of initial parameters such are the plume release elevations relative to the bed, source initial Suspended Sediment Concentrations (SSC) and different bed slopes were considered.<br/><br/>Experiments and CFD results agreed well. Negatively buoyant plumes fall vertically towards the bed and impinge generating turbidity currents. Excess buoyancy gained by increasing the initial SSC at the source leads to a considerable increase in the plume dispersion rate. Plume release height is found to be an important parameter. Discharging close to the bed leads to the formation of a circular levee around the impingement point at a distance 10 times the orifice diameter. The sedimentation ring acts as a barrier against the turbidity current leading to the deposition of sediments right outside the ring. As a consequence, the plume dispersion rate reduces and DSM wastes stay closer to the disposal location. In contrast, when plumes are released at a greater height from the bed, due to long falling distance and settling of particles, generated turbidity currents accelerate and the sediments particles are transported in suspension to large distances from the disposal location. <br/><br/>The main goal of this research, to provide a unique set of validation data for numerical models was achieved and a Large Eddy Simulation CFD model was successfully used, tested and approved for its capability to accurately predict the near-field spreading of DSM plumes. Based on obtained results, in order to minimise the environmental impacts, the flow velocity at the bed should be minimised to prevent re-suspension of already deposited sediments. It is recommended that sediment wastes and other effluents should be released close to the seabed. CFD model setup considered only sedimentation of particles and ignored erosion. Based on observed seabed morphological changes during the laboratory experiments, it is recommended that erosion should be considered within numerical models. To fully predict the environmental impacts of DSM operations, the near-field model used in this research should be coupled to a far-field model but also considering multiple environmental pressures caused by DSM tailings. <br","Deep-Sea Mining; sediment wastes disposal; turbidity current; sediment deposition; plumes spreading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-30","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor); Reedijk, Bas (mentor); Jacobs, R (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The Xbloc<sup>Plus</sup> is a new type of single layer armour unit for breakwaters. The key difference between earlier single layer armour units is that the unit is not only placed in a regular grid, but also with a regular orientation. The main benefit of this is that it can directly be seen whether the unit is placed correctly. Additionally, the placement always takes place with the same repetitive movement, as is preferred by crane drivers. The benefits to the placement procedure would however be reduced when the requirements for the under layer become very tight. Since the time that is saved during placement of the armour units, then would be lost during the profiling of the under layer. This has led this study to focus on the influence of irregularities in the under layer on the stability of the Xbloc<sup>Plus</sup> and the allowed tolerances for the placement of the under layer.<br/>In the process of obtaining a stable armour unit, multiple researches have been conducted. The final shape has been further optimised by adding a hole in the middle of the unit and increasing the interlocking capacity. Better interlocking increased the connection between the units and thereby improved the resistance. The hole increased the porosity and thereby reduced the overpressure underneath the armour layer. Which is a result of a difference in water level inside and outside of the breakwater. The increase in stability due to the enlargement of porosity, validated earlier findings that the acting failure mechanism is extraction due to the overpressure.<br/>The stability was expected to be mainly effected by the amount of interlocking. Subsequently, the amount of interlocking is determined by the relative angle between the armour units. For this research physical model tests have been performed to check that hypothesis. Multiple tests have been conducted with different radii of convex and concave shapes in both long shore and cross shore direction. The goal was to find the critical relative angles of each combination of shape and direction. The convex shape in cross shore direction was the only irregularity that caused failure and proved to be critical. The relation between the relative angle and the stability number resulted to be linear, instead of the expected drop of stability at a certain critical value. The relation showed signicant spreading, for which tests with small deviations from the design profile seem to form the upper bound and large deviations the lower bound. Thereby indicating that the level of stability is not only determined by the relative angle but also by the deviation from the design profile.<br/>In succession of the tests with specific shapes and directions, more realistic tests have been performed with micro irregularities and S-proles. The convex shape in cross shore direction proved to be critical for these congurations as well. Furthermore it was found that for large S-proles, sudden failure could occur without previous indication of loss of interlocking. Further analysis of the divergent failure behaviour of large S-profiles indicated that the arched shape of the profile enabled the lifting of the armour layer. A mechanism similar to the buckling of beams. The pressure inside the breakwater, the drag of the down-rush and the weight of the upper part of the slope, cause the initial distortion of the profile to be enlarged.<br/>The differences between the measurements of the profile before and after the tests, showed that the same movements occur for smaller S-proles and the tested convex shapes in cross shore direction. The movement could even be seen in tests that have not failed. Which implies that the arching mechanism that causes sudden failure for large S-proles, also induces the loss of interlocking for other convex shapes. A simplied model of the forces on the convex sections in the profile indicates that the enforcing of the arching mechanism mainly depends on the length and steepness of the downward part of the convex section and the  atness of the upward part of the convex section. These findings correspond with the test results and explain why the stability performance is the highest for the short length scale micro irregularities and lowest for the large scale S-proles with large deviations from the design profile.<br/>Evaluation of the effect of irregularities is performed with the tolerances of the regular Xbloc, which are also intended to be used on the Xbloc<sup>Plus</sup>. To prevent differences in stability due to the size of the under layer, the tolerances are expressed in the unit size (D<sub>n</sub>) instead of the under layer grain size (D<sub>n50</sub>). The resulting tolerances are maximum 0.25 D<sub>n</sub> for the deviation from the design profile and maximum 0.1 D<sub>n</sub> deviation between subsequent measurements along the profile. The profile is measured every 10m of the breakwater and subsequent measurements along the profile have a distance of 0.3 D<sub>n</sub>. The requirements are a little more liberal than the tolerances of the regular Xbloc since the tolerances of the largest under layer grain size are taken as a starting point. The test results indicate that the tolerances are sufficiently safe, with potential for more liberal requirements.<br","breakwater; concrete armour unit; physical modelling; XblocPlus; under layer irregularities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the approaches that policymakers use to improve these areas is the so- called gentrification approach. In this approach policy makers renovate and rebuild parts of the neighborhoods in order to attract more ‘better educated’ citizens to these neighborhoods. Although it seems this approach enables a mix of different social capitals, research show the opposite. A lot of research is conducted on how these negative effects of gentrification can be reduced. <br/><br/>According to Van der Graaf (2009) the solution is not to understand how to solve the social cohesion, but to research the actual causes of this lack of social cohesion. The changes in spatial elements and social structure that gentrification implies, lead to a decreased or even a disappeared attachment to the neighborhood. The aim of this master thesis is to investigate how the feeling home of residents in neighborhoods that are being transformed could be improved. A research through design approach has been used to perform this research. This research provides a new perspective on how policymakers can deal with the negative effects of gentrification. <br/><br/>A conceptual framework of the feeling home is developed to understand how to research the feeling home in neighborhoods. Spangen is characterized as a gentrified neighborhood with a diversity of people and high involvement. Although it seems that the high involvement solves the problems with gentrification in Spangen, it reinforces the gap between strong (close friend) and weak ties (acquaintance) in Spangen. This high involvement is often the result of the effort of particular groups (strong ties) that are not representative for the neighborhood. There are also residents that do not even have weak ties in the neighborhood. This gap explains also why public spaces in Spangen are often (partly) appropriated by one group. A group with strong ties that excludes others from using the place. <br/><br/>This gap is visible when a citizen’s initiative is requested for this public space. The groups that initiate the initiative usually operate individual and that often results in social exclusion and conflict. Other residents are not satisfied with their share in the process or even not aware of the possibilities to be involved. Therefore, the design aims to make the development process of a citizen’s initiative in public space accessible for interested residents to create representative public support for the initiative. <br/><br/>The BuurThuis concept shows that by making participating more accessible, people are able to appropriate the place and to explain their needs towards the place and the place. Since both aspects are needed to feel home, BuurThuis presents a participation tool that stimulates the feeling home. BuurThuis shows that is not always needed to foster real-life interaction between people in contrary what most policymakers strive for. The insights of this research support the research of Van der Graaf (2009) that advices governments to focus on supporting neighborhoods to live together instead of directly connecting people. <br","Feeling home; Open4Citizens; Design for Social Transformations; Participation; Rotterdam; Spangen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Over the previous two decades these serviced were not found to be sufficient sustainable according to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2013). This thesis researches how development aid organisations can contribute to sustainable WASH services by looking to the strategic planning process. <br/>In this research an adaptive planning approach is designed to contribute to long-term sustainable WASH services. It is a systematic step-wise pro-active approach where planners need to think beforehand of ways a plan might fail and design adaptation actions to guard against such failure. An adaptive planning approach has been adapted for sustainable WASH services and consist of three systematic steps:(1) defining the impact and critical assumptions of the WASH programme, (2) defining relevant uncertainties by using contextual scenarios, and (3) defining adaptation actions and the timing of the actions. <br/>The content and the applicability of the adaptive planning approach for long-term sustainable WASH has been examined during this research in the context of Bangladesh. To examine the approach a single case study is used. In this research multiple research methods have been applied to improve the reliability and validity of the findings, but also to capture different perspectives on this topic. First by means of an adaptive planning workshop in the Netherlands with WASH experts from the Dutch NGO Simavi and sequential by means of a field-research in Bangladesh, including interviews with local project stakeholders and field-trips. <br/>It can be concluded that WASH experts in the Netherlands and the project stakeholders in Bangladesh reacted differently on the three systematic steps of the adaptive planning approach for sustainable WASH. The indirectly involved project stakeholders - WASH experts - found it easy to question project assumptions and to identify critical assumptions for the project failure but could not propose specific adaptation actions. The directly involved project stakeholder - local project stakeholders in Bangladesh - found it more difficult to criticize and reassess project assumptions, but they defined feasible adaptation actions. <br/>It can be argued that ‘misrepresentation’ of critical assumptions of the project created hazard to all sequential steps of the adaptive planning approach for long-term sustainable WASH services. <br/>Purposely defining scenarios of success and gloss over the potential for failure, conflicts with the pro-active adaptive planning approach to define adaptation actions at the begin of the project. Therefore, it is questionable whether all systematic steps of the approach serve the interest of all project stakeholders. This makes that the adaptive planning approach, as it is designed now, does not contribute to long-term sustainable WASH services in environments where project incentives are on benefits and not on robustness. <br/>Based on the findings of this research, it can be recommended that different components of the adaptive planning approach for long-term sustainable WASH services should be practices by different involved parties. <br/> <br","Adaptive planning approaches; Sustainability; WASH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

A recovery control strategy based on reducing angular body rates and aerodynamic angles generates inner and outer loop commands. Pseudo control inputs defined as required moment increments are derived using a nonlinear Jacobian model of the control effectors.

This technique will result in a significant reduction of carbon emissions, allow for more flexible input requirements for materials, and lead to a reduction of processing costs as well. In 2010, Tata Steel IJmuiden built a pilot plant to test and develop the technology of HIsarna. The next step is an industrial scale installation: the HIsarna demonstration plant. The design of the storage and handling area of this new plant is the subject of this research. At this area, the materials are stored and pre-processed before they will be injected into HIsarna.<br/><br/>Thus far, Tata Steel has been working on the first design phase of the demonstration plant. Nevertheless, the design of the storage and handling area is missing. Consequently, the required quantities and necessary pre-processing steps of materials are unknown. Moreover, the existing storage and handling area at the HIsarna pilot plant cannot directly be used for the demonstration plant, because the new plant must meet HIsarna’s annual capacity requirements of around one million mt, be able to process iron-rich waste materials (also called reverts), and comply with HIsarna’s green ambitions.<br/><br/>First, an analysis of materials is performed to establish the suitable materials and their properties for processing at the HIsarna demonstration plant. This analysis is essential to identify how these properties may affect the design of the storage and handling area. Second, the storage and handling area of the HIsarna pilot plant is analysed, particularly to identify the necessary processing steps and potential future bottlenecks of the HIsarna demonstration plant. Next, a design of the storage and handling area is created by using multi-criteria analyses and information obtained from literature. A simulation model, created in Simio® software and verified using several techniques, is used to examine the performance of the design, but also to investigate the affecting parameters; these are found by performing a fractional factorial design. Based on these results, optimal parameter settings are found to optimise the design. <br/><br/>According to analyses performed, the suitable materials for HIsarna (besides the standard materials such as iron ore and coal) are by-products of the blast furnaces and the oxy steel plant: BF sludge, currently produced BOF sludge and historic BOF sludge. These materials are particularly interesting because of the high levels of iron, carbon and zinc. Less positive are the high moisture level, the stickiness and the inhomogeneity of composition. These might result in problems during processing. The following design is created: iron ore and coal will be transported by conveyor belt to the storage and handling area, historic BOF sludge by truck, and BF and currently produced BOF sludge by pipeline. Both the raw and handled materials will be stored in enclosed storage systems. Each material will be pre-processed at a dedicated handling line; all materials within the storage and handling area are transported by conveyor belt. The raw material storage of iron ore, coal and BOF sludge has a capacity for two days; and that of BF and currently produced BOF sludge for seven days. In addition, all handled material storages have a capacity of three days.<br/><br/>Based on the results of the fractional factorial design, three designs for the storage and handling area are proposed. Each of the designs has a different starting point. The second design option provides the highest reliability and is recommended if financial resources are not a restrictive factor. The third design is an interesting choice when fewer financial resources are available but still an adequate reliability is aimed at. Finally, the first design results in the lowest reliability. This option may only be suggested when funds are limited. In all cases, redundancy can be added to the storage and handling area, increasing the reliability and decreasing the required storage capacity. All designs fit the selected location at the Tata Steel site, IJmuiden.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-01","","","","","",""

Technological resistance or gaps are still presented and paperless solution must be explored. As well as addressing resistance from employees by changing to paperless. The objective of this research is to deliver a model to Royal IHC, whereby the effort to go paperless from technological and people perspective is determined by providing: (1) resistance from technological perspective; (2) solutions to realize paperless; and (3) resistance from employees to the paperless changes.

The Ocean Cleanup (TOC) Foundation develops a floating barrier able to intercept, concentrate and extract plastic from the marine environment. TOC has conducted several experiments and numerical studies to determine the plastic capturing efficiency of its system. One of the phenomena leading to degradation of capturing efficiency is wave overtopping. During a wave overtopping event, the system is not able to properly follow the waves. This allows water to wash over the system and possibly lead to plastic, which was retained by the system, escape into the open ocean. This issue is amplified by the use of a stiffer barrier than the original concept that was developed by TOC.<br/>To model and quantify plastic loss due to wave overtopping, the ideal approach would be to use a nonlinear 3D CFD method including hydro-elasticity of the barrier structure. Given the size of the problem and the number of conditions that need to be simulated to characterize the design space of the system, the use of such a method is computationally expensive and therefore unrealistic. Therefore, the objective of this work is to propose an alternative method. A method is presented which aims to quantify overtopping volumes by coupling a hydrodynamic solver to a 2D CFD solver. This thesis work will present the method in three parts.<br/>Part I develops a hydrodynamic model to predict the first order (linear) motion response to wave excitation of a 2D cylinder with a spring attached. It is proposed that this model approximates the motions of a 2D cross-section of a long flexible cylinder subject to random wave excitation. The model’s output is a time trace of the motion response, which allows for coupling to a 2D CFD solver. It is found that the spring constant is dependent on the wave characteristics of the ambient wave field. Also, the ability of the 2D cylinder to follow waves is sensitive to the spring stiffness introduced in the model.<br/>Derivation of the spring constant is handled in part II. Here, A model to approximate bending effects into a linear spring is set up. The ambient 3D wave field surrounding the capturing system is modelled and wave statistics are derived. Based on these wave statistics, spring constants are derived for given physical and environmental configurations. From the results it is found that for the wave cases 1 to 4, values of the equivalent spring stiffness coefficient are significant enough to influence the motion response of the floater. For case 5 and 6, values for the equivalent spring stiffness are relatively low and its influence on the response is expected to be negligible.<br/>Part III handles coupling of the hydrodynamic model to the CFD solver ComFLOW. In the cases with low wave steepness, derivation of overtopping statistics has been achieved and results show that overtopping performance can be assessed by performing the steps taken in this research project. In these cases, the wave field is generally behaving linear and the motion response obtained from the hydrodynamic model can be coupled to the CFD solver. Results show that wave height and the applied spring stiffness are governing parameters for overtopping performance. It was also found that in some cases, non-linearities are introduced in the wave field. In the cases where non-linearities occur, the motion response derived by the hydrodynamic model deviates from the motion response that one would expect.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key for this operation is the recirculation of flue gases using internal recirculation zones and mixing of these gases with the incoming combustion air and fuel. These aerodynamic characteristics have been researched experimentally and numerically for the DUT flameless combustor.

A better understanding of brain aneurysm genesis and rupture may open new opportunities to prevention and treatment. In this study, a part of the cerebral vascular system, the so called circle of Willis including an aneurysm, was analyzed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The importance of boundary conditions in an aneurysm simulation was assessed by comparing the results to 7T MRI velocity data, obtained from the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam. Adequate similarities were found in velocity values, together with qualitative agreement in wall shear stress (WSS) values. <br/>We found that in a patient-specific case with an aneurysm, the velocity profile was able to develop to a parabolic profile because of its location; the aneurysm existed far downstream of the circle of Willis. This implies that it is possible to use a cropped arterial system to simulate the aneurysm and to use parabolic inlet velocity profiles for patients with this aneurysm phenotype.<br/>In previous studies, it proved hard to locate the precise location of rupture in an aneurysm. A risk assessment of the rupture location in an aneurysm can be used as a more accurate tool to assess the need for surgery. The aneurysm geometry of the CFD Rupture challenge from 2013 was simulated to predict the location of a rupture site. This rupture location was predicted by combining the following hemodynamic criteria: the time-averaged wall shear stress (WSSTA), oscillatory shear index (OSI) and vortex-saddle point structure during systole with accompanying low pressure values. A sensitivity study was performed on these criteria and a critical threshold for rupture risk was proposed. Based on these criteria it was possible to predict the exact rupture site for two analyzed aneurysm geometries. It is concluded that a CFD model could be used to assess the hemodynamics in intracranial aneurysms. Future research should focus on repeating this study on more patient specific aneurysm geometries to verify this hypothesis further.<br","CFD; intracranial aneurysms; circle of Willis; rupture; hemodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-23","","","","","",""

The phenomenon, also known as ‘freezing rain’, usually occurs when subcooled rain droplets impact the aircraft while it descends from high altitude to prepare for landing. It can quickly increase the aerodynamic drag by up to 80% and reduce the lift force by 50%. Inefficient heating methods or toxic or corrosive chemicals are used to keep flying safe. In this thesis, infrared imaging (IRI) and laser speckle imaging (LSI) are used to observe freezing of water on surfaces with different material properties. A freezing front can be seen to travel through a molecular liquid layer of water (MLL) that covers all surfaces. If this freezing front has passed, impacting droplets freeze much sooner and at unusually high temperatures, which could explain the formation of clear ice on aircraft surfaces.<br/><br/>In the past decade, the interest in anti-icing research has spiked. However, no systematic study has been performed to find out the origin of clear ice. Using the new insight of a freezing molecular liquid layer of water, this thesis is able to explain the origin of clear ice and runback icing. It also suggests that the ongoing conflict in literature on the anti-icing performance of superhydrophobic surfaces might be caused by the presence of the molecular layer of water.<br/><br/>With a systematic study, the surface temperature, contact angle and relative humidity were found to be able to delay freezing of the water layer and the contact angle was able to decrease the velocity of the freezing front.

Treatment usually involves interventions like exercise, bracing, or if necessary, surgery. Often bracing is prescribed to stop curve progression so that surgery can be avoided. Traditional scoliosis braces are usually rigid devices, which displace the spine to the desired corrective position. With efficacies over 90%, these braces can be quite effective when worn enough. Unfortunately, the activities of daily living (ADL) for patients are reduced drastically when wearing a brace, and as a consequence compliance towards the braces is low. Since AIS develops in around 3% of all adolescents, of which approximately 10% has progressive curves that require treatment of some sort, the need for effective, comfortable bracing is high. To increase the ADL of patients, the current focus has been shifted towards designing a compliant scoliosis brace that can provide needed corrective forces and allow motion.<br/>This thesis focusses on the evaluation of spinal motions through the design of a motion capture experiment. The goal of this work is to provide general knowledge about these spinal motions for clinicians, researchers and mechanism designers, such that they can make use of the provided analysis for the design of a new, compliant scoliosis brace. Parts of this analysis are implemented in a brace design quantification strategy, which can be used to facilitate such a brace design project. The key contribution of this master thesis is the characterization of spinal motions for specific vertebrae, to provide substantial kinematic data for the design of a compliant scoliosis brace.","scoliosis; Motion; spine; brace; compliant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-01","","","","","",""

Last, prototype interventions activities with newcomers are done in order to find out what is appropriate.<br/> <br/>The analysis of the current context revealed information about the values workshop. Moreover, the definition of the three values freedom, equality and solidarity as described in the booklet Core values of the Dutch society (Ministry for Social Services and Employment, 2014) is adopted. A lecture by Tamar de Waal (Toeset, Hobbelink and Dorresteijn, 2017) motivated to respect the fact that the meaning of values should be viewed in relation to their context. Additionally, the four educational principles currently used in the values workshop are used as guidelines for concept development. These are: (1) make use of visualisations, (2) build on personal preferences and experiences, (3) include team and individual assignments and (4) facilitate group discussion and reflection.<br/> <br/>The foundation exists of four pillars. First, the learning cycle of Kolb (1984) proved to be suitable for approaching abstract values through concrete experiences. The cycle follows the stages of (1) concrete experience, (2) observations and reflections, (3) abstract concept and (4) test implications of this concept after which the cycle starts over again. Second, the adopted vision on integration is that acknowledging and respecting the pluriformity of the Dutch society can stimulate social cohesion, rather than aiming at sharing all values. The third pillar consists of three additional educational principles: (1) focus on intrinsic motivation, (2) make use of active learning methods and (3) involve of a role model. Last, all newcomers are defined as the target group for the project. Although the initial focus was on Syrian newcomers, involving people with different cultural backgrounds is more suitable when talking about the meanings of values in different contexts in an equal way.<br/> <br/>The intervention studies showed the importance of time, roleplay, discussing both similarities and differences and involving concrete information and multiple topics when aiming at understanding values. The design brief was devised in accordance with Nieuwboer using all previous findings. The following design goal was agreed upon:<br/> <br/>Design an experience-based intervention that enables newcomers in The Netherlands to understand the three Dutch core values following an experiencing, reflecting, understanding-approach while at the same time supporting the newcomers in discussing the differences and similarities between different culture’s values and practices.<br/> <br/>The design brief functioned as the closing document of the Reveal phase and the starting point of the Create phase.<br/> <br/>Create<br/>The aim of the second phase was to create a suitable intervention. Ideation sessions led to the game idea direction. It was decided to design for structured play, incorporating a clear goal and rules. Moreover, the choice for an analogue game was made to provide the best circumstances for dialogue and roleplay. Last, the aim to explore cultural issues and provide dialogue about these clearly indicated the game would be expressive.<br/> <br/>Game elements and mechanisms found in other games were combined into the game concept. Through seven gameplays with different user groups the elements and mechanisms have been tested and improved which resulted in the intervention WAARDEN?! Het spel. The goal of the game is to earn the most value points. Twelve participants play in four teams and sit around the three-values symbol, which is laid down on the floor. A game facilitator guides the gameplay.<br/> <br/>Each turn either a roleplay or a question card is played. With a roleplay card two teams enact a situation. One team from the perspective of their own cultural background, the other how they think it would happen in The Netherlands. The question card presents a question about a law that the teams have to answer. By playing the cards teams can earn points. After that, the game facilitator asks reflection questions about the differences, similarities, participants’ opinions and possible consequences of the enacted situations. Finally, the played card has to be linked to one or more of the three Dutch values by placing it on the three-values symbol. The game ends by reviewing the three-values symbol and appointing a winning team. Through this procedure, the participants follow the phases of the learning cycle of Kolb (1984).<br/><br/> <br/>Evaluate<br/>In the last phase of this report the conclusion and discussion are presented. The game is a very effective intervention for helping newcomers to understand the Dutch core values. The answer on the research question is that the values are too abstract, too dynamic and too ambiguous to capture and convey. These conclusions have resulted in following recommendation for policy making: <br/><br/>Discard the abstract and contradictory Participation statement. Rather, regard the values workshop as an introduction to a lifelong intercultural values dialogue to reach a pluriform society in which people respect each other’s values.","design; integration; newcomers; game; policy; roleplay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The approach that is used to successfully complete the graduation project, is based on the Double Diamond model. According to the conducted iterative design process, the main topics of the thesis are summarised.<br/><br/>INNOPAY <br/>INNOPAY is a consultancy agency which is committed to creating a world in which all people and organisations confide in and use digital transactions. The company's corresponding mission is to guide organisations worldwide to fully embrace the opportunities of the digital transactions ecosystem. The originally Dutch company often operates at the cutting edge of business, technology and legislation. Payments, digital identity, e-business and cybersecurity, are digital transactions related areas in which the company excels. <br/><br/>The challenge <br/>The retail banking industry is transforming to a more open ecosystem. Due to the implementation of new European regulations, mind-blowing new technologies, increased competition and a change in customer behaviour and expectations. However, it is unclear what new products and services could emerge in the Dutch Open Banking ecosystem that are of true relevance to customers. To stay at the forefront of digital transactions, INNOPAY seeks to obtain a better understanding of innovative products and services that can be realised as the openness in the financial landscape will move forward. Therefore, the aim of the graduation project is to design a representative concept from the retail banking customer's point of view that could fit in the future emerging Dutch Open Banking ecosystem. <br/><br/>The Dutch retail banking industry <br/>Dutch retail banking is generally known as mass-market banking and is strictly regulated and dominated by a small number of large national banks. The financial landscape originally has a very conservative and closed character, and is typified by a lack of innovation. Within the boundaries of the law, the banks are fully in control. <br/><br/>The four emerging forces <br/>The transformation of the retail banking industry is caused by four emerging forces, namely: the implementation of new European regulation (1), an increase of competition (2), technological advancements (3) and a change in customer behaviour (4). <br/><br/>The implementation of Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) act as a catalyst for the concept of Open Banking. PSD2 is introduced in order to improve customer protection, stimulate innovation, lower costs in the payments value chain and increase the security of European retail payment services. A controversial key aspect of this regulation is, that it obliges retail banks to grant licensed third parties access to the customer online accessible accounts, if the customer has given explicit consent for this. GDPR is a privacy regulation which aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all customers within the European Union. <br/><br/>Non-traditional players are entering the retail banking industry. FinTech and BigTech companies are upending the status quo by surpassing the expectations of the retail banking customer. In order to prevent becoming a back office utility, retail banks are forced to develop truly relevant innovations. <br/><br/>The rise of open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provides the possibility to securely share data, content and functionalities. Additionally, multiple business rationales stimulates parties to open up their digital doors. <br/><br/>The ongoing digital transformation causes that the customer expects to be offered personalised support and seamless to use digital products and services. <br/><br/>Open Banking <br/>Open Banking ecosystems stand for the totality of interconnected systems of individual customers, third parties (non-banking) and other financial institutions, which by means of multisided platform business models enables exchange of value and data via open APIs. <br/><br/>Open Banking embodies a real evolution which stimulates innovation, enables openness and puts the customer in control over their financial data. Combining banking resources with non-banking resources, enables parties to develop truly relevant products and services for the customer. <br/><br/>The voice of the customer <br/>The voice of the customer is represented by a customer profile which consists of the following key aspects: <br/><br/>The most important jobs to be done concern the control and management of financial transactions, the activity to get the most out of their money, the optimisation of time spent to recurring activities and achieving savings goals. <br/><br/>The most extreme pains related to doing banking business are caused by a lack of context, a lack of continuous feedback, a lack of discipline and the absence of an incentive. <br/><br/>The most essential gains are a more informative overview, relevant guiding advice, products or service that are flexible in use, more informative updates and motivational incentives. <br/><br/>The Dutch retail banking customer needs to be supported in pursuing optimal control over their finances, because they want to be enabled to live now and be prepared for the future in a time efficient and effortless way, so they can get the most out of their money. <br/><br/>MoneyMaster <br/>The voice of the customer is translated into a representative concept, which is called MoneyMaster. <br/><br/>MoneyMaster is a customer-driven Open Banking service which via a conversational interface proactively the Dutch retail banking customer empowers to have optimal control over their finances in a time efficient and effortless manner. MoneyMaster utilises banking resources, non-banking resources and advanced cognitive technologies to serve optimally as the customer's digital financial assistant in a contextual enriched and intelligent manner. The smart chatbot is channel agnostic, 24/7 available, has an unconquered response time and is capable to mimic human behaviour. <br/><br/>MoneyMaster does not solely offer an interesting perspective for the customer, but moreover opens up new opportunities from a business perspective. The opportunities that MoneyMaster creates, are both financially and non-financially related and applies to both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-customer (B2C) context. <br/><br/>However, with regard to the final design of MoneyMaster, also multiple challenges are identified. The biggest challenge relates to the public's increasing privacy awareness which makes people hesitant to share (financial) data. Therefore, new innovative products and services such as MoneyMaster need to be provided by reliable parties that clearly communicate which data is used for what reason.<br","Open Banking; Value propositions; Financial services; Customer-centric; Design; PSD2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In a crystalline silicon solar cell light has to pass through several layers before it enters the silicon wafer where the electron-hole pairs are generated. As one can imagine, if more light reaches the active layer, more electron-hole pairs can be generated. It is highly desired that only one layer, the active layer, is absorbing photons of the solar spectrum. The active layers at the sunny side of the silicon wafer should be highly transparent for solar light. In addition to being transparent, these layers should be conductive to extract the generated charge carriers to the metal contacts. Current layers applied at the sunny side are not optimally transparent, so it is still possible to increase the efficiencies in the crystalline silicon solar cells. In this study, doped silicon oxide layers have been explored as a potential more transparent layer for passivation of both the silicon surface and the metal contacts. Two routes for the fabrication of doped silicon oxide layers were investigated: post-oxidation of doped polycrystalline silicon layers and post-doping of in-situ grown silicon oxide layers. To characterize this new type of material, several different measurement techniques have been applied to improve our understanding of Low-Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition deposited silicon oxide passivating contact layers. It was found that the structure and composition of the layers is very different for these different routes. However, very good and stable surface passivation (minority carrier lifetime of &gt;3ms) can be achieved with both types of silicon oxide layers. Also, sheet resistance measurements have indicated that phosphorus doping in silicon oxides is possible. For better insight into the electrical properties of these layers, further testing in electronic test structures is advised.","Materials science; solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this graph-theoretical interpretation has not yet been extended to SMPL systems. <br/><br/>Switching max-plus-linear (SMPL) systems are an extension of max-plus-linear systems (MPL) for modelling discrete-event systems. While for MPL systems the system is described by one max-plus-linear state equation and one max-plus-linear output equation, for SMPL systems the system is described by more than one mode of operation, each consisting of its own unique max-plus-linear state equation and max-plus-linear output equation.

The switching between the different modes of operation can be deterministic, stochastic or a combination of the two. <br/><br/>Due to the fact that max-plus algebra is an idempotent algebra and there is no opposite operation to max-plus addition, vectors spaces in max-plus algebra cannot be defined in the same way as for conventional algebra.

Research is needed nowadays to drive a transient phase towards the construction of future ‘smart grids’, where multiple actors will be able to communicate with each other and efficiently adapt their production/consumption with respect to the dynamic evolution of the increasingly complex power network. In this scenario, operational management of small, local electricity networks (microgrids) and their two-way interconnection to the main grid are creating new opportunities and, at the same time, new technological challenges. Advanced control schemes are being investigated to smoothen the integration of distributed generation and to achieve optimal operation at microgrid level, through coordination and dispatching of power generation, flexible loads, and storage elements.<br/>The residential sector is responsible for about 30% of the global energy consumption and has historically played a passive role in the unidirectional centralised power infrastructure. A residential microgrid that utilises controllable prime movers, such as gas engines, to compensate fluctuating demand and output of renewable energy would represent a fundamental step towards a more economic, efficient, and environment friendly energy infrastructure. This MSc thesis project focuses on the design of energy management systems in residential buildings where micro-Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generators are installed. Micro-CHP technology is able to produce electrical energy locally in a controllable way, having at the same time the advantage of efficiently employing by-product heat to satisfy thermal demand of the building where it is located. The purpose of our work is an economic analysis regarding the profitability of investment in distributed energy resources for Dutch households and a subsequent investigation about the benefits that advanced control techniques would lead to microgrid operation on the long run. For this reason, specific case studies are built based on real data of thermal and electric consumption, which have been collected through smart meters in various Dutch houses. Two different versions of the microgrid are considered: a first case only involves micro-CHP and thermal energy storage, whereas a second one is expanded to include solar panels.<br/>Advanced techniques employed for supervisory control of power flows in microgrids generally aim to take into account relevant information about the consequences of choosing specific actions, by considering future predictions of system evolution. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a well-known, established and widely used control technique that is often considered as a natural approach to adopt in microgrids. Its main strength is the ability to turn a control problem into an optimisation problem; therefore the capability of including operational constraints arises naturally. However, high volatility of small-scale demand and intrinsic stochasticity of renewable energy supply lead to the hard challenge of integrating appropriate forecasting models into the decision-making strategy. When deterministic approaches relying on the certainty equivalence paradigma are applied in residential microgrids, frequent violations of thermal comfort constraints occur due to poor prediction accuracy of the stochastic<br/>processes involved. The possibility to explicitly take into account the uncertainty affecting the controlled system extends the effectiveness of the predictive control strategies, at the cost of increased complexity. Therefore, suitable probabilistic formulation of the forecasting models for stochastic processes and subsequent control strategies in the MPC framework are studied in our work. Different stochastic approaches recently studied in the scientific literature, i.e. scenario based and tree based, are implemented and compared for the defined case studies. Their performance is evaluated in terms of economic savings, primary energy consumption, and violation of thermal comfort constraints for the households.<br/>The results of our work show the profitability of investment in residential microgrids for average Dutch households willing to share the installation of distributed energy resources in multifamily buildings, even in absence of government subsidies. Moreover, the employment of predictive strategies for local generation scheduling results in slightly improved performance with respect to traditional rule-based controllers. The poor prediction accuracy of demand forecasting on small spatial scale still represents the main difficulty to overcome in order to fill the gap with the theoretical potential benefits of ‘optimal’ predictive strategies. However, in the investigated context, the need for a stochastic framework is motivated and highlighted<br/>with respect to the usage of deterministic tools due to the large variance of uncertainty in system dynamics.","MPC; Stochastic Process; CHP; Microgrids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Previous thesis projects have resulted in a design for a 4500 m long buoyancy bridge which consists of 22 concrete pontoons that carry a steel truss superstructure. To reduce lateral movements the pontoons are fixed to a submerged anchoring cable system. In the middle of the bridge a 400 m wide, 70 m high ship fairway is created. In previous bridge designs the superstructure consisted of separate girders for every span which were connected to the pontoons through hinges. The purpose of this research was to investigate the structural feasibility of creating a continuous superstructure without internal hinges for the Sognefjord bridge. After making a design for a continuous CHS steel truss superstructure, behaviour of the whole Sognefjord bridge with the new superstructure was researched for different load combinations. It was found that maximum lateral displacement of the bridge is 27 m, while maximum longitudinal displacement is 46 m. These were deemed acceptable values. A research was conducted into which parameters influence bridge behaviour the most. It was found that of the bridge structure, rotational stiffness of the pontoons influences bridge deformations the most. A two times higher rotational stiffness of the pontoons leads to a maximum reduction in lateral bridge displacements of 44%. The stiffness of the superstructure was found to have only minor effect on bridge behaviour. Internal loads in the superstructure were found to be mainly determined by displacements of the top of the pontoons, upon which the superstructure rests. Internal loads in individual truss members under a ULS storm situation were investigated. Member stress levels under a ULS storm are very diverse in value, with a maximum peak member stress of 590 N/mm², resulting in a unity check for stability of 1.36. Under reduced bridge deformations from double rotational stiffness of the pontoons, member stress in de superstructure on average drops by half. Peak member stress in the superstructure under a ULS storm with double pontoon rotational stiffness is 293 N/mm², resulting in a unity check for stability of 0.67. Preliminary investigations into bridge dynamics and ship collision were performed. Vortex-induced vibrations of structural elements, as well as pontoon displacements and shockwave effects under ship impact are challenges that require more investigation. The results of this research suggest that creating a continuous bridge girder without internal hinges for the Sognefjord buoyancy bridge is structurally feasible. This would require doubling the rotational stiffness of the pontoons, which is expected to come with large material costs. More in-depth research into other load situations is recommended.","Sognefjord; Buoyancy bridge; Truss girder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","","61.083162, 5.505368"

According to human-centered design, the underlying controller for HSC should closely resemble human behavior. This paper aims to continuously adapt HSC based on an online identified operator model. This approach is named coadaptive HSC. Co-adaptive HSC is hypothesized to decrease conflicts when the human adjusts his control behavior to changing requirements of the task.<br/>In a compensatory tracking experiment with eleven participants, co-adaptive HSC is compared to time-invariant HSC. During the experiments, the participants control a time-varying controlled element, which changes from a single integrator to a double integrator and back unannounced. Time-invariant HSC was designed for controlling a single integrator, whereas co-adaptive HSC adapted to the human by continuously estimating the time-varying parameters of the operator using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). This online identified model of the operator was directly used in the shared controller, therefore, the co-adaptive HSC imitates human behavior.<br/>A 36% decrease in conflict rate (the percentage of time in which the human force and the controller force have opposite directions) was found for co-adaptive HSC compared to time-invariant HSC when the controlled element was a<br/>double integrator. However, for some participants incorrect EKF-estimation of the neuromuscular damping resulted in undesired oscillations in control force during co-adaptive HSC.

The classical spike sorting algorithm is, however, not scalable to process thousands of neurons, and not fast enough to be applied on real time. Alternatively other algorithms have been implemented that are not only scalable to thousands of neurons but also faster in the classification task. In this work we focus on one of these algorithms: the Bayes Optimal Template Matching (BOTM). The BOTM presents the advantage of using a template matching procedure to solve, at the same time, the spike detection and classification. Within the BOTM algorithm we need to compute the noise covariance matrix. This matrix contains spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal noise correlations among the electrodes used for recording the data, and it is important since its inverse works as a spatio-temporal whitening transformation. However, the matrix becomes too large to be computed or handled when large number of electrodes are used. In this work we focused on how to compute the noise covariance matrix when large number of electrodes are used for recording. First we separated its structure in two simpler matrices: one containing the spatial noise correlations, and one containing the temporal noise correlations among electrodes. We computed their inverses and applied three different whitening: spatial whitening, temporal whitening, and spatial and temporal whitening, one after each other. We evaluated the BOTM's performance under the different whitening approaches. Additionally, we took into account a new covariance matrix containing signal correlations, i.e. considering the whole signal, and not only the noise when computing correlations among the electrodes. We also evaluated the BOTM's performance for the signal covariance matrix. We were able to demonstrate that the spatio-temporal noise covariance matrix can be split in two simpler matrices: a spatial noise covariance matrix and a temporal noise covariance matrix. And that their inverses work as a spatial and as a temporal whitening transformations respectively. We also discuss about a problem we found within the toy data created for our measures: high-frequency components on inserted footprints. This problem can affect not only the BOTM algorithm, but also any other template matching based algorithm used. Finally, we concluded that the BOTM could not need any whitening transformation thanks to the redundancy on the recorded data when a large number of electrodes is used.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By employing this assumption, and in addition, incorporating models for terms in the Reynolds stress transport equations, the system of six partial differential equations can be simplified to an algebraic form. However, the resulting equations are non-linear in terms of the Reynolds stress anisotropy and therefore become implicit. The cause of the non-linearity is the presence of the ratio of kinetic energy production to dissipation (P/E) in the equations. In order to derive an explicit model for the Reynolds stress anisotropy, methods to determine P/E are required. For RANS, there are many variations of the final formulation based on the procedure by which this ratio is determined. Marstorp et al. (2009) provide an extension of this modelling framework used in RANS to LES in order to model subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses. In their formulation, the value of P/E, which in LES is the ratio of SGS kinetic energy production to dissipation, is specified as 1, thereby obviating any need for treating non-linearities in the equations.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the performance of the explicit algebraic subgrid-scale stress model (EASSM) developed by Marstorp et al. (2009) is tested in comparison with the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) at an a priori level using DNS data for forced homogeneous turbulence with and without system rotation. Based on the results of the a priori analysis, a new model, termed as the non-equilibrium EASSM is introduced, which does not require the assumption that P/E = 1. The framework of EASSM demands the determination of the SGS kinetic energy and the time-scale in order to close the system of equation. While Marstorp et al. (2009) use algebraic expressions for determining these additional variables, for the non-equilibrium EASSM, avoiding the assumption that P/E = 1 enables the use of an evolution equation for the SGS kinetic energy. For the time-scale, an algebraic expression is derived as a function of SGS kinetic energy and dissipation. The performance of the non-equilibrium EASSM in comparison with the DSM and the EASSM of Marstorp et al. (2009) is evaluated by conducting LES of forced and decaying homogeneous turbulence, with and without rotation, using the finite volume code-INCA. For forced cases, the non-equilibrium model outperforms other models in terms of mean resolved and SGS kinetic energy predictions, and also gives a good match for the time averaged resolved spectrum with DNS. In the presence of strong rotation, however, all the models fail to capture the right decay rate as observed in DNS. On examining the DNS data for the two decaying cases, it appears that the isotropic scaling used for the modelling SGS kinetic energy dissipation in the non-equilibrium model deteriorates the model performance making it unable to provide the right level of inhibition in the decay of the resolved kinetic energy and dissipation.","Explicit algebraic subgrid-scale model; turbulence modelling; homogeneous turbulence; rotating turbulence; LES","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For sensor equipment critical to the motion compensation, this leads to a code black in the system. The occurrences of code blacks should be limited where possible due to the fact that these lead to downtime.<br/><br/>A critical sensor for the motion control is the position transducer in the hydraulic cylinders. The measured lengths are used for feedback purposes in the control system. The position transducer is redundant in each cylinder. The redundant sensor is mainly utilized for checking the main sensor. However, when the measurements from both sensors deviate too much from one another the system will shut down. <br/><br/>Therefore, in this thesis, the possibility of a model-based fault detection method for the position transducer in the hydraulic cylinder is explored. Firstly, an accurate model of the hydraulic cylinder is derived and identified. Then, the model is combined with an observer to generate accurate estimates of the cylinder lengths. Furthermore, the estimates are compared with the actual measured cylinder lengths from the position transducer to generate residuals. Finally, the residuals are evaluated in order to make a decision about the health of the sensor.<br/><br/>Three different fault types have been defined, which are expected to cause sensor degradation/failure. For each fault type, the residuals are evaluated. Prior to this a threshold has been defined based on a fault-free case. The threshold determines whether the system is healthy or not. Ideally, when there is no fault in the system, the residual is close to zero. Whereas, when there is a fault present the residual will be much larger. Whenever the threshold is exceeded, the detection system knows that there is a fault present, which allows it to sent out a warning. There are three model-based fault detection estimators which generate three different residuals. These three estimators are combined into one fault detection architecture.<br/><br/>The results developed throughout this thesis have provided new insights for the fault monitoring system in the Ampelmann system. Currently it has only been applied for the position transducer. However, it can be extended to other critical components in the system. Furthermore, the work presented in this thesis is valuable for predictive maintenance purposes. Finally, the detection estimators can be used for the implementation of fault tolerant control in the system.","Fault Detection; Ampelmann; Model-based Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

As the literature survey shows, in order to fully understand the characteristics of the flow around a car, large-scale and volumetric flow field measurements are required. For its features, PIV can be pointed as a useful technique for automotive wind tunnels. However, its use in an automotive wind tunnel is strongly conditioned by the industrial environment itself, which requires particular efforts for what concerns safety and economic aspects.<br/><br/>The advent of Robotic Volumetric PIV has permitted the measurement of time-averaged properties of large-scale complex aerodynamic flows by the combination of coaxial volumetric velocimetry and robotics. Firstly, the use of Helium Filled Soap Bubbles as seeding permits to enlarge the measurement volume due to their higher scattering capability. Furthermore, the compactness of the coaxial velocimetry probe together with the robotic actuation allows to measure large-scale volumes, partitioning the entire volume and reconstructing the time-averaged flow filed from multiple PIV acquisitions.<br/>Since its presentation, Robotic Volumetric PIV has been used to investigate low velocities flows, with free-stream values ranging between 2 m/s and 14 m/s. More specifically, 15 m/s can be considered the largest velocity that can be analysed with the state-of-the-art of the system due to its hardware limitations in the maximum acquisition frequency. <br/>For this reason, to meet the requirements in terms of flow velocities proper of industrial environments, the range of analysable velocities has to be extended. <br/><br/>To address the identified requirement of high-speed volumetric measurements, a new acquisition technique has been designed and proposed. Even if a standard double-pulse strategy can measure high-speed flows due to the short time that can elapse between the two subsequent pulses, in order to increase the accuracy of the final results, a two-$\Delta t$ method is proposed. Firstly, a predictor is built using a Double-Pulse, Double-Frame acquisition with a short pulse separation time $\Delta t_1$. Afterwards, the predictor is used to allow the stretching of the second pulse separation time $\Delta t_2$ without encountering errors given by the false pairing that would be present due to the longer displacement of the particles. <br/><br/>To test the performance of the new method, the near wake of a $50\%$ replica of the Ahmed body with a 25$^{\circ}$ slant angle has been studied through an experimental campaign in the Open Jet Facility (OJF) of TU Delft. Firstly, a measurement at 12 m/s has been performed in order to be able to assess the performances of the proposed method w.r.t. the time-resolved acquisition strategy and the DP standard -DF approach. <br/>Afterwards, an airspeed of 20 m/s has been considered, in order to demonstrate the capability of the new technique of extending the velocity range of Robotic Volumetric PIV. <br/><br/>The conducted measurements demonstrate the possibility of extending the velocity range of the Robotic Voluemtric PIV system with the proposed method. However, this is achieved at the expense of a lower accuracy, due to the lack of temporal information, and a longer measurement time, given by the necessity of multiple acquisitions.","Particle Image Velocimetry; Coaxial Volumetric Velociemtry; Dynamic Velocity Range; Robotic Volumetric PIV; Aerodynamics; PTV; Lagrangian particle tracking; Large-scales; Flow measurement technique; High speed flows; Industrial application; Helium Filled Soap Bubbles; Automotive industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

But which patients could benefit the most from the technology and how would this step affect the design of stethoscopes? The current project focused on answering these two questions with regards to cardiovascular patients.<br/><br/>The analysis phase of the project focused on exploring the most promising disease – use case combination. The following two scenarios were identified:<br/><br/>Heart failure is a condition where patients’ heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s necessities. This can lead to pulmonary edema – fluid retention in the lungs. If pulmonary edema remains undetected, it can lead to severe acute events. Using digital stethoscopes the development of pulmonary edema can be detected in time.<br/><br/>COPD is a progressive disease leading to permanent lung damage. Lung infections pose a great threat to these patients as they speed of the progression of the disease. If lung infections are spotted at an early stage, they can be treated before the acute worsening of the patients’ state. However, no current technology can support patients in this early detection. Thereby, digital stethoscopes are highly promising for early detecting lung infections in COPD patients.<br/><br/>The developed solution is a strap based self-monitoring device. The device has a double stethoscope set-up, which enables patients to listen to the sounds of both of their lungs at the same time. This halves the measurement time. During the project, the inner structure of the device was elaborated as well. The device is stored on a wall-mounted charger. Hidden lights in the strap help patients to remember measurements and provide feedback about measurement accomplishment. The fabric-based strap design provides a friendlier and more comfortable look and increases the comfort during use. The wall mount is equipped with a holder that supports patients in the easy and accurate placement of the device on their back. The vision on the use integrates breathing exercises to measurements. By conducting the measurements, users can unlock new exercises. This way the use can stay more diverse over time.<br/><br/>The design solution was evaluated with the involvement of COPD and heart failure patients. All participants were highly satisfied with the ease and comfort of the use and the involved measurement reminding features. Participants found the device highly reliable and hygienic looking, friendly and moderately medical looking. Thereby, the aesthetic goal of balancing between a medical and a friendly appearance was met. The opinion of patients greatly varied regarding the envisioned rewarding system. While some participants found it childish, other found it rather interesting. This aspect of the device is recommended to be improved via the integration of various use encouraging features that patients can personalize to their own motivational aspects with ease.<br","Stethoscope; medical devices; self-monitoring; Self-management; copd; heart failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","CardioLab",""

We also present testing results on two off-the-shelf SRAMs quality to be a PUF compon- ent; Microchip 23LC1024 and Cypress CY62256NLL. Testing on two bit-selection algorithms (data remanence analysis and neighbor analysis) are also performed.

Moreover, we also propose a procedure to develop SRAM PUF-based applications using any off-the-shelf SRAM. The procedure consists of three main steps; test the off-the-shelf SRAM quality to be a PUF component, create a PUF-generated key using enrollment-reconstruction mechanism, and develop any PUF-based ap- plication utilizing the PUF-generated key. In addition, an idea to create numerous CRPs using SRAM PUF is also proposed here. Using a collection of stable bits as a challenge, the stable bits are permutated among themselves to create a challenge which has a numerous number of possibilities. Furthermore, we also present a secure data and key storage scheme using SRAM PUF. The proposed scheme is in- fluenced by multi-factor authentication. Using a combination of a PUF-generated key and user’s password, a derived key is produced and utilized as the final key to protect user’s data or/and user’s key. As the grand concluding experiment of this thesis, we present a demo of storing a private key of Bitcoin.

Simultaneously, the consumer mind-set is found shifting from the desire to own towards gathering meaningful experiences and having access to services and goods on demand. Thus, it its proposed that the Ford Motor Company - famous for being the first car company making the car affordable and accessible for everyone – should include the creation of novel user experiences to further distinguish the company’s position in a competitive and changing mobility landscape. <br/>The analysis of public transport behaviour and the current use of travel time by business commuters has revealed the potential for autonomous mobility to improve the everyday urban commuting experience. Thereby, the proposed concept introduces a radical approach for innovating the meaning of urban mobility and travel time. It envisions to transform the everyday business commute into a well-being ritual, that empowers urban citizens to dedicate their travel time to sustaining their personal well-being. The latter was found increasingly challenging due to the pressure caused by high-performance-driven societies and their fast pace lifestyle in western cities. Hereby, the concept of mobility for well-being is further rooted in growing trends of consumers seeking for methods and activities helping them to sustainably foster what it takes to live a happy life. The proposed concept provides commuters with a progressive well-being experience that includes the positive effects of personal engagement and the daily commuting routine. The proposed concept is a combination of both product and service design, that can be accessed while booking and traveling on-board an autonomous vehicle. Empathy, customizability and proactivity were given high priority during the development of the design system. Hence, an open service platform was generated that provides the customer with variable and progressive content. In addition, affective computing and the potential of involving machine learning was investigated with the aim to offer a more natural human-machine interaction. <br/>The design process followed an agile approach that allowed the designer to analyse, synthesise and elaborate on genuine design solutions that would do the context justice. Hereby, the project started with a user-centred and generative research phase which was then, concluded with the identification of several opportunity spaces. From this, a clear design vison was formulated, that guided the designer in generating a pool of apt ideas. The following conceptualization phase focused on the elaboration of one design direction that revealed to become a holistic system solution. The latter was influenced by the application of various design fields, including design activities in product, service and interaction design. In close collaboration with strategic experts, working in the field of autonomous mobility and design experts from the TU Delft, specialized in design for innovation and well-being, the designer was eager to create based on both facts and imaginative power. Subsequently, a user-centred, meaningful, radical and complex design innovation resulted.

On top of that, a high rate of alarms is false and messages are not always relevant. These stressors have a large impact on patient safety and work satisfaction. In literature, multiple solutions are proposed to improve this situation. However, these research outcomes are not consistently implemented in the field, the solutions found are not generally accepted due to current hospital cultures and the usability of implemented solutions is often insufficient.<br/><br/>This project started with the assignment to design a dashboard for ICU nurses that would improve patient safety and work satisfaction. To reach that goal, a contextual research, based on contextmapping, was done, in which seven ICU nurses were interviewed about their workflow and information management. There, it came forward that improving effectiveness and efficiency, could improve work satisfaction and patient safety. To achieve this, collaboration and the feeling of having control of the situation had to be improved. This led to the design goal “Design a dashboard that increases the feeling of control and collaboration by showing timely and relevant information.”<br/><br/>To come to a design that fits the ICU environment, the appearance and interaction style was based on the general characteristics of an ICU nurse. The content of the dashboard was based on a co-creation session with ICU nurses, which also provided structure to the interface. To provide alert fatigue to occur, an alert philosophy was formulated that gives guidance to prioritizing the alerts and to visualizing the types of notifications. <br/><br/>This design was tested with six ICU nurses, with the aim to get insight in their opinions about the system and to formulate recommendations for further development. The results of this test show, that the nurses think this system is intuitive, easy to learn and has future potential to improve information provision and patient safety. <br/><br/>However, it has to further developed to conclude this with more certainty. For example, the interface of the dashboard has to be evaluated when it is used next to the current registration software, so it can be concluded whether the current design does justice to the dashboard’s main functionalities. Next to that, it is recommended to look into supporting communication in multidisciplinary teams by means of this ICU Dashboard.<br/><br/>It could be concluded that this project has provided a good foundation to reach the goal of New Compliance. It provided insight in the ICU context and proposed a design, which seems to be able to support the ICU nurses’ workflow. Not only is it a tool that helps nurses to locate specific information more quickly, it also gives insight in the activities of team members so that collaboration can run more smoothly.

To circumvent this problem, in this thesis, we introduce a more accurate evaluation methodology, which relies on the actual motion control application running on the HPPC and is able to capture aspects as scheduling, parallelism, and processor resource usage. <br/>To this end we develop a set of custom performance benchmarks able to emulate the CARM environment and evaluate the Freescale T4240 processor in this new context.

PID controllers are linear, and thus have fundamental limitations, such that certain performance criteria cannot be achieved. To overcome these limitations, nonlinear reset control can be used. Reset control can achieve less overshoot and a faster response time than linear controllers. However, the resetting mechanism has a jump function which causes jumps in the control input, which can result in limit cycles.<br/><br/>Linear filters and controllers are designed in the industry using loop shaping, which is done in the frequency domain. In this study it is investigated how to analyse reset systems in the frequency domain. A reset system is nonlinear, so transfer functions needs to be approximated by describing functions. The sinusoidal input describing function considers only the first harmonic of the output and therefore does not capture all the dynamics of the element.<br/><br/>The effects of the higher order harmonics are important in precision systems, since unwanted dynamics should not be excited nor should performance be affected. In this thesis, the higher order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDF) are derived analytically. The HOSIDF shows the magnitude and phase response per harmonic, such that stability and performance analysis can be improved.<br/><br/>Because the HOSIDF shows multiple responses, it is not trivial how to do loop shaping. The information from the HOSIDF is combined, creating a combined magnitude and combined phase response. It is seen that the combined magnitude looks promising, but the combined phase has jumps. It is concluded that the combined magnitude and combined phase are not mature enough to rely on during loop shaping and further work in this direction is required.","reset control; higher order describing function; clegg integrator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Today already, devices provide intelligent support for daily tasks, by making homes automated and context-aware. This inexorable trend is projected to further reshape the nature of consumer goods. However, several threats come along with blindly implementing digital technology. Meaningful human-product interactions can get diluted, or even lost, by the ongoing automation of the kitchen. Especially, highly emotional luxury brands like German kitchen appliance manufacturer Gaggenau, rely on the physical qualities of their products. This dilemma makes the brand hesitate when it comes to the implementation of digital technologies, facing the thread of their products becoming obsolete on a market driven by digitalization. A crucial task for the brand’s future development is to find the balance between support and automation while preserving their user-centered brand values. While analyzing the target group it was found crucial to understand their process of cooking, in order to identify novel opportunity spaces.<br/>An essential insight derived by analyzing the relationships of a product and its surrounding environment. Supportive countertop devices take a big amount of space. When managing bulky kitchen machines, the user has to restore the device after every use or leaving it on the countertop permanently. Additionally, every machine comes with its own, heavy motor block which is doing essentially the same thing - providing motion. The design principle was formulated, describing the idea of an universal motion port, submerged in the countertop surface of a kitchen. The seamlessly integrated hub provides motion and heat via an electromagnetic field, powering various modules placed on top of the counter. <br/>Exploring the principle, became the focus of the project and a blender module was chosen as an example module. During the embodiment of the product, several ideas were tested to transfer a rotary momentum through a solid surface. The principle of an axial flux motor was sensed promising and got prototyped and tested by many iterations. A more elaborated prototype from machined parts was made, proofing the concept idea as valid. Due to the successful implementation of the axial flux motor principle an ultra slim motion port was achieved. To further enrich the product experience, a haptic input controller was designed. This completely detachable magnetic dial works with a digital user interface shining through the counter surface. <br/>The final design of the blender module was strongly guided by the three design attributes - light, pure and effortless. The semi-transparent glass object can lock in on the submerged motion port on a perfectly unbroken surface. While processing food, the cook can perceive the color of the produce, even through the lid. The frosted glass finish combined with the light and pure appearance of the product, makes the device harmonize with its surrounding. Finally, The Gaggenau Sous Chef, was designed to be unobtrusively accessible to the user and to allow a flexible operation of modules by an universal motion port.<br","Kitchen appliance; Gaggenau; Axial Flux motor; Sous Chef; automation; motion port; luxury","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

To establish innovative results and compete with smaller, more flexible companies, corporates look for new ways to organize themselves. In the light of these developments, design is moving beyond approach to improve aesthetics, towards a more strategic role in new product development. <br/><br/>The way designers think and act forms the basis of Design Thinking (DT). DT has been introduced in a range of organizations as a problem solving approach that helps teams deliver more innovative outcomes. The concept is represented through cognitive principles, practices, and process steps supported by specific design methods. <br/><br/>Many companies claim to have successfully implemented DT in their organization. Increased innovation is most frequently mentioned as benefit of using DT. Other effects range from reduced investment risk in product development, to increased employee engagement. Anecdotal reports on the value of DT are plentiful but lack detail, for example on the type of innovation output that can be expected. There is still little empirical evidence on the value of DT. <br/><br/>Organizational change, specifically in the innovation domain, clashes with current business processes. Hurdles to implement new management concepts can be expected, but there are no studies that specify how challenges to implementing DT can be overcome. <br/><br/>This thesis describes a case study on implementing DT in project teams at Exact. Exact is a Dutch company with about 1500 employees that delivers business software, with a focus on financial processes, The firm recently founded a new team of internal designers, dedicated to spread DT in project teams. The graduation project is a collaboration between the Delft University of Technology and Exact with the aim to measure design practices and impact and propose focus points to improve DT at Exact. <br/><br/>The study compares projects at Exact that ran during the DT program, with a group of benchmark projects, to track the effects of the DT program on project processes and outcomes. An internal survey was conducted with 43 respondents, evaluating the maturity of the design principles: user centricity, collaboration, tangibility, ideation and an experimental and optimistic mindset. <br/>The survey also included measures for project outcomes. Context specific benefits of design practices were explored through correlation analysis of the design principles and project outcomes. <br/>To determine triggers and barriers for project teams to apply DT, qualitative data was collected in eight employee interviews. Common challenges to using DT were prioritized with employees in four sessions. <br/><br/>Most activities in the DT program focused on enhancing user centricity or improving ideation practices. This led to a significant increase in the perceived user centricity in project teams compared to projects before the DT program, Also users indicated more unique benefits in products that resulted from recent projects. Besides user centricity, other strong design practices are collaboration and an experimental an optimistic mindset.<br/>On the other hand, ideation measures scored relatively low and did not improve over time. Organizational barriers, such as subjective scoping and pressured time frames, pose barriers to creating multiple solution options. Also lower scores were found for tangibility, which includes visual thinking and prototyping activities. <br/><br/>Multiple positive correlations occurred between design practices and project outcomes. Practices related to ideation showed most positive correlations. Multidisciplinary teamwork and tolerance to failure also showed many correlations, indicating a high impact on project outcomes. The main value of DT in the context of Exact is improved the quality of products and enhanced teamwork. No significant negative correlations were found, underlining that DT does not block planning and budget goals. <br/><br/>Research results are used to design a strategy to improve design practices and their effect on project outcomes at Exact. <br/><br/>Focus points for the short and long term are identifies based on the survey results. Ideation is a focus point on the short term. Due to the low maturity level and high potential value, quick wins are expected in this area. A next step is to invest in increasing impact of prototyping and finally to invest in design as a strategic deriver by creating dedicated spaces and hiring design leaders. These last recommendations are based on an analysis of DT implementation strategies at other corporate firms. <br/><br/>To improve ideation, more detailed recommendations are made on organizational and team level. On organizational level, it is suggested to balance a portfolio of validation and exploration projects. Also, by a-synchronizing research and conceptualization activities with the technical development, more time can be dedicated to DT. For teams, a new standard ideation process is proposed with four steps: prepare, ideate, concertize and select. Complementary tools are provided to support each process step. <br/><br/>Tho conclude, this thesis work provides insights into the maturity and value of DT in the context of an established software firm. A step-wise approach strengthen DT in the organization is proposed. <br/>Other companies can use the measurement tools used in this thesis to identify context specific strengths and weaknesses in design practices and create their own strategy to improve the impact of DT. <br/>The ideation process and tools that are introduced in this project are generally applicable for firms that wish to enhance diverging and converging abilities in new product development.","Design Thinking; Change Management; Design impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Owners often see them as a friend, child or partner in the relationship.<br/>Cats have similar emotions as humans, which lays a foundation for the relationship; they express emotions, however, quite differently. Therefore, owner and cat don’t always understand each other, which often results in confusion, frustration, annoyance and uncertainty in the owner.<br/>The relationship between owner and cat is an emotional one, full with positive and negative interactions. Too many negative interactions could, in fact, eventually lead to an abrupt termination of the relationship.<br/>This project is about the development of the owner-cat relationship and what leads up to the unexpected termination of it: when an owner decides to give up the relationship and surrender the cat to the shelter.<br/>The decision to owner-surrender is often grounded in several reasons of the owner. What are some of the reasons that owners decide to surrender their cat? What problems may arise in the relationship? How does the relationship work?

Epoxy is a thermoset material which ensures enhanced fatigue performance and improved mechanical characteristics when used to modify bituminous materials. However, unlike conventional modification techniques, a series of experimental methods have to be conducted to evaluate the chemical- related phenomena occurring during the binder production and their effects on the performance of the epoxy modified bitumen. For this reason in this thesis, the utilization of epoxy modifiers was investigated at binder level.<br/>Initially, the chemical hardening (curing) process of epoxy modified bitumens (EMBs) was investigated by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer and Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). Different combinations of hardening conditions for three epoxy modification levels were studied. Properties, such as modulus and viscosity, were utilized to determine the workability of EMB. At the same time, by using the FT-IR spectrometer, the functional groups of EMBs during the chemical reactions were identified for the understanding of polymerization in the epoxy components. <br/>Additionally, the DSR device was utilized to determine the fatigue and tensile strength of EMBs. It was found that, with increasing the content of epoxy modifier, the fatigue life and tensile strength were increased significantly compared to an unmodified binder.<br/>Finally, the age hardening (aging) of EMBs was evaluated at different time intervals. For the simulation of short-term aging on EMBs, a short-term oven aging method (STOA) was used. For long-term aging, simulations were performed in a pressure aging vessel (PAV) under constant pressure and temperature. The results of chemical characterization and rheological properties of the aged EMBs were obtained by using DSR and FT-IR and were compared to the unmodified bitumen. <br","epoxy modified bitumen; chemical hardening (curing); performance; aging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","","","","","",""

The membrane electrode assembly consists of a bipolar or exchange membrane, an Ag-mesh catalyst and a gas diffusion layer. The counterreaction occurring on the opposite of the electrode assembly is oxygen evolution performed in a 1 M KOH anolyte. While using a fixed cell potential of 2.5 V, it was found that the bipolar membrane configuration produces 4 to 6 times more current versus an anion exchange membrane assembly due to the low local pH enabled at the cathode due to the bipolar membrane. This difference comparatively benefitted both CO2 reduction and the competing H2 evolution. It was further found that the surrounding infrastructure, namely the titanium sample holder, was almost exclusively performing H2 evolution, both inhibiting reactions on the Ag-mesh and preventing the formed products from being transported to the cathodic gas phase. Instead, all formed products were detected in the anolyte compartment. To circumvent these issues the sample holder was removed, and ionomer solution was applied to the Ag-mesh increase conductivity between the bipolar membrane and the Ag catalyst. During operation the membrane ultimately delaminated due to internal gas accumulation. The main conclusions from this work are that the examined membrane electrode assemblies using Ag-mesh as a cathode are unable to perform CO2 reduction while the Ag-mesh is located too far from the gas diffusion layer. Even with layer compression between all components, only trace amounts of CO were produced, implying that contact between the CO2 reduction catalyst and the CO2 source was not sufficiently present. Membrane electrode assemblies might then be improved by utilising a layer of conductive liquid between the membrane and Ag-mesh. In an alternative approach a gas diffusion electrode was produced through the sputtering of Ag directly onto the gas diffusion layer. Even without optimisation this system outperformed all produced membrane electrode assemblies in terms of CO2 reduction.","CO2 reduction; Bipolar membrane/BPM; anion exchange membrane/AEM; membrane electrode assembly/MEA; flowcell; gas diffusion electrode/GDE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This study acts as one of the mobile nuclei of the NUCLEUS project, with the goal to operationalize RRI instead of building theories. The aim of this research is to stimulate reflexivity, one of the dimensions of RRI, amongst scientists in fundamental research within the TU Delft, using a simple tool or method. This is done using a self-developed co-design approach, based on design-based research. This research is the first attempt to create a tool together with the end-users, the fundamental scientists, to stimulate RRI.<br/><br/>In this study, the mirror tool is designed and tested. On micro-ethics level (first order) reflexivity was stimulated using the tool. Especially first year’s students mentioned that the mirror form would help guiding them when reflecting on large projects or when being stuck. However, macro-ethics (second order reflexivity) was not considered using the tool, and thus the socio-ethical and socio-economic aspects were not taken into account yet. Therefore, changes to the design are proposed assuring also macro-ethics will be considered.<br/><br/>Using the tool, not only reflexivity is stimulated, but also responsiveness is encouraged, due to the last question ‘So what?’. In this way, not only learning and thinking will change, but also adjustments can be made to the current way of working.<br/><br/>Implementation of the tool at the BN department of the TU Delft could be done via two ways: either via the graduate school or via the principle investigators. Furthermore, quantitative tests should be performed to statistically prove the effect of the tool, increasing its reliability. Besides, the tool could be more functional when digitalizing the mirror form, such that users are not limited by the amount of writing space and such that supplementary elements could be implemented.<br/><br/>Apart from using the mirror tool in their universities, the NUCLEUS consortium can additionally benefit from the new methodology to create a tool for RRI with and for scientists. Using the one page guideline (appendix 17), consortium members can conveniently create a tool for RRI for their specific target group and in their context.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A large increase in containerized maritime transport, bigger ships and bigger call sizes cause the need for container transhipment terminals to increase the volume they can handle without increasing their handling costs and handling time at the terminal. This research aims at deepening the understanding of how this goal can be achieved through integration of an inland port and improving information exchange in the container transport chain. <br/><br/>Improving the accuracy of the estimated time of arrival (ETA) and real time sharing of the berth window are selected as the most promising alternatives to improve the container terminal. A more accurate ETA will improve the productivity of the gangs by reducing the overmanning and undermanning the terminal and by improving the allocation of the ship to shore (STS) cranes. Real time sharing of the berthing window reduces the waiting time of ships at the terminal as ships get notified that they can decrease speed when resources at the terminal will not be available upon arrival. Ships will save bunker costs when reducing their speed. When resources in the terminal are available earlier than the arrival of the ship, ships will get notified to increase speed, improving the utilization of the terminals equipment and workforce, resulting in less handling costs at the terminal.<br/><br/>Using a simulation model in the context of a transshipment terminal in the port of Algeciras, the integration of an inland port is designed. Both the effects of this inland port as improved information exchange are estimated. The turnaround time and gang productivity of container terminals with congested yard can be improved through handling and storing containers at the inland port. This reduces the yard occupancy, improving the productivity of the yard equipment and the STS cranes. A transshipment terminal can be improved by storing long-stay transshipment container at the inland port in addition to handling import and export containers there. Customs facilities should only be implemented at the inland port when transhipment containers are stored there. No dedicated stacks in the yard of the deep-sea terminal for transport towards the inland port should be reserved as it will increase ship turnaround time at the terminal.<br/><br/>Improving the accuracy and real-time sharing of the berth window improves the gang productivity in the terminal. A more accurate ETA decreases the effectivity of sharing of the berth window. Both alternatives do not improve the ship turnaround statistically speaking. Around 2.5% additional volume can be handled in the deep-sea terminal through real time sharing of the berth window. A similar results be achieved by integration of inland port where 2.5% of the transhipment containers and import and export containers are stored. Combining the integration of an inland port with sharing of the berth window increases this number further. These results are case specific and dependent terminal specific properties like dwell times, productivity of the yard equipment and the container split in the terminal.<br","Container transport chain; Transhipment terminal; Inland port; Information Exchange; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

To reduce the risks of pollutants entering the environment, a watertight base layer and an impermeable cover layer isolate the waste. These layers have to be maintained eternally, which is very costly. To move towards a more sustainable landfill aftercare, Dutch landfill operators have started three demonstration projects, to reduce leachate concentration in 10 years. At one of the projects, this is attempted by recirculation of leachate, which in the long term, reduces the concentrations of pollutants in the leachate. During the project the reduction of emissions via leachate is measured, but in order to make this project successful, it also has to be proofed that the emissions are reduced permanently. To proof that the emission via leachate is permanently reduced a model is required which enables to predict how remaining mass in the landfill will be emitted via leachate, based on time series of leachate quantity and quality. <br/>This research focuses on adapting the prediction models, created for two demonstration projects, to describe the water balance for the third demonstration field at De Kragge II in Bergen op Zoom. Compared with the other two projects, the water balance for this field is a bit more complicated, since it has a different layout of the drainage system and lateral flow to and from adjacent fields is possible. The aim of this research is to model the water dynamics in the landfill with minimal uncertainty.<br/><br/>Available input and output data are: rainfall, evaporation potential, leachate levels and leachate outflow, available for the pilot field and the adjacent compartment. The leachate outflow is controlled by valves, level meters and pumps in the flow system, also the operator has influence on which compartment is drained. Another complication with the outflow data is that the data from weighed trucks transporting the leachate indicate that sometimes leachate was directly pumped from the landfill, herewith bypassing the flowmeter.<br/><br/>The model consists of three layers, a recultivation-, waste- and drainage layer. In the recultivation layer infiltration into the waste layer is calculated by balancing rainfall, evapotranspiration and storage. The water volume infiltrating the waste layer is distributed stochastically, according to a travel time distribution, that discretizes the infiltrated water to faster and slower moving regimes. In the drainage layer model, the balance of water inflow, leachate outflow, sideflow and storage is calculated. Resulting<br/>in a volume of water ex-filtrating the landfill. To evaluate model uncertainty, visual and quantative criteria are used. The fits of modelled on measured data is used as a visual check. The quantitative analysis consists of evaluating the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the marginalized likelihood. The Kullback-leibler divergence estimates how much information is gained from the parameters, while the marginalized likelihood determines the balance between information content and complexity. <br/>In order to find a model that describes the water dynamics with minimal uncertainty, three different model implementations were evaluated. In the first approach both leachate level and outflow were used for calibration with measured data. Evaluation of the model performance showed that the outflow could not be determined with acceptable error. This was indicated by large standard deviations of the model and measurement error with respect to outflow measurements. Likely the reason for this is the gap in the water balance and the erratic patterns in the outflow data. A second approach was therefore modelled in which only the leachate levels were fitted with measured data and the outflow data was given as input. This increased the leachate level fits slightly, also the quantitative criteria showed that approach 2 is better than approach 1. Some of the parameters of approach 2 had large uncertainty and the model is quite complex given the available measured data. Therefore a third, simpler and faster model was implemented. In this model the waste layer calculations were simplified using the circular convolution function of MATLAB. This function calculates the travel time distribution continuously instead of discretizing the function over given retention times, which was done in the first two approaches. This model approach gave the best leachate level fits. The Kullback-leibler divergence indicated higher information content compared to approach 2.<br/><br/>In addition, each approach was evaluated with different model scenarios in which the waste compartments where either coupled or uncoupled. For each approach the uncoupled models performed visually and quantitatively better than the coupled models. <br/>Approach 2 gave the best insight in the water dynamics given its complexity, shown by the higher values for the marginalized likelihood. Approach 3 gave the best fits, of the leachate levels, the highest 퐷<sub>KL</sub> values and is the fastest model. From these results it would be advised to use approach 3 to analyse the water dynamics of the landfill. Given the results of the different scenarios, it would be advised to use the uncoupled models for the analysis of water dynamics inside the landfill, since these models showed the best fits, highest 퐷<sub>KL</sub> and marginalized likelihood values. <br/>Based on the obtained results, the following insights could be drawn about the landfill dynamics. The sideflow between the two compartments is about 5 to 25 m3/day. The model showed that water in the landfill, flows fast from the cover layer to the drainage layer. The infiltration flux of the recultivation layer model seemed to be dominated by rainfall and evaporation. Therefore this model could be simplified by omitting water storage and flow through the layer.","water balance model; landfill; De Kragge II","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, PV systems face various loss mechanisms at the module level as well as power electronics level which need to be addressed for further growth of the technology. Power generation from PV modules suffer from heat losses that are a function of the temperature coefficient of maximum power (γ) of the PV module. Another loss mechanism is the shading of PV module where the power output of a module and ultimately the system can be severely compromised. Although various approaches such as bypass diodes and module level power electronics have been employed to minimize the effects of shading on a PV module, so far, the performance of a PV module under shading had only been addressed vaguely and was generally described qualitatively. Therefore, a parameter called Shading Tolerability (ST) was recently developed to quantify the behavior of PV modules under all kinds of shade. However, the observations pertaining to Shading Tolerability were only carried out under Standard Test Conditions (STC). Hence, this thesis aims to investigate whether ST is an innate property of a PV module by formulating a correlation, if there’s any, between ST and ambient temperature, classify various PV technologies based on ST and γ and develop a selection map so that an optimal selection of PV modules can be made for the design of PV systems simply by knowing the specifications of the module along with the meteorological conditions of the installation location. Furthermore, different interpolation techniques were evaluated to achieve a comprehensive picture of the meteorological conditions of The Netherlands to determine the most optimal PV technology for The Netherlands using the PV selection map. Finally, Performance Ratios of various existing PV systems were calculated using suitable irradiation decomposition and transposition models as a proof for the validity of the selection map. The obtained results showed that PV systems using CIGS technologies exhibited higher performance ratios on average as was suggested by the selection map.","PV systems; Design; Module materials; Shading Tolerability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-08","","","","","",""

A major variable affecting the development time required is the elaborateness of PACE. When joining the accelerator, a multitude of guides condense to about 150 pages on innovation in the PACE accelerator.<br/><br/>Twenty interviews with PACE coaches and intrapreneurs indicate that this way of describing innovative practice is too elaborate for new innovators to grasp. Intrapreneurs struggle to understand their design process as the theory seems too linear to unlock the full potential of creative divergence and to react to emerging insights from user-tests.<br/><br/>A literature study shows that intrapreneurial skills are vital for the effectiveness of innovation. To achieve success, intrapreneurs need to become more skilled at balancing the five design activities of formulating, representing, moving, evaluating and managing.<br/><br/>To conduct these activities, intrapreneurs benefit from reflexive practice on their use of innovation methodology.

During the design phase of a nourishment, performance indicators can enable an objective comparison of a mega-feeder nourishment to alternative nourishment strategies, In the case of an existing mega-feeder nourishment, predictions of the performance enable an objective assessment of the need for additional nourishments in the proximity of a mega-feeder nourishment.<br/>Today, engineers and policy makers rely on expert judgement when assessing alternative nourishment strategies, or the need for additional nourishments. Currently no tool exists that enables quantification of the performance of a mega-feeder nourishment. Existing models that describe and predict developments of nearshore coastal areas have been applied before to assess the developments of a mega-feeder nourishment, but have not been validated specifically to describe the performance in terms of alongshore feeding. The research question is therefore: ""How to describe and predict macro-scale mega-feeder nourishment performance with behaviour-based coastal indicators?""<br/>A tool is proposed that enables the quantification of the performance of a mega-feeder nourishment, as well as the validation of models that describe and predict the performance of a mega-feeder nourishment, The tool is specifically aimed at quantifying the performance in terms of the alongshore feeding. The tool comprises of indicators that representatively quantify the contribution of sediment, the region of feeding, and the time it does so.<br/>The tool is applied to the Sand Engine, used as a case study to examine the applicability. This Sand Engine, constructed during the spring of 2011, has a nourishment volume of 21.5Mm3, initially spanned a width of 2.4km and extended 1km into the sea. Application of the indicators to the Sand Engine confirmed the performance developed with continuous trends, suggesting the performance can be predicted.<br/>From the validation of the model approaches, it is concluded that the analytical model can be used to predict the initial performance of a mega-feeder nourishment, if the longshore spreading is derived from the LST equation by Kamphuis. Second, if the bathymetry is regularly monitored (e.g. semi-annually), the input of the analytical model can be calibrated, enabling long-term predictions of the performance. If more detailed descriptions of the developments of a mega-feeder nourishment are needed, a bruteforce process-based numerical modelling approach can serve as a method to describe and predict the feeding performance of a mega-feeder nourishment.<br/>The performance of the Sand Engine is predicted with the validated models up until 2030. The volumetric growth will stagnate on the south, while on the north it is expected to grow up to 4Mm3. The width will increase to approximately 7km. From this, it is concluded that it is unlikely the Sand Engine will meet its original objective of contributing to coastal safety along the Westland coast (17.2km). Further, the half-life of the Sand Engine will be reached near 2030, indicating the actual lifetime is significantly longer than the design lifetime (20 years). <br","Sand Engine; Description; Prediction; Quantification; Performance; Behaviour; Indicators; Analytical model; Numerical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sand Engine","52.055729, 4.186864"

The regimes can be divided in two main groups namely, dispersed two-phase ﬂows and the separated two-phase ﬂows having relatively larger interface. Simulating a two-phase ﬂow itself is already a complex task. It gets even more complex when the ﬂow is turbulent. Each phase can be laminar or turbulent depending which one is taken as point of reference. Primary phase may be turbulent compared to secondary phase but may be laminar compared to the vessel.<br/>The objective of this master’s thesis project is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of two-phase stratiﬁed ﬂow settings relevant to Nuclear Reactor Safety (NRS) scenarios more speciﬁcally, the focus is placed on the modeling of Taylor bubble co-current ﬂow (airwater) in a vertical pipe in Two-Dimensional (2D) and Three-Dimensional (3D). This is done through the application and validation of i) OpenFOAM’s standard VOF solver in combination with a conventional RANS model to mimic the turbulence behavior of the ﬂow, and ii) NRG’s Runge-Kutta (RK) VOF solver in combination with a modiﬁed RANS model to capture the turbulent two-phase ﬂow with large interfaces. For the purpose of this project two data sets are selected against which the morphology of the Taylor bubble is compared, namely the analytical model of Tomiyama et al. [1] and the high resolution Taylor bubble LES data of Frederix et al. [2].<br/>It is shown that in case of i), where standard k−ε is applied to model the turbulence behavior, the model fails to predict the interface of entire Taylor bubble adequately. This is because standard RANS models, which are initially developed for single-phase ﬂows, overpredict the turbulence intensity near the interface. This is due to excessive turbulence production. This problem is addressed a.o. by Egorov et al. [3] who developed a model with a turbulence damping term in the turbulence model. This term is activated locally at the interface. Frederix et al. [4] have extended the Egorov approach in order to make it even more stable and robust. Frederix’s model is applied in ii) where it is shown that for a damping term, length scale, δ/D = 3.9×10−3 the turbulence model is damped at the interface while in the rest of the ﬂow the turbulence behavior is modeled properly by k−ω SST model.<br","Taylor bubble flow; two-phase flowe; Turbulence; RANS modeling; multiphase","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics","",""

When the bridge is in motion the calculations for the machinery part focus on the dynamic loads (torque) generating at the motor shaft. The calculation of these loads is carried out using tabulated formulas of the standard, which have been derived via a 2-DoF linear dynamic model. In this model the linear spring represents the total stiffness of the machinery part. For the calculation of the spring stiffness the push-pull rod component is excluded, assuming it as a rigid component of the system during the movement cycle of the bridge. The push-pull rod (also known as the buffer) is a component of the machinery of several bascule bridges that connects the leaf of the bridge with the drive mechanism. It consists of stacked disc springs and its stiffness varies based on the load acting on it.<br/>The main objectives of this thesis are to model the force deformation behavior of the buffer component, incorporate it in an update set of equations of motion of the bridge-machinery system, and study its effect on the decisive dynamic loads generated at the motor shaft during motion. First, the generalized force deformation diagram of the buffer is formulated with a piecewise function that is based on the force-deflection function for a stack of disc springs according to the standard DIN 2092:2006:03 (2006). Second, the damping of the buffer is modeled as Coulomb friction type, since friction is generated in various position in the stack of disc springs and is the main source of energy dissipation of the buffer component. The validity of the proposed modeling of the buffer component is evaluated via a SDoF model of it, performing a series of dynamic analyses and interpreting the results. Afterwards, the model of the buffer component is introduced in a new set of equations of motion for the bridge-machinery system, derived with the Lagrangian formalism technique. The resulting highly nonlinear set of equations of motion is implemented in the bascule bridge of the new Ramspol bridge located on N50. The analyses aim to the calculation of the torque generated at the motor shaft during an emergency stop at full speed. This loading case is the most decisive with respect to loads generating at the motor shaft.<br/>The resulted maximum torque from the dynamic analyses is compared with the torque calculated with the formulas of the standard NEN 6786:2001 (2001). The state of the buffer determines by which formula of the standard the comparison is carried out. A series of dynamic analyses is performed varying, the type of brake (constant or bilinear), the time the brake is applied, the duration of the emergency stop and the friction coefficient of the buffer. In case the buffer is not fully compressed, the calculations with the dynamic model result in lower maximum torque compared with the one according to the standard. In case the buffer is fully compressed the magnitude of the resulting maximum torque depends on the aforementioned variables, whilst the one calculated with the standard is independent of them. In general, the resulting maximum torque derived from the dynamic model decreases with the increase of the friction coefficient of the buffer and the bilinear modeling of the braking.<br","Movable bridge; Push-Pull rod; Buffer; Panama wheel; Nonlinear dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The main goal of this project is to determine the optimal location for an OTEC installation with a minimum lifespan of 30 years off the coast of Barranquilla and to make an anchor mooring design for the floater on which this installation is located. Bluerise has identified an area near the coast of Barranquilla for which OTEC can be applied. This area is situated within Colombia’s territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles, or 22.2 kilometres), where two locations have been identified by Bluerise: Location 1: 11.2028 latitude, -75.0003 longitude, Location 2: 11.2772 latitude, -74.9208 longitude.<br/> <br/>Environmental conditions - <br/>The daily wind direction is NE-ENE. There is no clear extreme wind direction. The daily waves have a dominant Northeast direction while the extreme waves have a dominant Northern direction. The extreme waves are generated far north of Barranquilla by very high wind speeds which explains the relatively high extreme significant wave heights in the area and the relatively low extreme wind speeds. The yearly average (nautical) surface current direction at the two possible floater locations is predominantly south or southeast. The top 20 strongest current speeds in the past few decades have come from the west or southwest however and therefore these are the normative current directions. The environmental conditions are equal for both possible floater locations. A temperature difference of 20_C is reached at warm water intake and cold<br/>water intake depths of 30 and 763 meters, respectively. The depths at which a temperature<br/>difference of 22_C is reached are 36 and 1023 meters (with temperatures of 27 and 5 degrees, respectively). The influence of the Magdalena river and upwelling is concluded to be negligible.<br/> <br/>Marine traffic - The two locations with safety zones are located in a traffic-dense area. The area is getting more traffic intense in the upcoming years. However, it will not pose an immediate threat to the operation. As location 2 has slightly less traffic, it would be preferable from a safety point of view.<br/> <br/>Seawater intake- and return pipes - Assuming a cold seawater intake temperature of 5C and a warm seawater intake temperature of 27C, the intake pipe lengths become 1023 and 36 meters, respectively. Based on the equation<br/>of state, the mixed water return flow pipe length becomes 130 m. At this depth, the effects of a difference in density between the surrounding seawater and the mixed returned water are minimized. Also, the depth is outside of the euphotic zone which minimizes algae growth. If the intake water is higher than 27 degrees, the discharge temperature will have a higher temperature. Calculations with the Equation of State reveal that the warmer the discharge temperature,<br/>the lower the density of the discharge water is. Whenever the discharge temperature is higher than the output temperatures, less depth is needed in order for the discharge water to be naturally buoyant. As the intake temperature fluctuates throughout the year, it is therefore advised to design the length of the discharge pipe at 120 meters. <br/> <br/>Anchor mooring design - The proposed anchor mooring design consists of a spread-moored 4x3 taut mooring system. The lines are composed of three parts: a 50 meter chain connected to the ship, a 1290 meter fibre line part and another 150 meter chain at the end that is connected to the anchor. The floater is positioned in a 58,05 angle with respect to the north in a northeast direction. This ensures comfortable operation during daily conditions and will reduce fatigue build up. The hurricane conditions were found to be governing. The design complies with the basis of design stated in section 5.3 and with the DNV-OS-E301 code and the API Recommended Practice 2SK.<br","OTEC; anchor mooring; design; Colombia; Barranquilla","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","MP237","10.9642103, -74.7970435"

(mentor); Hartjes, S. (mentor); Voskuijl, M. (mentor); Campe, Roy (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Preface In the wake of the economical crisis of 2008, the shipping industry changed from a very profitable industry to a struggling one, aiming to optimize vessel operations in order to survive. Theories regarding route optimization based on weather and oceanic currents exist, but only few reliable industrial applications can be found. This, together with nowadays global environmental concerns, is where the roots of this project, aiming at developing a route optimization tool for seagoing vessels, based on real-life vessel data, short-term weather forecasts and oceanic currents and monthly averaged sailing conditions can be found. Due to the huge amount of fuel burned by seagoing vessels, achieving just a fraction of fuel savings already results in a significant reduction of global greenhouse gas production. The concept of weather routing is not new, but the results that can be achieved by using it are not widely documented. In order to quantify this, a weather route optimization tool has been developed. The availability of detailed hindcast datasets made it possible to incorporate monthly averaged sailing conditions in the optimization process, influencing the decision on which route to take when weather forecasts are not available anymore. Analysis of different ratios between forecasts, monthly averaged conditions and taking the shortest path to describe the sailing environment, led to the conclusion that forecasts are more reliable than sailing according to the monthly averages or taking the shortest path, as long as these forecasts are available. When no forecasts are available, using monthly averages as reference environment is favored over taking the shortest path. While evaluating randomly selected routes, it became clear that the usage of these monthly averaged sailing conditions can reduce the fuel consumption by 0.59 %, where the total effect of applying weather route optimization is found to be approximately 3.18 %. Due to the limited number of simulations performed and the unstructured nature of the data distribution, the 95 % confidence interval of the expected fuel savings ranges from 2.54 % to 4.02 %. When assuming the achieved savings are approximating reality, application of weather route optimization on the entire CMB fleet, containing close to 100 vessels, leads to a CO2 emission reduction almost 80 thousand metric tonnes per year. This is the result of a fuel consumption reduction of 23.5 thousand tons, which would roughly saves 9.35 million US Dollar in bunker costs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Winter, J.C.F. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Steering feel is an important variable that contributes to drivers’ assessment of safety and comfort. As such, creating acceptable steering feel is one of the goals of automotive manufacturers. Prediction of subjective steering feel based on objective measures, for example, driver torque characteristics, can benefit the automotive industry by decreasing time and cost of the vehicle design process.<br/><br/>This thesis project examined the effect of steering column friction, a sole objective parameter, on subjective steering feel and on the drivers’ performance. A driving simulator study was conducted with 17 non-professional drivers, who drove and assessed 11 dimensions of steering feel for five steering configurations. The experiment was carried out in a fixed base driving simulator. The steering configurations differed only in the level of column friction: 0 Nm, 0.15 Nm, 0.27 Nm, 0.39 Nm, 0.50 Nm. The driving task was divided into two sections: Drive on a highway without prescribed manoeuvres to evaluate the steering feel and lane following to collect objective measurements. <br/><br/>Data collected during the experiment were tested with Friedman’s ANOVA. The results showed that the subjective assessments of the group were influenced by the level of friction. A more pronounced effect occurred between configurations with the lowest (0 Nm, 0.15 Nm) and the highest (0.50 Nm, 0.39 Nm) steering friction. Statistically significant differences were primarily found for the dimensions steering effort, steering effort in the neutral area, centering, and reluctant feel. Drivers assessed reluctant feel as increasing and returnability as decreasing with steering friction.<br/><br/>In term’s of drivers’ performance, a higher workload was observed with an increase in steering friction, as measured by steering reversal rate. The same effect is present in another measure of workload, standard deviation of steering angle (STS; corrective movements become larger with friction). Lane keeping performance was not significantly affected by column friction in the present study.<br/><br/>In summary, the results of the present study indicate that column friction is an important factor influencing a driver’s subjective steering feel, especially for configurations with at least 0.27 Nm. The findings suggest that friction can be tuned according to the driver’s preferences without incurring a decrease in performance. The potential effect of steering friction on drivers’ safety needs further study.","steering feel; driving simulator; subjective assessment; on-centre handling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

(mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The medical device market is continuously innovating to improve the outcome in the treatment of patients. One of these innovations is minimally invasive robot-assisted surgical systems to assist in performing laparoscopic surgical procedures and to allow surgeons to perform the most complex and delicate surgeries with pinpoint precision in very tight spaces in the body.<br/> <br/>The sweeping and rapid innovations in surgery can almost universally be seen as an advanced surgical treatment. However, there is a downside. The surgical instruments have become increasingly complex and therefore more and more difficult to clean. The reuse of improperly reprocessed reusable instruments may lead to surgical site infections and spread of diseases. This is an major public health concern, since the consequences of reprocessing failures are severe.<br/> <br/>The increasing difficulties of proper cleaning of complex instruments is often due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of the reprocessing process by the manufacturer. As is concluded in the literature review of Berendsen, the manufacturers must stop the downward spiral of developing increasingly impossible reprocessable devices and therefore the unnecessary purchase of expensive new reprocessing machines by hospitals. Berendsen recommended ''Design for Reprocessing'', which focuses on the design of simplified devices containing easy to clean design features which can be disassembled, or prevent hard to clean parts from getting contaminated.<br/> <br/>This fundamental aspect has been applied to the design and development of the Portable Laparoscopic Robotic System (PoLaRS) to ensure sterile (re)use in clinical applications. PoLaRS is a light weight, portable tele-surgical system developed for performing extra-luminal procedures with low costs in comparison with existing systems. The newly developed PoLaRS's instruments have a system which may be separated into different parts and are connected with the implementation of a Coupling Mechanism. The Coupling Mechanism is located in between the instrument and the Control Box. It is designed to prevent body fluids reaching the hard to clean Control Box due to blood flow through the instrument lumena towards the Box caused by the intra-abdominal pressure. Furthermore, it must prevent blood reaching the Control Box (manipulator arm) due to blood spattering or contamination from the sterile assistant's hand. Therefore, the complex Control Box does not need to be reprocessed, but only the remaining easy to clean instrument parts. In addition, the Coupling Mechanism must be user-friendly for the sterile assistant and the sterile processing staff. <br/>The Coupling Mechanism design must fulfil these multiple requirements to function accordingly. The critical features, such as the function of the sterile barrier and the use of the Coupling Mechanism, are evaluated to assess the system. Design improvements based on the experiments are implemented in the final Coupling Mechanism prototype.<br/> <br/>The final Coupling Mechanism has embodied a frictionless solution by releasing blood that enters the Coupling Mechanism to the outer environment via outflow-openings. This facilitates the transfer of movements from the Control Box to the instrument. The complex hard to clean parts of the PoLaRS are covered by the Coupling Mechanism. The results of the usability experiment regarding the experienced workload and the required time for assembling and dismantling the PoLaRS mock-up version were very promising.<br/> <br/>Future research should focus on experiments executed with the complete assembled PoLaRS including the final Coupling Mechanism to substantiate the promising results of the pilot study.","PoLaRS; SATA-RT instrument; Control Box; Coupling Mechanism; robotic surgery; cleanability; detachable; modular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Additionally, an internal and external analysis has been carried out. The analysis reveal that Quooker is aiming to introduce a new system which provides two additional functions for the end-user. The two additional functions are the cooled and sparkling water functions next to the existing function (cold, warm and boiled water). Additional, insights into the target group show that the design is perceived as not completely safe by the target group which is one of the main reasons why people do not buy a Quooker product.

Once the stage is re-entering the atmosphere, the low-melting-point materials melt and the inner parts will be exposed to excessive heat. With heat increasing, the parts will break into debris. Some of the fragments will burn in the atmosphere, others will crash into the Earth’s surface. Since there is a lack of knowledge about the re-entering physics, Demise Observation Capsule (DOC) project is started. The DOC collects information about the re-entry progress of launch vehicle stage, where it is mounted on. Several launchers and stages are considered to investigate the effect of the location on the DOC’s configuration. In an ideal situation, the DOC can be placed on all stages/parts of launch vehicles and at the same time it is optimized for that location. A generalized design concept that fits on several locations and stages, will reduce the cost and effort. Therefore, the thesis objective is to determine whether it is feasible to have a generalized DOC or an optimized DOC per location and load case. Additionally, the current DOC is designed for four locations and the second objective of this thesis is to optimize the current DOC and shift its center of gravity to the nose of the DOC. For this reason, the main research questions are as follows: Is it feasible to generalize the DOC concept design so that it will fit on every ESA launcher and stage and meet the predefined requirements and will withstand environmental loads while general operability of the DOC is guaranteed? How can the center of gravity be shifted on the DOC to its nose under the current designed loads such that the DOC can be made more stable?","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","","",""

As the port is ensuring a place in the top ten ports in the world, the city of Rotterdam is changing as well, growing and becoming a more international town. The municipality of Rotterdam is planning to build a 3rd bridge that will cross the Nieuwe waterweg and will connect the eastern or western part of the city center to improve the economic growth, welfare and attainability of the city. Although the exact location of the bridge is still under investigation, the construction of the bridge will obstruct the passage of cruise ships and consequently, they will not be able to reach Kop van Zuid where the current cruise terminal is located.<br/>Moreover, new buildings will be constructed in the coming years at Kop van Zuid. The construction of these buildings will lead to more logistics problems at the current terminal that will influence the viability of the entire area. Currently, the port of Rotterdam is facing an increase of entrance demand of cruise ships. The number of double mooring calls and the dimensions of the cruise ships are expected to grow in the coming years. The current cruise terminal cannot, without technical improvements, guarantee enough berthing space for two cruise ships at the same time. <br/>For these reasons, in 2015 the Port of Rotterdam Authority started the project “Zeecruise lange termijn visie”. One of the conclusions of the “Zeecruise lange termijn visie” project in case that the Port of Rotterdam Authority and the municipality of Rotterdam decide to change the location of the cruise terminal, was that the most suitable location for the future cruise terminal is Pier 1 of the Merwehaven. The Merwehaven is composed of four piers that were constructed between 1923 and 1931 using caissons as quay walls.<br/>Due to the age of the construction of the caissons and the requirements imposed by the new cruise terminal, a full feasibility study of the Merrwehaven had to be performed. The feasibility study is described in this report and mainly concerns the adaptation of the existing quay wall of Pier 1. The aim of this study was to maintain the existing caissons, avoiding the demolition of the structure and the need for constructing a completely new quay wall.<br/>The approach used to achieve this objective follows the principles of the basic design cycle of Roozenburg and Eekels. Different design phases distinguish this method and the structure of this report follows these phases. <br/>In the first phase, the functions, operational aspects, boundary conditions and assumptions of the Merwehaven and cruise market were analyzed. Based on this analysis the quay walls of Pier 1 were assessed. The main scope of the assessment was to establish whether the quay walls meet the requirements for the new cruise terminal and to identify the main issues that hinder the mooring of the cruise ships. The assessment proved that the quay walls do not meet the requirements of the new cruise terminal. Therefore, the conclusion was that to maintain the existing caissons of Pier 1 and ensure their stability a technical design solution must be provided. <br/>Different design concepts were proposed to solve the issues that hinder the mooring of the cruise ships along the caissons. Through a first design loop, the design concepts that did not have sufficient feasibility to become the final solution were excluded. From the remaining design variants the best design variant was selected, by means of an evaluation based on a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) and a cost estimation. From this evaluation, it turned out that the best technical design solution is to drive an underwater sheet pile wall in front of the caissons of Pier 1.<br/>Then, before performing the detailed design of the best design variant, special attention was given to the design bollard capacity of the cruise terminal. The bollard force is an important load in the design of quay walls. Hence, an extended study concerning the loads acting on the design cruise ship was carried out to define the required bollard capacity of the new cruise terminal. From this study, it turned out that the wind force is the dominant load acting on the design cruise ship and that the effect of passing vessels can be neglected. Based on this conclusion a static mooring analysis was performed to determine the load on the mooring lines of the design cruise ship and consequently the required bollard capacity. On the basis of the results of this analysis, the conclusion was that the existing bollards located on top of the caissons cannot withstand the mooring force and therefore new bollards with a capacity of 1700 kN have to be provided.<br/>In the last phase, the design variant with underwater sheet pile wall was elaborated in more detail. This detailed design was performed by analyzing the overall stability of the caisson and the deformation of the underwater sheet pile wall using the PLAXIS software. Based on these analyses the conclusion was that the design variant with the underwater sheet pile wall can adapt the existing caisson, used as quay wall at Pier 1 in the Merwehaven for the future cruise terminal of Rotterdam.<br/><br","Quay structures; Caissons; Bollard capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The goal was to create an environment in which passengers feel free to take some time to relax and forget about the aspects that cause them to experience stress or anxiety. The design is created to make the experience of passengers at airports less stressful and therefore more pleasant. This relaxing chair, the VITA Sentation Lounger, is equipped with the innovative Frequency Physio Support (FPS) technology. The FPS technology stimulates blood circulation, reduces muscle tension and with that it reduces anxiety symptoms, stress and the experience of pain (NEWAS,2018). A usability test with the VITA Sentation Lounger at Rotterdam The Hague Airport showed that the chair itself is experienced as very comfortable and relaxing. However, opinions about the FPS technology differ a lot, and passengers can evenly be divided in the following groups: 1. Passengers who prefer the chair without the FPS technology 2. Passengers who prefer the chair with the FPS technology 3. Passengers who don’t prefer one condition over the other. The usability test also showed that besides having a comfortable chair available, a more private area, having some kind of distraction available and being aware of time is very important for passengers to feel comfortable in the run-up to flying. The one thing passengers worry most about is missing their flight. Literature showed that a passenger brings individual perceptions, expectations and experiences into the environment, which all influence the overall comfort experience (Vink, Bazley &amp; Jacobs, 2016). Additionally, being surrounded by greenery in combination with green and blue colours reduces stress levels (Fjeld, 2000), and the presence of lavender scent (Kristidima, Newton &amp; Asimakopoulou, 2010) and relaxing music (Pothoulaki et al. (2008) and Khalfa, Bella, Roy, Peretz &amp; Lupien, 2003) increases the experience of relaxation. Insights from the usability test and literature research resulted in two concept designs, of which one has been chosen to prototype and test in a second usability test. This concept design focusses on distraction and gives passengers the opportunity to forget about negative experiences and to focus on the positive things that come with the travel journey. The seconds usability test was conducted with a prototype of the chosen concept design. The test showed that the designed environment can contribute to a more comfortable and relaxing experience in the run-up to flying and participants mentioned that they would love to use the design at the airport. Main improvements include the possibility to safely store your luggage, the ability to see if the chair is occupied from the outside, and some problems occurred with unclear or even missing information that was given by the interface (control system). These insights lead to the final concept design that is showed in picture 1 and 2. For further research, it is mainly suggested that the final concept design is being tested at an actual airport with a broad group of passengers and some practical considerations need to be taken into account. Besides, it is very important to start convincing airports and airlines about the benefits the design can bring when it’s implemented in their lounges.","Airport; Passenger; Comfort; Experience; Relax","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Lack of such support can impede language usability and adoption, as developers prefer different editors. However, supporting M editors for N languages requires M * N implementations to be built and maintained, which is known as the IDE portability problem. Portable editor services aim to reduce this to M + N implementations, which leads to the main question of this thesis: how can we make the editor services of languages portable across editors?<br/>Language definitions made in the Spoofax language workbench can automatically expose their editor services in any editor that Spoofax supports. Therefore, we evaluate the portability of Spoofax Core, the editor-agnostic core of Spoofax, through an implementation of the workbench in the IntelliJ editor.<br/>To get portability for editor services of languages in general, we first investigate how editor services can be added to the most popular editors, and explore their features, documentation, and API. From this, we derive a platform-agnostic model for portable editor services: AESI, the Adaptable Editor Services Interface. AESI describes the maximum set of common editor service features supported by the editors we investigated, while at the same time imposing minimal requirements upon any implementation of these editor services. We evaluate AESI by providing two language implementations, and adapting AESI to Eclipse, IntelliJ, and VS Code. Finally, we compare AESI with two other solutions to the IDE portability problem: LSP and Monto.","portable; editor services; spoofax; intellij","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drag forces generated by the limbs are consequently used for forward propulsion. The hands are responsible for approximately 60% of the generated propulsive forces. Reaching a podium place in competitive swimming is dependent on differences in finishing times smaller than 0.5%. For this reason, investigating the effects of hand configuration on swimming performance is of interest. Configurable properties of the hand are the finger spreading and hand palm cupping. It is argued that a small finger spreading leads to a larger obstruction in the fluid flow compared to closed fingers, resulting in larger generated drag forces. Similarly, a small hand cupping is expected to increase the drag forces in analogy to the drag increase experienced by cupped disks. In this thesis, an experimental investigation is carried out to look into the effects of both finger spreading and hand cupping. Furthermore, CFD simulations are used for the abstract modelling of hands with finger spreading by use of slotted disks. <br/>Towing tank experiments in water are performed to investigate the effects of finger spreading for five full-scale arm models. The research showed that a small finger spreading of 5° can increase the drag coefficient of the hand with 1.7%, in comparison to closed fingers. Larger spreadings were found to influence the drag coefficient disadvantageously, where a 20° finger spreading reduced the drag with 1.5%. The found effects indicate that finishing times can be reduced with 0.3% by using 5° finger spreading instead of 20° spreading.<br/>Wind tunnel experiments are used to look into the effects of hand cupping. Dynamic scaling based on the Reynolds number is used to account for the used air flow. Effects for five full-scale arm models with different hand cuppings were investigated, these have a 5° finger spreading which was found optimal from previous research. It appeared that small rotations around the longitudinal axis of the arm have large influences on the drag coefficient, where a maximum in drag was never found for the hand palm perpendicular to the flow, but with an abducted thumb opposing the flow. The research showed that 6% more drag is generated for a flat hand in comparison to the largest investigated hand cupping. This indicates that finishing times can be reduced with 0.8% by using a flat hand instead of a large hand cupping. <br/>In conclusion, the research found a hand configuration with 5° finger spreading and a flat hand palm optimal for maximizing drag forces. The found effects on finishing times indicate that using this hand configuration can play an important role in reaching podium places during front crawl swimming.<br","Swimming; Proplusion; Fluid mechanics; Experimental study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work the potential of capillary forces for soft-tissue manipulation is investigated; not only a single liquid bridge is used, but multiple bridges as well since capillary forces can be enhanced by contact splitting. Specifically, laparoscopic bowel surgery was chosen, because with current instruments it remains difficult to atraumatically grip soft delicate tissues.<br/><br/>Three 30 by 30 mm grippers were cast from PDMS (1:10 weight ratio curing agent to base) with pillars of diameter 2, 1 and 0.5 mm, named D2, D1 and D05 respectively. The ratio of pillar area to total gripper area is 0.6. The pillar structures and a flat reference sample were wetted with demi water and placed on the substrate (glass and 15 wt.% gelatin as tissue phantom). A preload is applied to attach the gripper to the connector and both are retracted at 0.1 mm/s to measure the adhesion. From the camera footage of the measurements on glass was confirmed for D1 and D2 that capillary forces were measured. The best performing pillar structure was D1 with adhesion values between 1.3 – 3.4 kPa, but it did not outmatch the flat samples’ adhesion: 2.2 – 3.1 kPa. On gelatin, the evidence for measuring capillary forces was not conclusive. The mean adhesion of all geometries on gelatin was 0.8 kPa and there was no clear effect of the different pillar diameters on the measured adhesion values.<br/><br/>From these results it is concluded that capillary forces should not be used as the main method to lift tissue, but rather to complement other gripping methods such as suction.","Adhesion; Gripping; Capillary bridges; Tissue manipulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

In de eerste interventie voorafgaand aan het brainstormen, hebben de leerlingen klassikaal de leerdoelen van de ontwerpvaardigheid verhelderd door gezamenlijk adviezen op te stellen om divergent te denken.

To bridge this gap, all stakeholders that influence the development must perform optimally. This thesis presents the performance of OTEC developing stakeholder groups (‘clusters’) in Japan, the Netherlands, France, USA and Malaysia and recommendations for improvement. Interviews with the main OTEC developing organizations gave input for a technological innovation system analysis which is used to determine the performance of each cluster. Four structural elements are used to define the current state of OTEC in each innovation system and seven functional elements are used to systematically study activities and events that influence the technology development and commercialization. A cross-case analysis is used to find industry-wide trends.<br/><br/>The cluster around Naval Energies and Akuo Energy in France and the cluster of OTE Corporation and Makai Ocean Engineering both perform well on most of the investigated elements. The performance of the Dutch cluster suffers somewhat from the small scale of its main OTEC developing actor, Bluerise. The Japanese cluster performs very well on research related aspects although limited commercialization efforts can negatively influence further technology diffusion. Malaysia lacks essential actors for technology development and should therefore not be defined as an OTEC cluster.<br/><br/>Two influences external from the industry were found to affect OTEC development negatively. Firstly, current support mechanisms for emerging (renewable energy) technologies are not suitable for technologies that require high upfront investments due to focus on production subsidies instead of upfront grants or guarantees. Secondly, OTEC is not included in renewable energy development plans from governments, which negatively influences the confidence in the technology of industry and investors and creates uncertainty in the market.","OTEC; Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion; technological innovation systems; functions of innovation systems; Innovation; Policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Knowledge of the influence of loading directions on trabecular bone remodeling in spine is of significant value in understanding the development of spine deformities and vertebral bone quality across different scales. Information on the constitution of a preferred trabecular orientation and mechanical properties of trabecular bone are important indicators in this respect. The current thesis aimed at exploring these aspects across multiple length scales in the spine. The thesis is divided in two parts. The influence of loadings less dominant than compression, i.e. shear, on the constitution of a preferred trabecular orientation in the spine on the macro-tissue level (&gt;10 mm) was investigated in the first part (Part I). This influence was related to mechanical characteristics of trabecular structures on the micro-tissue scale (1-10 mm) in the second part (Part II). In Part I, primary trabecular orientations (PTOsmacro) near the superior and inferior vertebral endplates of L1 and L5 of 6 human spine cadavers were determined on the macro level using micro computed tomography imaging (voxel size = 120 m3), by calculating the dominant fabric principal vector. Their relative deviations to the axial compression vectors in the spines, quantified by the normals to the endplate (NEs), were determined afterwards. The average deviation between the PTOmacro and NEs was 6.24⁰ (±4.34⁰). The PTOsmacro did not show a preference towards the anterior or posterior direction relative to the NE. From the deviations, it was concluded that trabecular bone in the spine predominantly adapts to compression loads. However, secondary loading directions, such as shear, are of additional influence. In Part II, 13 small cubes (6.0x6.0 mm) from the volumes of interest in Part I were analysed on the micro level with regard to elasticity. Components, component ratios and primary elastic orientations (PEOmicro) of elasticity tensors, computed by the simulation of mechanical tests in finite element (FE) models, were calculated. PTOs of the cubes (PTOsmicro) were compared to the PEOsmicro and related to the PTOsmacro and NEs (Part I) qualitatively. Elasticity tensor components were within a reasonable range (approximately 1-250 MPa, excluding outliers) and no material symmetry was found, i.e. the structures were mechanically anisotropic. PTOsmicro deviated 13.90⁰ (±8.04⁰) with respect to the PEOsmicro on average. 10 out of 13 PEOsmicro had similar anterior or posterior tendencies as the PTOsmacro with respect to the NEs. 11 out of 13 PTOsmicro had similar anterior or posterior tendencies as PTOsmacro with respect to the NEs. Elastic properties of typical trabecular structures in the vertebral bodies were successfully determined. Due to a relatively low resolution, PEOsmicro deviated strongly with the PTOsmicro. Such deviations could function as indicators for bone quality in skeletal disease diagnostics using low resolution imaging. PTOsmicro and PEOsmicro agreed relatively well to the PTOsmacro on the macro-tissue level, in terms of anteriorly or posterior tendencies relative to axial loading in the spine. This outcome shows promise for multi-scalar biomechanical analysis of trabecular bone.","spine; trabecular bone; bone adaptation; fabric; elasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Tissue Biomechanics and Implants","A Multi-Scale Approach to Implications of the Preferred Vertebral Trabecular Orientation on Spine Biomechanics","52.0863° N, 5.1799° E"

Therefore it is important that the vehicle models reflect the behaviour of the actual vehicle.<br/><br/>This thesis investigates the methods used to estimate the model parameters which influence the resulting vehicle simulation.

The production of new plastics is extremely cheap and convenient resulting in a lack of incentive to retrieve plastic litter. Annually 8 billion kg of plastics enter the ocean polluting the ocean environment, of which the largest part via rivers and other waterways. Eventually, plastic enters the food chain through fish and other sea life. Organisations are arising worldwide to reduce the plastic stream to the ocean. The Great Bubble Barrier is based on the idea of filtering plastics from rivers by making use of a bubble curtain.<br/>The principle behind this idea is as follows: a long tube is placed diagonally across a river and air is pumped through it creating a wall of bubbles. The rising bubbles enhance upward entrainment of the surrounding water. When approaching the surface the vertical flow is transferred into horizontal flow away from the bubble curtain on both sides. Together with the crossflow, this horizontal flow induced by the bubbles drives the plastic to the side. This horizontal flow is strongest at the surface and decays linearly down to 25% of the water depth. Therefore, only the plastic litter floating in the upper layer is affected. The vertical and horizontal flow induced by the bubble curtain in still water has been extensively researched in the last century. In this thesis, the influence of the crossflow on the behaviour of the bubble curtain is explored. Predictions of the horizontal surface flow are based on a theoretical model and validated with experiments performed at the Eastern Scheldt Flume at Deltares.<br/>The model is based on the assumption that the maximum bubble induced horizontal velocity is not influenced by the strength of the crossflow. At every depth in the surface layer, the two velocities can be summed up. Depending on their magnitude and the angle of the curtain, the direction of the resulting flow at that depth can be calculated. If the resulting flow is directed to the upstream side of the bubble barrier, the plastics are assumed to stay on the upstream side too and will, therefore, be led to the side of the river. If the resultant is directed to the downstream side of the bubble curtain the plastics are assumed to break through.<br/>The vertical velocity of water in the plume, as well as the horizontal bubble induced velocity, is calculated using two equations. One is derived from the momentum balance and the second is empirically found by Bulson. The results of both equations are compared with the experiments. For the vertical velocity, the momentum balance derived equation gives better results, whereas Bulson's equation gives a higher accuracy for the horizontal velocity. The crossflow is described by a logarithmic profile.<br/>For all angles and crossflow velocities, the airflow required to keep the resultant upstream can be calculated at every depth in the surface layer. The airflow that is theoretically required to keep the resultant at a 10 cm depth upstream, is shown to be sufficient to block 90% of the tested objects in all experimental setups. The smaller the angle relative to the direction of the crossflow, the smaller the total required airflow over the whole tube despite the longer required tube length.<br/>This work has gained a better understanding of the working principle of a bubble curtain as a plastic barrier. Further research on its performance in deeper waters is advised.","Plastic pollution; Rivers; Bubble curtain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-02","","","","","",""

In this thesis work, we developed the CSPCs based on oxygen-alloyed polycrystalline silicon (poly-SiOx) passivating contacts, which shows less parasitic absorption compared with the polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) passivating contacts.<br/>In order to deploy poly-SiOx CSPCs in c-Si solar cells, we optimized the oxygen content, doping level, high-temperature annealing as well as the hydrogen passivation process. As a result, the excellent passivation for n-type poly-SiOx passivating contact on both flat surface (implied-VOC of 727 mV and J0 of 2.4 fA/cm2) and textured surface (implied-VOC of 723 mV and j0 of 6.9 fA/cm2) and for p-type poly-SiOx passivating contact on flat surface (implied-VOC of 709 mV and J0 of 13.9 fA/cm2) are obtained.<br/>With the optimized poly-SiOx passivating contacts, the front and back contacted (FBC) solar cells were fabricated in this thesis. An excellent fill factor of 83.5% was obtained in the solar cell with front and rear poly-SiOx passivating contacts, indicating an efficient carrier transport and collection. An active area efficiency of 21.5% featuring Jsc of 40.8 mA/cm2 was measured on a front side textured FBC solar cell with the optimized poly-SiOx passivating contacts. It indicates the potential for achieving a conversion efficiency of above 23.0 % with the same cell configuration in the short term.<br","Carrier selective passivating contacts; oxygen-alloyed polycrystalline silicon; tunneling oxide; plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; high-temperature annealing; hydrogen passivation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-01","","","","","",""

However, at the moment the beaches are retreating. An example is the erosion of Hellshire Beach, showing a retreat of ten meters in only seven years. To preserve the beaches effectively, a new concept is requested. The main requirements of the system are wave attenuation and the marine life enhancement. <br/><br/>The literature study showed, a variety of coastal management techniques exist. However, none of those solutions are capable of attenuating waves and enhancing marine life in an effective way. Ranking criteria are given and the following concept groups are generated: boulders, gabions, marine blocks, big (open) blocks and 'lego' (interlocking) blocks. The Multi-Criteria Analysis shows that the big (open) blocks are the most viable and two concepts are designed within this concept group: a triangular and a hexagonal block structure.<br/><br/>In the hydrodynamic and wave models (Delft3D), a study is performed to find the relation between breakwater dimensions and wave attenuation. Also, three different conditions are modelled: daily conditions, hurricane conditions, and one-year storm conditions at the Hip-Strip in Montego Bay. Using the results from the hurricane model, the flow- and wave forces are calculated using the Morison equations for lift and drag. Three lay-outs for submerged breakwaters are tested in the model. This led to the final lay-out which is a combination of the three tested breakwaters.<br/><br/>Following the Delft3D models, a structural analysis is done with the flow- and wave forces from the Morison equation. The structural analysis focuses on the sliding and uplift of the submerged breakwater. The hexagonal structure shows a better stability than the triangular blocks in hurricane conditions and therefore chosen as the final concept. A sensitivity analysis is performed with regard to the friction coefficient, the force-time profile and the placement errors. The placement errors turn out to be crucial and a connection between the top block and the base is needed to retain stability. <br/><br/>The final dimensions (l x w x h) of the hexagonal blocks are 3 x 0.75 x 0.93 meter. The blocks can be made from a low strength class concrete and reinforcement is needed to provide strength during lifting. To enhance the marine life enhancement properties, fish condos of 4"" and 6"" are provided, the surface is made more permeable and the pH of the concrete is altered by curing.<br/><br/>The structure shows great future potential and can be built soon. It is a state of the art structure, the stability is high, it enhances the marine life, the final dimensions will precisely agree with the drawings and there is no need for a nearby quarry. However, to all this benefits, there is also a drawback; the cost. The cost is a multiple of the conventional armour stones. Recommendations are given to bring expenses down. Placement in shallow water is preferred and replacing steel reinforcement by fibre reinforcement is worth investigating. Those recommendations will decrease the cost and will increase the viability of the Honeycomb block concept.","Beach erosion; Concrete; Breakwater; Marine life enhancement; Wave Attenuation; Modular system; Modelling","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18.4762, -77.8939"

Nanofiltration (NF) is widely implemented in water reclamation treatment particularly in industrial field. However, the presence of silica hinders the possibility of obtaining a high recovery in a NF membrane system. In this work, the effect of silica concentration on the scaling of a NF membrane was investigated. Three types of feed water (demineralized water, water with 100 mg L-1 and 300 mg L-1 of SiO2) were fed to a single stage nanofiltration element. All cases were carried out at room temperature, pH values ranged 7 - 8 and a constant recovery of 11±1% for 24 hours continuously. The mass transfer coefficient (MTC) was used as method to determine the scaling of the membrane module. Results showed that no silica scaling occurred during the system runtime. Nonetheless, for all cases, an initial decrease in MTC could be detected. On the one hand, based on some literature reports, it is likely that a part of silica (mainly colloid) had precipitated on the membrane surface forming a more porous layer than the precipitation of polymerized monomeric silica. But to verify this argument, a further autopsy method is demanded. On the other hand, concentration polarization may also contribute to the initial decline in mass transfer coefficient. But the reason for the decrease for demi-water case remains unknown. In brief, Nanofiltration membrane can operate at a silica concentration up to 300 mg L-1 for 24 hours in lab-scale. The guideline (120 mg SiO2 L-1) suggested in the industrial standard (ASTM, D4933-08) was judged to be relatively conservative. For more practical purpose, further study is needed.","Nanofiltration; brine; silica scaling; high silica concentration","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","ZERO BRINE",""

Images from the past 30 years have shown coastal retreats of up to 1.3 km. Mangrove forest used to be present in large numbers at the location. These forests enhance accretion, but due to different reasons, the number of mangroves has decreased significantly. Several attempts have been made to rehabilitate the mangrove at WnZ. Sediment Trapping Units (STUs) have been constructed, with the purpose to enhance accretion and thereby create ideal conditions for mangrove development. The units consist of walaba poles with bamboo as filling material. Walaba is a suitable wood type for this and also grows in Suriname. From bed level change results, field observations and interviews it could be concluded that there is room for improvement. Therefore, the following project goal was formulated: ‘To present methods for mangrove rehabilitation at the WnZ coast, which can be supported by the key stakeholders’.<br/><br/><br/>To present mangrove rehabilitation methods, it was necessary to gain insight regarding the WnZ stakeholders’ involvement when it comes to coastal management. Fourteen key stakeholders were identified and analyzed. To gain even more insight into the views, perceptions and wishes of the WnZ region’s inhabitants, a survey was also conducted. Knowing the success factors and design requirements resulted in the analysis of which mangrove rehabilitation designs are applicable and supported by the region’s stakeholders. The first step was conducting a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) in which five alternatives are weighed. From this analysis the top three variants were chosen as preliminary designs: 1) Adapted STU, 2) STU with Nourishment and 3) STU with chenier. Finally, support by stakeholders for the mangrove rehabilitation designs can only be gained if they are engaged. This was tackled by composing a stakeholder engagement plan. In this plan, the following three strategies were formulated: 1) Setting up a bamboo farm, 2) Setting up a Mangrove Vacation Resort and 3) Growing salt-tolerant plants. These strategies can contribute to the economic development of the region if implemented, which could then also benefit the various stakeholders.<br","Mangrove rehabilitation; Sediment trapping units; Suriname; Coastal erosion; Stakeholder engagement","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","MP244","5.903, -55.225"

However, only few of these approaches can take into account the vehicle’s dynamics, as well as comfort and safety constraints. Moreover a degree of optimality of the deviation is required in order to keep the vehicle as close as possible to the nominal trajectory. A model predictive control (MPC) based trajectory planner is designed to solve a constrained optimal control problem. Using the ACADO toolkit, highly efficient self contained C code is generated to solve the trajectory generation problem very rapidly. <br/><br/>A single-track model with front and rear wheel steering is used to predict the four-wheel-steered vehicle’s manoeuvring capabilities in every consecutive initial state. This enables the planner to take into account the GRT’s dynamics, without overcomplicating the optimization problem. The performance of the planner is tested in Simulink.","four wheel steered; autonomous; ACADO toolkit; mpc; trajectory generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Literature suggests that this stability can be obtained by separating routine and non-routine work, and focusing on quick identification of non-routine tasks by completing inspection tasks early in the check. Current task planning methods show limitations in producing a feasible task planning, motivating the need for an advanced task planning model. This model combines the task elements of manpower, work order, and aircraft zone to find the minimum TAT given the task complexity-based heuristic. For this model, aircraft zones have been redefined, as the zones specified by Boeing are not suitable for task planning. An experiment using the advanced task planning model is conducted for the Inspection Phase tasks of the Boeing 777 C07 check. The target is to complete all tasks in 48 hours. Results show that it is feasible to perform all Inspection Phase tasks in 61.28 hours, where 99.51% of the tasks is completed in 48 hours. Completing all tasks takes 8 shifts, with a maximum of 31 technicians in a shift. The total TAT can be further reduced by identifying and lifting the constraints in the planning. One example shows how this can lead to an 8 hour reduction in total TAT for the best experiment scenario, bringing the TAT closer to the 48-hour goal. This demonstrates how the advanced task planning method can be used to stabilise aircraft heavy maintenance.","Airframe; MRO; Maintenance; Planning; C-check","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-01","","","","","",""
