Radar sensors have the property that the performance is not to be affected by low vision conditions compared with camera sensors or laser based radar sensors, which makes it crucial for the autonomous driving system.<br/><br/>Automotive radar system utilizes millimeter-wave band to detect the range, velocity and direction of arrival (DOA). Commercial 24 GHz and 77GHz radar have been well developed in vehicle applications at present, and the future trend is 79 GHz solution with wider 4 GHz bandwidth, which has been defined by the European Commission in 2004 as the frequency allocation for automotive shortrange radar systems. The main modulation method of automotive radar is Frequency-Modulated Continous-Wave(FMCW), which holds advantages including high-resolution distance measurement, quick updating and lower sampling frequency required on hardware.<br/><br/><br/>%good functions in the various weather condition.<br/><br/>The resolution and accuracy of DOA estimation depend on the number of used antennas and their physical size. To improve the performance advanced algorithms and antenna configurations can be used. So-called super-resolution techniques can improve the estimation performance but suffer when few measurements are available and the number of targets is unknown, and the performance will also be degraded by correlated signals.<br/><br/>Monopulse is an established technique for radars for precision angle estimation. It enables DOA realized in only one pulse and requires quite less computation complexity. Conventional monopulse with one transmitter and two receivers and phased array monopulse have been well developed especially in tracking radar system. MIMO-monopulse has been studied in some literature, but most of them utilize distributed MIMO. The research and application of colocated MIMO-monopulse are still in progress. <br/><br/>In FMCW automotive radar application, clutter may have a strong effect on DOA detection and estimation of targets with low RCS, e.g. pedestrian. With Space-Time Adaptive Processing(STAP), it is possible to suppress the clutter in the angle-Doppler domain. MIMO-monopulse basically utilizes digital beamformer to generate sum and difference channel, which also allows STAP processing to obtain adaptive sum and difference weighting. With STAP clutter can be canceled, thus false detection of MIMO-monopulse will be avoided. <br/><br/>In this master thesis, we propose the solution of angle estimation algorithm using MIMO-monopulse based on an actual automotive radar provided by NXP using colocated MIMO antenna. The algorithm is simulated through Matlab and verified on real experimental data. The performance of the algorithm is compared with conventional DOA algorithm and the advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. A feasible extension to STAP will be discussed to suppress the clutter for preventing false DOA estimation.<br/>Since monopulse estimator has been approved high performance in the field of single target tracking (such as low RCS pedestrian), our proposed algorithm is also validated in single and multiple target DOA estimations, which is an attractive scenario for a potential application using MIMO-monopulse.","Target localization; DOA; MIMO; monopulse; FMCW; automotive radar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-30","","","","","",""

One of them is the fact that sodium silicate, active component, is considered a green chemical. Moreover, this component has shown the ability to generate thermally activated plugs at far away distances from the wellbore improving oil recovery. This work aims to give further understanding of how to approach the simulation of silica gelation kinetics, by integrating experimental data to a novel simulation approach for this process and how it can be applied to industry needs. <br/><br/>The simulations are performed using a thermal-compositional reactive formulation in Stanford’s Automatic Differentiation General Purpose Research Simulator (ADG- PRS) based on a fully implicit approach. The motivations for selecting this method is the strong coupling between chemical and flow variables linked to drastic changes in permeability profile and the absence of methods in literature addressing this subject consistently. The implementation of the silicates reaction assumes an oligomerization reaction through a fourth-order reaction rate describing the deposition of solid silicate along the reservoir. The methodology followed in this document is structured in three chapters: calibration and study of kinetics, comparison with a previous study and field applications. <br/><br/>Validation of the model displays a match between core experiments and simulations. Results from this section suggest a strong dependence on upscaling of the reaction rate constant and encourage further research on this topic. Study of kinetics, from a simulation perspective, reveals that the process timescales and local domain play a major role in resolution. Numerical convergence of the solution was achieved for a two-meter grid along the flow direction and simulation timesteps below 1 day. Results from comparison with previous works show great differences in the formation of the in-depth silicate plug. The prescription of the equation as a solids deposition proposes more realistic results in terms of plug distribution and activation. Moreover, cumulative oil production improvements rounding 7% over a fields file, account for realistic figures. The application on channeled subsurface confirms the possibility of implementing the process on more realistic subsurface. A clear optimization of the water sweep around the plugged zones is evidently leading to improvements, rounding the percentage mentioned above. Contrary to expectations, after introducing a blockage, no major variation in flow towards producer’s perpendicular to the main channel are observed. In the geothermal applications, the generation of a plug helps to increase the thermal breakthrough time, extending the geothermal doublet lifetime. <br/><br/>The overall process has proved to be sensitive to parameters such as silicate concentration in solution, the volume of a pre-flush batch and the volumes of silicate solution injected. These factors give room for optimization of the process for future studies.","Simulation; Petroleum; diversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

'Luggage services' are a recently emerged, promising innovation that could possibly help with easing luggage congestion at the airport. Consequently, Schiphol has shown interest in luggage services, but research knowledge on possible target group of users is unknown. Schiphol and Delft University of Technology are both contributing to PASSME, a EU-funded research project aiming to reduce passenger door-to-door travel time by 60 minutes and to improve passenger experience at airports.<br/><br/>Via this programme, a Master's thesis research project was carried out that had the following research questions: 1. Who are possible users for luggage services? 2. What are the needs of these users in the current passenger journey? 3. What features should the service offer to attend to these needs? The project also had the aim to find out how the solution could improve passenger experience and cut down waiting time, alleviate the luggage congestion problem at Schiphol as well as to explain what Schiphol's role in luggage services could be.<br/><br/>The project was carried out via a co-creation approach, having members of the target group dictate the service requirements and features, which would then be further designed and evaluated with these target users. End deliverable was a service blueprint depicting multiple level interactions taking place at various stages of using a luggage service.<br/><br/>The outcome was that holidaying parents and seniors could be a good leading target group for the service due to bringing lots of luggage along the trip and because of reduced mobility brought by aging. Main identified user needs were having control, being informed and having trust, that a luggage service should convey via different kinds of interactions. It should offer its users options to tailor the service to each user's individual schedules and trip itinerary and keep them informed of their luggage. It should also operate under a known brand that the users can trust.<br/><br/>Finally, it was concluded that luggage services can improve passenger experience by reducing waiting time at the airport as well as easing luggage-related stress during other parts of the holiday journey. They also have the potential to ease Schiphol's luggage congestion by diverting luggage away from the airport, although it is recommended that Schiphol looks also into other options. Schiphol itself has good potential to operate a luggage service with industry partners under Schiphol's familiar, trusted brand.","Luggage Services; Co-design; Service Blueprint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","PASSME",""

Delfi Space is the CubeSat Development program of the Delft University of Technology and a subprogram of Defi-Space is Delfi-PQ which aims to develop PocketQubes which are an order of magnitude smaller than the CubeSat standards. One of the advanced payloads that would potentially be a part of the Delfi-PQ is an imager/camera. The imager needs to be as small as possible in order to fit into the Delfi-PQ satellites. The design of the camera has remained the same throughout the years and one of the reasons that increase the thickness of the camera is the presence of lenses. A way to reduce the size of the camera would be to remove the lens out of the equation. However, this introduces additional problems and trade-offs in the camera. These lenses can be replaced by masks/coded apertures. One of the additional steps in using coded-apertures is that additional computational steps need to be performed in order to reconstruct the image. The kind of computation that needs to be performed depends on the kind of masks that would be used. In this thesis, a separable mask is chosen and computer simulations on separable masks have been performed. Two image sensors that can be used in the picosatellite were chosen for implementation and the hardware/software is designed and developed. The experimental setup for determining the field of view of a lensless camera has been developed and tested. One of the trade-offs observed through the experiments is that the acceptance angle of a lensless imager had reduced by 38 percent and 31.8 percent in the horizontal and vertical directions compared to a conventional lens-based system. Based on the experimental results, the field of view of the camera has also been determined. A singular value decomposition based method has been developed and is used to align and calibrate the camera with the mask. The final step is estimating the system matrices of the lensless system. The system matrices enable the perfect reconstruction and a complete realization of a separable mask based lensless camera. A scheme for estimating the system matrices of the lensless imager using Hadamard basis is proposed and confirmed using simulations and the strategy for experimental verification is proposed. As far as we know, this is the first study that focuses on designing and developing a lensless camera in the visible light domain for use in picosatellites.","Lensless Imaging; Cubesats; Coded Aperture Imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until now, offshore wind turbines are mainly installed on bottom-mounted foundations, which are economically feasible in shallow waters. This factor has limited the development of offshore wind to those countries that can benefit from abundant wind resources located in shallow waters. To further extend the wind energy market, floating support structures for wind turbines are being studied and developed. This technology allows harvesting the wind energy resources located in deep waters, avoiding the costly construction and installation of large towers.<br/>A floating support introduces different challenges with respect to a bottom mounted one, not least the fact that the dynamics of the system are significantly different. The aim of this Master thesis is to generate a numerical model that can predict the dynamics of a geometrically simple, two-dimensional floater under the action of a train of regular waves. The wave-structure interaction problem is solved coupling the CFD solver fluidity with a rigid body code developed in Python that numerically solves the equations of motion for a rigid body and uses NURBS to define the geometry of the body. The immersed body method is used to represent the solid body into the fluid.<br/>The results obtained with this approach are then compared with potential flow results, experimental results and results obtained with other CFD solvers available in the literature. Similarities and differences are outlined for the different numerical experiments that have been simulated. In general, good agreement has been found with experimental results and other CFD solvers results. With respect to potential flow theory, good agreement has been found for low-frequency waves, while differences have been noticed for the high-frequency waves.<br","waves; Wave-structure interaction; CFD; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT), recently introduced by 3GPP, is a relevant Radio Access Technology (RAT) solution for deployment within smart grids, the electricity grids of the future, due to the need to provide low-cost connectivity to a large number of smart meters installed in households. Outage Restoration and Management (ORM), a smart grid use case, involves the smart meter User Equipment (UE) sending a notification message to the utility upon the detection of a loss or restoration of power. ORM is an effective way for utilities to quickly detect, localise and restore a power outage. However, depending on the extent of the power outage, a near simultaneous network access by multiple UEs may occur, leading to resource congestion, particularly of the so-called ‘random access channel’. This may impact the reliability, i.e. the percentage of total notifications successfully delivered within a certain transfer delay target, and in turn, the accuracy of the power outage localisation. Consequently, the maximisation of the ORM reliability performance for a technology like NB-IoT becomes a challenge, given that such use cases, though relevant, were not considered in its design phase. <br/>The main goal of this thesis is the optimisation of the NB-IoT network configuration, with a focus on packet scheduling, in order to maximise the ORM reliability performance. To this extent, a system-level simulation model is developed and implemented, incorporating realistic characteristics of energy distribution and mobile networks in four different environments (rural, suburban, urban and dense urban), the traffic characteristics of ORM and the relevant 3GPP specifications of NB-IoT. Additionally, a set of candidate time-frequency domain packet schedulers are proposed. A sensitivity analysis of key network configuration components is performed for a set of power outage scenarios i.e. network loads, the associated optimisation trade-offs are highlighted and a near-optimal network configuration is derived. <br/>Based on the sensitivity analysis, a proposed scheduler which prioritises UEs based on a combination of the Earliest Due Date First (EDDF) and Shortest Processing Time First (SPTF) principles, and assigns each UE a single uplink subcarrier with a subcarrier spacing of 3.75 kHz, performs best amongst all the candidate schedulers. Furthermore, the achieved reliability performance is close to 100% for all the considered power outage scenarios in the rural and dense urban environments. In the suburban and urban environments, close to 100% reliability is achieved for the majority of the power outage scenarios.","Smart Grid; wireless communication; NB-IoT; Optimisation; mobile networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Telecommunications and Sensing Systems","",""

In practice,there will be impurity gases in the injected CO2 stream or in the aquifer, which inﬂuence the dissolution rate of the CO2 stream. This research aims at ﬁnding a method to evaluate and calculate this inﬂuence. We focused on H2S and CH4. We found that given the speciﬁc circumstances underground and with added impurity gases, it is advisable to use an Equation of State, for which we chose Peng-Robinson. For the ﬁrst simulation with a large aquifer model, we were able to see the difference between a stream of pure CO2 and mixtures of CO2 with H2S and CH4 respectively. We observed that the gas stream with CH4 moved considerably faster along the aquifer than the streams of pure CO2 or CO2 mixed with H2S. On the other hand, we found that the dissolution rate was higher when H2S was present in the mixture. In the dissolution process, we see a large inﬂuence of instabilities on the dissolution rate as a result of density differences in the aquifer. However, the resolution of the large aquifer model did not allow to evaluate this inﬂuence sufﬁciently. In two consequent steps, we adapted our simulation model. First, we used a small scale model using only a fraction of the large aquifer model, thus considerably reducing the calculation time. Next, we increase the resolution of the small scale model. This higher resolution gave considerably more accurate results, reﬂecting the differences between the three cases and the inﬂuence of the instabilities in the aquifer. We concluded that the simulation based on the small scale and high resolution model yields accurate and reliable results. However, the calculated outcomes have to be corrected for the difference in boundary conditions between the large and small scale models.<br","CO2; dissolution; aquifer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Land-based deposits seem to be insufficient and shortage impends within the coming decades. Mineral resources from the deep ocean are considered as a possible complement. These minerals occur in various forms. One of these forms is lying on the subsea sediment of the deep ocean; polymetallic nodules. The nodules can be best described as potato shaped objects containing amounts of rare earth minerals like copper, nickel and cobalt. The economic feasibility depends on nodule abundance per square meter. An exploitation region with high prospectiveness in terms of economic feasibility is the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a region in the centre of the Pacific Ocean. As deep-sea mining implies, the mining site is located at a water depth of approximately 4000m. Characteristics such as these automatically result into challenging conditions. Exploitation of the nodules includes subsea harvesting and vertical transportation towards the sea surface. Activities which are within the scope of Boskalis, appealing their know-how and experience in dredging and marine operations. Currently, most developments are focused on vertical transport by means of hydraulic lifting through a riser. In order to avoid challenges such as flow assurance, riser handling and efficiency, Boskalis proposes an alternative solution; mechanical lifting.<br/><br/>Mechanical lifting can be considered as a newcomer in the relative early field of deep-sea mining. However, experience can be gathered from successive deep-sea lowering operations in the oil and gas industry. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the static configuration and dynamic response of the proposed mining system during operation, identify potential showstoppers and in the end asses whether deep-sea mining by mechanical lifting is technical feasible. When simplified, it is merely a matter of collection of nodules in transportation skips and hoisting of these skips towards the sea surface. Nevertheless, within this simple procedure various challenges arise. Therefore a start is made with a proper description of the proposed production method and identification of potential hazards and showstoppers. In complementing the initial research, the project site has been studied in terms of sea floor characteristics and metocean data. These obtained results served as input in further analysis. For example a sheared current is present, influencing the geometry of the hoisting wires. The sheared current phenomenom has been studied in which a quasi-static analysis is performed. The analysis has been carried out by discretization of the hoisting wires in a number of elements with a payload attached at the tip acting as a sinker. Here it became clear that for the applied hoisting setup, the influence of the local current is minimal and the influence of a forward vessel motion significant.<br/><br/>When acting in an offshore environment, the vessel motions might affect the deep-sea mining operation as a result of the connection with the nodule collector. Preliminary to a dynamic analysis, typical vessel motions are determined. This is done by selection of an appropriate mining vessel and implementation of a characteristic sea state using a Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. Vessel motions are calculated with the software package Seaway, resulting in an output in the frequency domain. The suspended hoisting wires are still numerically modelled by a discretization method. Axial analysis for the applied hoisting setup shows significant magnification of the response of the attached payload at full depth (4000m). This hurdle should be overcome by applying heave compensation, which has become a commonplace in this type of marine operations. Transversal motions for the applied setup are expected to be minimal as a result of the submerged state.<br/><br/>Conclusively, within this research first insight in technical feasibility is gained, but as a matter of fact yield further valuable questions along the lines of deep-sea technology. Therefore, we can conclude that deep-sea mining by means of mechanical lifting is feasible, but still offers numerous interesting topics in future research exceeding the current standards.","Deep-sea mining; Deep-sea lowering; Polymetallic Nodules; Vertical transport; Mechanical lifting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","","","","","",""

The SLAM problem is usually approached using probabilistic laws; both the robot's path and the environment are estimated and represented by probability distributions. <br/><br/>The estimate of the environment is incorporated into a map, which could either be one global map or a network of smaller connected local maps. In small areas where the sensors' errors and inaccuracies remain low, the creation of one global map is preferred. However, as the area grows larger, the global map becomes inaccurate due to accumulated errors. Therefore the strategy of creating a network of local maps is employed. Even though this strategy produces low error results, there is still a limit beyond which it does not scale. Specifically, as the mapping area grows even wider, the number of local maps increases which in turn causes the amount of required memory to increase. In addition, when it comes to loop closure or in other words the procedure of estimating whether the robot returned to a previously visited point in the map, the required computational power increases linearly or sometimes quadratically with respect to the number of local maps.<br/><br/>Consequently, SLAM algorithms suffer from scalability problems, especially when the mapping area becomes too large. Since robots are real-world devices, mapping solutions should be efficient and applicable to the robot's resources, even when these resources are limited. <br/><br/>In this thesis we propose a framework which addresses this scalability issue, aiming to reduce the computational needs and memory usage during the SLAM procedure. Additionally, our framework intends to facilitate loop closure, which can become troublesome in large environments. <br/><br/>Our framework uses multiple sensors and creates a network of hierarchically structured local maps. In order to assess our framework, we compare it to a technique which produces a network of non-hierarchically structured local maps. Our experiments show that in large areas our framework works ideally; the speedup is encouraging and the RAM memory overhead is negligible or conditionally lower.","SLAM; mapping; hierarchical mapping; Particle Filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-29","","","","","",""

Miniaturization of resonators helps to attain higher sensitivity, lower power consumption, higher resonance frequency along with lesser requirement of space. Since graphene is strong and stiff and has various other exceptional mechanical properties, graphene based resonators are of interest. Most of the garphene resonators in the past have been measured using optical setup. In order to get rid of this large and bulky setup, we aim to integrate it with an actuation electrode. The main goal of this thesis is to fabricate an electrostatically actuated graphene resonator. For the graphene membrane to work as a resonator, it needs to be suspended. In this work, various samples of different shapes, sizes and gap sizes have been analyzed using different experiments. Some samples are found to be collapsed. Whereas the other samples show corrugations and wave like structure. We observe clear differences between the SEM and AFM images of the collapsed and likely suspended samples. This is followed by the fabrication of graphene resonator with a buried electrode. This work presents all the failed attempts to fabricate suspended graphene membrane on a buried electrode before realizing the suspended graphenes membrane on p doped polysilicon and niobium electrode. To find the resonant frequency of the graphene membrane, experiments such as DC tuning and nonlinearity have been performed on the samples. We found a high frequency peak becoming much more non linear at high oscillation amplitudes than the low frequency peak. We suspect it to be graphene's resonant frequency. <br/><br/>In the later part of this work, the cause of the collapse of membranes is analyzed. Using stress measurements and observations from various samples, some hypothesis have been proposed for the collapsing graphene membranes. We also observed bubble like structures on graphene samples which formed suspended membranes after release. We have found the cause of collapse of membranes but the exact mechanism of suspension is still unknown. The EDX analysis on the bubbles show that the bubble area has significant amount of more oxygen than the other area of graphene. To use graphene membranes as a resonator, it needs to be fully suspended. Hence, it is crucial to understand the process of suspension of graphene in more detail.","graphene resonators; electrostatic actuation; suspension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-18","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

With this background, the research project is intended to define the design concerns as well as practical design methods of MR interactions.<br/><br/>Referring to the design concerns, the project looks into the construction of the spatial interface, and categorizes the interface elements into three layers according to the distinct functions as well as target users. The three layers include the public layer, the personal layer and the HUD layer. As the three layers have different positions, content, formats and design concerns, a design tool, namely the three-layer template, is developed. The three-layer template helps to categorize the interface elements, and consider the three layers not only separately but also as a whole. The three-layer template can fit in the use flow and swiftly visualize the interface design. <br/><br/>On the other hand, prototyping methods of diverse level of fidelity are explored during the project. Throughout the visionary assignment process, four prototyping methods have been implemented, namely physical mock-up, three-layer template, visual flow and testable mock-up. These prototyping methods make it possible to illustrate the design ideas swiftly and vividly, in order to support communication and presentation, and thus assist the design iteration. <br/><br/>To evaluate the design concern of three layers and the design method of prototyping, the research is conducted along with a visionary assignment in order to simulate a practical design assignment. The visionary assignment is a collaborative working space for city planning sessions with different stakeholders. <br/><br/>The topic is decided because it is one of the areas in which the MR technology has most potentials, and the collaboration space is a genre in which typical interface formats are involved.

When the contaminant reaches the groundwater, it can be subjected to subsurface flow due to which a contaminant plume may form and the contaminant can spread. In this research, it was investigated if a horizontal layer of reduced permeability can be engineered by using the SoSEAL (Soil Sealing by Enhanced Aluminium and DOM Leaching) concept to prevent leakage. Within SoSEAL, Aluminium-Dissolved Organic Matter complexation is used to clog the pore space with a reduction in permeability and hydraulic conductivity as a result. The concept is based on the natural process of podsolization in which a layer of reduced permeability (a hardpan) is formed by decades of organic matter leaching to the subsurface while complexing with metal cations. In this research, the complexation reaction using Aluminium-Chloride Hexahydrate and HUMIN-P 775 (Organic Matter) was investigated. The study roughly consisted of two parts, one concerning a situation of ideal mixing and one where the chemicals mixed inside a porous medium. When considering ideal mixing, eleven samples were created with 40 mL of Organic Matter solution and Aluminium solution in the range of 0 to 4 ml was added. These samples were created with an initial OM pH of 5, 7 and 9 to investigate the pH effect. The precipitation was quantified on the basis of measured pH, EC, UV254 and weight. With UV254 measurements it was found that 85% of the organic matter is able to form precipitates by binding aluminium ions. Depending on the pH, the amount of aluminium which needed to be added to reach this 85% varies. At a lower pH, less aluminium salt is needed to be added to form complexes with the available organic matter.<br/>The precipitation as a result of the complexation was also formed in the three-dimensional experimental set up. The chemicals were injected via horizontal drains and a flow was created towards an overflow drain. A narrow precipitation band of a few millimetres thick was formed at the contact interface of the aluminium and organic matter solutions. The Al-DOM precipitation was visualized with a 3D interpretation of photographs of horizontal cross-sections in Matlab. The results of this interpretation showed that it was difficult to form an area-covering layer of precipitates. Most precipitation was shown near the injection- and overflow drains, this assumes that due to separation of flow no Al-DOM precipitation took place in the middle of the set-up. Due to the lack of an area-covering layer, a significant reduction of hydraulic conductivity could not be measured. An average reduction of about 25-30% was measured. In COMSOL it was assumed that in ideal situations the precipitation band could cause a reduction in permeability of about two order of magnitude. The results of this research show that the SoSEAL concept, using HUMIN-P 775 and aluminium hexahydrate, can be used to form a horizontal layer of reduced permeability, but that it is challenging to create an area-covering layer due to separation of flow and preferential flow paths.","Geo-Engineering; Podzolisation; Subsurface Flow; Permeability Reduction; SoSEAL; Organic Matter; Complexation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

These breakwaters have an effect on the waves, the (wave-driven) currents and hence, the sediment transport along the coast. The waves and tide force an equilibrium sediment transport along the coast in a natural unaltered coast. When breakwaters are constructed this sediment transport in the alongshore direction is (partially) blocked. This results in accretion at the updrift side of the breakwater and coastline retreat at the lee-side. Coastal erosion behind a breakwater can result in floods, destroy property or simply narrow the beach. Not only the short term effects of these structures (what happens during and short after construction) is important to know, also the long term effects need to be known; because the breakwaters are build for decades coastal influence of these breakwaters needs to be known for these time-scales as well. Therefore it is relevant to investigate the scale (in time and space) of these adverse effects beforehand. <br/><br/>In coastal engineering, numerical models are used to predict the impact of coastal constructions like breakwaters. High detailed models which take for all physical processes into account will result in accurate predictions but result in large computation times. Simplified models have smaller computation times and are more suitable for coastal impact predictions on larger spatial (10 - 100 km) and temporal (decades) scale. The objective of the thesis is to improve the coastline change predictions of models at decadal scale by reviewing the common practice and a new, very fast, module for lee-side wave computations and investigating different wave processes that can improve the wave modelling. This research will focus on (1) understanding of what wave processes are important for the coastline change and (2) advise on what models to use for which conditions and how to the improve model predictions.<br/><br/>The approach of this thesis is triple. First five different modelling approaches for wave modelling are compared, varying in computation time and usability, to a very accurate model that will be used as ground truth. The wave conditions will vary in direction and both wind waves and swell waves will be modelled. From this step de accuracy of these models for different wave conditions can be analyzed. The second step is to get an better understanding of the processes that are involved with the wave modelling. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of model approaches with high computation times. The last step is to see how this relates to sediment transport and thus the coastline change at the lee-side of a breakwater. <br/><br/>This can be concluded after the investigation of 3 wave model (SWASH, SWAN and the Kamphuis module) <br/><br/><br/>SWAN model approach is for cases with wind waves a good model approach: the wave height, wave direction and the sediment transport are well representative. Also the setup differences are very similar to the ground truth model.<br/>SWAN is not very accurate for cases with a small directional spreading. For these cases the diffraction is more important and there is not enough wave energy in the sheltered area nor is the wave direction well represented. <br/>Kamphuis with Snellius (refraction) is for the case with a wide directional spreading, given the computation speed, pretty good. For the cases with a small directional spreading the wave height is not accurate.<br/><br/><br/>The conclusions related to the influence of the wave processes are:<br/><br/><br/>The refraction is investigated by comparing the Kamphuis module (which does not incorporate refraction) with the ground truth model. When Snell's law was applied to the kamphuis module the model results did show good results. Therefore the refraction is (especially outside the sheltered zone) very important to the wave direction.<br/>There is a large difference for cases with small and large directional spreading. The SWAN model gives results can can be expected when no diffraction is present. Directional spreading both influences the wave height directly behind the breakwater as well as the influence lengt of the breakwater. <br/> Diffraction does not play an important role for wind waves. The large directional spreading results in much smaller energy differences between the sheltered and the non-sheltered zone. Even SWAN without diffraction gives a good representation for wind waves. For swell waves however this is very different.Then diffraction is very important. There is a much larger difference in wave energy between the shelterd and the non-shelterd zone and for a good representation a model that can coop with diffraction is a must.<br/>Current induced refraction of the waves has influences for waves of an incoming agle 0 to 30 degrees because this will result in rip currents along the breakwater that turn the waves up to an extra 10 to 15 degrees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The relative sediment transport of the five modelling aproaches was also analyzed. The sediment transport proxy for the five modelling approaches showed that SWAN computes the wave height and direction well for wind waves. For swell waves however the model did not show good results. The reason is that there is no diffraction in SWAN, the diffraction computations with SWAN did not show much improvements either. <br/><br/>The sediment transportation proxy for the Kamphuis module with Snellius where expected to be good for wind waves, because the wave height and wave direction where well represented. However the length of the erosion pit was much smaller and also the shape of the erosion pit is very different from the other two models.","SWASH; SWAN; Unibest; Coastal Engineering; Wave Transformations; Breakwater; Coastline evolution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grasping instruments used in clinical practice require high pinch forces in order to generate sufficient grip for manipulating soft tissue without slipping.<br/>In nature, several animals employ adhesion in order to grip on, not only hard, but also soft substrates. Among these animals, geckos and tree frogs are of special interest for engineered gripping systems, because of their high body mass. The toe pads of both animals are soft and characterized by a hierarchical pillar structure ranging from micro to nanoscale. Several research groups have mimicked this structure and demonstrated its potential for adhesive grip. Next to pillars, the toe pads of both animals possess a network of stiff inner fibers, which possibly also contributes to (friction) grip.<br/><b>Aim</b>: Inspired by the inner fiber network of geckos and tree frogs, the aim of this work was to investigate whether reinforcing a soft pad with stiff fibers increases friction on soft substrates as compared to a fiber-less pad. Our hypothesis was that provided that a soft exterior of such a pad establishes adhesive contact with the substrate, stiff fibers at a direction parallel to the substrate reduce the compliance of the pad in this direction, thereby preserving the established contact and thus increase the peak friction force.<br/><b>Methods</b>: Three experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, composites consisting of 3D-printed fibers encapsulated in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pad were fabricated, and their adhesion and friction forces were measured. In Experiment 2, the friction of composites with stiffer 3D-printed fibers than those in Experiment 1 was measured. Lastly, in Experiment 3, the friction of composites consisting of a carbon fiber fabric encapsulated in PDMS of various stiffness degrees were tested. All experiments were conducted on both hard and soft gelatin substrates of various stiffness degrees, the latter functioning as soft-tissue phantoms.<br/><b>Results</b>: The results showed that, for all substrate types, adding 3D printed fibers with varying degrees of stiffness to a PDMS pad significantly reduced peak friction force, whereas adding a carbon fiber fabric significantly increased peak friction force compared to a fiber-less PDMS pad. The PDMS stiffness did not have a significant effect on friction force.<br/><b>Conclusion</b>: The results from this research are promising for developing fiber-reinforced composites for gripping to soft substrates, including minimally invasive grasping instruments for soft-tissue grip.","Mimicking; Adhering; Soft substrate; Gecko; Tree frog","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

However they still lack of generality as they are based on closure coefficients determined from fundamental real flow cases. Their accuracy drops when dealing with separating turbulent flows.<br/>There is a specific class of flows that separate after encountering a geometry-induced adverse pressure gradient. Periodic hill flows are viewed as the benchmark case of those, presenting typical gross features of this class of flows. The separation point is viewed as one of the characteristic features and its prediction is crucial for a fair downstream flow development representation. In literature it was found that different turbulence models produced different flow solutions, as both separation and reattachment points were badly reproduced.<br/>The aim of the project is therefore to reconstruct the solution under uncertainty in separation location and turbulence closure coefficients. A statistical calibration of the uncertain parameters is performed using Bayesian inference; then Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (MCMC) is adopted to explore the a posteriori information.<br/>The separation location is controlled using a step, that, located in the area of adverse pressure gradient, forces the flow to separate. The geometry parameters of the step are considered as the uncertain parameters to be calibrated. The effect of separation forcing on the flow solution is studied when adopting different turbulence models. A strong coupling between the step influence on flow solution and closure model adopted has been found. Because of this, Launder-Sharma k-epsilon model was employed for the rest of the work. The calibration of turbulence model coefficients have been performed starting from existing works. <br/>After providing some validated data relative to a particular location of the flow field and performing parameters calibration, the entire field is reconstructed through posterior predictive distribution.<br/>In general it was found that the results of the calibration depend strictly on the location where the inverse problem is performed. The calibrated value are able to reproduce the flow solution at the inverse problem location but unable to accurately predict the solution at different locations. <br/>The calibration of the closure coefficients only, resulted in a fair prediction of the reattachment point, but a bad representation of the separation point. The inclusion of the step resulted in a slightly better representation of the flow when moving away from the inverse problem location, with particular reference to the vertical velocity profile. This proved that the influence of turbulence closure coefficients is predominant.<br/>The analysis is conducted focusing on the velocity profiles. In fact the eventual aim is to start from planar PIV data and post process them for a three-dimensional flow field reconstruction.<br/>Because of a future application in real three dimensional cases and the possible high-dimensionality of the uncertain parameter space, a mathematical tool to be used during MCMC iterations is developed.<br/>Instead of calling the CFD solver at each MCMC iteration, the flow solution is computed \textit{offline} through model reduction techniques. POD + I and Isomap + I have been tested for this purpose; the first one being used for linear spaces and the second for the non-linear ones. At the end Isomap + I was also used for examining the intrinsic metric of the flow solution space when varying the turbulence closure coefficients and the step parameters.<br/>The model reduction techniques seemed to work well and this allowed to perform the calibration at cheap computational costs.","Bayesian Inference; turbulence modeling; Reduced order model; MCMC; POD; Isomap; k-epsilon; CFD; inverse problem; Uncertainty Quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A problem with using only weight is that the actual work performed on a section is left out of the estimation as well as other cost drivers. Another problem occurring is the current estimation method being divided into three phases, with lacking evaluation, optimization and feedback possible.

The graph database method uses the CBR theory as a basis for cost estimations. Problem solving is done by using a solution from an old ship and reusing this solution for a new ship. The graph database stores detailed information about the work performed on the ship and the main cost drivers.

Based on the results of the first stage, the second stage focuses on two new experiments. One experiment aims to verify a fertility detection method by measuring a large amount of eggs. Another experiment explores the feasibility of detecting rotten (“exploder”) eggs for increased accuracy in current fertility detection methods.<br/>All findings are described in this report.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Airbus Defence and Space GmbH in Friedrichshafen is the project coordinator of the NEOShield-2 project whose purpose is to develop the technology needed for near-Earth object (NEO) impact prevention. This research is located within the scope of a kinetic impactor mission which typically consists of two spacecraft: impactor and observer. This master’s thesis focuses on the latter and starts from a preexisting translational Image Processing (IP) navigation to develop a guidance and control algorithm for the translational motion and a complete guidance, navigation and control (GNC) algorithm for the attitude one. The study focuses on bodies with diameter less or equal than 300 m and the asteroid 2001 QC34 is taken as a baseline. First, the main perturbations influencing the dynamics of the spacecraft are assessed, showing that the best strategy is to do near-inertial hovering. Due to navigation purposes, the objective is set to minimise the amount of manoeuvres needed to keep the spacecraft in the desired location. Classical methods, based on reflecting or inverting the velocity vector, all based on the concept of control box, are simulated showing limitations for long hovering periods. Two new strategies also based on dead-band control theory are shown, one operating at the nominal performance (1 manoeuvre per day) and the second reducing by half these ones (0.5 manoeuvres per day). However, both methods suffer very much from initial conditions and on orbit operations, this being the reason why a second approach is formulated. A method based on Lyapunov control function is pro- posed showing that it reduces the commanded manoeuvres a ∼ 25% with respect to the classical ones (0.6-0.8 manoeuvres per day). It was also found that increasing the control box improves the propellant consumption. For the Lyapunov case, an increment in size of ∼ 30% has savings of ∼ 8% of propellant.<br/>The study continues with the implementation of the attitude GNC which uses only star tracker measurements for attitude estimation. The absolute performance error (APE) was found to be 0.15 deg, or distributed per axis as [0.005, 0.01, 0.01] deg. This pointing performance is in line with the establish in other space missions such as Rosetta. The main sources of error were found to be the bias of the star tracker and the gyroscopic term coming from angular momentum of the reaction wheels. The latter source can be reallocated per axis changing the initial conditions of these ones. The APE was only lost when translational manoeuvres were performed. This was due to the torque induced into the spacecraft because of thrusters errors. These manoeuvres can cause that the star tracker reach its physical limitations.<br/>Finally, the momentum dumping of the reaction wheels has been studied. Due to the distribution of the propulsion system, a thruster management function needs to be implemented for thrust allocation. For this purpose, linear programming (LP) techniques are used. In particular, using a new approach, and combining machine learning techniques (neural networks) with a pulse-width pulse-frequency (PWPF) modulator. The study shows that although momentum dumping manoeuvres are within the sensor physical limitations, the fact of having both rotational and translational motion coupled and the errors induced by the PWPF modulator, cause that the spacecraft needs to also correct after each desaturation manoeuvre its translational motion. For coarse pointing the method might work, but for momentum dumping where the frequency of the manoeuvres is low, classical methods are preferred as no relevant savings in terms of computational speed can be achieved by the inclusion of DNNs.","Guidance; Navigation; Control; Asteroid mitigation; MATLAB; Star tracker; Reaction Wheel; Chemical propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Desiring to maintain the social license to operate, these companies are now looking into alternate ways of safety management with the aim of mitigating fatalities in the workplace. <br/>In this study, a new risk management approach was applied to mitigate fatal incidents through the utilization of critical controls. The aim of this study was to create a scalable, minimally invasive proof-of-concept for AngloGold Ashanti that can successfully be implemented at any of the company’smining operations.<br/>The foundation for this implementation was laid through a literature study blending contemporary safety and risk management approaches with Business Intelligence systems thinking and a perspective on industry best-practices. Subsequently, a framework of organizational requirements was set up based on 26 interviews with stakeholders in various departments within the company. Both design and implementation were conducted on-site at an AngloGold Ashanti operation in Western Australia. <br/><br/>The system was designed by adhering to organizational requirements, and ensuring that it is suitable to any mining environment. The designed Critical Control Management System was subsequently implemented at Sunrise Dam, one of AngloGold Ashanti’s Australian mining operations. To ensure that critical controls were also assessed at the operational level, a workplace inspection process was modified to generate control data. All sources of data subsequently were fed into a Business Intelligence environment enabling insight into critical control performance to all company stakeholders. Doing so informs decision-making on safety priorities company-wide, based on real-time data generated on the operational level. <br/><br/>Two case studies were performed to assess two of the most significant hazards at Sunrise Dam. The studies showed that the effectiveness of reactive controls changes irrespective of their compliance and performance. Furthermore, the influence of human factors within risk management remains difficult to quantify. Finally, it demonstrates the potential for integration of incident data into the Critical Control Management System, thus creating both leading and lagging indicators for safety performance. <br/><br/>The conclusion of this study is that an effective and scalable Critical Control Management System can be successfully implemented in a mining operation if the right conditions are generated. The approach of integration in existing processes demonstrates that companies can achieve greater control over fatality prevention without the need for an additional safety management system. On this basis, it is recommended that other operations are supported in creating an environment suitable for adaptation before Critical Control Management is implemented.","Critical controls; Safety; Mining; Business Intelligence; Risk Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","","","","","",""

Therefore, future wind turbines tend to move towards deeper water, which sets a requirement of larger capacity support structure. The design guidelines of Gravity Based Foundation (GBF) which is capable of supporting deeper water wind turbines lack attention on the cyclic response of the foundation. The undrained capacity of GBF in terms of failure envelope under combined loading is investigated numerically, in order to shed light on the effect of cyclic loads on the capacity of the foundation. A GBF supporting a 5 MW wind turbine on sandy soil domain is designed based on the static conditions. A critical state model called Hypoplastic sand model with intergranular strain concept is adopted to represent the soil domain in 2D. The influence of factors such as relative density (Dr), load characteristics (¿c yc &amp; ¿avg ) and the wave frequency on the pore pressure behaviour are analysed in the event of concluding a critical case. Moreover, it should be noted that the number of cycle is restricted to 50 cycles as a result of limitations in the implicit method. An undrained failure envelope is developed for the critical case, which in comparison with original envelope reveals the expansion in undrained capacity with respect to the number of cycles. It is inferred that the expansion in the capacity is because of the process known as densification which overcomes the effect of pore pressure on the failure envelope. It is also worth noting that the consolidation phase which is used to model the loads has a significant influence on the expansion of the failure envelope.","Finite Element modelling; Gravity based foundation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first part of the thesis conducts a data analysis based on the Dutch JARKUS dataset, which provides yearly measured profiles along the Dutch coast. A series of parameters derived from the profile measurements have been used to represent the dune behavior quantitatively. Two locations with different coastal orientations, the Rijnland and Ameland coasts, have been studied. The theoretical wind transport capacity calculated for the two coasts showed very different results, where the transport capacity in cross shore direction for Ameland was found offshore dominant with very small onshore component while the one for Rijnland was found onshore dominant with much larger onshore component. The calculated actual dune growth rates along the two coasts had much less values than the transport capacity but demonstrated similar trend: Rijnland experienced more dune accretion than Ameland. The spatial variations in coastal morphology derived from the measurements have been correlated to the alongshore varying dune behavior, showing that a larger dune accretion is usually linked to a wider active dune but no obvious relationship can be identified between beach width and dune growth rate. The second part of the thesis discusses a modeling study using the AeoLiS model. The inconsistency between the actual dune accretion and the theoretical onshore wind transport capacity was probably because the sediment availability dominated the aeolian sediment transport, which inspired an attempt to analyze the role of sediment supply in the aeolian system through a modeling study. Therefore AeoLiS has been used to simulate aeolian sediment transport, dune volume changes and the combined effect of erosion and accretion processes in the coastal systems. In the modeling study, 11 scenarios have been simulated. By comparing the simulation results of the different scenarios, the influences of several different processes on the aeolian sediment transport have been analyzed. Dune vegetation was found to be necessary to acquire dune accretion. Sediment sorting and beach armoring were found to be able to significantly reduce the aeolian sediment transport, indicating the important role of sediment supply in the aeolian system. And the more the nonerodible roughness elements existed on the bed, the more the aeolian transport could be reduced. In the onshore wind dominant system, the existence of the offshore wind reduced the onshore aeolian transport in the model. In the offshore wind dominant system, the offshore wind needed to be filtered out to enable the model to reproduce the pattern of onshore aeolian transport and dune accretion. For Rijnland which experienced mainly onshore winds, the modeled dune accretion volume was relatively larger than the measured dune accretion based on the data analysis. For Ameland where the present winds were mainly offshore, the simulated and measured dune accretion volumes were quite close. Similar to the trends in the wind transport capacity and the dune growth rate, the modeled dune accretion volume for Rijnland was also larger than the one for Ameland.","Aeolian sediment transport; Dune development; Sediment supply; Coastal orientation; Process-based modelling; AeoLiS; Data analysis; Rijnland; Ameland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.312904, 4.483041"

The focus of this thesis is laid inside the swash zone, in which the water motion is present of waves that run up and run down on a beach. Energy from wave run-up could deliver erosion to the beach. It is relevant to know what the magnitude is of run-up during extreme events, in order to protect the beach. Several studies are done to wave run-up. There are relations which specify run-up, however, the alongshore variability is not studied in detail and less knowledge is available about this topic. At Anmok beach in South-Korea an intermediate reflective beach is present containing beach cusps and crescentic sandbars. A rhythmic bar and beach state contains the most complex morphology, furthermore the morphology changes a lot within intermediate beaches (Wright and Short [1]). The characteristics of this beach are used to perform an analysis to the influence of cusp and bar morphology on alongshore variation in wave run-up. <br/><br/>Run-up is composed of setup and swash. Setup is the super elevation of the mean water level, swash is ‘’a time-varying location of the intersection between the ocean and the beach’’ according to Stockdon, Holman [2]. Swash can be decomposed into two parts, incident band swash and infragravity band swash. Swash and setup depend on beach slope, deep-water wave height and the deep water period[2]. <br/><br/>To analyse the alongshore variability multiple bathymetries have been generated on which 500 waves are modelled for 60 different wave condition. First of all a reference case is modelled with a uniform bathymetry. Secondly beach cusps are used as input with different length scales and at last a beach cusp with crescentic sandbar is used. The length scales of the cusps are 452, 300 and 100 metres. The bathymetries are idealized bathymetries with the characteristics of Anmok beach. The run-up and components are calculated and an analysis is done to the magnitude of run-up and the standard deviation along the beach.<br/> <br/>The magnitude of run-up is lower for a cusp system compared with the reference situation and even lower for the cusp bar system. Furthermore there are no large differences in magnitude of run-up between different cusp lengths. A larger alongshore variance is observed when a cusp (bar) system is present. A cusp system of 452 metres contains larger run-up at the horn compared with the embayment, this holds for large and small wave heights. The difference is 18% and 8.4% respectively. However, when a cusp bar system is present less alongshore variability is visible and an opposite behaviour is visible for small wave heights. In this case the same pattern can be seen for large wave heights. A difference of 3.68% is seen when the horn is compared with the embayment. However, for small wave heights the run-up is 10.5% smaller at a horn compared with an embayment. <br/><br/>A cusp length of 100 metres shows different behaviour compared with a cusp length of 452 metres. Run-up is larger at an embayment compared to the horn. This holds for large wave heights. The alongshore variance is in this case larger compared to larger cusp lengths. A cusp of 452 metres and 300 metres leads to similar results, whereas a 100 metres cusp shows deviations. It could be edge waves which could have an influence on a cusp with a length of 100 metres.<br","Beach cusps; Crescentic Sandbars; rhytmic bar and beach state; alongshore variance; runup; swash; infragravity band swash; incident band swash; setup; intermediate reflective beach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","37.776282, 128.943305"

The proposed method enables offshore crew to look through the water with the use of augmented reality. To this end a real-time numerical model of the subsea cable dynamics is developed. The model is created in programming language C# and visualization in augmented reality is done using the game-engine Unity. This development environment is uncommon for engineering and scientific purposes and has been selected based on its ability to visualize model results in augmented reality, its extensive graphics library, its capability to process real-time in- and outputs and its free availability. Relevant physics are analyzed on contribution to global cable geometry and tension for the case of shallow water cable laying, resulting in an equation of motion which is sufficiently accurate for representing the physical phenomena occurring during cable lay. An assessment of the measurements required by the model during operation is made. The main challenge of modeling in real-time is that the average model time step is limited by available computational power, in turn limiting the axial stiffness range which can be modeled without the occurrence of numerical instability. Discretization is done using a lumped mass method. It is shown that cable dynamics can be modeled in real-time using an explicit method and that overcoming the associated limitation on axial stiffness does not lead to inaccurate results. The developed numerical solution is verified using OrcaFlex, which is typical software for dynamic analysis of offshore marine systems. An augmented reality interface is developed, including color codes indicating the structural state of the cable. The current work enables the visualization of the real-time model in augmented reality. Potential legal issues related to the implementation of augmented reality during offshore cable lay are outlined during a collaboration with Tilburg University. Successful practical implementation of the proposed innovation is associated with promising opportunities.","Real-time modeling; lumped mass method; cable dynamics; Augmented Reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); de Vries, Sierd (graduation committee); Giardino, A (graduation committee); Santinelli, G (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The Dutch coast is affected by coastal erosion. In order to limit erosion and prevent inland migration of dunes, sand nourishments have been adopted as a common practice for the maintenance of the coast. The evaluation of the applied coastal erosion policy is achieved by the use of coastal indicators. Increased number of nourishments affects the coastal profiles and coastal indicators are used to describe those changes along the coastal zone. The present work intends to improve the definition of one of the indicators (dune foot position) by proposing a new methodology and to develop a Bayesian network in order to assess the effectiveness of nourishments on the coastal system. Coastal indicators, such as the Momentary Coastline and the dune foot position, are used in the Bayesian network in order to quantify those effects. <br/><br/>Available field measurements of the entire Dutch coastline (JARKUS morphometric database) are used in order to develop the methodology of the dune foot position detection. Taking into account the geometry of the profiles, the dune foot position can be detected by calculating the first and second derivatives of the measured points along the profiles. Comparison with visual, in-situ observations, constitute the validation method of the proposed methodology. Root mean square errors, with respect to visual observations, are used to compare the performance of two methods for the dune foot position detection; the proposed methodology and the current dune foot definition, which detects the dune foot at the most seaward crossing of the profile with the level of +3 m NAP. By looking at the performance of the methodologies at different areas, the results are diverse. However, the proposed methodology shows a general improvement of the detection. Moreover, the methodology is believed to be generic and applicable to other dune systems around the world, since it is purely based on the morphology of the profile.<br/><br/>A Bayesian modelling approach is used to assess the effectiveness of nourishments on coastal indicators for the Holland coast. The selection of the input and output parameters, the design of the network and the optimization of the structure are the main steps for the development of the model. Once the optimum configuration is chosen and the model is trained, the Bayesian network gives the possibility to investigate the relations between variables, by constraining the input nodes on a specific range of values and assessing changes on the indicators. By applying those constraints it can be found that nourishments have positive effects on the coastal indicators, since larger seaward displacement is observed compared to cases in which no nourishment has been implemented. Moreover, initial erosive trends of the dune foot position are constrained by the implementation of nourishments. In addition, the effects of nourishments at different time scales are investigated. To this end, time horizons of 1, 5 and 10 years after a nourishment implementation are chosen. Positive effects of nourishments are present at all the considered time horizons, with beach nourishment to have an immediate effect on the indicators, whereas shoreface nourishments reach a stronger effect 10 years after the implementation.<br/>Finally, the Bayesian inference can be used as a decision support tool for coastal managers, since its user-friendly environment can lead to easy interpretation and use for coastal management purposes. The required sand volume can be estimated in order to achieve a specific magnitude of seaward displacement of the indicators or in order to preserve the coastline at the current state. The estimations concern large spatial scales.<br","Nourishment; Coastal State Indicators; Dune foot position; Bayesian Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-28","","","","","",""

These discharges are typically nanosecond current pulses in the amplitude range of milli-amperes. A long term exposure of the insulation system to these partial discharges accelerate the aging mechanisms that eventually lead to the final breakdown of the insulation system. Such insulation breakdowns in High Voltage (HV) / Medium Voltage (MV) equipment typically involve arc-flash/fire hazards, posing safety threats. Moreover probable undelivered power and huge financial losses are also associated. Early detection of PD activity can provide warnings about pending insulation/device failures and hence, maintenance or repair activities can be scheduled before breakdown occurs. Moreover, clustering of PD due to different types of sources is of practical importance as it indicates the severity of defect and provides an insight into the time available for repair activities before complete breakdown. State of the art tools for electrical PD monitoring are expensive and cannot be economically deployed over a large network of HV/MV assets. Moreover, they employ classification schemes based on less robust PD features.

A detailed assessment using nonlinear finite element analysis is one of the alternatives which could help in decision-making about maintaining, upgrading or even demolishing and rebuilding of the structure. A reliable assessment should account for the existing damage in the structure, which may cause re-distribution of stresses within the structure, giving rise to unexpected failure modes. The existing approaches in nonlinear finite element analysis which account for the effect of already undergone damage in concrete, pose a number of limitations which either makes structural analysis ambitious or the uncertainty of concrete damage is not effectively accounted for. An alternative approach is adopted in this thesis, which is phenomenological and probabilistic in nature. Existing damage in concrete is conceived as a statistical field, which can be input into a finite element model, such that the existence of damage is taken as the starting point of the structural analysis. Focusing on indications of damage on the surface of concrete, i.e. crack patterns, an exploratory methodology based on image analysis is developed, to account for information obtained from crack pattern observation into nonlinear finite element analysis of reinforced concrete structures. The methodology is implemented on MATLAB and validated on damaged experimental specimens. Results of the computational analyses indicate good efficiency in predicting residual load carrying capacities and failure modes, alongside insightful numerical crack patterns. Through a critical examination of the obtained results and reflection upon the assumptions and simplification made in the methodology, recommendations for future research are provided.","finite element simulation; Crack pattern observation; reinforced concrete structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, offshore structures are simulated in time-dependent dynamic analysis to calculate the stress response at critical locations of the structure. Sorting of relevant stress cycles is done using a suitable cycle counting algorithm (usually rainflow counting) and then an appropriate S-N curve and Miner’s cumulative rule are used to estimate the total fatigue damage at these critical locations. Offshore structures are usually designed for a minimum fatigue life of 20 years, which takes a lot of computational time in FEM. If loads are converted to an equivalent frequency domain and the structure is analyzed in frequency dependent dynamic analysis, computational time can be reduced. This will help engineers perform faster optimizations on new structural developments.<br/>For frequency analysis, using Dirlik’s semi-empirical method, a good estimation of fatigue damage are achieved according to literature. Application of Dirlik’s method on various structures has been validated by comparing the damage values with equivalent rainflow counting method. Unlike rainflow counting algorithm, Dirlik’s method calculates probability density function of the stress ranges with empirical formulae and uses S-N curve and Miner’s rule to estimate total fatigue damage. Dirlik’s method is easy to understand, easy to program and estimate fatigue damage with good accuracy. This might also help us in calculating fatigue damage in the stinger, due to bow deflection.<br/>To fully understand the method of dynamic frequency analysis with Dirlik’s method, the objective of the research is to study its feasibility on simple models by conducting simulations in FEM and to establish the fatigue calculation procedure. Two models are selected in this research, a cantilever beam and a simple frame model (for tubular joints). Simulation on both the models are conducted in frequency analysis and fatigue estimation is done using Dirlik’s method. To verify the estimated damage values, equivalent time-dependent analyses are also conducted with rainflow counting method.<br/>Comparable fatigue damage results are achieved for cantilever beam but, for frame model, results obtained could not be compared due to issue found by conducting detailed analysis. Although, the overall objective of the research is not fully complete, results and observations found in this research will be helpful for conducting additional simulations with different strategies to verify the frame model. With this research, a firm basis is developed which could motivate the company to further investigate the method.","Fatigue; Dirlik's method; Tubular structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-27","","","","","",""

The present study evaluates and compares the performance of two different preclinical multipinhole SPECT systems (NanoScan, VECTor) for short frames acquisitions.<br/>Prior to the systems comparison, the comparison and selection of the best performing fast imaging mode provided by NanoScan system (Mediso) was performed. The fast imaging modes of this system provide acquisitions with 1,2 and 3 detector position around the animal bed. This comparison was performed by using uniform phantoms (syringes) and the rods of the NEMA NU4IQ phantom (frames: 6-30s). The down-sized version of NU4IQ phantom (SPECTIQ phantom) was used in this study to compare the performance of VECTor (MILabs) and NanoScan when performing acquisitions with short frame times (18s-600s, whole body scans). The quality of the acquired images was assessed in terms of absolute quantification (recovery coefficient), noise levels and visual evaluation.<br/>The quantification with the NanoScan was accurate (±5%) regardless of times frames duration and activity concentrations when imaging large structures. The increase in number of detector positions yielded images with lower noise levels. In the case of small structures, acquisition with 3 detector positions (Semi-3 mode) appeared to provide more accurate activity recovery compared to acquisitions with 1 (stationary mode) and 2 detector positions (Semi-2<br/>mode). Especially in the case of the 2mm diameter rod of the NU4IQ phantom, the Semi-3 mode appears to provide significantly more accurate activity recovery (30s frame). The systems comparison showed activity recovery with up to 5% deviation from the dose calibrator measurement when imaging the uniform region of SPECTIQ phantom (d = 21mm). Both systems could recover the three largest rods (d = 1.5, 1.0, 0.75mm) for the longest frames used(180,360,600s).

One of the most important technological characteristics in low enthalpy geothermal projects is the time when cold fluid from the injection well breaks into the production well.

Decision makers in this field need to make trade-offs between the conflicting objectives. In the decision-making process regarding investment projects, it is important that the multiple objectives are considered explicitly. A multi-objective optimization problem formulation is proposed for the investment project portfolio optimization problem. Solving a multi-objective optimization problem means to identify the set of Pareto optimal solutions. These Pareto optimal solutions are used by decision makers to gain insight in the effects on the objectives, and to make well-founded trade-offs.<br/><br/>An approach is proposed to include the uncertain nature of investment projects in the problem formulation, without increasing the complexity of the problem too much. This is done by introducing lower and upper bounds for uncertain variables. By optimizing not only the expected values of the objective functions, but also the lower and upper bound, one is able to identify the solutions that give satisfactory results for all the scenarios. Project portfolios that are Pareto optimal for the lower bound, expected value, and upper bound, are considered as robust choices with respect to the uncertainties in the objective values. <br/><br/>Railway infrastructures typically consist of many assets with a long lifespan. The prediction horizon and the level of detail considered in the optimization problem need to be chosen carefully to avoid extremely large computation times. Even for a modest level of detail, the problem size is too large to check all the possible solutions within acceptable time. The computation time is also dependent on the algorithm that is used to search for the Pareto optimal set. Next to the computation time, several performance indicators are selected to measure the quality of the approximation of the Pareto optimal set that is provided by an algorithm. <br/><br/>Two algorithms with different approaches are proposed to approximate the Pareto optimal set, the repeated ε-constraint algorithm and the widely used genetic algorithm NSGA II.<br/>Some benchmark problems are introduced to gain insight into the working of the proposed algorithms. <br/>A case study is performed for an artificial data set for investment projects in a railway network. <br/>The selected performance indicators are used to analyze the results of the case studies for the proposed algorithms with different settings. <br/> The repeated ε-constraint algorithm is able to find a close representation of the Pareto optimal set, and has a very stable performance due to the established search method of the CPLEX solver. However, obtaining these results requires an excessive amount of computation time. The genetic algorithm NSGA II is much faster, and for carefully tuned settings, the quality of the approximation set is fine. The coverage of the NSGA II is considered sufficient, so due to the reduced computation time, the NSGA II is recommended to use in the decision support process of selecting investment project portfolios in railway infrastructure networks.","Multi-objective optimization; project portfolio optimization; railway management; infrastructure; Investment decisions; repeated epsilon-constraint algorithm; NSGA II; Decision support tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore one of the most important disadvantages of using middleboxes is that each network function deployment requires a great deal of human work. During their operation, middleboxes need maintenance which also demands for massive human work. Therefore using middleboxes for each network function puts a constraint on the flexibility of the network. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a proposed architectural framework which introduces the virtualization of network functions. In NFV, each network function is implemented as software and deployed on data center servers which offers greater network flexibility with the ability of run-time network service deployment throughout the network. With this technology, the places of network functions can be determined for satisfying different requirements such as Quality of Service (QoS) for end-users. Determining optimal locations for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) is an open research area. <br/>In this research, the optimal placement of VNFs is studied. The objective of this work is determined to minimize the end-to-end Round Trip Time (RTT) between the end users and the deployed network functions while also minimizing the number of data centers used.<br/>First, the problem is formulated using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and it is shown that it is NP-hard. Therefore an updated problem definition is formulated to propose a heuristic. The proposed heuristic uses the knapsack problem notion to solve the problem in a smaller amount of time with a trade-off in objective value. Lastly, for the proof of concept, the updated problem definition is also formulated using ILP and the proposed heuristic and the ILP formulation are compared under different scenarios.","NFV; Optimization; Heuristic; VNF; ILP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In recent years due to the slow down of Moores Law and Dennard Scaling, alternative architectures are starting to be used instead of plain CPU implementations. These new architectures, such as FPGAs and GPUs, offer higher performance to power consumption ratio when compared with a CPU only implementation. But these new approaches have to sacrifice programmability in favor of performance gains. While GPUs are somewhat easily programmableand provide high performance this comes at the cost of high power consumption. FPGA programming on the other hand is a tedious and time consuming task. Specialized personnel is required for this, as their programming requires a background in designing with HDL languages. Furthermore an implementation is specific to a certain algorithm and cannot be used for any other algorithm even if it is slightly different. So if a new algorithm for aparticular task is found then a part of the design process has to be redone. Also designing for FPGAs is a computationally intensive task as the whole design after simulation has to be synthesized and then placed and routed (P&amp;R) for a particular FPGA every time the design changes slightly. This process of mapping the design can take hours or even days to compute for large designs. In recent years developments in High Level Synthesis (HLS) and OpenCL have made the whole process of designing for FPGAs an easier task. But this solution is notwithout problems either as the algorithm has to still be implemented for a specific FPGA device. A solution to the FPGA synthesis and P&amp;R problem has recently been proposed with the name of FPGA Overlay Architectures. The core concept of this idea to abstract the FPGA create a virtual FPGA on top of the underlaying physical one in order to help with configuration and compile time. In this thesis, we investigate available alternative overlay architectures and select the most appropriate architecture for our analysis. We extended the selected architecture to be deployed on alternative FPGA hardware and to work in a shared CPU/FPGA system. Then, we implemented a number benchmarks to evaluate various aspects of system performance. Our results show that our architecture can be reconfigured in only 11.9us, as compared to seconds for full FPGA recon_guration. However, the overlay architecture uses 10.5x more LUTs and causes a drop in frequency of about 30% for the chosen architecture. For future work, there is room to improve these results by optimizing the interconnect network of the device.","FPGA Overlays; Zynq","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-24","","","","","",""

These data show series configuration performs better on self-sensing accuracy. This is due to the 2-3dB difference in signal to noise ratio, in favour of series. In addition good repeatability was found in the mechanical behaviour of the TCPMs, with a variance in the spring constant that is smaller than 10% for all cases.

The airport, which is under construction at the moment, is located on top of thick layers of Mexico Clay soils. These clayey layers consist of a mixture of both clay particles and pyroclastic volcanic materials. These unique soils are characterised by a high water content and compressibility. Upon loading, the soft soils will settle as a result of the consolidation process. This consolidation is defined as the dissipation of excess pore water as a result of an increase in stress. The rate of consolidation is governed by the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, which is in general very low in soft soils, and the drainage path. In order to speed up this time consuming process, vertical permeable elements can be installed in the soil. Upon installation of these elements, a reduction in drainage path is realised. This reduction in drainage path allows faster dissipation of excess pore water pressure, hence reducing the consolidation time. Due to the conditions at the site, the design of the runways is challenging. The differential- and residual settlements need to be within strict boundaries in order to keep the runways operational. Prior to the design of the runways, trial embankments have been constructed in order to measure the performance of different soil improvement techniques at this specific site. Based upon this field test results, prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) were selected as the most efficient soil improvement technique. Besides the PVD trial, the sandpile trial also showed promising results. The PVDs and sandpiles both decrease the drainage path length inside the soft soil layers. The main difference is the relative high stiffness of the sandpiles, the stiffness of the PVDs is negligible. By installing stiff elements in the soft soil, the loads applied on the top of the soils are transferred to deeper and stiffer soils. Hence, the total settlements of the top soft soil layers are reduced. The sandpiles could therefore be feasible alternative to PVDs, applied at locations in which the total settlement needs to be limited.<br/>The investigation into the behaviour of sandpiles in Mexico Clay soils is performed in multiple stages. First, analytical models are used for gaining knowledge about the expected sandpile behaviour. In the second stage the FEM software Plaxis 2D is used for the numerical modelling of the sandpiles, using an axisymmetric model setup. The model is constructed in multiple steps, with increasing complexity. The first models simulate the material behaviour with the Mohr-Coulomb model, in the advanced models the Soft Soil Creep and Hardening Soil models are used. The final numerical model is verified by the measurement data obtained from the field trials.<br/>After fitting the numerical model to the field data, the verified model is used in the sandpile sensitivity analysis. In this analysis the sensitivity of the material properties and geometry of the sandpile on the performance are researched. The residual settlements or performance, which is defined as the difference in settlement after construction and over a period of 8 years, is affected by the length, radius and centre to centre (ctc) distance of the sandpile. Adjusting the pile stiffness has minimal effect on the performance of the sandpile. An optimum in performance is found by varying both the pile radius and ctc distance. A combination of a small pile diameter with a small ctc distance results in the best performance. When comparing the performance of both sandpile and PVD, the PVD is found to be more effective in terms of performance. The additional stiffness of the sandpile is not reducing the total settlements, on the contrary, the self-weight of the piles increases the total settlements by providing an additional load to the soft soil layers located underneath the pile tip. In conclusion the sandpiles have no additional benefit over the use of PVDs, therefore the application of sandpiles at the NAICM site is not a feasible alternative to the use of PVDs.","Sandpile; Mexico Clay; PVDs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","NAICM",""

This thesis is focused on the dynamic behavior of the high-rise building subjected to wind action. The acceleration becomes a limiting criterion in designing such structure which can be categorized as the comfort criteria of the building. Nausea and motion sickness from the acceleration of the building has been studied by human experience, and numerous building code has included this in the design criteria [6]. The tuned mass damper (TMD) comes from the basic vibration absorber theory by Frahm in 1909; then the studied continued and applied in a building. At present, the TMD is a well-known technology to mitigate vibration, but it is not always applicable in every building case. Therefore a study of the interaction between the building properties also the soil structure interaction (SSI) is made in the application of the TMD.This thesis aims to study the dynamic behavior of a high rise building with the implementation of TMD and to take into account the SSI, also to indicate which type of building is preferable to apply a TMD. The model for the high-rise building is an analytical one-dimensional model which is validated by the finite element program (FEP). The analytical model can give a good fit for the building response but due to the model of the wind load is a random load, it is challenging to match precisely the TMD performance due to the comparison of different load phase. The physical characteristic and tendency of the TMD performance to different building parameter still can be studied in this analytical model. It is shown in this study that the damping plays an important role not only to reduce the acceleration of the building but also influence the effectiveness of TMD. The acceleration is drastically reduced in the lower damping ratio area, which makes theTMD more effective if the building has lower damping ratio contributed from the material, structural joints, and SSI. The reducement of the acceleration by increasing stiffness and mass is very limited compared to the application of TMD. There are two building data for the base of the analysis; the first is the European Patent Office EPO building which is designed by Zonneveld Ingenieurs and the new proposal of slender high rise building in Rotterdam. The EPO building has a unique geometry which the contribution of torsional vibration is high. The slender high rise building shows that the TMD is more effective in reducing the acceleration in this case. The reason is the slender high rise has higher acceleration compare to EPO building when the required building stiffness for the deformation limit is applied.","Structural Dynamic; High-rise Building; Tuned mass damper (TMD)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some impurities still remain in the water even after the filtration process. It has been widely reported that water injection operations encounter severe injectivity decline which is of substantial concern for field management. Total dissolved and suspended solids in injection water are one of the significant reasons for injectivity decline. These solids are then filtered by the porous media and cause formation damage which can result in significant injectivity decline. <br/>Major past studies have assumed typical filtration techniques (micro-filtration) where the size of remaining dispersed particles in the water are reduced to ~2 microns. Hence, the majority of the experimental studies have used suspended particles of ~1-5 microns to investigate injectivity decline. These studies show that initially internal filter cake starts to develop and after some transition time external filter cake is formed, after which injection face is almost completely plugged. However, not many studies have been performed with ultrafiltration where remaining dispersed particle size in injection water is reduced to nano size range.<br/>In this study, injectivity decline by ultra-filtered water injection was investigated experimentally. To mimic ultra-filtered water, spherical silica nanoparticles of 120 nm diameter were used as dispersed particles in the injected water. First, stability study of nanoparticle colloid was carried out by varying nanoparticle concentration, brine compositions and pH. Hydrodynamic size and zeta potential measurements showed that there exists a salinity and pH range in which nanoparticle colloid remain within the expected size range.<br/>Core flood experiments were conducted on Bentheimer sandstone core plugs. Pressure measurements along the core and influent/effluent analysis were used to study the transport and retention of nanoparticles in porous media. Experimental results showed about 50 to 70 percent less injectivity decline compared to micron size suspended particles. Furthermore, results showed that external filter cake does not form by nanoparticle flow through porous media if the injection fluid’s pH and salinity are kept within a defined range obtained from stability study. Only deep bed filtration takes place where three main retention mechanisms dominate i.e. surface deposition, plugging and entrainment. <br/>Finally, a numerical model is presented in this study that describes deep bed filtration taking into account observed retention mechanisms. Model results are found to be in good agreement with experimental results.","Formation Damage; Deep Bed Filtration; Ultra-Filtration; Nanoparticles; Porous Media; Numerical Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-27","","","","","",""

Under some conditions, a lead-to-trailing (LTT) edgewise bending moment can induce buckling at the trailing edge adhesive joint, which may lead to early failure of the blade due to delamination. As a structural instability, buckling in wind turbines has been the focus of much research especially in full-scale tests and more recently at the sub-component level. These higher-level tests, however, are done on pre-manufactured wind turbine blades and require extensive preparation in order to adapt the testing rig to each blade section, as well as incurring into elevated costs.<br/>An additional test level has been suggested for elements and details of wind turbine blades. It has been suggested that this level can fulfill many purposes: New concepts, modifications, material combinations and orientations can be tested, partial safety factors of larger scale tests can be reduced or even certifying minor details of the blade can be done at the element and detail level. As such, the focus of this project is to develop a testing method for a simplified trailing edge bonded joint with a custom designed hinged clamping system upon which a compressive moment can be imposed to induce buckling.<br/>The design of this test will initially be based on a semi-analytical buckling plate model, where in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are coupled through the Von Karman strain-displacement relations. This semi-analytical tool is employed to quickly estimate the buckling loads for plates of varying dimensions. Strain-free imperfections can be included in the model for twisted/pre-bent plates in order to estimate their effect on reducing the load-bearing capacity of the structure. The semi-analytical tool is complemented with FE models for all the design parameters.<br/>The semi-analytical and numerical results are compared to demonstrate the agreement of both approaches aimed to provide a sturdy base for the research. Next, the experimental buckling loads and force-displacement curves are shown against the predictions from the previous approaches with good agreement. Nevertheless, the observable discrepancies between the experimental and numerical results showed that the desired joint-fixity at the boundaries was not fully realized, therefore leading to a slightly different post-buckling behavior. In the end, suggestions are given to improve on the experimental clamping system in order to improve and expand the scope of this research.","Buckling; Trailing Edge; Wind Turbine; Adhesive; Test level","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","FP7-ENERGY-2013 IRPWIND Project",""

To investigate the impact of SDN on WSN, in this thesis, we consider three Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Network (SD-WSN) frameworks, namely SDN-WISE, SDWN-ONOS, and TinySDN. After comparing these frameworks, the performance of TinySDN is evaluated in three different scenarios: homogeneous, heterogeneous, and dynamic networks. The Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) is used for the evaluations, and is subsequently compared with Rime data collection protocol in Contiki. Our performance evaluation is based on four metrics: Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), packet duplication, duty cycle, and delay.<br/> <br/>Our results show that the PDR for WSN and SD-WSN is relatively similar, that is, around 0.98 to 1 for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, whereas in a dynamic network, the PDR of WSN decreases from 0.98 to 0.9. Compared to the WSN, the SD-WSN reduces both the average delay of SDN sensor node and the time the SDN sensor node is active to send packets in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. However, implementing a centralized controller in a dynamic network may cause the SD-WSN performance decrease, which is indicated by the increase ratio of average delay from 2.03 to 2.3, whereas the increase ratio of average delay for the WSN is only around 1.6 to 1.98. The packet duplication level increases by 33% in the dynamic network when the number of SDN sensor nodes increases from 10 to 15.<br/><br/>The performance of SD-WSN in heterogeneous, homogeneous, and dynamic networks is relatively worse than WSN in terms of packet duplication and Rx duty cycle. SD-WSN, in addition, is not optimally implemented for dynamic conditions as the activity changes from the SDN sensor nodes will significantly affect the performance of SD-WSN. To reduce the load on the centralized controller, the clustering controllers are deployed to distribute the load on multiple controllers. The result shows that packet duplication and average delay in a dynamic network can be reduced by 13% and 57%, respectively. Clustering controllers provide more stability in terms of Rx duty cycle compared to before using clustering controllers.","SDN; WSN; Performance Evaluation; Collection Protocol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

To keep the grid stable, it is necessary that the electricity plant can control and protect the mechanism. In the past, traditional plants could meet these requirements. Nowadays, the share of sustainable power sources in total electricity generation has become so important that these sources must keep the grid stable. A significant part of these requirements is the Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) capability of the sustainable energy plant. When some large loads are connected to the grid or as a result of grid faults like lightning strikes or short circuits, short–term voltage dip may occur. This low voltage dip condition plans to be simulated and the behaviours of Brushless Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (B-DFIG) should be improved in this situation. This thesis is going to realize this goal that after the improvement, when low voltage dip occurs, it is not necessary to disconnect the generator from the grid.<br/><br/>The thesis is organized as follows: Firstly, the B-DFIG modelling is implemented, including the steady state modelling by equivalent circuits and the dynamic modelling by differential equations. The steady and transient state characteristic of B-DFIG can be studied by equivalent circuits and dynamic models respectively. Secondly, the control algorithm is added to the power electronic converter to control the machine in a stable and responsive manner. Thirdly, simulations of both full voltage and low voltage dip conditions are done to compare B-DFIG behaviours between these two different simulation conditions. Unexpected performance like large transient current will occur under low voltage dip condition. Fourthly, the LVRT control algorithm is added to the controller of B-DFIG for improving the behaviours of B-DFIG in low voltage dip condition based on some constraints and assumptions.

It is in the place where art is displayed that the knowledge about it is produced.<br/><br/>Within the art system, a distortion in the value of art has been staged by the increasing significance of the role of private collectors in investing in contemporary art and legitimating their collections trough the echoes of certain art spaces’ typologies. As consequence, private collectors become the accepted ‘manager of consciousness,’ and the former distance between collectors and museum is confused, and the museum academic capacity is being replaced. Here, the question of how a private collection is presented to the world became particularly urgent.<br/><br/>In response to this context, the construction of two specific narratives embedded in two contemporary art spaces for two private art collections has been delineated not in a deconstruction of values, but contextualised in-culture within the realm of architecture and its position towards the system.<br/><br/>Seeking a condition of nearness to the art world has been necessary in order to trace the encounters, or relationships which would construct the notion of place for contemporary art, and the values of the prelude to it. A certain alertness and respect towards the other and the world can be achieved in the art gallery that is otherwise often elusive, since what the art gallery as site does that ‘real life’ does not is that it forces the issues of attention – towards the space, the place and the other. Especially in this context, “considerations of where implies more than an ontology of position.”<br/><br/>The fiction of the art space started from the definition of the collection as first assemble to relate art to places and spaces, since the structure and identity of it became fundamental. A section through two collections and their collectors tries to trace the ways and rules which define the different spatial implications of art, in order to relate different specificities to the word, to find them a place within the world.<br/><br/>The role of architecture has been a negotiation between narratives, the one of the existing place which I found as connected to the specificity of the two collections I was dealing with, and the one of the artwork within the collection itself. And in measuring the one with the other, a staged uncertainty would lead to a certain awareness of the place one is in, and how does it relate with the collection itself, and with the world. I believe architecture has to offer a framework that should elicit reactions – it cannot be, as consequence, neutral. <br/><br/>I do think that the role of architecture in relation with art it is not so different from the one of storytelling in “establishing the rights of intensity” of encounters.

Firstly, the technical background and societal relevance of this thesis are given. Subsequently, the different physical domains are introduced that are in principle suitable for liquid composition sensing, such as the electrical, the acoustic, the optical and the thermal domains. As a next step, the thermal domain was selected with injected heat flux, J_h, as the through parameter and the resulting temperature difference, ∆T, as the across parameter. The basic principle of thermal impedance spectroscopy by frequency scanning was presented. Next, the thermal equivalent circuit model was used to simplify the thermal problem by transferring the thermal issue into an electrical topic. The main design challenge is to have the heat injected into the liquid rather than the substrate and to have a temperature-difference measurement not affected by the presence of the thermally conductive substrate. Different design properties such as heater, sensors, doping level, heat efficiency improvement and thermopile optimization, are explained in detail. After the interpretation on design properties, the fabrication process is introduced in detail and followed by the fabrication results.

The wind farm installation period involves crucial stages like streamlining onshore logistics, transportation of components on vessels, installation of foundations, wind turbines, and cable laying, etc. With wind turbine size growing and OWFs moving into deeper waters, the complexity of the installation procedure is also intensifying correspondingly. Moreover, the installation process can experience uncertainty due to harsh weather conditions, possible equipment failures and component delivery delays during the build. Additionally, the resources used in the installation phase are needed for the subsequent projects and have limited flexibility with end dates. This finally results in a considerable ambiguity in end date and cost incurred during the project. <br/>This graduation study looks at optimization of OWF installation procedure with a targeted completion date as a priority. In this thesis, an optimization approach is built around an ECN in-house software, developed for simulating various OWF installation strategies. Ultimately, the result of the dissertation is to have a method that provides added flexibility to simulate different OWF installation planning while still obtaining optimal installation costs. A concise literature review describes the significance of the current research and the potential that metaheuristic approaches bring to solve installation scheduling problems. Thus, the genetic algorithm is chosen as the optimization procedure to use for current work. The objective of the optimization procedure throughout the research is minimizing the total installation cost. The target end date in this study is implemented in the form of a constraint to steer the optimizer solution within the specified limit. A new methodology is proposed to generate an automated planning for the different installation procedures to facilitate the link between the optimizer and ECN tool. The project also considers uncertainty introduced due to weather and describes the considerations made to account for the same. The new approach shows the potential of introducing an optimization procedure in OWF installation logistics and ultimately assisting in lowering the overall project costs.<br","offshore wind energy; Installation; ECN Install; optimization; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

For instance, particle-based solar receivers utilize the high absorptivity and heat capacity of dispersed phase in a carrier fluid to improve efficiency and heat transfer. This dispersed phase generally consists of a large number of small particles. It is, therefore, difficult to completely resolve such flows considering their finite size. Usually, these particles are so small, that they can be treated as point particles. This considerably reduces the computational effort, while preserving the essential characteristics of the particle-laden flows. In this thesis, the focus is on heat transfer modulation in a particle-laden turbulent channel flow using direct numerical simulations. <br/><br/>In flows with temperature gradients (for example, channel flow between hot and cold wall), particles absorb heat from hotter regions and release heat to colder regions, thereby enhancing heat transfer through particle feedback flux. On the other hand, presence of particles leads to decay in turbulence resulting in lower turbulent heat transfer. The interplay of this two phenomena can either increase or decrease the overall heat transfer based on Stokes number and thermal Stokes number (ratio of thermal response time to characteristic time scale of the flow).<br/><br/>To investigate the heat transfer modulation in particle-laden channel flow, the existing DNS code developed by Boersma [5] has been modified to include particle transport and heat transfer. The point-particle approach with two way coupling is implemented using trilinear interpolation scheme and 3 rd order Runge-Kutta time marching scheme. The implemented code is validated using the results from literature [20] for a flow with no external heating.<br/><br/>With the developed code, cases with no external source term and external source term with different optical thickness of the fluid have been analyzed. In order to focus only on the fluid-particle interaction, the effect of gravity is neglected and the flow is considered to be incompressible. It has been observed from these simulations that particles play an important role in modulation of heat transfer in such flows. Mean temperature profiles, heat flux mechanisms, temperature variance and budgets of temperature variance are studied extensively in order to understand the underlying phenomenon. It is found that the particle feedback heat transfer is the dominating mode in particle-laden flows.","Particles; Turbulence; DNS; Heat transfer; optical thickness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observations of meteor showers on Earth have been studied for at least 50 years, in order to construct accurate Solar System meteoroid models. More recently, Earth-based telescopic observations of the light flashes produced by lunar meteoroid impacts have revealed useful in the validation and improvement of such meteoroid models. However, Earth-based lunar observations are restricted by weather, geometric and illumination conditions. As such, it has been proposed that a lunar orbiter could improve the detection rate of lunar meteoroid impact flashes. Assessing which orbit a spacecraft should fly in order to detect these flashes and improve current Earth-based observation methods is the aim of this thesis. The study is restricted to spacecraft with the CubeSat format and its inherent limitations, since it is also inserted in the context of the feasibility study of the Lunar Meteoroid Impacts Observer (LUMIO) and ESA’s Lunar CubeSats for Exploration challenge.<br/><br/>A methodology of sequential orbital trade-offs was followed, taking into account acceptance criteria based on the mission requirements and selection criteria based on the research objective. The goal was maximise the number of meteoroid detections, during the mission lifetime, while minimising the mission ∆V budget. Circular Frozen Orbits, Earth–Moon L2 Lyapunov, Halo, Near-Rectilinear, Vertical, Distant-Retrograde and Low-Prograde orbits were selected as candidates, based on a preliminary orbital trade-off. In order to determine the total number of meteoroid detections possible from a certain orbit, the lunar meteoroid environment was modelled and a coverage analysis tool was developed to determine the payload FOV-area in the lunar nightside.<br/><br/>Frozen Orbits were found to allow the detection of meteoroid impacts with kinetic energies too small with respect to the desired, so the design space was restricted to CRTBP orbits. From Lyapunov, Halo, Near-Rectilinear and Vertical Orbits it would be possible to detect between 1000 and 10000 impacts during the mission lifetime, but detections from some DROs could be one order of magnitude larger. Nonetheless, since transfer costs to DROs are known to be high, a Near-Rectilinear Orbit, with a minimal ∆V budget, was chosen as the operational orbit.","Moon; meteoroids; impact flash; orbit design; coverage; CubeSat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-24","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Lunar Meteoroid Impacts Observer",""

Especially with long cables and heavy payloads, the payload starts moving with larger amplitudes than the ship itself when no HC control is involved. HC aims to decouple the ships vertical motion due to the waves (the heave) with the cable, such that the cable and payload are as unaffected as possible by the heave motion. Several implementations are possible for HC, but in this Thesis only Hybrid Heave Compensation is elaborated. <br/>In order to decouple the cable from the ship's motion, the cable is actuated. In this Thesis a heave compensation cylinder is evaluated to control the cable length. This is a set of hydraulic cylinders between two sheaves, with the cable wound around them. <br/>Cable dynamics are very important when lifting a payload to deep sea. Cable lengths of up to 3000 m are considered in this Thesis. In contrast to most papers on HC, a lot of effort is put in the cable model, which has proven to be necessary. In most papers, the cable is simulated as a single mass-spring-damper, which has consequently only one resonant frequency. The cable model in this Thesis is based on PDE equations and includes the first twenty resonant modes of the cable and payload. Simulations point out that multiple modes are significantly present in the payload motion and forces in the cable, which indicate that these resonant modes cannot be neglected.<br/>The most basic control strategy in HC is feedforward on the heave measurement, which is taken as benchmark. A PID on velocity is added to the feedforward to assist in decoupling the ship from the cable, which is a common control strategy in HC. This controller however causes worse payload movement compared to the benchmark in simulations with long cable lengths. Another control strategy is feedback on the measured force at the top of the cable combined with the feedforward, which performs better than the benchmark. This controller however cannot cope with steady state errors, causing the heave compensation cylinder to drift to it's limits.<br/>A better option is to combine the velocity and force feedback in parallel, combined with the feedforward. Two options for balancing between force and velocity feedback are evaluated under different working conditions; the controllers are simulated under multiple cable lengths, payload masses, noise and control delays. It turns out that force feedback combined with a low bandwidth velocity feedback performs best at the different scenarios. This is in comparison to velocity feedback with additional damping from the force PID and the benchmark controller. The parallel PID with emphasis on force feedback performs especially well on damping resonant modes in the cable and payload and limiting force variations. Under the conditions as in this Thesis, the parallel PID controller with emphasis on force feedback is recommended for use in HC control.<br","Heave Compensation; Vibration Control; Cable Damping; Deep Sea; Active Heave Compensation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","","","","","",""

(mentor); Grätzl, Thomas (mentor); Shroff, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The automotive industry has developed an interest in manufacturing structural parts from continuous fibre-reinforced polymers because legislation is becoming more strict on the permissible CO<sub>2</sub> emission of newly produced vehicles. Additional requirements on the level of recyclability has raised the question if composite materials with a thermoplastic matrix in particular can be utilised in the body structure. From the perspective of cost sensitivity, the conventional automotive manufacturing chain has to remain as it is and requires the body structure to pass through the automotive paint shop and subjects all structural elements to significant hygrothermal loading. The objective of this research is to analyse the deformation behaviour of continuous fibre-reinforced thermoplastics subjected to hygrothermal loading characteristic for the automotive painting process.<br/><br/>Studying the theory behind viscoelastic problems revealed that numerical solutions to the integral form of the linear viscoelastic constitutive equations often pose a problem regarding computational memory usage because of the importance of strain history. Utilising a recursive formulation of the constitutive equations eliminated this problem and identified the required material parameters for the numerical model. Thermal expansion, hygroscopic shrinkage, polymer-chemical effects, and stress relaxation were the four phenomena that governed the deformation. Measurements with a dilatometer, a micrometer, and an analytical scale yielded quantitative results about hygrothermal expansion. Thermogravimetric analysis provided information on the moisture diffusion and dynamic mechanical analysis quantified the stress relaxation behaviour. Quasi-static tensile tests confirmed the linearity of the viscoelasticity and digital image correlation supplied the major Poisson’s ratio.<br/><br/>A finite element model has been developed that implements hygrothermal expansion and takes into account orthotropic linear viscoelastic behaviour by means of a material user subroutine. Adopting a sequential uncoupled simulation approach allowed the prediction of heat transfer, moisture diffusion, and stress distribution. A semi-numerical simulation approach enabled the calculation of the expansion of symmetric balanced laminates through classical laminate theory whilst taking into account the time- and temperature-dependency of the mechanical properties computed with a micromechanical model created for special orthotropic laminae. Sensitivity studies justified the usage of one-dimensional heat transfer- and moisture diffusion simulations. Moreover, mesh- and time step convergence studies revealed the sensitivity of the simulation to these parameters.<br/><br/>Dilatometer experiments with dry- and moisture saturated multi-directional specimens confirmed the correct calculation of hygrothermal expansion. Increasing in complexity, measuring the out-of-plane deformation of a clamped unidirectional tensile specimen subjected to a temperature profile that resembles the most severe thermal loading found in the automotive painting process confirmed a satisfactory agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data. Geometric compensation for the thermal expansion of the fixture and choosing graphite as construction material kept the thermal expansion of the fixture to a minimum. Components with the geometry of the roof bow that is currently in series production for the BMW 7 Series were manufactured by a thermoforming method to allow validation of the simulation with complex geometry. A proper agreement between the predicted deformation behaviour by the semi-numerical simulation and the optical measurements of the dry- and moisture saturated roof bows with various multi-directional lay-ups validated the functioning of the developed simulation.","Automotive; Paint shop; Composites; Continuous fibre-reinforced thermoplastics; Finite element analysis; Viscoelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

With an increasing level of vehicle automation, the role of the driver changes from controlling and observing the driving environment into becoming a passenger. However, with the introduction of piloted driving, the user has to trust his life to a machine. Therefore, one of the most important factors in the human-car relationship will be trust that the occupant places in the piloted vehicle (Waytz, Heafner, &amp; Epley, 2014). In fact, the feeling of trust will have a major impact on the acceptance of piloted driving and is an important factor in the judgment of autonomous systems (Garcia, Kreutzer, Badillo-Urquiola, &amp; Mouloua, 2015). However, recent scientific surveys indicated that people are interested in the new technology, but hesitate to trust piloted driving vehicles (Schmidt, 2016, Schoettle &amp; Sivak, 2014, Kyriakidis, Happee, &amp; Winter, 2015). In order to define the future domain and context for this thesis, the target year is based on different expert forecasts on the development of autonomous driving. According to literature, it can be concluded that due to developments in technology, fully autonomous driving will be market-ready between 2025-2030 (ERTRAC, 2015; Rupp &amp; King, 2010). Due to the fact that the next generation vehicles for 2020-2023 are currently under development, the selected target year for this thesis is 2030 in order to create a visionary input for the subsequent fully autonomous vehicle generation of Audi. The theoretical analysis about fully piloted driving and the related problem of trust in combination with the developed future context scenario of 2030, which will be discussed later in this thesis, led to the following mission statement: “Design of an AI Companion that evokes the feeling of trust by creating a relationship that is characterised by authenticity and control” Based on the mission statement, the interaction analogy of “using a compass for guidance in unknown territory” and the derived product qualities of “vivid”, “reassuring”, “familiar” and “magical”, the AI Companion was developed. The AI Companion is an innovative haptic interface concept for a fully piloted vehicle without a steering wheel and pedals with the objective to build trust between the vehicle and the occupants. By simply laying on hands, the AI Companion generates a magical, haptic movement that allows the user to feel the upcoming driving manoeuvres of the piloted vehicle. By actively moving the AI Companion the user has the ability to communicate with the vehicle and therefore shapes its driving dynamics. Through the interaction with the user, the AI Companion creates an individual piloted driving profile based on the needs of each occupant. In order to make the functions perceptible and to test if the AI Companion concept fulfils the desired product qualities in order to evoke the feeling of trust, a functional design prototype was build. To evaluate the concept, a user test with 47 participants was carried out. The user test revealed that the developed prototype satisfies the desired product qualities to a large extent. That in turn forms the basis for a trustful relationship between the user and the product. Therefore, it can be stated that the AI Companion has a positive influence on the feeling of trust in the context of a fully piloted vehicle.","Piloted Driving; Artificial intelligence; Interface design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

This type of flow, which is highly three-dimensional, turbulent and unsteady, usually leads to the generation of a Horseshoe vortex at the obstacle's leading edge. Existing extensive experimental and numerical studies focus on the inception of such vortex, as it exhibits a bi-stable behaviour which persists downstream in the vortex legs. In a practical situation such as wing-fuselage juncture, the created vortex interacts with the flow around the aircraft. Consequently, the interference drag increases and the wake can reduce the effectiveness of the stabilizers. To tackle these effects, control devices are implemented to alleviate the strength of the vortex, being leading edge fairing the most widely used device. <br/><br/>In this research project the junction flow is subjected to the influence of different control devices: leading edge fairing, vortex generators and the novel antifairing are tested. The flow field is captured with the state-of-the-art large-scale tomographic PTV technique. The aim of this project is to characterize the vortical structures associated with each passive control device. <br/><br/>The time-averaged flow field results show the fairing is the most efficient device in reducing the presence of the Horseshoe vortex, but it is also the one which contaminates a larger wake area with the vortex wake. The vortex generators are the worst performer both in the mitigation of the vortex and the turbulence level in the wake. Nevertheless, the performance of such control devices highly depends on the location of the vortex generators. Thus, it is speculated that an optimal position exists which can yield better results. The antifairing shows minimal differences in the velocity field and the vortical structures compared with the reference case, but with a slightly lower turbulence level.<br/><br/>An auxiliary experiment with stereoscopic PIV is performed to the wake of the junction, in which the momentum deficit, a good indicator of the drag, is calculated for the different configurations. The leading edge fairing shows minimal drag reduction associated with the HSV of just about 1-2%. The VG once again have proven not being very effective with an increment of 4%. A reduction of more than 15% is measured for the antifairing case. Although the associated flow topology assimilates to the reference case.<br/><br/>This study investigates the HSV system around the junction as a volume. In comparison with most of the previous experimental studies on the subject, performed mostly with planar PIV and limited to just a few planes, the volumetric measurement can deliver more information with a single measurement. Therefore, it can better define the flow topology and vortical features and facilitate the understanding of the control devices working mechanisms.<br","Helium filled soap bubbles; Tomographic; Junction flow; PIV/PTV; Large scale; Aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Their integration, however, regularly represents a design problem due to flow separation and high aerodynamic losses occurring in the bend. Curved duct flows for both compressible and incompressible conditions have been studied extensively in the past. However, no experimental results of a high Reynolds number flow through a turbine exit guide vane (EGV) followed by a curved duct have yet been published. An in-depth CFD analysis of the aerodynamic effects is therefore carried out, using the RANS solvers TRACE (at MTU Aero Engines) and SU2, to analyze the flow field and geometric sensitivities of a high Reynolds number flow through an EGV followed by a 90 degree bent duct. The geometry of interest is investigated at a Reynolds number of Re=10^6 and a ratio of bend radius to duct diameter of one. The inflow conditions are prescribed to closely resemble typical flow conditions at the low pressure turbine exit plane of a turbojet engine. After validating the solver with experimental data using the test case of a 90 degree bent duct, an initial CFD analysis of the combined exit guide vane geometry with curved duct is carried out to identify the dominant flow phenomena and mutual effects of the EGV and the bend. Three zones of flow separations are found, each at the convex and concave sides of the bend and one at the lower side of the plug. Secondary flows caused by the bend are found to have an effect on the flow upstream of the EGV, leading to a non-uniform flow inlet angle and aerodynamic loading of the individual blades. Separation downstream of the EGV is influenced by the presence of low velocity wakes from the EGV. Subsequently, a sensitivity study is carried out to find the effect of different geometrical parameters on the flow field. Main investigated parameters are the ratio of bend radius to diameter (R_c/D) and the distance between EGV and bend (l/D). Additionally, the aerodynamic effects of the circumferential EGV positioning, swirl and the plug shape are investigated. It is found that an increase in both bend radius and distance between bend and EGV improves aerodynamic efficiency, while swirl can decrease pressure losses in the duct for small bend radii of R_c/D&lt;0.8. Improving the plug shape and rotating the EGV allows to further increase the aerodynamic efficiency without weight increase. For further optimization of the geometry, it is recommended to include duct geometries with a non-constant bend radius and outer duct diameter to increase the design space.","CFD; turbulent flow; 90° elbow bend; flow separation; sensitivity study; Exit Guide Vane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

With the growth of Automotive industry, there is a high demand for the sensors used in assisting systems. As the number of sensors increases, probability that these systems being in close proximity will also increase. This will lead to situations where in multiple radar sensors will be operating in close proximity, this might lead to a sub-optimal performance of our radar system. Currently FMCW radar systems are most prevalent in the automotive radar market. For FMCW systems, interference mitigation techniques exist in time domain, frequency domain, polarization domain and etc. Most of these techniques insiston detecting and identifying the interference before mitigating it. In this thesis, we consider a FMCW radar system and first develop a MATLAB model for the three most important interference scenarios namely Continuous Wave(CW), FrequencyModulatedContinuousWave (FMCW) and PhaseModulatedContinuousWave (PMCW). We propose a signal model where interference can be localized over the beat signal, then we systematically study how interference can be detected. As a result, we will detect the interference even if the power level of the interferer is lower than the power level of the received reflected signal. Post detection of interference,we suggest a technique to identify the interference by estimating the slope from the detected interference samples. Starting with a simple existing mitigation technique, we look at how to mitigate the interference and suggest enhancements that can be done for these techniques post detection and identification. Considering a worst case scenario of interference being completely in band to the transmitted signal, we propose a novel avoidance technique which will also predict the bandwidth of the interferer. As a result we will be able to shift the center frequency of the transmitter to avoid the interferer. Finally we propose another novel time domain mitigation technique where in without detecting or identifying the interferer, we will mitigate the interference and compare the gain of Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) achieved by using this technique.","FMCW radars; Interference; Detection; Identification; mitigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-23","","","","","",""

Amazonehaven unique quay wall removal gave the opportunity to study king pile’s failure close to toe. King piles are primary piles in a combined wall system, exposed to static and dynamic load. It is argued that the unexpected pile toe failure have been caused by dynamic load because of the uniaxial direction of the extreme deformations. However, research into pile toe failure in Amazonehaven shows that hammer-induced driving stresses are significantly lower than material’s yield stress close to pile toe, given Amazonehaven soil condition. Therefore, the dynamic load has not been solely detrimental to the pile toe integrity. The main reasons for pile toe failure are discussed to be (1) pile imperfection, (2) pile inclination and (3) pile inhomogeneous strength. Bear in mind that, pile toe failure to such extent when not limited might lead to dysfunction of the asset during its technical lifetime. Therefore, counteractions must be taken to assure quay wall’s safety and stability while operating. The remedies when such a piling risk event occur could be: replacement, early maintenance, or a reduction in its designed storage capacity. The reactive solutions will bring financial consequences of pile toe failure forward. In other words, the client will experience a reduction in its revenues due to asset’s malfunction.

Conversely, the effect on an OTEC plant by oceanographic features are not researched in depth either. The aim of this research is to describe the natural patterns and variability of the ocean currents around Curaçao, an island in the Caribbean Sea and a potential OTEC deployment location. This research is carried out in order to assess possible implications for the OTEC industry. Ten years of data from the Mercator Ocean Model with a spatial resolution of 1/12˚ and temporal resolution of one day was analyzed. The model is forced by wind data from ECMWF. A strong current jet is found to dominate the flow from east to west in the Caribbean Sea. The jet is identified as the Caribbean Current and it is forced by currents in the north equatorial Atlantic Ocean and large-scale wind patterns. The Caribbean Low Level Jet, an intensification of the Trade Winds over the Caribbean Sea, is strongest in winter and weakest in fall. Consequently, the current jet is found to have a peak from December to March and a trough in October and November. The largest surface velocities of the order of 1 m/s are found along the coast of Venezuela, where wind-driven upwelling enhances surface flow to the west. Along the Venezuelan coast, subsurface currents to the east, in the opposite direction to the surface currents, are also found. The period from April to September is characterized by the meandering of the jet and the formation of large (diameter &gt; 200 km) anticyclonic eddies that cause large local surface velocities. These eddies contribute to the great variability observed in the Caribbean Sea. The origin of these eddies has not been clearly identified. Due to upwelling, no OTEC system should be deployed more than 50 km south of Curaçao to avoid cold surface water decreasing the system's performance. Hydrodynamic forces due to the calculated expected maximum velocity of 1.8 m/s, induce stresses in the cold-water pipe that do not exceed the yield stress.","OTEC; Curaçao; physical oceanography; natural flow patterns; Caribbean Sea; subsurface counter current; Variability; eddies; upwelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12.2,-69"

In a highly competitive market, the challenge is to differentiate from other airlines. Differentiation within an airplane is difficult, because of the rigidity of an airplane and the strict regulations. The economy is in a lift, businesses allow their employees to fly business class more often. First class and business class only represent 10-15% of the total number of seats globally but is responsible for 50% of the revenue. This makes business class travel very relevant to major airliners<br/><br/>Seat comfort is a tool used by the airlines to differentiate themselves. Within a review of three business class seats, the participants were asked if there was something comfortable or uncomfortable about their sitting position. 30% of their answers mentioned shoulder, arm and hand comfort of which 65% was negative and 35% positive. 46% of this 30% explicitly mentioned the armrests. <br/><br/>The assignment was to improve the comfort of a business class armrest in order to improve the comfort of the entire seat. This project was done together with RECARO Aircraft Seating. The focus was on improving their current armrest (of their long-haul business class seat) in physical comfort and privacy. Furthermore, facilitating the activities reading and watching IFE (In Flight Entertainment) were selected to focus on.<br/><br/>During the analysis phase, general aspects that could be improved about the armrest and aspects of specific activities were identified. Some of these general aspects were, the asymmetric position of the armrests leading to skewed sitting positions, hard and slippery materials, the lack of space to place the arms and the lack of adjustability options. A specific opportunity for improvement for the activity reading was the conflict between getting tired arms from holding the reading device on eye level or feeling the tension in neck and shoulder when looking down to the reading device. Another area for improvement was observed specifically for the RECARO business class seat. When the seat moves forward to a more relaxed position, the armrests stay at the same place reducing the length available for the arms to rest on and reducing the width. <br/><br/>The final proposed design is an armrest which can be integrated into the current RECARO long-haul business class seat. The top part of the armrest can automatically move forward together with the seat so the space available for arm support while watching IFE is optimized. Both armrests have the same adjustability options to improve the symmetry of the sitting position. the up/down movement of the armrest can also be adjusted automatically with the same control panel as the seat adjustments. <br/><br/>The reading position is improved by the added function of upwards rotation and inwards rotation. When the armrests are placed under an angle the reading device is brought closer to eye height while supporting the arms. Participants experienced the new design as more comfortable for reading than the current armrest positioning during a user test. <br/><br/>An option for a privacy screen was designed to be added to the armrest. This involved a screen that rotates down originating from the current privacy panel. Although the panel improves the privacy significantly for sleeping, the effect only works if the armrests are moved fully up, which takes away moving space and does not improve the privacy for other sitting positions. Therefore a different solution for this needs to be sought. <br/><br/>Further improvement to the armrests can be made by searching for a way to make the inner armrest longer for reading. And the usability of the armrest design should be evaluated to check if the use is understood by the passengers.","ergonomics; comfort; seat; aircraft seat; armrests; reading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

They see a potential solution within the application of design activities related to design paradigms such as user experience and customer experience. However several hurdles are experienced within the introduction of these approaches. In other words there are difficulties with the successful introduction of an approach called design thinking.<br/><br/>According to a market analyses, KPMG’s advisory services has maintained about the same size in a growing advisory market, where competition has increased the past seven years. KPMG is the only company of the Big Four that has not grown within the past seven years. In the meantime KPMG has lost its leading advisory position within the Big Four consultancies to Deloitte. <br/><br/>The market for business services is changing. There is increased competition caused by growing competitors and new European and Dutch audit legislation. In addition clients expect better business services and better business service experiences. KPMG’s position on the advisory market, the growing competition and the development of increased expectations of business services indicate the need for new ways to develop better experiences for clients. Design thinking is an approach that can be used to do just that. Therefore the assignment of this project was to find a way to introduce design thinking in a successful way at KPMG and design a solution that would enable consultants to apply it in their profession.<br/><br/>Design thinking is an approach that centralizes human needs by using technology driven solutions in combination with business feasibility. This way design thinking can be used to develop holistic systems that solve multiple problems at ones. The design thinking process exists out of three stages, inspiration, ideation and implementation. Each of these stages exist out of several design activities. To apply design thinking, a certain mindset is needed. One needs to be empathic, use integrative thinking, collaborative, optimistic and experimental to successfully apply design thinking. This mindset can be created under the right conditions. <br/><br/>There are several hurdles associated with the introduction of design thinking within corporations. To learn why and how design thinking is applied within corporation, qualitative research was done with design professionals. This research resulted into several advantages that design thinking brings into corporations and strategies to introduce the approach into corporations. <br/><br/>Through conversations and interviews with consultants several hurdles and strategies for the introduction of new initiatives, such as design thinking, were identified. Together with the results of the research with design professionals, these findings were translated into a list of requirements for successful design thinking introduction within KPMG. <br/><br/>The value of design thinking should be expressed in terms time and money to make its application interesting for consultants. It should be applied within a service that has often been provided by KPMG and that as many consultants as possible are part of in order to succesfully spread it through the organisation. <br/><br/>The proposal development process meets all the requirements that are addressed in these lists. Through the application of context generating methods, co-creation session and idea testing, design thinking can potentially safe a lot of time, increase proposal acceptance and improve the experience of clients at the same time. <br/><br/>To enable consultants to take advantage of these design thinking characteristics, a toolkit for the proposal development process was designed based upon existing design thinking methods. The toolkit is called KPMG Essence and exists out of four stages that are associated with the design stages. These are 1. Plan, 2. Discover, 3. Ideate and 4. Preview. <br/><br/>The first stage exists out of tools that guide consultants in planning a co-creation session and gathering context about a clients problem. The second and third stages exist out of tools that guide a co-creation session with all consultants that are involved with the development of a proposal. The fourth step enables consultants to preview their ideas to clients and gather feedback about the generated ideas. This enables consultants to learn what direction to take within the further development of the proposal and to estimate whether they can offer the client the solutions they look for, before they spend day on writing a proposal in vain.<br/><br/>The Discover and Ideate stages were tested on a real life client case together with seven consultants. Consultants were very enthusiastic about the session and gave a the value of the session a 6 out of 7. <br/><br/>At the end of the report a plan of implementation and several recommendations are made for further development. <br/><br/>KPMG Essence provides a first step in the further application of design thinking within the proposal process. Furthermore it enables all advisory consultants to experience design thinking. As there are many more opportunities to introduce design thinking within KPMG the tool is expected to create awareness among enthusiastic consultants about how design thinking might also improve other services within KPMG.","Design thinking; design toolkit; organisational change; customer experience; consultancy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These interaction stresses are not accounted for in many simplified models that evaluate the behaviour of the soil layer and the structure separately. Modelling a fully coupled system requires extensive computation that changes with every alteration to the model. Having a general framework of equations that can be easily adapted to each specific case can therefor be of great value.<br/>In this thesis, we model the soil layer as a homogeneous, elastic continuum with two boundary conditions. One boundary condition is a kinematic excitation at the bottom of the soil layer, which is formulated in terms of a Fourier series with prescribed coefficients. The boundary condition at the top of the soil layer is a stress function, formulated as a Fourier series with unknown coefficients. The general solution of the equation of motion is then solved in terms of these known and unknown coefficients. The structure is modelled as an inextensible mass or as a mass-spring system, which is excited by an external force at the interface with the soil layer, formulated in the same Fourier terms and unknown coefficients as for the soil layer. The unknown coefficients are solved by means of an interface condition between the soil layer and the structure.<br/>This computational method provides an equation of motion for the soil layer that depends on the applied structure model. When the structure model is altered, for example by a mass-spring system instead of a single mass, only the interface condition has to be reevaluated to find a solution for the equation of motion of the soil layer and the structure. This thesis shows that this computational model, where we write the specific solution to the equation of motion in terms of unknown Fourier series coefficients, does indeed work.<br/>By analysing the stress distribution at the interface between the soil layer and the structure for different frequencies, results show that the stress is resonant at the natural frequencies of the system. The stress distribution is nearly uniform for most frequencies, but the stresses increase at the sides of the interface at the natural frequencies. It can also be shown that the interaction stresses increase with the frequency.<br/>When analysing various transfer functions, the influence of the stress interaction between the soil layer and the structure is most visible. Computing a fully coupled system shows that the natural frequencies of the system are affected by the structure on the top of the soil layer. First, the natural frequencies are partially shifted to lower frequencies. Secondly, not all natural frequencies lead to infinite resonance: the transfer functions show an alternating pattern of finite and infinite responses to the excitation at the natural frequencies.<br/>The transfer functions of added mass-spring systems, for example, used to model multi story buildings, also shows the influence of the interaction stress compared to the isolated model of the structure. The coupled system shows again that the natural frequencies are partially shifted and not all natural frequencies lead to infinite resonance.<br/>It can be concluded that the interaction stress in a fully coupled system has a significant impact on the system and should be taken into account when modelling a structure-soil system. The tested computational method is good way to do so.","Soil Dynamics; SH-waves; Soil-Structure Interaction; Structural Dynamic; Shear waves","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This entails that in most cases the production already starts while the engineering has not even been finished. If the pipes and cables are not routed when the steel plate are cut by the CNC machine, the associated penetrations have to be cut manually during section building, which is very expensive.<br/>The ideal situation is to know the location and size of all penetration before the plates are cut. However, this is not realistic in all cases and therefore a new engineering and production approach is devised. If the penetrations are not known on time, large openings are to be made which can later be filled with inserts, when all exact penetrations are known.<br/>It is possible to just open a lot of large openings, or an estimation concerning optimal openings can be performed. In this research, several algorithms have been created to estimate an optimal opening for a certain penetration, and to check whether this penetration fits in the estimated opening. For the closing of the opening, several methods are described as well. An obvious choice is to close using a welded steel insert plate. A less obvious choice is the rather new product called NOFIRNO®. Both solutions have some advantages and disadvantages for different situations.<br/>All the algorithms are validated by comparing the results to actual built vessels. With the accurateness of this validation, a business case has been performed for several opening methods, combined with several closing methods.

In Nigeria, the chosen context of this study, over 90% of the population is at risk of malaria infection, leading to 60% of the outpatient visits in Nigerian healthcare facilities. Accurate diagnostics are not available for the mass and drugs can be bought without prescription, leading to misdiagnosis, overtreatment and drug resistance.<br/><br/>The Excelscope is a smart malaria diagnostic device that leverages the functionalities of a smartphone to capture magnified images of a blood smear and provide a remote or automated diagnosis. The concept was developed by students from the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering and is currently under development of a research consortium. The Excelscope aims for increasing accessibility to accurate malaria diagnostics. Three scenarios for the diagnostic analysis of a blood sample (remote, semi-automated and automated) were the starting point of this research.<br/><br/>The technology analysis evaluated the three defined scenarios for remote or point-of-care diagnostics. Based on an initial analysis, the assumption was made that the semi-automatic scenario was most feasible in the context and best accepted by healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, lab scientists). Furthermore, the technology analysis briefly discussed definitions related to eHealth, resulting in several ideas for applications for the Excelscope. Finally, a study into similar technologies for malaria diagnostics was done. An integrated system for imaging and automated parasite detection has not been launched on the market yet, although several organizations and companies are working on similar technologies.<br/><br/>The context analysis consists of four chapters: Nigeria, her healthcare system, malaria and -diagnostics. Next to literature research and expert interviews, Insights were gained during a one-month field study in Ibadan, Nigeria. During the field study, healthcare facilities were visited and caregivers participated in semi-structured interviews. The context analysis resulted in a country profile (including general aspects about economy, living standard and health), an overview of the healthcare system and insights on each tier of the healthcare system. Coverage of malaria diagnostics can significantly increase when a device is implemented in primary healthcare centres, pharmacies, medicine stores or medical outreaches. However, the Excelscope has to meet the minimal infrastructure at these places: little or no access to reliable water, lack of internet connection, low-level medical staff and ‘robust’ environments.<br/><br/>Current ways of diagnosing malaria were studied as well and evaluated according to WHO’s ASSURED checklist. Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are the recommended methods for confirmation of a suspected case of malaria. However, both methods lack on different aspects, such as affordability, availability or accuracy. In development of the Excelscope, the checklist can be used as guidelines for basic requirements. However, aspects related to context (infrastructure and accessibility) and user (behaviour, attitude and trust) are essential in order to develop an effectively used device. <br/><br/>Throughout this project, emphasis has been placed on the user. The goal of this study was to find barriers and enablers for use and acceptance of the Excelscope by healthcare professionals in Nigeria. During the interviews with stakeholders in Nigeria, the different scenarios were discussed, as well as local perspectives on malaria management in general. Through the interviews, six potential target groups were defined: patent medicine vendors, pharmacists, medical doctors, nurses, laboratory scientists and medical volunteers (community health workers). For each of the target groups, suggestions have been given for smartness of the device, values and mHealth applications. <br/><br/>The study is concluded with a ‘roadmap’ wherein all findings are connected in a framework of technology, context and user. The framework can be used for defining a target group or anticipating on necessary developments in order to increase.<br","malaria; diagnostics; excelscope; Developing countries; Nigeria; acceptance; Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Part of this energy efficiency improvement must be achieved at Dutch primary school buildings, but insufficient- and separation of budgets complicate the development of sustainable school buildings. Subject to this financial pressure, the current poor state of primary school buildings in terms of indoor environmental quality is, and will remain insufficient. Affecting performance, productivity and health of students and staff, and additionally having a monetary impact on school boards.<br/>The inability to achieve energy efficiency in combination with good indoor environmental quality, within the available financial means, is for a large part explained by a lack of knowledge and experience in building renovation by many Dutch school boards. Often, indoor environmental quality is one of the first things to suffer from insufficient funds. A decision-making framework is developed to provide school boards with the necessary knowledge and insight to better finance and organize renovation projects, providing more (financial) room to address the indoor environmental quality of their school buildings. Leading to more balanced school buildings in terms of People (indoor environmental quality), Planet (energy efficiency), and Profit (costs).<br/>This framework comprises of a decision flowchart, supplemented by sustainable measure packages, that facilitates school boards in the renovation decision making process. The flowchart provides school boards insight in the decision-making process, (technical, financial and organizational) renovation opportunities, and effects of-, and on-, indoor environmental quality. This flowchart is developed using desk research, qualitative interviews and expert meetings. Then tested by obtaining qualitative expectations in interviews with school boards and a focus group with financial experts.<br/>The expectations are that the decision-framework does provide more insight in the renovation decision-making process and opportunities, and that this could lead to better financing and organization of school building renovation projects. By raising problem awareness about indoor environmental quality effects, the framework is also expected to contribute to improved indoor environmental quality in renovated school buildings.<br/>For further research, guiding school boards in contracting market parties is advised. This addition should present how to challenge contractors to come up with smart solutions to fulfil the ambitions of school boards. Furthermore, the flowchart should be tested by ’eenpitters’ (school boards managing a single school), as they are often mentioned as key beneficiary. Also, the development of a digital version of the flowchart could enable easy use and sharing of the tool as well as easy coupling with other existing instruments.<br/>Finally, for further development the following ’rules’ should be kept in mind: the strength of the flowchart is in its simplicity, don’t develop something new, bring together existing instruments, and use the language of the educational sector.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-21","","","","","",""

Significant increases in axial capacity have been reported where the rate of set-up varied between 15 and 75% per log cycle of time. <br/><br/>More economic foundation designs are feasible when set-up is incorporated in pile design methods. The objective of this thesis is to expand knowledge on time-dependent capacity of driven displacement piles and make way for a pile design method that incorporates time dependency of pile bearing capacity. <br/><br/>The time dependency of virgin pile capacity has been assessed in a database study and a scaled test program. 4 scaled closed-ended steel piles were driven in a man-made sand deposit. The virgin capacity of a pile was assessed 2, 16, 31 and 70 days after installation. The 3 m long, 0.15 m diameter piles were statically tested in compression. Strain was measured at multiple locations along the shaft during the load tests. The applied load and pile displacement were measured at the pile head. <br/><br/>The contribution of the pile shaft and pile tip was determined from the strain distribution over the pile length at failure. A trend for capacity increase with time has been found in the database study and the test program. A capacity increase of 13% per log cycle of time was found for the closed-ended piles tested. Both an increase in shaft and tip resistance was found with respect to the reference capacity determined 2 days after installation. The shaft capacity increased on average 18.5% per log cycle of time and an average increase of 9% per log cycle of time has been found for the pile tip capacity. The measured capacity was compared with the calculated capacity determined by the Dutch design code. Considering the measured capacity normalized by the calculated capacity the influence of time is even stronger on the tip resistance than on the shaft resistance for the piles tested. As discussed in the report, there are some uncertainties with the interpretation of the strain distributions over the pile shafts. <br/><br/>The accuracy of the CPT-based design method available in the Dutch design code, method Koppejan, has been assessed from the pile test results in the database. The results were compared with other design methods available. The accuracy of all methods was low. The calculated capacity exceeded the measured capacity up to a factor 3. <br/><br/>Time-dependent capacity increase is a potential mechanism to incorporate in designs of axially loaded driven displacement piles. A trend for time-dependent increase of virgin capacity was found for all the test results considered in literature as well as for the test program conducted. However, the rate of capacity increase was highly variable. More research is required on the mechanism(s) for a better understanding of time-dependent capacity increase. Understanding of the mechanisms will also help understand what factors, and how these factors, influence the rate of increase. <br","set-up; time dependent; pile foundations; static load test; sand; virgin capacity; database; bearing capacity; scaled test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

At Energy research center of the Netherlands (ECN), one such model is under development. In this project, couple of aspects were investigated to give better insight into improving the model. The two main aspects of the model that were investigated were the rear irradiance estimation and the temperature prediction of the model. <br/>Analysis of rear irradiance aspect of the bifacial yield model through simulations at low tilt angles and elevations should in practice result low rear irradiance but the results showed the opposite. From the literature, a new factor called acceptance was implemented in the rear irradiance model which led to correction in estimation of rear irradiance. For the temperature model, initially indoor measurements of three laminates of bifacial cells and three laminates of monofacial cells were performed under solar simulator. The experiment resulted in finding differences in measured and cell temperatures for all six laminates. According to measured temperatures, the bifacial cell laminates were hotter than their monofacial counterparts, which may not be correct due to higher absorption of irradiance by backsheets in bifacial cell laminates. The differences in calculated cell temperature and measured temperature were investigated and were found to be different. The heating behavior of all laminates was modelled and heat capacity and heat transfer coefficient found through modelling were found to be in good agreement with literature values. Outdoor measurements were used for temperature analysis of bifacial panels and again the differences in calculated cell temperature and measured temperature were found. Non-steady state temperature model was found to be more accurate for low resolution meteorological and insolation data of less than ten minutes as compared to the steady state model used by current ECN model. The difference between measured and cell temperature was translated in terms of heat transfer coefficient and for this difference, the annual energy yield results showed a variation of 1.45 %. <br/>The results of the project showed improvement of the bifacial yield model by ECN through an improved rear irradiance estimation. Furthermore, non-steady model should be used in case the input meteorological and insolation data is in less than ten-minute interval.","Bifacial; Yield Model; Rear Irradiance; Temperature Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the existing systems either require active participation from people in the crowd or are too expensive to be deployed. The exponentially increasing adoption of smartphones by people and the ubiquitous Wi-Fi infrastructure motivated us to tackle this problem in a non-intrusive manner. This thesis focuses on designing a system to infer the crowd distribution in large indoor spaces. As we choose to be non-intrusive in approach, we incorporate low cost Wi-Fi sniﬀers into smart bulbs that are part of the lighting grids in buildings. The Wi-Fi data gathered from these smart bulbs is analyzed to obtain people count and the people’s position within a given area. Our aim is to estimate people’s location within 4x4 m2 grids with minimal number of Wi-Fi frames. A number of ﬁltering and post processing mechanisms are proposed in order to eliminate false positives and to accurately identify the number of people within a given area. Extensive experiments are conducted in a realworld testbed with controlled settings as well as in test setups with no control (auditorium and a coﬀee corner). The improvised counting algorithm comes close to 75% of the ground truth. We adopt range free localization algorithms to estimate the position of people and evaluate these algorithms extensively. We propose enhancements on these algorithms to reﬁne the position estimation accuracy and reduce the execution time. Range free localization algorithms were able to estimate the position 40% of the time within 2m when sniﬀers are placed 6m apart in a grid topology in a highly multipath testbed environment. Simulations indicate this number can increase up to 76% when sniﬀers are placed 4m for the same topology. Since the bulbs with sniﬀers cost more we minimize the overall deployment cost of the system by reducing the number of sniﬀers while maintaining an accuracy within a 4x4 m2 grid majority of the time. Extensive simulations are run with diﬀerent topologies and sniﬀer densities in order to ﬁnd this sweet spot.<br/>iv","smart lighting grids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-21","","","","","",""

For this reason, an advanced analysis below is performed which redefines the magnitude of the resources for the development of a realistic OTEC deployment scenario which can still cover the entire electricity demand of the world.<br/>In total, the Offshore and Onshore OTEC power produce can reach up to 4.4 TW with a deep seawater flow rate of wcw=175 m/yr without causing any thermal disruptions in the ocean.

To meet stricter water quality regulations and ﬁght new emerging pollutants, upgrading treatment processes to improve treated water quality has become common practices worldwide. However, the quality improved drinking water still needs to be delivered by the old distribution system with harboured material which may cause serious water quality deterioration during the shifting of supply water quality. Until now, the accompanying transition effects within distribution networks caused by changes of water quality or hydraulic condition have been poorly documented. These irregular operations will impact water quality<br/>negatively through the associated physiochemical and microbiological destabilization of accumulated materials such as loose deposits resuspension and bioﬁlm detachment.<br/>The destabilized materials would be released as suspended solids into bulk water and travel throughout distribution networks. Therefore, the investigation on changes of suspended solids characteristics is the key to understand transition effects. To study the transition effects through suspended solids, there are challenges: 1) suspended solids are diluted in the big volume of water, resulting in low concentration if take water samples; 2) the detection limit of regular parameters makes the changes hard to be noticed; 3) the<br/>release of suspended particles is non-periodicity, which leads to the difﬁculty of catching the moment.<br/>In my studies, the online particle sampling system (OPSS) was applied in three distribution systems to collect and monitor suspended solids, which successfully overcame all of the three challenges mentioned above.

Robot Care Systems has been pioneering in developing a prototype of a mobile manipulator for elderly care. It has a 6 degrees of freedom robotic arm mounted on their flagship robot LEA, a non-holonomic differential drive platform. In order to utilize the navigation and manipulation capabilities of such mobile manipulators, robot placement algorithm that computes a favorable position and orientation of the mobile base is sought, which enables the end effector to reach a desired target. None of the existing approaches perform robot placement while ensuring a high chance of successful planning to target through a short path, while accounting for sensing and actuation errors typical in real world scenarios. This thesis presents a novel robot placement algorithm DeCOWA (Determining Commutation configuration using Optimization and Workspace Analysis) with these characteristics. Since the approach to robot placement is dependent upon the kind of mobile manipulation, a comparative study of sequential and full body methods is performed with respect to criteria important in domestic settings. Sequential mobile manipulation is found to be most suitable, for which a modular mobile manipulation framework encompassing motion planning and robot placement is presented. With sequential mobile manipulation, the ability to successfully reach a target depends upon the kinematic capabilities of the arm. Accordingly, robot placement with DeCOWA determines a favorable location for the arm, and corresponding platform orientation. To find the position of arm’s base, an offline manipulator workspace analysis is performed generating the Inverse Reachability and Planability maps. During online use, these maps are combined into an Inverse Fusion Map that ranks different<br/>locations based on the ability of the arm placed there to find a successful and short motion plan to target. This map is filtered to generate a set of feasible locations at the arm’s height. Through a ranked iterative search, a suitable collision free arm location is determined followed by minimization of the platform distance from robot’s current pose. This approach is evaluated against an unbiased random placement of robot near the target using a sample set of twenty scenes mimicking domestic settings. It is found that DeCOWA is able to generate commutation configurations in fraction of a second, that lead to a high planning success rate, a short path length, and account for goal tolerance of navigation. Also, its modularity allows to use several planability metrics, making it useful for domestic application.","Mobile Manipulation; Robot; Robot Placement; Vision; Domestic Environments; Commutation Configuration; Robotics; Base Placement; Reachability; Workspace Analysis; Optimization; Planability; Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Congestion refers to issues related to the overheating of components or voltage issues in the distribution network. Avoiding these issues is crucial to maintain a stable, economical and reliable electricity grid. By using the flexibility of aggregated EVs large investments in grid reinforcement can be avoided. However, a holistic approach is necessary to manage the procurement of flexibility services for all stakeholders involved. One approach is the Universal Smart Energy Framework (USEF), a framework that integrates the existing electricity market with a market for flexibility services from the aggregator to the Distribution System Operator (DSO). This master thesis presents a study on the flexibility market as described by USEF from the perspective of a commercial aggregator of EVs. USEF presents a framework in which flexibility potentially provides financial opportunities for aggregators of EVs. However, it is not clear what the financial impact on the charging costs of an aggregator of EVs is and in what way an aggregator has to adapt its charging logic when trading with DSOs. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to answer the following question: how can an aggregator of EVs offer flexibility services to a USEF compliant market at distribution level?

Geomechanical modeling is one of the method to understand the mechanical condition and has been used in various subsurface-related industries such as oil and gas, geothermal, and CO2 storage. The principal stress distribution influences the stress regime and dictates the creation of different type of fault and fracture. The magnitude and orientation of principal stresses are controlled by the physical and mechanical properties of the rock such as density and Poisson’s ratio. It is also effected by the tectonic stress and the geometry of the model which is created using the seismic data. In the case where the gravity is the only source of stress in the model, normal stress regime is observed in the whole depth. Meanwhile, in the case of tectonic stress is also involved, the stress regime changes over the depth from reverse, strike-slip, to normal stress regime. Lateral variation of the stress magnitude is observed even though it is not really significant. The presence of the fault in the model does not have a large contribution to influence the magnitude and orientation of the principal stresses. Changing the pore pressure magnitude is indeed can affect the principal, effective stress, and the stress regime throughout the model.","geomechanics; geology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The fatigue limit state is often the driving consideration for support structure design. Monitoring the monopile loads can offer an accurate knowledge of its consumed and remaining fatigue lifetime, which in turn has the potential benefits of lifetime extension and feedback on current design practices among others. Since within an offshore wind farm not all turbines are subjected to the same loading, a turbine or cluster-specific internal load monitoring scheme is investigated using data-driven approaches and specifically feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) and linear regression (LR). <br/><br/>The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether it is possible to accurately estimate the actual loading of the offshore wind turbine at the monopile mudline fatigue sensitive location by utilizing standard signals and/or sensor measurements and machine learning techniques instead of a structural model. <br/><br/>Data simulated with the Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy in-house aeroelastic code - Bonus Horizontal axis wind turbine Code (BHawC) – is used, including operation and idling fatigue load cases. Ten minute time and frequency-domain statistics of signals that are collected in turbines are used as inputs to the data-driven models, whereas 10-minute damage equivalent loads (DELs) of monopile moments are used as targets. By using statistics of rotor rotational velocity, electrical power output, blade pitch angle, hub wind speed and nacelle accelerations, a mean absolute error of DEL estimation smaller than 4% in both operation and idling load cases is achieved, under the condition that the training set properly reflects the entire variation in environmental conditions. Furthermore, errors average out over multiple 10-minute intervals, resulting in accurate long-term estimation with residual errors between -1% and +1%. The accuracy of the estimation can be further improved by including additional sensors; accelerometers placed at the tower bottom (TB) can help reduce ANN mean absolute error by up to 40% in operational load cases. <br/><br/>In addition, if inclinometers are installed at TB they can allow 10-minute equivalent ranges of rotation signals at TB to be used as inputs to a LR scheme to accurately estimate DELs. When the 10-minute intervals are binned based on whether the mean wind speed is below, around, or above the turbine rated wind speed, this method gives mean absolute errors below 2.5%. As a result, TB inclinometers are recommended as extra sensors for load monitoring, provided that factors such as their accuracy level and durability compared to alternatives are considered. <br/><br/>The data-driven models examined in this thesis show potential not only for online internal load monitoring, but also for fast estimation of past load histories using recorded data. <br","offshore wind turbine; load monitoring; neural networks; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Indonesia is the third largest rice producer of the world. Given the challenges such as growing population, degrading land and increasing water scarcity in upcoming decades, the Indonesian government aims to rehabilitate its irrigation systems. More insights in the spatial distribution of irrigation water and water productivity of rice paddies could contribute to decision-making in future rehabilitation investments. <br/>This report describes the assessment of Water Productivity (WP) of paddy rice in Indonesia using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). SEBAL is a tool that translates raw satellite measurements into maps of actual evapotranspiration and crop production, among others. The actual crop water consumption (i.e. actual evapotranspiration) and crop yield can now be estimated for every 30 m x 30 m, even if data on irrigation water application is not available. With this information, rice production per unit of land (kg/ha) as well as per unit of water consumed (kg/m3) can be computed. <br/>Focus of this study are sites in Bali, West Java and Lombok. Fieldwork is conducted in Bali and West Java to support the maps with ‘ground truth’ data. Data is collected from local governmental institutes and farmers to verify the remote sensing outputs. <br/>This research shows promising results linking SEBAL outputs with the ground truth even though the amount of fieldwork was limited. The inclusion of the new HANTS algorithm will create the technical opportunity to make daily WP reports for all rice fields in Indonesia, also under cloudy conditions. This could be a big information boost to support irrigation managers with their daily services of bringing water to farmers. Whereas some key explanatory reasons were detected (i.e. distance to canal, salt water intrusion, water quality, erosion), it is recommended to further explore relations between WP and influencing factors in the local context together with local irrigation officers. Even though the research revealed some limitations causing uncertainties, this new remote sensing technologies can support an efficient and effective investment purposes on modernization of irrigation. It is recommended that the Directorate of Irrigation and Lowlands recognize WP as a new policy instrument and implement it both at central level and irrigation district level. <br","Water Productivity; SEBAL; Indonesia; Rice paddies","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP238","-6.59, 108.45"

Smalt and yellow lake are unstable pigments in oil and their colour fades over time.

Ahmadi, between two vertebrae. The spinal cage is of a new hinged, and spring loaded design, requiring a new insertion instrument, since no existing instruments are able to place the implant. The implant is used in a PLIF (Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion) surgery. The goal of this surgery is to relieve patients from their symptoms when suffering from a hernia. The new applicator is designed to have a workflow which induces a low workload. To gain information on the current surgery, two observations in the operating theatre are made and a workflow analysis is performed. After the initial analysis a lean startup process is used to create iterations of the new spinal cage applicator. This method is used because it is found to better suit the already largely defined context of the project. A test with the first design shows that the multi-segment spinal cage was difficult to load into the applicator, therefore a solution is found by creating a cartridge which contains the spinal cage and allows for a quick and easy insertion. A connection between the spinal cage and the part which pushes the implant into the body is added as well to allow for a controlled insertion. The second design is tested on a simulated anatomical setup. This user test shows that the connection between spinal cage and pusher, and markings indicating the correct insertion orientation requires improvement. The third design is tested to evaluate the workflow. It is found that the workflow induces a low to moderate workload. It is found that the applicator still blocks the surgical view too much. The final design, called ClearFix, is a disposable applicator made from clear polycarbonate to increase the surgeons view on the surgical area. Surgeons state that the ClearFix is easy and intuitive to use, and would use the ClearFix if it were available.","Spinal cage; Applicator; Minimally invasive surgery; Sugical instrument; implant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design / Medisign","",""

The accurate description of this physical and chemical phenomenon is not a straightforward task. The Darcy law, which is commonly used in continuum modelling at the macroscale, fails when the porosity approaches the unity due to a dissolution. In order to accurately capture the acidisation phenomenon, an upscaling of Navier-Stokes equations is done from pore scale to Darcy scale. The resulting equation is called the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) equation and the approach is called hybrid modelling. The hybrid modelling has the advantage of not having to deal with jumps in velocity and pressure as it makes these variables continuous without any jumps at the interfaces.<br/><br/> The research presented here models the phenomenon using both the Darcy and DBS approaches to study the differences. A single phase injection model in 1-D is simulated to understand the flow dynamics and the chemical kinetics of a single wormhole in idealistic assumptions. To study different regimes of wormholes formation, the 2-D model, implemented in Stanford's Automatic Differentiation General Purpose Research Simulator (ADGPRS), was employed. The shape of wormholes is studied and is validated against the published results. The wormholes characteristics, obtained in both Darcy and DBS models, are defined as a function of breakthrough parameters and dimensionless variables. A convergence, sensitivity and performance analysis is performed for key parameters to fully describe and understand the differences in the 2-D solutions. Furthermore, the impact of co-injecting a gas phase namely CO_2 is simulated and compared with the single phase injection in both the models.","Acidisation; hybrid modelling; Brinkman; Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes; matrix acidising","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

To track the movement of the eyelid during an experiment, researchers traditionally made use of potentiometers or electromyography (EMG). More recently, the use of computer vision and image processing alleviated the need for these techniques, but currently employed methods require human intervention and are not fast enough to enable real-time processing. We selected a combination of face and landmark-detection algorithms in order to fully automate eyelid tracking, and accelerated them to make the first step towards an on-line implementation. Various different algorithms for face detection and landmark detection (eyelid detection) are analyzed and evaluated. Based on this analysis, two algorithms are identified as most suitable for our use case: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm for face detection and Ensemble of Regression Trees (ERT) algorithm for landmark detection. These two algorithms are accelerated on GPU and CPU, achieving speedups of 1753× and 11.49×, respectively. A combination of these algorithms is successfully implemented for a real neuroscientific use-case: eyeblink response detection, achieving an overall application runtime of 0.533 ms per frame, which is 1067× faster than the sequential implementation. Furthermore, this accelerated implementation was used to generate a database of 1440 eyeblink responses during the conditioning experiment.

(mentor); Steele-Dunne, Susan (mentor); Alfieri, Silvia (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Expected increase of world wide food demand requires improvement of efficient water use in agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the Directorate-General for International Cooperation (DGIS) of the Netherlands and many more key actors at the level of policy, research and practice are involved to obtain this improvement. However, this thesis demonstrates that there is little agreement between key actors regarding most relevant indicators for efficient water use and most effective strategies to obtain an improvement of efficient water use at the agricultural field.<br/><br/>At field scale, present indicators and strategies are analyzed. Two typical actual fields are simulated for a single growing season using the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant model (SWAP) and WOrld FOod STudies simulation model (WOFOST), calibrated against output from the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model (SEBAL). Remote sensing and model data is used to significantly reduce field work generally required in hydrological research. The obtained baseline scenarios are a plausible representation of the actual fields.Furthermore, SWAP/WOFOST allows for the simulation of various strategy scenarios. Ten different strategies for improvement of efficient water use are observed. The model output of baseline and strategy scenarios is used for computation of 13 different indicators for efficient water use. Hence, quantification of improvement of efficient water use by strategies according to possible indicators is obtained. Strategies and indicators correspond to present perceptions of key actors. The used methodology for field scale analysis is proven effective in this research. It is expected to be applicable for other regions and crop varieties. Recommendations are made concerning the methodology and future research on improvement of efficient water use in agriculture.The fields observed in this research are a general surface irrigated winter wheat field in Tadla basin Morocco and a sub surface irrigated smallholder maize field in the Lower Limpopo basin Mozambique. This thesis demonstrates that the effect of strategies is field specific. In general, a significantly larger potential for improvement is observed for the smallholder maize field. Also, trusted strategies are shown to be counter effective. Furthermore, change in efficient water use is greatly uneven and sometimes opposing by different indicators.At the winter wheat field, the target of 25% increase of the water productivity indicator used by DGIS is not met by any of the observed strategies. At the maize field this target is met by, among other strategies,elimination of irrigation. However, this also results in a 87% decrease of seasonal yield. Key actors use multiple different water productivity indicators, that are expressed in kg m¡3 and correspond to ’crop per drop’ or more vague and conceptual definitions for water productivity used at the FAO. The change to optimal seed quality at the smallholder maize field results in a water productivity increase ranging between -26 and +148% by different water productivity indicators. The -26% is obtained according to the indicator used by DGIS. This thesis demonstrates that the results from this indicator are misleading, caused by the use of biomass production in the nominator of the water productivity definition. Yield production is more representative for the desired field performance. The ’drop’ in the water productivity denominator can refer to applied irrigation water as observed in the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 6.4.1, or to other water balance fluxes including evapotranspiration or transpiration. Evaluating the applied irrigation water is relevant when data is available regarding efficient use of water for other purposes than field application.This is outside the scope of this research. Evapotranspiration and transpiration provide information on the consumption of water by the observed system and by the crop. These quantities can be accurately monitored with remote sensing technologies.<br/><br/>Therefore this thesis suggests that in arid and semi-arid regions, the water productivity indicator defined by yield divided by crop transpiration is the most relevant indicator for efficient water use to the purpose of food security. Although there is currently little agreement among key actors, the largest consensus on a relevant indicator was found for this definition. It is also demonstrated that indicators are often unclear to key actors involved in practice or at policy level and that key actors involved in research are most critical. This implies possible challenges in implementation of a single indicator for global use. In world wide monitoring of this indicator, the greatest challenge is expected in the computation of yield from biomass production for which land use classification is required. This thesis therefore also emphasizes the need for the development of methodologies that allow world wide mapping of agricultural land use.","Efficient water use; Agriculture; Water productivity; SEBAL; SWAP; WOFOST; Policy; Indicators; Strategies; Field scale; Sustainable Development Goals; FAO; DGIS; Remote Sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the DG advection scheme needs a mapping from each cell average to all nodal values that are needed for one DG cell, and a mapping back, which we called mapping a and b respectively.

The transmission operator has to decide where and when new overhead lines are required. However the operator can also chose to utilize existing lines more by increasing the transport capacity. This can be accomplished by applying dynamic line rating. In this case the conductor temperature and sag will increase but should not not violate the safety limits. Therefore a device can be installed on over-head lines to monitor the temperature and sag in real-time. Several devices are already manufactured and tested. However these devices require a reliable communication. In this thesis the feasibility and reliability of communication with Low Power Wide area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol in an overhead line environment is studied. The ﬁrst objective is to determine the consequences of DLR on overhead lines. Second shielding of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld in an overhead line is evaluated. Finally an antenna is chosen and a prototype is designed to evaluated its thermal behavior, low frequency magnetic shielding capabilities and communication feasibility and reliability. The ﬁrst objective is to understand how the conductor temperature, the sag and magnetic ﬁeld increases in respect to the transport capacity. The change in conductor temperature is examine by considering several heating gains and losses mechanisms. The sag is approached by a sagging and parabola curve to evaluate the decrease of distance to the ground. The maximum magnetic ﬁeld is determined for close distances from the conductor.Two methods are examine to shield form the electric and magnetic ﬁeld from the overhead lines. There-fore the materials copper, aluminum, steel and mu-metal are evaluated on their conductivity and permeability. The antenna is determined by comparing a dipole, loop and slot antenna on their complexity and expected radio noise interference. The prototype is exposed to a test setup in which the surface temperature, and magnetic ﬁeld, is measured. The reliability of communication is evaluated by analyzing the amount of send and received packages.In case of an increased transport capacity the conductor temperature of an overhead line mostly increase by Joule heating. For a conductor temperature increase and concentrated weight the sag increases with negligible tents of centimeters. The maximum magnetic ﬁeld was calculated and resulted in a required shielding effectiveness. The thickness of shield was determined for each material to reduce the magnetic ﬁeld inside an enclosure. A slot antenna was designed and made in the prototype and compared with simulations in respect to the reﬂection coefﬁcient. The surface temperature of the prototype did barely gain heat by the generated induced currents. However the prototype does reduce the magnetic ﬁeld inside and conﬁrms the theory of low frequency magnetic shielding.

However, the vehicle-to-grid service cannot completely make up for the intermittent nature of renewables. Deterministic models were used to compute the extent to which the vehicles can engage in the vehicle-to-grid service in a smart city domain using the ‘Car as Power Plant’ model. The extent to which the vehicles can provide grid support in terms of energy valley filling is dependent on the method of selecting the vehicles for vehicle-to-grid and the nature of the load demand. Constraining algorithms limiting the extent of refuelling and recharging of the vehicles can help curtail import of hydrogen and power and spread the demand more evenly across the timeline, but also increase the waiting times during the same. An aggregator while coordinating vehicles for the vehicle-to-grid service may encounter some conflicts of interests with respect to ensuring equal vehicle-to-grid participation amongst its customers and investing in the supporting energy infrastructure. The setting of a minimum threshold fuel requirement for participating in vehicle-to-grid strongly relates to the effectiveness of the vehicle-to-grid service. There are some barriers for the adoption of vehicle-to-grid adoption such as competition from stationary batteries and its unreliability that is limiting its uptake. Additionally, the lack of mass uptake of battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles has not yet got the market participants interested to invest in the vehicle-to-grid technology.

It is not immediately evident at which scale the static and dynamic model should be formulated. Therefore, this thesis work attempts to determine a relevant spatial scale in reservoir simulation. The relevant spatial scale is subdivided into a static and dynamic spatial scale. The static one is analyzed using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A dominant basis-vector is determined which explains the predominant pattern in the reservoir model.

The distance from the finest uncertainty trajectory is used to quantify the coarsening effect on a dynamic level.

Foundation requirements for offshore structures have shifted because of this. The monolithic nature of windmills allows the use of a single open-ended steel pile as a foundation. While their installation procedure is similar to onshore piles, the dimensions of these open-ended piles are of a different scale, measuring up to 8 meters in diameter and 80 meters in length. The hydro mechanical response of the soil and the soil-structure interaction during the installation of the piles is complex and not yet fully understood. To better comprehend the soil behaviour during installation Royal IHC has initiated a research project in collaboration with the TU Delft. The current study is part of this research project. Using advanced physical and numerical modelling methods, a first step is made to gain better insight in the soil behaviour. <br/><br/>Using advanced physical centrifuge modelling techniques this study aims to provide insight into the soil behaviour and pile response during impact pile driving. The model can help validate numerical models and provide a controlled test environment for further modelling. To achieve this a new model impact pile driving setup was developed. This setup is capable of modelling the blow rate and impact energy of offshore pile driving hammers. A new data measurement system and sensor equipment was also created to capture parameters such as pore fluid pressure, blow rate, impact speed and pile displacement. Model piles can be installed in a controlled and repeatable environment. Special care has been taken to achieve correct coupling between the hydro mechanical response and the impact driving in the model.<br/><br/>Preliminary results from the model show no major scaling or modelling errors compared to numerical results. However validation of the model is needed and could be done by using a case study. The setup itself is operating efficiently and is highly adaptable for future research goals. The tests performed during this research were limited due to time constraints. Installation parameters such as pile displacement and pore fluid pressure development are in the range as expected. Furthermore, a correlation was seen between the radial distance from the pile tip and the increase of pore fluid pressure. Comparison of pile displacement with numerical models show similar results. Future studies should focus on varying impact pile driving parameters such as blow rate, blow energy and impact speed to define a correlation between the development of pore fluid pressure and impact pile driving parameters. This could improve the future efficiency of impact pile driving.

It was identified that this phenomenon advertised a Western-centric perspective since its birth in 1851. This means that its way of representing the world excluded and marginalized others. Furthermore, it implies that the model of the World Expo did not change over the past 150 years. So, the opportunity arose to develop an exposition of the world based on another model, for the sake of inclusion.<br/>The project took a position within decolonization theory, which is concerned with the disruption of any ideology of domination. At this point three guiding principles were articulated to lead the design: Interdependence, Multiplicity and Disruption. By using a design-based research method, the project developed from the interaction between theory and practice. In addition, it allowed two disciplines, Architecture and Science Communication, to consolidate in the course of the process.<br/>The design process resulted in Expo Mondo, a patio-pavilion located at numerous cities around the world, where it provides visitors a place to distance from everyday life. Facilitating both a place for self-reflection and an aesthetic experience. The architecture of Expo Mondo performs as a communication mean. This means that the architecture does not house an exhibition, but is the exposition itself. Expo Mondo aims to reveal unity in diversity, by exposing a context specific content through an universal architectural framework.<br/>The universal framework is made of the fundamental elements of architecture: the constructive elements. The patio-pavilion behaves autonomously in its context. In this way it allows itself to be familiar, and yet be distant to its surroundings. Furthermore, the framework takes a both/and approach with regard to spatial opposites. This is determined to be an inclusive approach, because it does not prioritizes one over the other. Instead, the opposites co-exist in a mutual relationship. Expo Mondo concerns, among others, the co-existence of the man-made and the natural, the open and the enclosed, the classical and the neoplastic, the individual and the communal.<br/>Expo Mondo fosters diversity. The design triggers visitors to give multiple interpretations to Expo Mondo, and it allows different types of use. In this way it appeals to various individuals. Furthermore, the content - its nature, sculptures, and visitors - adapts to correspond to local conditions. Hence, the patio-pavilion fits the community and the climate in which it is implemented. As follows, it exposes the local culture. To leave room for interpretation the design of Expo Mondo is left open to some extend. The purpose of patio-pavilion is not mentioned in advance, only the name Expo Mondo is apparent. Additional information on the patio-pavilion can be looked up by visitors on the internet. <br/>Three focus groups were done to test the design of Expo Mondo. The participants represented three different groups of potential visitors. The results were related to the guiding principles of the design. The findings shows that the participants give different interpretations to Expo Mondo, and that not all intentions are recognized. Furthermore, this research has mapped the design process. In this way it provides insight on the integration of two disciplines, theory and practice in one research project. The design-based research method allowed for this integration to happen. The integration already started at an abstract level with the guiding principles. <br/>Lastly, the report concludes by answering main research question, interpreting the findings and discussing the limitations of the research.<br/><br/>This master thesis is the result of a joint graduation project in partial fulfilment of my masters in Architecture and Science Communication, as part of a double degree master program at Delft University of Technology.

The navigation capacity of the Valdivia river mainly determines the present state and future possibilities for the welfare of the city. Since sedimentation problems arose in the river, the capacity for navigation became limited. The ministry of Valdivia therefore desires a solution for this problem in order to create possibilities for future growth. However, it is not known to what extent solutions for the sedimentation problem will actually contribute to an increase of welfare. By identifying the problem for the Ministry of Public Works of Chile, the boundaries and goal of the project could be set. In this research an attempt is made to answer the following research question: How can the surplus of sediment in the Valdivia river be remedied and to what extent will this contribute to the economic and social values of the city of Valdivia? In order to know how to remedy the surplus of sediment, a qualitative analysis of probable causes of the sedimentation was necessary. The main subjects which were researched by means of data and literature are tidal influence, river discharges, sediment composition and salt intrusion. With this knowledge it was concluded that the directions and magnitudes of flow lines in the river system can give good indications on what locations sedimentation can occur. The interaction between tidal currents and river discharges are the main drivers behind these flow characteristics. To verify the theoretical analysis, a basic Delft3D model was set up containing only tidal movement and river discharges. The pattern of the flow lines which was obtained from the Delft3D model supports the possibility that sedimentation occurs on the current identified sedimentation locations. Although other hydrological and morphological processes were found to possibly influence sedimentation rates in the river, qualitative data for studying these processes were missing. The current Delft3D model is therefore a good result regarding the available data and can be seen as a part of preliminary research in order to support further studies. Because the exact causes of the sedimentation were not identified in this research, it was not possible to come up with suitable solutions and to research how these solutions could affect the system. However, in order to gain insight in the effects of a river system without sedimentation problems, a fictitious scenario was studied by means of a social cost benefit analysis. The goal of the social costs and benefits analysis was to give insight in what factors should be taken into account when considering a project plan which solves the sedimentation problem. A dredging design was made in order to make the Valdivia river navigable for larger cargo vessels to increase the trading capacity of Valdivia. This dredging design comprises the deepening of the Valdivia river to a minimum water depth of 10 meters. Considering investment and maintenance costs of the dredging activities of this magnitude, it is concluded that the costs are not profitable compared to the social and economic effects of a higher traffic intensity on the river. With the social costs and benefits analysis all effects of solving the sedimentation problem are inventoried. When the Delft3D model can identify what the remedy of the sedimentation could be, the impact on the economic and social values of Valdivia can be determined. This research was not sufficient to answer the research question. Both the Delft3D model and the SCBA model were lacking accurate and reliable data. To expand this research, it is necessary to collect the data of which an overview has been made. Therefore, this research can serve as a preliminary study for further research. It is recommended that after data collection, solutions will be identified which can solve the sedimentation problem. These solutions need to be compared with a scenario analysis in order to decide on which is the most suitable solution for the sedimentation problem. Besides this, it is advised to research whether it is actually necessary to expand the river for transport when looking at all actors involved.","sedimentation; valdivia; export; port","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Project","-39.818677, -73.234446"

Prior to the development and implementation of fracture modules in FEM solvers, most studies were constrained to simple geometries and load cases. The set of parametric studies that constitute this thesis aims to partially fill this knowledge gap by studying the fracture behavior of air-plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings (APS-TBCs) using cohesive zone modelling (CZM) in conjunction with FEM. Two-dimensional projections of the TBC microstructures were developed and subjected to a thermomechanical analysis involving thermal strains between the different components of the TBC system. The parametric study was split into three sections. The preliminary study, set O, was executed to discern the most appropriate set of boundary conditions that would produce realistic crack patterns in an expedient manner. Set A and Set B studied the fracture behaviour of conventional TBCs and the recently developed self-healing TBC composite, comprised of lamellae and pores and for Set B, self-healing particles. Qualitative observations reveal the influence of feature dimensions and relative placement to one another. The results appear to indicate that TBC top-coats that are comprised of finer lamellae exhibit higher fracture resistance on both conventional and self-healing systems, and that smaller particles in self-healing systems mitigate damage caused by pores less than larger particles.","fracture behaviour; Self-healing; coatings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In the dredging industry, centrifugal pumps are most commonly used and selected based on their operational capacities and expected slurry characteristics. The handling capacity of a centrifugal pump is however supplied for handling water and cannot be applied to other slurry conditions without an applicable correction. For handling Newtonian fluids there exist a well established de-rating method by {HI1983} and further improved until most recently {ANSI2015} was obtained. For non-Newtonian fluids however, no such generally accepted method exist, especially not for large centrifugal pumps as encountered in the dredging industry. In order to obtain a de-rating prediction for non-Newtonian fluids, researchers have tried to predict pump de-rating by applying the {HI1983} method. This is only possible if all fluid characteristics of a non-Newtonian fluid are summarized into a single value as used to characterise a Newtonian fluid. Several approaches are suggested by \cite{Walker1984}, \cite{Graham2009} and others. Dependant on which non-Newtonian parameter was found to be governing, apparent viscosities, Bingham plastic viscosity, and limiting viscosity were used in time.<br/><br/>Because all methods developed until today are based on small centrifugal pumps handling a mixture with a constant rheological behaviour, validity on centrifugal pumps with larger impellers and additional features as cover flushing cannot be guaranteed. Therefore the aim of this thesis research is to obtain a valid input parameter for a Newtonian de-rating method to predict the pump performance when handling a non-Newtonian fluid and determine the validity for large centrifugal pumps. To achieve this research goal, a measurement campaign on board the Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger `Pallieter' of DEME - Dredging International NV, working in a viscous environment was carried out. Measurement data for pump head, power and efficiency were obtained by installing a torque measurement device. Additional a device was installed to measure the dissolved gas volume fraction in order to separate effects caused by increased viscosity from multi-phase flow problems. After measurement data is obtained, available de-rating methods are compared and conclusions are drawn with respect to applicability.<br/><br/>Dissolved air in the mixture is of significant influence on the complete pumping process. After filtering the data to remain with performance data only influenced by the higher viscosity, de-rating models are analysed. Head showed very little to none de-rating when a viscous mixture was handled. At lower viscosities the de-rating method showed little deviation from the theoretical pump head, only at higher viscosities a significant de-rating was predicted but measurements didn't confirmed this. The same effects as for head yields for power. Significant de-rating was expected at high viscosities but measurements contradict this phenomenon. Although the Bingham plastic viscosity is the most conservative characterisation of a non-Newtonian viscosity, over-prediction still exist at high viscosities. This is most probable caused by the absence of viscous material in the axial gap between impeller and casing which in turn result in much less disk friction losses as would be expected.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-16","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Minimally invasive methods like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) show a high treating potential as well as low costs, short hospital stay and fast recovery. However, their success rate is limited due to their mechanical force transmission, often leading to inability of crossing the hard proximal cap of the CTO. This study focuses on a promising non-mechanical concept for treating CTO using PCI. The proposed idea is based on energy transmission via hydraulic pressure waves in a liquid filled catheter tube. The aim of this project is to conduct a feasibility study for treating CTO by simulating a realistic situation based on the proposed concept. The first stage involved understanding the existing setup and dealing with its flaws and limitations. After the setup was improved and made appropriate for systematic experiments, a realistic scenario was simulated in the lab which led to a drop in force efficiency to one tenth of its original value, a useful result for estimating the required input force to puncture a real CTO. A CTO model was manufactured using gelatin and hydroxyapataite powder. In the final tests, the device was used to puncture effectively the CTO and demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in an ex vivo situation. Only one strike was enough to puncture the soft proximal caps whereas 2 to 4 strikes were needed for the hard caps. The input peak force was set to \SI{36}{N}. Finally, the sensing capabilities of the device were explored with the purpose of getting information on the compliance of the target in contact with the output tip of the catheter.","Coronary artery disease; Chronic total occlusion; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Interventional cardiology; Hydraulic pressure wave; Biomedical device; Catheter; Load cell response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The eye movement and gaze angle tracking system should be able to monitor in real time the eye position and orientation (6 degree of freedom) to exactly localize the tumor location inside the eye with respect to the proton beam. The system should also immediately switch the beam off if the tumor goes out of the irradiated area to protect vital organs and keep the non affected cells healthy. The non-invasive eye-tracking system will replace the painful surgical procedure of implantation of radio-opaque tantalum clips on the eye. In order to estimate accurately enough the eye gaze angle and torsion, a stereo imaging system consisting of two high-resolution imaging cameras and two infra-red beacons can be used. The six coordinates of the eye are extracted by image analysis of the acquired stereo camera images using the beacons reflections (glints) and location of the eye pupil. The accuracy of the method can be affected by motion artifacts and difficulty of pupil segmentation in some eyes. Further, the method is inclusive to cyclo-torsion (rotation of the eye about its optical axis). The eye-tracking system can thus benefit from motion artifacts suppression and implementation of analysis of the eye surface features, e.g. iris pattern. Another addition is to use steerable mounts and mirrors to improve measurements and, thus, eye tracking accuracy.

Most of the current studies with successful CS reconstruction are mainly focusing on the mathematical applications of CS theory in ultrasound imaging. However, the randomized mechanisms in these studies are hard to be fully fulfilled in hardware. In addition, some of the studies try to discover the sparse representation of signals by ignoring a part of information rather than compressing all data. We propose a new compression scheme for fast image acquisition in ultrasound imaging using a method, which is similar in style to CS. Our scheme is based on the formulation of an inverse scattering problem (ISP), where the Born approximation have been used during its derivation. In our system, the ultrasound image are represented by a collection of hypothetical points, what can be called pixels. These points are identified by their unique spatial impulse responses relative to the elements in the transducer. The randomized linear combinations of the spatial impulse responses from the view of elements can be maintained the uniquenesses of these points, which is similar to the coding techniques in data compression. Hence, our compression scheme can be more controllable than the conventional CS, which can achieve the real-time compression of data during the acquisition stage in hardware. We employ L2-regularization to solve the ill-posed ISP rather than the L1-regularization CS since there is no any assumption of signal sparsity. In our work, we finally achieve the acceptable reconstructions by compressing the raw data to 12.5% of its original size. The results are better than 12.5% with multiplexing the received signals from 12.5% elements in the array and almost as good as 25% with multiplexing the received signals from 25% elements in the array.","compressive sampling; ultrasound imaging; semi-controllable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With time, these pigments degrade to form colourless arsenic oxide. Different oxidation states of arsenic (+3 and +5) in the degradation products have been recently found. Moreover, they have been identified throughout the whole painting layout from the panel until the varnish, suggesting the migration of degradation products through the paint layers. Besides changing the aspect, they might change the stability of the painting or painted object. Furthermore, they might represent a potential hazard for conservators when dealing with the work of art. Since a painting is in equilibrium with its environment, there is always water in motion inside the painting. It is therefore believed that the degradation products are migrating via water. However, the migration mechanism is still not well understood. This thesis aims to provide a better insight into the diffusion process of arsenites (As+3) and arsenates (As+5) in materials commonly found in paintings. For this, two different approaches were followed: <br/><br/>In one hand, light aged painting reconstructions were analysed with FTIR microscopy and SEM-EDS to asses the effect of different grounds and relative humidity on the migration of arsenic. In all the samples, degradation products were found in the orpiment layer based on the As-O vibration, detected with FTIR microscopy. It was possible to identify arsenic in the ground layer close to the orpiment-ground interface for all samples with both techniques. However, due to the low intensity and the proximity to the interface of the arsenic found in the grounds, no conclusions could be drawn about its migration. <br/><br/>On the other hand, in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and EIS measurements were performed on a set of samples to analyse the water, arsenates and arsenites diffusion through oil and two varnishes (dammar and mastic). The diffusion coefficients of water in oil, dammar and mastic were determined with both techniques. It was found that the water diffuses faster in oil than in the two varnishes. Despite being similar, mastic was found to be less stable than dammar since a decrease in its barrier properties with time was found. The diffusion of arsenates and arsenites in dammar and mastic was studied by EIS and the diffusion coefficients were calculated for the first time. It was found that the diffusion of arsenites in the coatings is faster than arsenates, which is in accordance to the diffusion of these species in water. EIS resulted in a promising technique in the study of diffusion of ions in coatings. Although further research is needed to fully understand the migration mechanism of arsenic in painting systems, this thesis provides a useful insight and a methodology with which the water and ion transport in coatings can be studied.","Arsenic; Painitng; Diffusion; EIS; Orpiment; Realgar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, the geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics of the Río Colorado fluvial system were used as a modern analogue to determine how the river avulsion process has generated the current fluvial topography and why its repetition has developed a vertical stacking pattern of thin but laterally extensive layers.<br/>Differential Global Positioning System data, Google Earth Pro Imagery, and previous studies focused on the evolution analysis of river positions in this region, allowed the observation of multiple repetitions of avulsion river in an area of approximately 400 km2, describing the fluvial sediments on top of the lacustrine deposits and representing alluvial ridges with an average width of 1500 m. Moreover, a thickness variation between the fluvial and lacustrine deposits up to 2 meters was recognised over 25 km, and a very gentle gradient slope, from 0.02° at the apex of the fluvial fan to 0.0022° in the flattened section towards the Salar de Uyuni.<br/>Borehole data from the West Netherlands Basin and surface data from the Río Colorado were integrated to construct a three-dimensional model that represents the characteristics of the fluvial deposits regarding geobody size, geometry, and potential connectivity.

Four different nozzle length configurations with and without the presence of a supersonic exhaust plume have been tested. Testing with different nozzle length configuration resulted in flow cases where the shear layer reattachment occurred on the nozzle (solid reattachment), on the flow downstream of the nozzle (fluidic reattachment), and intermittently on the nozzle and on the flow (hybrid reattachment). A qualitative identification of the effect of exhaust plume and the variation in nozzle length on the flow topology on the wake of axisymmetric backward facing step model, at the above mentioned conditions, is successfully described by means of Schlieren visualization. The topological flow features for the subsonic and supersonic flow cases has been identified (i.e shock waves, Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan, boundary layer, separated shear layer, recompression and plume shocks). On the other hand, a quantitative identification of the effect of exhaust plume and the variation in nozzle length on the flow topology and mean pressure distribution on the wake of axisymmetric backward facing step model, at the above mentioned conditions, is successfully done by means of planar PIV. The planar PIV measurements in the wake region of the model provided detailed information of the mean flow field properties (i.e mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stresses and reverse flow). Using these mean flow field properties data, the mean pressure distribution is reconstructed based on the momentum equation.It has been shown that an increase in nozzle length and the presence of an exhaust plume caused an increase in mean reattachment length at freestream Mach number of 2.20, while no significant change in mean reattachment length was noticed at freestream Mach number of 0.76. Significantly higher turbulent kinetic energy levels have been observed for L/D = 1.8 cases where solid reattachment occurred, at freestream Mach number of 2.20. In contrast to supersonic flow cases, the flow cases at freestream Mach number of 0.76 showed a significantly lower turbulent kinetic energy levels. Comparisons of flow cases with a long nozzle without a plume and flow cases with a short nozzle but with a plume suggest that the presence of the plume cannot accurately be modeled by replacing the plume with a solid geometry. From the pressure results it is observed that the location of the low-pressure region downstream of the base remained unchanged for different flow cases with and without exhaust plume and for different nozzle lengths. Furthermore, it has been shown that an increase in nozzle length leads to higher local pressure at the nozzle exit and hence results in a less under-expanded for the supersonic flow cases or more over-expanded plume for the subsonic cases.","Space launcher base flow; Aerodynamics; experimental; PIV; Schlieren; buffet; shock wave; Transonic and supersonic wake; Base-nozzle flow interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As LoRa utilizes the license-free ISM-bands, many network providers have deployed their LoRa networks that adhere to the LoRaWAN specification. With so many deployed networks, it is likely that devices belonging to neighboring networks will interfere and lead to increased packet loss due to collisions. However, not all colliding frames attribute to packet loss, because of the capture effect in LoRa.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we investigate the performance of LoRaWAN, particularly on frame collision and packet loss, through small-scale measurements, which is then followed by the evaluation in a large-scale setup involving multiple gateways. It is expected that adding more gateways can reduce packet loss. By estimating the Data Extraction Rate (DER) from the measurements and validating the result with simulations, we found that adding more gateways, to some extent, does improve the DER when the capture effect is considered. However, downlink traffic can significantly decrease DER of a single gateway as the currently available gateways operate in half-duplex mode. The impact of different spreading factor parameters to the network performance is also evaluated.<br/><br/>We also characterize and evaluate the two major LoRaWAN networks in the Netherlands, namely The Things Network (TTN) and KPN, which respectively represent the crowdsourced and commercial usage of LoRaWAN networks.

This project was called ‘Homies’. In order to achieve their goal of reducing burglary costs, the Homies team created a concept for an in-home alarm system that warns a network of neighbours, family and friends through messaging service WhatsApp whenever it is triggered. Homies’ working method is based on the ‘Lean Startup’ method: their aim was to start as soon as possible with releasing ‘minimum viable products’ (MVPs) to their (potential) customers and end users. Housing corporation Ymere agreed to participate in pilots, and facilitated the contact with its tenants. For this graduation project, I was able to use Homies’ pilots to test my own interventions and gather insights.<br/><br/>Context<br/>Break-in-and-entering in homes is a problem of substantial size in the Netherlands, in which socially deprived neighbourhoods suffer disproportionally. There are many stakeholders that are negatively affected by it, among whom victims and their neighbourhoods, governmental institutions, insurers and housing corporations. From my research on how Homies could address this problem, I discerned three major challenges:<br/>1. Decreasing damages from break-in and burglary<br/>2. Availability for social tenants<br/>3. Promoting social cohesion<br/><br/>Research process<br/>As the Homies concept was already being developed and tested in a pilot at the start of my graduation project, it seemed worthwhile to research the prototype in use, as well as its pilot users. My process consisted of interviews, observations, interventions, simulations with end users and creative sessions. The insights that I gained during this research, were in some cases directly used to alter the Homies concept and prototype (MVP). At the end of this process, I had contributed to an increase in the amount of neighbours that are warned for each alarm from less than one to 5 on average, helped boost the responsiveness of neighbours after an alarm fired and reduce the average time it took to assess if it was false alarm to below three minutes in 90% of the cases.<br/><br/>Key redesign factors<br/>My research led me to believe that Homies’ mission and vision for its product and service have clear merits, but there are many factors that could impede success. I defined five key redesign factors, based on my research insights. I addressed these in a redesign for Homies’ service, that focuses mostly on a new interface that is meant to replace WhatsApp.<br/>1. Guide users through alarm situations<br/>Departing from the very limited possibilities for guiding alarm situations in WhatsApp, creating a new interface for users during alarm situations opens up many opportunities for Homies to guide their users in the best possible way. The redesign was specifically made to only give each user information that is relevant to them in that exact moment, and to suggest very specific actions that would lead to effective follow-up. Each view of the app is specifically designed to guide the user in taking their next step. As a significant part of the target group (social tenants) are low-literate, have little experience with technology and mobile phones and are insecure about their capabilities, I aimed for a design with decreased dependence on reading and writing skills, opting to always give users a few clear options for their next action, enhanced with as many visual cues as possible.<br/>2. Provide better insight and oversight for users and Homies<br/>By creating a new interface, social translucence can be taken into account specifically. Users will then be better able to work together and account for each other’s needs in the situation. Next to this, each button-press or other interaction within the concept can be captured by Homies and used towards understanding both user behaviour and the specific conditions of each alarm situation, which can be of great value for improving their service: the behaviour of individual users can be tracked back in more detail. Additionally, all aggregated data can be used to show trends and patterns in both user behaviour and alarm situation specifics. Homies can collect statistics on user, home and neighbourhood level and build a system of positive reinforcement for its end users around improving scores.<br/>3. Reduce dependence on third party apps<br/>Progressive web apps (PWAs) have the potential to solve Homies’ WhatsApp dependency and improving the alarm follow-up user experience, while also omitting the necessity for a native Homies app for each different smartphone OS. <br/>4. Show users the value of Homies as integral part of the user journey<br/>This custom interface that guides users better during the alarm situation, can easily be used during the onboarding process to simulate alarm situations. These simulations could provide a perfect environment for users to be prepared for alarm situations.<br/>5. Engage users effectively over long time spans<br/>It is important to keep users effectively engaged throughout their Homies membership, as it is important that, in each alarm situation, enough alarm group members engage in follow-up behaviour, otherwise Homies can’t effectively decrease burglary and fire damages. The onboarding process is designed following the effective engagement model that Yardley et al. (2016) propose: behaviour change is mediated by the digital behaviour change intervention (DBCI), where in the first phase, the DBCI prepares the user for behaviour change in a set of ‘micro’ level moment-to-moment engagements that keep the user come back to the DBCI. Throughout these micro level engagements, the DBCI aims to get the user to identify and engage with the larger intervention goals, which reinforce the user’s motivation to keep engaged on the micro level. The combination of these levels of engagement can then in turn bring the behaviour change about, onto a point where continued engagement with the DBCI is not necessary to keep the behaviour change.","design; IOT; social cohesion; lean development; app; liveability; neighbourhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Different technologies on energy production, solar, wind, tidal, geothermic, etc., have been researched with the additional challenge of how to store it.<br/>From the different types of energy, heat represents a basic need in countries where the climate conditions lead to long and cold periods, namely countries at high latitudes where a big part of the produced energy is destined to household and district heating.<br/>The Academy of Finland implemented the New Solar Community Concept project to research the development and application of alternative technologies for production and storage of energy. The use of the local geological domains has been considered as a possible solution for seasonal and long-term energy storage, specifically heat. Aalto University participates in Tackling the challenges of a Solar-Community Concept in High Latitudes by researching the seasonal storage of thermal energy in the ground simulating and assessing thermal flow for different borehole heat exchangers arrays.<br/>To do this, numerical models have been implemented, special attention to the Weak Form Equations (WFE) and the Heat Transfer in Pipes (HTiP) models. These models are evaluated using the COSMOL® Multiphysics software, each of them with advantages and disadvantages over the other.<br/>An in situ experiment has been performed in Aalto’s research tunnel to validate the results of the numerical models. The aim of the experiment was to assess the performance of the models based on the result comparison between the simulated and the observed data under controlled conditions.<br/>The experiment consisted of a single U-pipe borehole heat exchanger operating under seasonal conditions. Two phases were defined, heating and cooling. In the first phase, a constant heat flux is provided to the rock by circulating a heated carrier fluid in the BHE. In the second phase, the circulation is stopped allowing the rock to cool down under normal conditions. The heat field in the rock was tracked with a monitoring borehole one meter away from the heat source. Several digital temperature sensors were installed at the monitoring point in customized equipment referred in this work as Thermal Multisensor Probes for this purpose. <br/>The comparison made between model and observed results returned an acceptable accuracy of the predicted values of the models for the heat flow in the rock mass. Additionally, it was identified the WFE model can be improved by calibrating the borehole thermal resistance parameter in the equations, parameter that must come from experimental data. Finally, it was seen that the few discontinuities present across the boreholes had a low impact on the flow of heat through the rock for this experiment.<br/>Currently, the tuning of the numerical models is being performed at Aalto University by increasing the weight of different parameters in the models matching the results of the experimentation process.","Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE); numerical modelling; model validation; in situ experiment; heat flow; seasonal storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tackling the Challenges of a Solar Community Concept in High Latitudes",""

Various parties target at developing a radar which is able to detect wave trains. This deterministic wave forecast can be used to forecast vessel motions up to several minutes ahead. With such a forecast a quiescent period can be searched for, where ship motions are at a minimum. Possible advantages considered for a heavy lift operation are: Safer operations, less waiting on weather and extended lifetime of equipment. With the use of the Heerema Simulation Center (HSC), the possibilities to extend a deterministic wave forecast into a motion forecast is investigated. Thewave components are known in the HSC, so a perfect wave radar is available and the focus is entirely on (1) predicting motions and (2) presenting it in a useful way. The first part of the objective is approached by investigating the possibilities and limitations of making a motion forecast in the frequency domain. This method is convenient since the calculation is easy to understand and very fast, a quality which is most wanted when making a future prediction. To quantify the quality of a wave- andmotion forecast, the correlation coefficient (½) and RMS ratio (¾) are used (forecastedvs logged motion). The model showed good results for heave roll and pitch (½ 0.85 - 1.0, ¾ 0.86 - 1.15) for mild, severe and complex sea-states (all wave directions, respectively). For extreme swell a forecast could not be made. This can be explained by the fact that when motions become larger, a frequency domain approach is no longer valid. However, it should be noted that it is very unlikely a lift operation will take place with Hs &gt; 2m. The sensitivity of themodel to variations in the center of gravity and radii of gyration of the vessel (model input), is found to be within acceptable bounds. The impact is negligible on the phase and small (&lt;10%) on the amplitude of the forecast. With data offshore available with an accuracy of +- 2m, this is acceptable. Two test cases are investigated. A single crane lift (1000 mT module) and a dual crane (7000 mT module). In both cases the model proved to be well capable of forecasting themotion of interest (Heave) of the module (relative to a fixed and floating platform). The second part of the objective has a more qualitative character, where the use of a forecast is tested in the HSC by using a tool that is created for this purpose: the VirtualWave Radar Tool (VWRT). This tool is able to make and display a forecast in the HSC. The tests executed in the HSC showed positive results for the use of a forecast in the crane cabin during a lift operation. A reduction of secondary impact loads in a challenging environment was realized due to the use of the VWRT. Furthermore, a forecasted time span of two minutes (current performance of wave radars on the marked) proved to be long enough to benefit from during a lift operation. The tool demonstrated that simplicity of the dashboard is key and should be understandable at a glance. With many possible sources causing a forecast to deviate from the actual motion, a self learning, optimization model could reduce the need for exact model input offshore (not always available), even without knowing the source of deviation. v","Deterministic wave prediction; Waveradar; Deterministic motion prediction; Decision support tool; Heavy Lift Vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

These acoustic emission waves are the result of the sudden stress release during the nucleation of the crack surface. Using dedicated acoustic emission monitoring equipment, these waves can be recorded. When multiple sensors are able to pick up the waves of a certain fatigue crack growth step, the location of this crack can be determined by using the differences in time of arrival of the signals at these sensor locations. This localization is performed by the method of multilateration, which is the same method that is used to calculate the epicentre of earthquakes.<br/><br/>TU Delft and the 4D-Fatigue joint industry project will use acoustic emission to predict fatigue crack depth, in order to determine the crack growth rate in a multi-axial fatigue loaded test specimen. The location of the fatigue crack will be known, so sensors can be applied very close to it. This use of acoustic emission is unconventional due to the fact that most appliances focus on a much larger scale, since this is one of the advantages of this method. The accuracy goal which is set during this project is also far exceeding traditional use, aiming at a crack depth prediction with an error less than 1mm. Little literature on acoustic emission focuses on this close range, inducing the need for additional research. <br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to perform finite element simulations, in order to determine the behaviour of acoustic emission waves in close proximity of the crack. This knowledge should be used to determine what accuracy values are achievable, and whether there are ways to improve on this accuracy.<br/><br/>The first step in order to achieve this goal was the simulation of a Hsu-Nielsen source, more commonly referred to as a pencil lead break. This is a very simple to perform acoustic emission source, and will serve to establish appropriate finite element simulation parameters. This simple first step is also convenient to establish the effect the acoustic emission monitoring equipment has on the obtained signals. The multiple filter steps which are performed by the hardware, and the frequency response of the sensor have a great influence on the signal. Pencil lead breaks were performed on a steel plate of 5mm thickness, at several distances of a sensor. Signals produced by the simulations were verified by the experimental signals in a range of 5mm-70mm, verifying the used simulation methods.<br/><br/>The next step was to simulate actual fatigue growth in the same steel plate of 5mm thickness. Experimental signals were attempted to be acquired during fatigue tests of the plate. The fatigue machine that was used however, turned out to produce high amplitude noise, making it not possible to obtain the desired signals. Since verification of the simulated signals would not be possible, several source models were investigated in order to simulate fatigue crack growth acoustic emission, comparing the localization results with each other. Localization using conventional methods were able to achieve an accuracy of 0.6mm. Using a new method of wave speed determination however, which makes use of the simulation results, the localization accuracy was improved to 0.4mm.<br/><br/><br/>The final step was to perform a simulation of a specimen which is used by the 4D-Fatigue JIP. This tubular specimen contains flanges, which reflect inbound waves back to the sensors, potentially influencing the localization accuracy. The simulations however, concluded that these reflections arrive after the initial wave has passed. The effect on localization was found to be negligible. Localization using conventional methods was not found result in reliable data. This decrease in accuracy compared to the accuracy found in the 5mm plate, is attributed to the larger differences in travel distance the signals have, due to the 10mm thick body of the tubular specimen. Localization using the new speed determination method, resulted in a localization accuracy of approximately 1mm.<br/><br/>Although localization accuracy was found to be sufficient to satisfy the initial goal of 1mm, it should be noted that the localization was performed using an estimated noise amplitude value. Also, during these numerical simulations the sensor is exactly known, which is not the case during experiments, so additional location error should be taken into account. The work in this thesis does however describe multiple phenomena which influence the localization accuracy, and forms basis for further research to improve on it.","Acoustic Emission; Finite Element Method; Fatigue; Localization; Non-destructive testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","4D-Fatigue",""

Proper management is therefore urgent. While drawdown flushing is considered an effective method to remove sediments from the reservoir, the increased sediment flux has an impact on the downstream environment. On the short term, several species suffer high mortality rates due to increased turbidity. Also on the long term the impacts might be significant. The deposition of fine sediments can change the habitat suitability and thereby jeopardize the conditions for recovery. <br/><br/>The aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of different flushing operation scenarios on the physical habitats at the ecologically relevant meso-scale. An idealised, depth-averaged hydro-morphodynamic model is set up in Delft3D-Flow, a modelling software package developed by Deltares. The model represents a reach of the Avisio, a river situated in the Eastern Italian Alps. Across this river, the Pezzè dam was built in 1952, trapping all incoming sediments. Every three years the dam is flushed, which gained more public attention over the last years. A specific reach was chosen as a reference case as it consists of a channel bar topography where fine sediments accumulate up to ten times more during a flushing event than in other, more channelised reaches. It is therefore considered the most affected by the flushing event. The reach has a length of roughly a kilometre and is situated 10 kilometres downstream of the dam. <br/><br/>The hydro-morphodynamic model assumes a non-erodible bed, as the coarsened river bed is not expected to move significantly during a flushing event. This bed has the shape of an alternate bar topography. The simulation of the flushing event is simplified as an influx of bed load transport with a fraction size of one millimetre, and a magnitude close to the equilibrium transport capacity. Deposition occurs upstream and to a higher extent downstream of the bars, where flow velocities are low and secondary flow aids the movement of sediments into these areas. Subsequently, a clean water peak is imposed to investigate its effectiveness in removing the fine sediments from the reach. The hydrograph of this peak is varied in shape, duration and magnitude to simulate different operation scenarios and natural rainfall runoff events.<br/><br/>By applying the Mesohabitat Evaluation Model (MEM), a habitat suitability model developed for the meso-scale, it was possible to divide the reach into classes based on flow velocity, flow depth and shear stress. Such classification highly depends on the governing discharge. The classes are mainly distinctive by the division between high and low energy classes and in this way show a high correlation to the deposition of fines. The model suggests that fine sediments remain in the system only when low energy classes are present. Although the MEM classification aims at the meso-scale, it follows a micro-scale approach and therefore undermines the advantages of assessment at the ecologically more relevant meso-scale. It is recommended to develop the MEM-procedure by accounting for neighbouring computational cells.<br/><br/>The MEM-procedure gives an useful indication of the spatial variety in deposition and erosion patterns. It however does not provide insight into the implications of sedimentation to the ecology, without the coupling with a biological model. Such a biological model describes the suitability of the physical habitat for a specific organism and thereby incorporates a functional goal. <br/><br/>As such a biological model could, due to time restrictions, not be applied in this research it was chosen to perform a micro-scale based suitability study. This illustrates the potential of morphodynamic modelling as a tool for habitat suitability modelling. Simplified preference curves were derived for spawning trout, of which the physical habitat requirements are sensitive to the deposition of fine sediments. It was found that the deposition of fine sediments hardly effects this habitat. When required nonetheless, any considered peak flow recovers a substantial amount of suitable habitat. This implies that, if a clean water peak of a sufficient magnitude follows the flushing operation, the impact on the spawning habitat, and probably any habitat, is minimal. <br/><br/>Whether such a clean water peak occurs, can be partly controlled by the dam operation, but also depends on the hydrology of the catchment. A ten-year hydrological time series of the Avisio river, measured upstream of the dam, shows that the catchment of this reservoir does not provide sufficient water to guarantee a clean water peak during any season. However, with the significant contribution of two tributaries that flow into the Avisio river between the dam and the reference reach, it is highly probable that a peak flow of sufficient magnitude occurs during high flow season. To ensure the benefits of a clean water peak, it is recommended to plan the flushing event at the start of the high water season, which lasts from May to July. For other rivers, it might be possible to adopt such a clean water peak as part of the flushing operation strategy, providing a higher level of control. Even though this study suggests that the implications of the flushing event to the physical habitats are minimal, and of no comparison to the potential direct impacts, this method of evaluation shows potential to assess other morphological relevant events and even long term morphological changes. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","46.291506, 11.579227"

Because of its high precision, traceability and ease of use, the interferometer stands out for high precision measurements. However, the laser beam of an interferometer can be influenced by temperature and pressure fluctuations. Compensation of this error is possible by sensing temperature and pressure fluctuations while performing interferometric measurements. Alternatively, a refractometer running parallel with the interferometer can be used to do the same compensation with a higher accuracy. Additionally, errors caused by external sources such as vibrations, can be compensated by adopting a highly symmetrical design. Picodrift interferometer was developed and upgraded at VSL (Dutch Metrology Institute) as a calibration facility for high-precision sensors. First, the improved design of the picodrift interferometer is evaluated, implemented and tested allowing for a controlled measurement environment and high stability. The design requirements are determined to reduce the uncertainty caused by temperature and pressure fluctuations to picometer level in one hour. Based on those requirements, a vacuum system is implemented and tested to reach a pressure level in the ultra-high vacuum regime. During the implementation, necessary experiments and tests are performed to find leakages and the reasons for an undesired beam drift related to the pressure change. Additionally, an active temperature control system with passive shield is installed. Also, various kinematic coupling mount systems are designed and manufactured to provide a good positioning stability even in a noisy environment caused by a turbo pump. As the number of the interferometer channels has been doubled to perform measurements in both vacuum and atmospheric conditions, a well planned alignment procedure is developed to align the more sophisticated optical path. To characterize the performance of the new interferometer, a dead path measurement is performed. Second, to take advantage of the high precision and traceability, the interferometer is expanded to work as a calibration facility for external sensors of different sizes. A stable symmetrical calibration setup is designed to fit in a limited space for external measurements while minimizing uncertainty caused by temperature fluctuation and misalignment. An alignment procedure for the setup is developed. Eventually an example calibration is performed. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This hypothesis was based on the findings of previous researches, which concluded that risk management is either non-existing (Scholten 2007) or has to be completely developed as part of project steering and control (Taskforce 2010). The overriding conclusion in this thesis is that risk management is currently part of integral project management at the WS. The history and the resulting culture results in a risk aware organisation in which the necessity and importance of performing risk management in projects is naturally understood. In all projects analyzed, elements of risk management were identified. Risks were assessed from different perspectives, control measures were selected and performed and time and cost contingency for risk control were in place. Experts recognize that also other WS have (started to) professionalize(d) their entire project management practices. Especially those WS that participated in large projects for the program ‘Ruimte voor de rivier’ have already professionalized and also WS that are now conducting large projects in the High Water Protection Program (HWBP) are in the process of professionalizing their project management practices including includes risk management.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Future space exploration missions on solar system bodies will require landing safely and precisely, with an accuracy of ~100 m at touchdown. This accomplishment is made challenging by vehicle design limitations, the dearth of onboard situational awareness, and the limited knowledge of the variability of the landing terrain. To date, only the Chinese Chang’e-3 has implemented hazard detection and avoidance capabilities, within its Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&amp;C) subsystem, therefore being able to actively adjust its trajectory. On the contrary, the majority of the space landers only had the ability to execute autonomously a small series of simple and programmed commands. Therefore, past missions have essentially landed ""blind"" in regions deemed relatively safe, forcing landing site selection to be capability-limited rather than scientifically driven. In this thesis, hazard detection was investigated as a mean to increase autonomy for planetary landings and to further decrease the risk of a landing failure, employing equipment readily available on space missions. The analysis has been limited to the framework of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) where the input images are acquired from a single moving camera and thus the scene is reconstructed from the resulting video sequence. A software package was developed and tested to compute depth maps from adjacent descent images, captured at half altitude from one to the other. The basic pinhole camera model was selected to address the measurement taken from synthetic surface images, rendered in the Planet and Asteroid Natural scene Generation Utility (PANGU). To assess the hazardousness of the terrain, hazard maps are computed combining slope, roughness, and shadow information. In contrast to the results of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) NASA, it has been shown that rocks and boulders are not well resolved from shape recovery with both low- and high-elevation image pairs. Thus, their presence on the surface has been accounted through an adapted version of theHarris Corner detector directly on the input images. Two different mission scenarios were simulated: 1) a perfect vertical motion forward along the camera pointing direction and 2) a 45° angle dropping trajectory for a more realistic approaching descent phase, with a 40° imaging sensor line-of-site offset. Furthermore, the limitations of the developed algorithm were tested under ordinary operative conditions. For the former scenario, the results show that the overall quality of the recovered depth maps does not appear adequate enough for landing site selection. As a matter of fact, the locations around the image centre can not be correctly assessed. This represents a significant problem since these locations are the most convenient in terms of distance and guidance costs. On the contrary, the latter descent sequence indicates that below 300maltitude the software is a suitable candidate for hazard detection, with total correct detection on average &gt;94% and the percentage of undetected hazards below the allowable maximum 1%. To assess the algorithm robustness to errors in camera position, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed. Thereupon, random uncertainties within the interval [-0.5 0.5] meters were taken into account for the altitude of both camera poses. The errors for the computed Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are bounded to the maximum allowable only when both altitudes are affected by small deviation of similar magnitude and same sign (approximately 10 cm), peaking to 250%-300% increase for the other values of the considered interval. Moreover, concerning the robustness to errors in camera orientation, deviations of the camera pointing direction were considered only along the plane containing both the normal to the surface and the camera axis. Already differences greater than +0.05°, in the imaging sensor line-of-site, are responsible for exorbitant errors in the DEM for all altitudes. These results clearly indicate that the developed SfMalgorithmis not suitable as a stand-alone method for hazard detection and landing site selection.","Planetary Landings; Hazard Detection; Computer Vision; Structure-from-Motion; Passive sensors; PANGU; Digital Elevation Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","",""

The habitability condition, met for the liquid water layer covering the moon, yields to astonishing speculations concerning what might exist in the interior of the tiniest moon of Jupiter. The Voyager and Galileo programs detected a frozen and brittle layer, deeply battered by lineament features. The observed crevasses on the moon's icy surface can be considered as results of a strong and variating stress field applied to the brittle icy shell that eventually reaches critical deformation conditions locally, and favors the process of crevasse propagation. The superimposition of secular widening to diurnal components is the source of stress that continuously deforms the brittle surface of Europa and induces the ice to crack, similarly to the processes observed with crevasses in large terrestrial ice sheets. The research's aim is to improve the existing models of fracture propagation for the Europa ice shell, dealing with analogs observed in Earth's crevasses on large ice shelves, by the implementation and the usage of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Two different LEFM approaches are included in the document, one dealing with the estimation of global areas on the moon that are more favorable to host propagation and one dealing with the estimation of fractures' lengths for specific observed features. Results describe the existence of critical and non-critical areas centered in the equatorial zone which are respectively prone or not to host vertical propagation. Maximum critical depths for surface crevasses reach values of 120 meters, while critical heights for bottom crevasses show values up to 1.5 kilometers. Beside the outcomes of the vertical simulation, a mathematical manipulation of the LEFM analysis allowed the determination of horizontal cracks’ growth. Knowing the aspect of an observed lineament, the current model could calculate fracturing events’ intensity. These reach propagation rates of kilometers per second, namely almost instantaneous episodes. The outcomes of the current research are particularly interesting when seen in relation with the future exploration missions to Europa: ESA's JUICE, NASA Europa Clipper and its potential lander. Specific areas that are more prone to host propagation and the determination of growth rates are helpful elements in the preliminary description of target landing areas and the fracturing events’ detection possibility. The built model yields to a further and more accurate understanding of the dynamics for the interior of one of the most promising celestial object, in term of searching for a biosphere, hence extraterrestrial life.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In this process the temperature and pressure are raised above the critical point of water (374 C, 221 bar), creating a supercritical medium in which a high conversion and energetic efficiency of biomass to bio-syngas is realized. Due to these high efficiencies supercritical water gasification has received much attention as a potential treatment technique for sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants. <br/> To design a supercritical water gasification process kinetic models are used. They provide predictions on the decomposition products of the organic components of the biomass during treatment. However, kinetic data on lipids, which can make up to 25% of the organic matter in sewage sludge, are not available yet. This study aims to identify main reaction pathways and corresponding kinetic parameters that describe the decomposition of lipids in supercritical water.<br/><br/>Experiments were performed to provide data of decomposition products yields and find the dominant reaction pathways. Oleic acid was used as a model compound for lipids from sewage sludge. Experiments were conducted in a stainless steel batch reactor which was heated by immersion in a fluidized hot sand bath. Investigated temperatures and residence times were 400, 420, 460 and 520 C and 15, 35 and 65 min, respectively. Oleic acid feed concentration was 10 wt% and a pressure of 25 MPa was applied. <br/><br/>From experimental results the decomposition of oleic acid into aliphatic hydrocarbons and shorter chain fatty acids was identified. With increasing time and temperature these products would either gasify or the aliphatic hydrocarbons would dehydrogenate to cyclic and (poly)-aromatic compounds. A remarkably high selectivity towards the light hydrocarbon gases (C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6) compared to an earlier study into the decomposition of oleic acid in supercritical water was observed for all temperatures and residence times. <br/><br/>Parameters for a kinetic model, build up from the identified reaction paths, were fitted to the experimental data using Matlab. The Arrhenius equation was used to describe the reaction constants as function of temperature. For the oleic acid decomposition an activation energy of 151 kJ/mol was fitted first with a percentage output variation of 82% between 420 C and 520 C. Parameters for the other reactions were fitted using this activation energy as constraint.<br/> Qualitative trends on the gas and liquid decomposition products distribution over time and temperature were predicted well by the model, but predictions on the quantitative yield of them were concluded to be inaccurate. Largest differences between experimental and model yields were observed for CH4 and the light hydrocarbon gases. <br/><br/>One reason for these model errors is the scarcity of data points in the 0-15 min time-scale, where the process was highest in reactivity. Also some of the reaction pathways in the model might have been oversimplified, neglecting certain dominant decomposition reactions. <br","Supercritical water gasification; sewage sludge; lipids; oleic acid; kinetic modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Sustainable Process & Energy Technology","",""

Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) such geometric component variability can be converted into key parameter changes of aerothermal performance of the compressor. The aim of this thesis is to post-process the available component data and to quantify the geometric changes versus the nominal design using existing analysis tools already being applied in probabilistic assessments of compressor components. In a next step, a probabilistic investigation can be performed using the Rolls-Royce aerothermal analysis tool Hydra in order to quantify the impact of the component variability onto compressor aerothernmal performance. Doing so an assessment and analysis of key geometric component parameters onto compressor performance across the component life cycle can be done. The results show that there are sources of geometrical uncertainty of the blades throughout their life cycles. The beginning of life geometrical variability has been shown to be larger than the end of life geometrical variability. Furthermore, it has been shown that the geometrical variability due to operational wear is too small to be accurately captured by the current CFD evaluation methodology.

Amongst others due to the urbanisation and the increasing world population the real estate demand is growing. However, the current scarcity of workforce in the construction industry might become a huge issue in the future. In order to deal with the future real estate demand, the conventional construction industry needs to change. Although other industries are gratefully using newly developed technologies such as robots, innovations on the construction site are hardly used.<br/>Objective - This thesis aims to investigate how a business model of a Dutch construction company has to change to make on-site robots feasible. This research provides different strategies for construction companies to implement robots for the construction of row-houses, in order to deal with the emerging issues.<br/>Methods - This research is divided into three parts. The first section is a literature review providing an overview of currently developed robots, the status of the construction industry and the business models of construction companies. Secondly, an empirical part in which interviews are conducted to find out what the current business model of Dutch construction companies looks like. In addition, a case study in the dairy industry has been conducted as inspiration. In the final part, the operational section, all gained knowledge is combined and formulated as input values for the design of the adjusted business model. This is validated and complemented through a focus group with experts from the construction industry. For this research, the Business Model Canvas of Osterwalder and Pigneur is used as a framework. <br/>Results - Three different strategies are designed, based on the current business models of construction companies. These proposed models are adjusted to the input of the chosen robot, the case study in the dairy industry and the outcomes of the focus group. In the business model of the first strategy, the construction job is outsourced to a sub-contractor, who responsible for the operation of the robot. Within this model, minimal adjustments are needed for the construction company itself. However, this is the most expensive way to construct. In the second strategy, the robot is also implemented as key partner in the current business model, in this case not as sub-contractor but as a supplier. The robot is rented by the construction company from an external equipment party. This scenario will require adjustments of the current business model. Although this business model is less costly than the first model, it is still more expansive than currently used construction methods. The last strategy implies the purchase of a robot by the construction company itself. The impact/influence on the business model is shown for a worst and a best-case scenario. This strategy will cause several changes within the current business model, of which the most important is the robot as new key resource. The difference in costs depends on the worst or best scenario. The worst scenario, turned out to be the most expensive one, while the best scenario will just have minimal impact on the costs.<br/>Conclusions - Three different strategies are designed with matching business models for the implementation of on-site robots by construction companies. Therefore, it is impossible to develop one generic business models. Hence, the adjusted business models matching to the three possible strategies are based on a merged business model of all the participating construction companies. For each of the strategy, specific adjustments need to be made in the current business model. The first business model, in which the robot will be implemented by a sub-contractor turned out to be the most expensive scenario. Nevertheless, according to the practice, this will be the most promising scenario to start implementing robots. The fact that construction companies take a passive position towards innovations confirms the findings from the literature study that concludes that construction companies are described as traditional and conservative. However, when the urgency for the use construction robots grow, due to an increasing shortage of workforce, it is more likely that the last strategy will be implemented; the purchase of a robot by the construction company itself. This will be the most obvious one, regarding costs, efficiency<br","3D concrete printing robot; business model; business model canvas; Dutch construction companies; innovation; on-site robots; row-houses; construction process; residential; contractor; construction companies; robots; 3D printer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wind Turbine Manufacturers (WTMs) design their wind turbines for a lifetime of typically 25 years during which the structure has to withstand a large variety of loads, induced by wind- and wave conditions. To obtain a suitable design, numerous load calculations have to be performed for each design. A versatile approach is to use Reduced Order Models (ROMs) to restrict the computational effort that comes with<br/>these numerical techniques, which are also used in other industries (automotive, aerospace, etc. ). However, during the design process, structural changes are often applied. Since ROMs lack robustness with respect to these variations, this approach calls for a reconstruction of the ROM each time the initial model is changed, and the intensive calculation procedure has to be repeated afterwards.<br/>With the motivation to improve the limitations of ROMs and how they are used in engineering practice, a literature survey was performed on relevant Parametric Reduced Order Model (PROM) methodologies. Based on appropriate criteria in the context of a WTM’s design cycle, a methodology was selected that interpolates between the precalculated ROMs and their corresponding Reduced Order Basis (ROB).

In the presented configuration, the interpolation approach is suitable to update the GR basis with high accuracy. The technique also shows good performance while updating the MT and CB basis, but challenges are found when the structure preserves symmetry properties because of close and multiple eigenvalues of the modes.

The customers performed sales, customerservice, marketing and other roles and did so purely based on theirown enthusiasm, not because they were being reimbursed to doso—for example moms started buying €1200,- kitchen machinesfor the girlfriends of their sons, daughters started sharing recipesand sons praised the machine to their friends. All the more, thesecustomers even enjoyed performing such additional roles, andappreciated Vorwerk more for facilitating them. A win-win for boththe customer and the organisation.Livework believes the subject of this thesis—the phenomenon oforganisations consciously enabling customers to perform additionalroles—is unique, unprecedented and extremely valuable. Not onlyis it able to improve customers' experience, it can also provideorganisations themselves with huge value. In more theoretical termsthis thesis concerns the movement from transactional customerorganisationrelationships, in which the customer receives a productor service and pays, to engagement based relationships, where boththe customer and organisations enjoy mutual advantages because ofmutual engagement.By analysing the Vorwerk case, supplementing it with additionalliterature, and consolidating it through academic experts andindustry practitioners, a framework and method have been built. Thisframework of design for relationships should give practitioners—suchas service designers and CX managers—the means to form and fosterrelationships between their customers and their organisation.The first phase of research, with practitioners within and outsideof Livework, established that relationships often merely are anunconscious and implicit outcome of services. Academics confirm this,stating that practitioners need additional means to more effectivelydesign for relationships (Cipolla and Manzini 2010; Snelders, Van deGarde-Perik &amp; Secomandi, 2014; den Hollander et al., 2015; Baek et al.,2017).Having established this need, the first iteration of a framework wasbuilt drawing from customer experience, social design, relationshipmarketing and customer engagement literature. It proposes threeadditional exercises which are to be added to Livework’s regulardesign process: Relationship receptivity, relationship fostering andrelationship mutuality.‘Relationship receptivity’ aims to showcase the organisation as apossible relationship partner to the customer. Additionally, it showswhich moments in the customer’s experience are relational of nature.For example, an interaction with service personnel or a chatbot.‘Relationship fostering’ aims to establish the appropriate level ofrelationship quality within the identified relational moments. That is,the level of intensity of the relationship which the customer deemsright. For example, should the service personnel behave very formally andpolite, or more friendly and take the time to ask about personal informationsuch as how someone’s family is doing?‘Relationship mutuality’ is a brainstorm exercise which aims to exploremutual engagement between the customer and the organisation.That is, what types of roles a customer can fulfil for an organisationand what additional value an organisation can provide to a customer.For example, could a customer perform a marketing function on socialmedia while enabling the customer to showcase ethical behaviour such asengagement with the environment?Being a highly explorative study, the effectiveness of the method hasnot been tested yet. This would require at least several cases usingthe methodology to be done, after which the cases would have tobe monitored in terms of relational need fulfilment from a clientperspective and monetary benefits from a business perspective.Nevertheless, a method has been developed around these threeexercises which was tested in practice, iterated and validated throughthe input of practitioners and experts.

This makes them centres of resource consumption and waste production. Sustainable development is seen as an opportunity to respond to the consequences of urbanisation and climate change. In recent years the concepts of circularity and urban symbiosis have emerged as popular strategies to develop sustainable urban areas. An example is the experimental project “Straat van de Toekomst”, implementing a circular strategy based on the Greenhouse Village concept. This concept implements circular systems for new ways of sanitation, heat and cold storage and greenhouse-house symbiosis. Although many technological artefacts have to be developed for these sustainable solutions, integrating infrastructural systems asks for more than just technological innovation. A socio-cultural change is needed in order to reach systems integration.<br/><br/>The institutional part of technological transitions has been underexposed over the past few years. Besides the fact that systems integration is a relatively new concept, challenges regarding the process towards it have been mainly focussed towards the technological side. There is a lack of a clear answer on what institutional challenges and opportunities emerge during the process of systems integration, as well as a lack of knowledge on its implementation in urban area development.<br/><br/>In order to analyse the process of systems integration in urban area development, the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework of Ostrom is used. The framework enables us to identify the influence of important variables on the decision making process. It consists of three exogenous variables (biophysical/ material conditions, attributes of the community and rules) that influence an action arena (action situation and participants) and provides handles to identify interactions and analyze these interactions through evaluative criteria. <br/><br/>A comparative case-study is performed into three cases in the Netherlands: Cityplot in Buiksloterham, Amsterdam; Waterschoon in Noorderhoek, Sneek and EVA Lanxmeer in Culemborg. These were selected on the criteria of encompassing a project integrating infrastructural systems from the “Straat van de Toekomst” and being an urban area development.","System integration; circular cities; Buiksloterham; Noorderhoek; E.V.A.

Human behaviour is a key component in services, as the interaction between a user and touchpoints determines the overall performance and value. Increasingly, service organizations aim to influence or change behaviours. Livework Studio, one of the leading service design agencies in the world, wants to incorporate the knowledge of behavioural economics into their practice to fundamentally understand and guide customer behaviour. The main objective of this project was to develop a structured design approach that supports Livework designers to incorporate behavioural economics theory into their process.  An extensive research was conducted to generate insights on how Livework can use the behavioural economics theory in the design process of services. The insights gained throughout the project were integrated into a design approach and toolkit. The approach is focused on influencing behaviour by getting the customer in the right mindset at the right time. In this approach two types of behavioural interventions are combined across a customer journey to either speed up or slow down the user’s momentum. These interventions do not only facilitate automatic and fast thinking (such as nudging) but can, when necessary, switch customers to the conscious state. People can be prompted by rational override interventions to switch to the conscious state. Rational overrides are micro moments of friction that can be used to disrupt mindless automatic interactions, prompt moments of reflection and increase conscious decision making. Not all service interactions require the speed and usability of a frictionless experience. Some situations require users to slow down, focus on the decision at hand and understand the options that they have. In these situations, friction is not bad, it is necessary. This research identified nine strategies that can switch people to reflective and conscious thinking.","Service Design; Behavioural economics; Behaviour change; Interventions; Behaviour; Nudge; Rational override","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The exploration is conducted by addressing the question of whether leadership styles and tasks are solely performed by the project manager of a design team, or whether leadership styles and tasks are also performed by other team member of the design team. The intention is to increase understanding of the interrelatedness of tasks, leadership style and communication using an inductive approach.<br/>Research question: What are the main tasks that need to be addressed in project teams with Shared Leadership and is the way a task was performed dependent on certain leadership styles?<br/>Methodology: The concept is explored by using a comparative case study design. Two case studies were executed to collect data. First, the team members and the project manager were interviewed by using a semi-structured interview at the beginning of the research. Second, an observational study is done by observing the design team meetings to identify which members are contributing to shared leadership and could there be tasks and roles recognized on the basis of their behaviour and communication flow. Third, the team members and the project managers were asked to fill in a questionnaire, which are used to understand the interpersonal side of team collaboration. <br/>Findings: Shared leadership can be measured by making observations and applying communication labels as developed during the research. There is not a relationship to be recognized between the formal role of a person and the shown behaviour. Furthermore, Shared leadership is dynamic as it is not linked to specific leadership styles. Furthermore, a new definition of shared leadership appeared from this study: Shared leadership consists of multiple dynamic leadership behaviours to maximize team effectiveness. <br/>Limitations of the research: Qualitative research is always subject to bias due to the interpretation of the qualitative information. Subsequently, the modest number of samples that is investigated in this research are not intended to adequately represent the behaviour and communication flow.

When we look at the design process of an architect and a production designer, the two design processes look quite similar. Though, there are some important differences between the two, especially when we look at the first part of the design process. This is because an architect starts with an actual location and actual users <br/>he can refer to, while the production designer starts with a scenario which describes a narrative, characters and a fictive world. So how we can translate these stories into a design, without having any visual reference?

De Nieuwe Kuip in Rotterdam is used as a case study to put the findings into practice. In order to answer this question a literature study into the application of wood, steel and FRP has been performed. In addition to that, a literature research into types of graded structures has been performed. This research showed that Voronoi and Delaunay are the most promising for the generation of a graded grid structure. Voronoi was chosen as it most resembles the desired look of a bone structure. The densification of the graded structure is based on an imagemap that has been created by analysing several performances. This performance map is a greyscale image that follows the form of the overall shape of the canopy in which lighter colours represent large openings and darker colours represent smaller openings. Three methods to generate a graded Voronoi based on this imagemap were tested. The first method is based on Lloyd’s algorithm, the second method is based on Force Driven Circle Packing and the last method is a Smart Circle Packing based on mesh relaxation techniques and mathematical theorems. The last method proved to be most suitable for the task. Lastly, the created abstract grid of lines was translated to a real structure. It has been structurally optimized and analysed and technical details were created.","graded structure; voronoi; performance based; image map; performance map; grid structure; FRP; Multi-objective optimization; optimization algorithms; delaunay; bone structure; circle packing; lloyd's algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The objective of this research is to study how this innovation can finally become a marketable product. To do so, a structured method is followed which is divided in two phases. Firstly, the potentials in the market, the technical capabilities and limitations of the microperforated glass technology are researched in detail. Concluding from there, that the cost of production is too high, however, the advantage of great quality allows for customized solutions as façade-front applications.

The interest in improving the resource efficiency is growing. A move towards a Circular Economy (CE) has been assigned as the solution for a more efficient use of resources in the construction industry. The aim of a circular economy is to create a system in which waste and energy leakage is minimised and resource input is avoided by closing the material and energy loops. Despite the advantages of CE, the construction industry has not yet made a significant step towards<br/>the CE. The theory of Reverse Logistics (RL) could be the enabler of circular economy in the construction industry. RL in the construction sector is defined as the management of collecting, sorting, processing and reusing construction waste. In the field of RL, quantitative models have proven to be a successful tool to combine environmental goals with financial constraints. However, such models are missing in the field of construction industry. In this context, this research proposed a general applicable RL-model that supports decision-makers in implementing circular principles in the return flow of their assets while minimising the costs. <br/>Literature review has been conducted to obtain a theoretical framework for the model design. The first part of the literature study has provided a framework to prioritise different waste management strategies based on their level of circularity. The second part of the literature study has been conducted to get an insight in the characteristics of the reverse logistics in the infrastructure and how the principles of circular economy can be included in the RL-process. <br/>The most suitable modelling approach for the proposed problem has been found to be linear programming.<br/>The proposed RL-model has been designed as a transhipment model and is based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The proposed model design simulates the reverse flow of one asset moving from a deconstruction project, through the processing facilities to the final redistribution. The proposed model has been complemented by a guideline that supports the application of the model for specific cases. <br/>To test the applicability of the model and the proposed guideline, the model has been applied on two different types of assets in the infrastructure: concrete and street lights. <br/>The model for both cases have been run for multiple scenarios, based on the developments in the industry. The results of the model provides two types of information. Firstly, it provides a trade-off between the level of circularity and the costs. Secondly, it gives the corresponding network-design for the different outcomes. It was found that technical innovations in combination with efficient transportation will help to create return flow in the infrastructure, according to the principles of circular economy, which is financially feasible.<br/>Overall the model has been proven to be general applicable and it supports decision-makers in making decisions about the reverse flow. The outcome gives information about the financial impact on implementing circular principles. The corresponding RL-network provides an insight in which aspects in the RL-process influences the outcome.<br","Circular Economy; reverse logistics; linear programming; Construction industry; waste management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Population growth, climate change, and increasing demands placed on infrastructure call for a smart and standardized approach. The data needs to stay at the source and sharing information in a more efficient way is becoming increasingly important. To make this possible in the water sector a platform is needed to facilitate the exchange of information. This platform allows for keeping data at the source, which can then be accessed all over the world. The data exchange will become possible when the platform works according the right standards. An integrated model based on existing standards is one of the first steps in achieving better communication and interoperability. The research goal is to to design a well defined information model based on standards that will be optimal for implementation in a information infrastructure within the water sector to make the 1D time series data exchange easier. This is done by a research to the existing standards and there capabilities. The standards are described and from their background an information a model is created to illustrate in one overview the relations between these standards on several levels. To create one Hydrological TimeSeries Stan- dard Based Information Model (HydroTS-SBIM) the international standards that are most relevant are selected and reviewed; ISO 19156 O&amp;M, OGC Timeseries Profile of O&amp;M and WaterML 2.0: Part 1- Timeseries. This is done to get a clear and complete HydroTS-SBIM that gives an accurate insight on both the positive and negative aspects of the existing standards, and will show in one information model the possible relation between them. For now the standards cannot be merged into one complete model due to the inconsistencies among the standards. Therefore the HydroTS-SBIM 2.0 is created to illustrate these inconsistencies and complications on each level. To create an HydroTS-SBIM thorough research has been done, including interviews with highly educated specialists within the fields of data standardization, governance and the water sector. A survey was used as feedback for the creation of a demo version of the proposed solution, called the Packet Plan. The Packet Plan is an step-by-step approach to the standards. To show the use of the packets, the core packet is developed which is called core packet A. It illustrates that there is no need to implement the total standard in all its richness at once to be able to share data, instead it presents a model with the concept of compact packets. This is a time efficient process where the implementation of the standard will be in parts, leading to less information at once but divided over the packets. The user will only get the required information for the specific part the user needs at that time, resulting in an easier and more time efficient data exchange.","Data exchange; Data integration; Data platform; OGC standards; Packet Plan; Standards; Standardization; Hydrological TimeSeries Standards Based Information Model; Timeseries data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Consequently, the installations research resolved to determining the causality of the unsatisfactory dewaterability. The digester feed, mesophilic digestate, thermophilic digestate and ammonia stripped thermophilic digestate were compared. Harsher sludge treatments led to a severe deterioration in dewaterability. An increase in presence of colloids resulted in a worsening of dewaterability, to an extent originating from size and surface charge of colloids; unlike variations in presence and size of supracolloids, which were inconsequential. Moreover, inferior dewaterability was strongly associated with the increased concentrations of carbohydrates, proteins and humics in the bulk and loosely bound phases, and with the decreased presence of proteins in the tightly bound phase. Furthermore, the decreased calcium and increased iron presences in the bulk and tightly bound phases were correlated to a degradation in dewaterability; whilst sodium, potassium, ammonium and magnesium in all phases were found of no or insignificant influence. Recognizing the dewatering determinant factors enables the search for digestate specific conditioning and dewatering methods.","thermophilic digestate; mesophilic digestate; ammonia stripped digestate; dewaterability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-01","","","","","",""

Home - as a device – is plugged to everyday life, and its spaces serve the evolving living and working habits. The physical concept of the home space – XIX century tenement houses, socialist blocks of flats or popular since mid-nineties development housing estates, are the most common form of inhabitation in Poland – according to governments statistics, in 2016, 57% of Polish society inhabited multifamily dwellings. We leave in buildings of age ranging from 100 years – XIXth century tenements, through 50 years old socialist prefabricated blocks of flats, to two decades old concept of developers’ estates. Meanwhile, the technology that we are using changes dramatically every decade, so do the social constructs and systems that we are part of. Consequently, the architectural concept of our apartments is further and further from the contemporary concept for living. Le Corbusier and other Modernists worked on the change of the plan of the apartment, but what indeed hasn’t been worked through, is the housing type in historical-social terms: the functionally differentiated house, with its family-based house-keeping regime. <br/>What emerges, is the necessity of re-domestication, meaning exploring and defining the new ways of inhabiting, making off the home. This includes definition of user - inhabitant, but also of a community they (inhabitants) are willing to be part of. In order to go out of the old, non-contemporary-relevant patriarchal way of ruling the house, I look into social, architectural and individual practices and elements that contribute to making off a home as commonly approved concept, which I consequently deconstruct. The process of deconstruction happens in two ways. First of all, as a deconstruction of a social construct of household and domestic work. The model that is deconstructed is the patriarchal-based domestic household, that gradually lost it’s public character and aspects of commonality among different households. <br/>It is the monogamous family with the inferior economic and social status of women and a status of man visa a vis her. Secondly, it is the spatial, material deconstruction, re-programming of the functions of the house – a clash of modernist solutions, applied on XIX century apartment layout with XXI century traces of living inside it. The spatial base of the XIX century tenement houses emerges from the layout that satisfies the living needs of the bourgeois class of the society. The ‘open-gallery type’ was introduced in the first half of the XIX century and it represented a remarkable adaptation of the Empire Style to urban multistory housing. The main feature of these apartments was the complete separation of the service spaces with only kitchen included inside the apartment, which still was a space for servants or housewife’s. The most mature form of the bourgeois apartment had a center defined by a large living room and so-called sitting room – the entire house was organized around the living, but exclusively for the rich part of the society.<br/>Within the Architectural Project of Boredom, under examination are rooms, spaces in-between, spaces of communication, objects, services, materials, routines. The outcome concerns new spatial constellations, new social structures, and most of all, set up of the spatial principles for projects with everyday life as a main concern.<br","Boredom; domesticity; everyday housing; woman; Łódź; Poland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

During the entire replacement project many stakeholders are affected. This can lead to resistance against the project. Resistance can be expected when the interests of the stakeholders are not (sufficiently) integrated in the design or construction method of the replacing quay wall. The high density of stakeholders in urban areas increases the probability that stakeholders will resist against the project. In Amsterdam the lead time for replacing a quay wall is up to five years this lead time accounts for the time from the decision to replace the quay wall until the realization of the new quay wall. One of the reasons for the long duration of the replacement projects is the time invested in dealing with the resistance of stakeholders. While the construction method of the new quay wall has influence on the reaction of the stakeholders, the reactions of the stakeholders on the other hand may influence the construction method. Therefore, in order to reduce the lead time for replacing a quay wall, an optimum between the construction method and the reaction of stakeholders is expedient. In order to minimize the resistance of the stakeholders it is advisable to take the interests of the stakeholders into account. The objective of the present research has been to develop a method to determine the construction method that will most be in accordance with the interests of the stakeholders, in order to possibly minimize the resistance produced by the stakeholders. C&amp;S-matrix In this research, a method called “construction stakeholder matrix” (C&amp;S-matrix) was constructed. This matrix connects the stakeholders and the construction method directly, by comparing the extent to which different construction methods are in accordance with the stakes of the stakeholders. Thereby, the matrix takes into account the influence of different stakeholders on the outcome of the project. The outcome of the matrix is a numerical value: the lower the number, the more resistance can be expected. The C&amp;S-matrix is applied on a case of the Prisengracht in Amsterdam, four types of urban quay walls were selected. The outcome of the matrix is that the combined wall with inclined piles will result in the least amount of resistance produced by stakeholders. The C&amp;S-matrix is a useful method to determine which construction method produces the least resistance. Since the output is numerical value it enables that the construction methods and the expected resistance can be compared, which makes this method unique. The effectiveness of the C&amp;S-matrix mainly depends on the stakeholder analysis, it requires that all the stakeholders with their interest are identified and that the power-vs-interest grid resembles the actual power and interest of the stakeholders. This method predicts which stakeholders will most likely resist, this gives information for other measures to reduce this resistance for example compensation.","stakeholder; resistance; urban quay walls; C&S-matrix; Construction & stakeholder matrix","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work explores the use of the multi-fidelity method to speed up an aerodynamic optimisation algorithm applied to axial compressor blades. A rotor blade is optimised in a two-stage blade geometry for maximum isentropic efficiency. The single-fidelity reference optimisation uses a high-fidelity evaluation process employing Menter SST turbulence equations and a mesh of 903.000 cells. Five multi-fidelity optimisation setups are tested, which employ the same high-fidelity process, but<br/>distinct low-fidelity processes ranging from a fine mesh and RANS turbulence equations to a coarse mesh and inviscid Euler equations. It is found that multi-fidelity optimisation could cause a delay in run time of up to 39.9%, equivalent to almost three days and a loss in optimum efficiency of 0:11%. The best result is a speed-up of 14.1%, equivalent to 1 day of time savings and an improvement in efficiency of 0.02%. The speed-up of 50% demonstrated in literature could not be achieved since the high-fidelity model in this work is much cheaper. The best cost ratio achieved in this work is comparable with 0.14, but the correlation coefficient of 0.46 is insufficient. It is shown that at their optimum efficiencies, two selected single-fidelity and multi-fidelity optima have different geometries and aerodynamic behaviour. For improving performance using the multi-fidelity method, it is recommended to increase the fidelity gap between the low-fidelity and the high-fidelity processes. The cost ratio of a new low-fidelity process<br/>can be estimated with an error of at most 5%, by using 10 member designs. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient can be estimated with an error of at worst 35%, using 20 blade designs. From the results in this thesis, it is recommended to employ a cheaper low-fidelity process using for instance through-flow<br/>calculations or to make the high-fidelity process more expensive by adding more design features.","multi-fidelity method; aerodynamic optimisation; axial compressor blade; fidelity reduction; Kriging; Co-Kriging; RANS turbulence modelling; Euler equations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Using thermoplastic resins gives rise to induction heating as a joining technique. Induction heating can be applied by utilising the inherent material properties of the adherends themselves. This avoids having to input a foreign material in between adherends that has to heat up the joint. It is a form of non-contact heating, it is relatively cost-effective and<br/>it is a rapid form of heating. One of the major challenges in using induction heating is controlling the temperature distribution within adherends. The temperature distribution directly influences the quality of the bond and is controlled by numerous process parameters. Having computational models able to predict the influence of these process parameters is of key importance into optimising the bond quality in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. This research focuses on the electromagnetic response of UD CF-PEKK laminates<br/>on an alternating electromagnetic flux. It shows the relation between the micro-structure and electric material properties with the thermal response to an electromagnetic wave. This research fills the gap in literature by modelling this response for unidirectional laminates heated without the use of susceptor materials.

(mentor); Ducarne, Julien (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Deployable structures using tape-springs are a promising option to minimize the volume occupied by satellites at launch and reduce launching costs. The attractive characteristics of tape-springs made of ultra-thin woven composites are their high specific stiffness and bi-stable behavior. However, the most important shortcoming is the complexity of their mechanical analysis. Textile composites are formed by the weaving of bundles of fibers creating a very complex microstructure, and tape-springs present a highly nonlinear mechanical behavior subjected to multi-axial loadings. Therefore, conventional mechanical models developed for unidirectional lamina no longer apply since they do not take into account stress gradient effects through the representative volume element (RVE). In this work, a multi-scale approach is validated to predict the failure initiation of tape-springs. Micromechanical models are used to predict analytically the stiffness properties of the fiber bundles, while FE mesoscale models describe the woven structure and provides stiffness and strength properties for computations on macroscale. A case study of hybrid laminates composed of woven and unidirectional layers is analyzed for its application on tape-springs. Manufacturing defects related to ply waviness of the UD layer have been detected and taken into account to estimate the reduction of the overall stiffness properties. Finally, a dedicated failure criteria based on the force and moment resultants have been used to predict failure initiation of the tape-springs under multi-axial loading conditions. A good correlation was found between the finite element analysis and experimental observations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-10","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To this end four different method of uncertainty propagation are tested on a case study of sugarcane cultivation methods in Thailand. These methods are compared and evaluated on their suitability for agricultural LCA in developing countries, complemented by an expert survey in a Thai LCA research network. The results show that there is a general lack of knowledge among LCA practitioners on uncertainty analysis, while primary data is often abundant. Also, sampling methods can provide great insight into the output uncertainties, but are also complex and data intensive. Analytical or fuzzy interval methods could be a good alternative when knowledge or resources are lacking.

The purpose of this thesis is to create a system that intelligently schedules the charging of EVs while considering the cost of energy and the discomfort of the user. At any given moment, 90% of vehicles are parked and have a huge energy source left unused. EVs could also be used as power sources for vehicle-to-home/vehicle-to-grid (V2H/V2G) to benefit from them during high demand of energy. This way the power plants would see almost a constant demand and usage, in the long run, making them more efficient.<br/>This thesis uses a non-intrusive data-driven technique to create a occu- pancy and EV charging model of the household. Smart meters in each household collect power usage data. From this power usage data we de- termine occupancy and EV charge sessions. The next step is to determine temporal metrics for occupancy and EV charge sessions. The temporal met- rics study the likelihood for occupancy or an EV charge session to occur or to switch from one state to another. Because there are differences between weekday/weekend and seasonal power usage, we have decided to create tem- poral metrics for each time period.<br/>The next step is to create the EV charging algorithm and V2H/V2G algorithms. These algorithms require a flexibility window. This window indicates in which hours the EV can be charged. Which hours of the flexib- ility window are chosen, depends on the type of objective. We have created three objectives: cost minimization, comfort maximization and joint object- ive. The V2H/V2G algorithm is executed when the state of charge (SoC) of the EV is higher than the SoC boundary.<br/>In order to measure the performance of the algorithm, we have created two metrics: relative savings and miss rate. The miss rate measures how an hour was scheduled for EV charging but failed. During the testing of the algorithm, we found that only the objective cost minimization was deemed useful. Each objective uses a flexibility window and we conclude that the user’s preferences are already taken into account during the creation of this window. For the execution of the EV charge scheduling algorithm, a max- imum relative savings can be achieved of 27% and a maximum miss rate of 11.1%. By choosing the SoC boundary value of 60% for V2H, maximum relative savings of 9.9% and a maximum miss rate of 5.2% can be achieved. V2G execution had a negligible effect on the relative savings and miss rate because the pricing dataset did not contain many price surges.","V2H; V2G; EV; charging; Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

First, there is the tension between the dynamic nature of migration – migration as ongoing flow - and the rigid institutional and governmental practices offered as solutions. Second, a tension can be noticed between migration as a constant phenomenon in the current city, and the temporary, quick-fix housing options developed for migrants. The diverse flows of migrants to the Netherlands are primarily taken as temporary housing problems. This leads to exclusion and missed opportunities and results in a monoculture that can be considered negative for urban space. Consequently, if refugees, asylum-seekers and other migrants have to be really integrated in our cities and societies a more diverse, long-term, urban approach is needed. In other words, migration is a complex and pressing spatial urban challenge. <br/><br/>The former prison complex Bijlmerbajes and the surrounding WPM area have been taken as a case study to investigate practices and elaborate guidelines for an alternative development strategy that can build up a diverse, porous and resilient urban space. This strategy consists of orchestrated small-scale investments, grassroots initiatives and diverse programmes based on a governmental investment in public space as an organised and designed grid related to three scales. <br/><br/>The strategy leads to in an imaginary, future scenario for the WPM area, inspired by the 1970s ideal of the Bijlmerbajes. The project proposes to (re)open the former prison complex and to (re)create a Hotel City, where newcomers and temporary inhabitants can be received and prepare their integration into society. The ‘empty’ area next to the former prison complex is transformed into an experimental area with a lot of freedom where companies, institutions and individuals can rent, lease and develop space. <br/>The two zones (prison and empty area) are connected by a grid structure of public space and can together function as free-zone for experiments with new social and economic policies and practices. In this way, a place is carved out where newcomers, temporary inhabitants and more permanent residents of Amsterdam can together and actively become part of urban space. The intervention of a grid public space connects temporary stay and use with more long-term developments and permanent structures. <br/><br/>On the one hand, this thesis can be seen as a visionary project, inspired by the fundamental ideal of the Bijlmerbajes aiming to foster integration and transition of migrants into city and society and vice versa. On the other hand, the proposal offers a series of realistic and pragmatic design ideas and suggestions based on existing European policies, that can be used as a quick-start for debate to reconsider migration in today’s political atmosphere.<br/><br/>The most important insight of this research and design project is the idea that temporariness and permanence need an organised public space to manage demographic fluctuations and change. The three-scaled grid provides a flexible structure. Even though people come and go and might only stay for a short time, they need to be accommodated in a complex and diverse public space, which as such contributes to the city as a whole and long term creation. Thus, temporariness presupposes stability, and the other way around.<br","Migration; Organisation of public space; Temporariness; Permanence; Resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.3377, 4.9252"

During the early neonatal stages of human development, the basic activity of the brain is to develop itself during sleep. Prolonged sleep is required in infants for further development of the nervous system. Sleep also plays an important role in body temperature regulation and energy saving. Neonatal sleep is divided into two main different sleep stages: Rapid EyeMovement (REM) and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM). As the infant develops, sleep stages vary in maturity, length and distribution, thus underlining the importance of the quantification of these stages, which could eventually lead to new biomarkers of neonatal brain development.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the golden standard in sleep monitoring is Polysomnography (PSG), in which vital signs as well as EEG and muscle activity are recorded during a whole-night study and subsequently sleep stages are classified by an expert. However, the high obtrusiveness of the multiple electrodes involved in PSG and its high associated costs make it impossible to use PSG as a routine monitor system. The SOMNUS project had two main targets: (i) to accurately measure respiration signals from patients using an ultra-wideband radar module, and (ii) to detect differences in respiration between REM and NREM phases in order to unobtrusively and automatically score sleep states of infants without the need of any electrode attached to the patient. The system has been developed using a training dataset of 23 patients from 3 months to 14 years old. It is for the first time UWB radar technology is used to monitor sleep in young patients. Moreover, this work provides a new data analysis algorithm to suppress motion artifacts from radar signals and increase the robustness of respiration monitoring.<br/><br/>The results from the breathing detection algorithm developed in the present work provided an average mean absolute error of 3.25 Respirations per Minute in respiration rate. Amount of movement was employed to estimate Sleep/Awake events, with an average error in percentage of Total Sleep Time of 7.48%. Regarding sleep-state classification, several classification analyses were performed in order to study the best classification variable to detect REM/NREM, along with analyses regarding the best classification technique. Respiration variability was the main feature determining REM/NREMstate, with an overall sleep classification accuracy of around 80% when using linear classifiers such as Support Vector Machines and Fisher Linear Discrimination.","Ultra-Wideband Radar; Neonatal Sleep Monitoring; Sleep-state classification; Breathing detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-09","","","","Biomedical Engineering","SOMNUS",""

They will also be used to define certain parameters of the building itself, such as heights, views, certain directions of structure, etc. Once the boundary is created, the program is determined and placed on the site. The overall design and form will be derived from spatial analysis of the required program. This will start with the analysis of what functions are required in a multi use tech exhibition and startup center. Once the programs and functions are taken into account, the analysis of the spaces, functions and uses will be cross referenced and tagged in order to determine which spaces need to be close to each other and which ones can be farther away. This will be accomplished through a script that places the individual programmatic spaces within the boundary in close proximity to other spaces that are required to be close. Once these spaces are defined and the areas are set, swarm logic, people flow simulation and environmental factors will shape the form and connect the spaces. The swarm logic will start from specific areas on the site where people can enter and connect the ground to the building and interior spaces. The autonomous agents will create a trail that will define other architectural elements critical to the design of the center. These would include public/ semi public spaces that lead the visitor into the building. People flow analysis will be used to create the internal flows of people in the tech and exhibition center as well as the external to internal flows and vice versa. The wind analysis will help to streamline the form so that the wind will not create extra stresses across the building, rather flow along the structure. The environment, climate and other factors will be taken in to account in order to create a low impact building that concentrates on performance driven aspects, revolving around and showcasing the tech industry.<br/><br/>In the micro/meso scale, the buildings skin and construction components will be explored to derive a new way to use Carbon Fiber (or composites) in the construction field. This part will fall under the category of Design to Robotic Production. The goal for this portion is to explore and create a self supported or minimally supported carbon fiber structure (or composite structure) that would integrate the systems, structure and aesthetics into the building pieces. Through the use of programming and biomimicry, the composites would be designed in a way that is structurally sound, aesthetically pleasing and performance oriented. The design of the building will incorporate Robotic Building technologies, as the whole building would be designed and built through the use of robotic manufacturing practices.","carbon fiber; parametric design; Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this exercise the student needs to develop a proposal for 6500-7000 sq. m. of student housing on the Green Village in Delft. The Green Village vision is to create a sustainable future together and that all starts with the health of the students themselves since they are the ones who's going to live there. Stress seem to have a really negative influence on the health but also the performance of the students. For this project i tackled this problem by reducing the stress level of students on their way home. During commuting students are often still outside the present. They take their work back home which can result in low quality sleeping and on long term even result in lack of performance at the university.<br/>The concept therefor is to work with the route student take towards their homes. In order to give the route more meaning, spaces and function will be integrated in the route. Profiles on the route are never same. Edges of this route exist out of benches, shelters, workplaces and nature. Especially nature plays an important factor of fulfilling multiple function. Not only does nature improves the mental state of people but it also serves as shading, fall prevention and orientation of the spaces by the colours of the plants.<br/>The goal is to relax the mind of the student on this route. Based on that the route is designed with smooth shapes in order reduce disturbance of the mind. By using flowing curves, shapes will never break in segments. This leads to less impulses on the human mind.<br/>Once students will reach their home. The design languages and materialisation changes from free form abstract architecture made of concrete to orthogonal space efficient architecture made of timber. The reasons for choosing wood is because its a warm material that makes it pleasant for student to live in, but also because timber is sustainable and relative easy to work with. Where the concrete part of the building is public, the dwellings are personal and more temporary. After some years the interiors of the dwellings could be easily upgraded to newer standards.<br/>All dwellings are orientated in such a way that one side is facing a space covered by an ETFE roof which provides the space underneath for additional passive heating. The other side of the dwelling will face regular Dutch climate. With a cold and warm side of the dwelling the space can ventilate passively. Hot air underneath the ETFE roof will rise and pulls the colder air throughout the dwellings. Depending on the temperature the ETFE roof can let the hot air out to regulate the temperature.<br/>As mentioned before, the free form part of the architecture will be made from concrete. The overall form will be divided in building components. These elements will be pre fabricated. Based on the digital model a mold will be milled of expanded polystyrene and later reinforced with steel an poured with concrete. These elements will be stacked on top of the constructive walls of the dwellings and solidified together with freshly pored concrete. To insulate the dwelling polyurethane foam will be sprayed up against the inside of houses.<br/>Computational strategy. The strategy to create and mostly generate the architecture is not only needed for fabrication but also for the design itself. All the freeform wished results are brought back to from roughly 64 faces to 4 faces per building component. From this reduction functions (bench, workplace, etc.) are assigned to different areas of the overal plan based on data. Then all the details will be generated by the grasshopper script. Faces will be added where needed and later on smoothed and polished to get the final result. For orientation of the user, colour will be assigned based on location of where the user is located within the plan. The size of plants will be planted according to the results of solar radiation inside the dwellings. And ceilings of the public space will be shaped according to structural analyses.<br/>All these things will come together in functional and pleasant architecture in order to reduce the stress of students who are commuting from university to their home.","loop; parametric design; student housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Om toch een optieprijs te kunnen bepalen, wordt er gebruik gemaakt van simulatiemethoden. In stochastische modellen, gebaseerd op zogenoemde arbitragevrije prijsbepalingen, is de optieprijs gelijk aan de verdisconteerde verwachtingswaarde van de maximale opbrengst over alle mogelijke uitoefenmomentenm van de optie onder de risico-neutrale maat. Het uitoefenmoment waarvoor de verdisconteerde verwachte opbrengst maximaal is, wordt gevonden door een optimale uitoefenstrategie te hanteren. Deze uitoefenstrategie kan worden bepaald met behulp van de continueringswaarden die horen bij de optie. Het bepalen van de prijs van een Amerikaanse optie draait om het vinden van de continueringswaarden. Longstaff &amp; Schwartz [2001] veronderstellen dat de continueringswaarden kunnen worden beschreven door een functie. Het algoritme dat zij beschrijven, maakt gebruik van regressietechnieken voor het bepalen van een functiebenadering van de continueringswaardefunctie. Met behulp van deze functiebenadering kan een ondergrens voor de optieprijs benaderd worden. Omdat het evalueren van de optieprijs relatief veel rekentijd kost, willen we dat de gevonden ondergrens ook relatief nauwkeurig is. Dit motiveert het gebruik van variantie reductie methoden. Bolia et al. [2004] beschrijven in hun artikel een methode die gebruik maakt van importance sampling als techniek voor de reductie van de variantie. In een iteratief proces proberen zij een zogenoemde variantie-nul kansmaat te benaderen. Wanneer de optieprijs onder deze kansmaat wordt geëvalueerd, kan de optieprijs met variantie nul worden bepaald. Net als Longstaff &amp; Schwartz [2001] veronderstellen Bolia, Glasserman en Juneja dat zowel de optiewaarde als de continueringswaarden kunnen worden benaderd met een functie. Net als in het algoritme van Longstaff &amp; Schwartz [2001], worden deze functies benaderd aan de hand van regressiemethoden. De optiewaardefunctie kan vervolgens gebruikt worden bij het bepalen van een benadering van de eerder genoemde variantie-nul maat. Met de gevonden benaderde kansmaat kan een nieuwe optiewaardeen continueringswaardefunctie worden benaderd. Intuïtief volgt dat elke iteratie een nauwkeurigere benadering geeft van de continueringswaardefunctie. Wanneer er voldoende iteraties zijn uitgevoerd kan de optieprijs worden geëvalueerd onder de verbeterde strategie. Dit geeft een betere benadering voor de ondergrens van de optieprijs. In het verslag wordt het algoritme van Bolia et al. [2004] behandeld. Het project kent twee voornamelijke doelen. In de eerste plaats is het project gericht op het doorgronden van het algoritme. Hierbij is het de bedoeling dat het algoritme wordt beschreven voor derdejaars bachelor wiskundestudenten. Vanwege de hoeveelheid en ingewikkelde wiskunde achter het algoritme, is er gekozen om alleen de delen wiskunde te behandelen die noodzakelijk zijn voor het begrip van het algoritme. Het tweede doel binnen het project is het algoritme toepassen. Het verslag wordt dan ook afgesloten met een voorbeeld ter illustratie van het algoritme. In de gevonden resultaten treden discrepanties op met eerder gedaan onderzoek. Uit verschillende testen kan echter geen duidelijke fout in de implementatie van het algoritme worden aangewezen.","Option Pricing; American Options; Simulation; Importance Sampling","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DVS originates because axial loading conditions on- and the design of adjacent vertical load bearing elements are different. Due to these differences, the reaction of the adjacent vertical structural elements expressed as length change can be different.<br/><br/>The aim of this thesis is to research differential vertical shortening effects in high-rise buildings that use a concrete core as a lateral stability system and a timber pendulum structure as a gravitational system. The Tallwood House in Brock Commons is a perfect example of such a structural system where the engineers have considered the shortening effects which will be reviewed in this research. Furthermore, this research will look for measures in the design and implementation phase that have influence on the magnitude of differential vertical shortening deformations.<br/><br/>In the Tallwood House project the problem was only tackled on basis of the individual column shortening and the effect it would have on vertical mechanical systems. A clear understanding of the relative difference between core and column shortening (DVS) and the effect it can have on secondary building systems is lacking. The determination of criteria on which the DVS deformations are assessed in the Brock Commons building, are based on the deformation capacity of the vertical mechanical systems, which does not necessarily relate to the DVS deformations. A more methodological approach is necessary for the prediction of DVS deformations and the determination of criteria regarding DVS deformations.<br/><br/>The sub question have the aim to reach to a more general and methodological approach in predicting DVS deformations and determining criteria for DVS deformations. <br/><br/>“What are the criteria on which differential vertical shortening deformations in the building structure should be assessed in order to guarantee the functional performance of the building during its service life?”<br/><br/>“How can differential vertical shortening deformations be quantified for a timber-concrete high-rise structure?”<br/><br/>After answering the sub-questions that relate to the criteria on DVS deformations and the quantification of DVS deformations, a research can be conducted to the influence of some input variables for the design and construction process to answer the main question of this research:<br/><br/>“What are effective measures which can be applied in the design and construction phase to mitigate the differential vertical shortening during the service life of high-rise buildings that uses a timber gravitational load bearing system with stabilizing concrete cores?’’<br/><br/>Problem areas where DVS deformations can have a negative effect on secondary building structures are researched. A general approach for the determination of criteria for DVS deformations is elaborated, based on principles for vertical deformation criteria that are described by the Eurocode.<br/><br/>The response mechanism of axially loaded concrete load bearing elements and axially loaded timber load bearing elements on external influences is researched qualitative by a literature study. The CEB-fip 2010 strain model is used to predict deformations in concrete. For timber, the strength class system is used according to Eurocode 5 to determine the elastic strains. The creep and shrinkage strains in timber are determined by experimental results that are found in a literature study.<br/><br/>The influence of the building process on DVS deformations is researched by a literature study. Staged construction analysis provides the possibility to simulate the sequential loading in a building process and to distinguish the DVS-deformations that can affect secondary building elements (post-DVS deformations) from the total-DVS deformations.<br/><br/>A case study on the Tallwood House at Brock commons in Vancouver is conducted to provide a basic geometric model in which DVS deformations can be predicted in which all previous research in this thesis serves as input properties of the model. From this basic model, variables in the design and building process are altered to conduct a sensitivity analysis of these variables. The building height expressed in number of floors, column cross section and the building speed of finishings in a building are taken as the analysed variables.<br/><br/>Increasing the column cross section can be an effective measure to decrease post- and total-DVS deformations due to elastic and creep strains. The effectiveness decreases with the increase of the column cross section because shrinkage strains are not affected. The post-DVS deformations can be decreased by postponing the building process of secondary structural elements in the construction schedule. The effectiveness decreases with increasing building duration because DVS-deformations due to loads of the finishes itself are not affected. Total-DVS deformations are not affected. Compensation has effect on the total difference in vertical position between the floor supports. The vertical translational movement is not prevented. This means that post-DVS deformations cannot be influenced by compensation.<br","Timber; Concrete; high-rise buildings; Differential vertical shortening; Time dependent deformations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

This thesis explores a new method to assess the quantity of underground electricity cables which could one day become available for urban mining. This research answers the question: ”To what extent can topological networks be used to localize and quantify underground metal cables in order to assess the quantity of an underground urban mine?” Three case study areas in Amsterdam have been selected to exemplify the method. The Dutch National Road Network has been used as a topological skeleton to approximate the electrical network. <br/><br/>Three different methods were used to connect buildings and transformers to this network. The ’Connect to Closest Point’ method, connects every point to the closest point on the street network. The ’Connect to Closest Junction Vertex’ method connects every point to the closest junction vertex of the street network, which is divided into segments with maximum length of 75 meters. The ’Iteratively Connect to the Closest Junction Vertex’ method iteratively connects every point to the closest junction vertex, within a threshold, until all nodes are connected to the street network. <br/><br/>By evaluating the edge betweenness [Girvan and Newman, 2002] for every edge in the topological networks, cable current and thickness could be determined and the urban mine was quantified in terms of electrical cables. The ’Connect to Closest Junction Vertex’ method showed to be most accurate, with up to 88% accuracy in Geuzenveld. Although this method is suitable for finding a minimum quantity of an underground urban mine, locational accuracy is too low to pinpoint the exact location of underground cables.","Geomatics; Urban Mines; Electrical network; graph theory; Circular Economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

These plants are adapted to loose wet soils, saline habitats and periodic tidal submergence. With more attention paid into the approach of building with nature, natural coastal defence strategies are gaining more importance as an asset in addressing the coastal squeeze that is prevalent not only in urban areas, but also in agriculture and industrial areas that are located along the coastline. Mangroves are receiving more attention due to their coastal protective role against wave and hydrodynamic forcings as well as their ability to adapt to sea level rise. Mangrove vegetation attenuates and damps the hydrodynamics forcings by providing obstacles to the flows and creating drag. To date and to the knowledge of the author, no study has been conducted on interaction of the wave-induced currents with mangrove vegetation. This lack of relevant studies may be due to the fact that mangrove forests and the foreshore in front of the mangroves are usually of very gently sloping bed (varying in order of 1:300 to 1:1500). This means that in order to conduct physical model experiments to study wave-induced current within a mangrove forest, a very large wave basin is required in order to conduct modelling without using a very large scale factor difference between prototype and model. This is to ensure that the relevant processes are representing prototype as closely as possible, as well as to be measureable. Numerical modelling of the interaction of wave-induced current with mangrove vegetation is yet to be conducted due to the lack of measured data for validation, both field as well as experimental measurements. An experiment by Hulsbergen (1973) was selected as validation data for current study. The main objective of the study is to understand the difference of nearshore processes for (stationary) tidal gradient-driven and oblique wave-driven current for both with and without mimic mangrove vegetation. The scope of the study involves desktop analysis of the main validation data and other relevant and similar experiments, assessment of reliability of Delft3D for the study, validation against measured data, and simulation of various hydraulic conditions for condition with mangrove forest. Among questions answered in this study are the extent of wave-induced longshore current damping within mangrove forest, the significance of wave-induced longshore current within mangrove forest, the effects of bed slope and mangrove density on wave-induced current and the extent of model’s reliability for current study. It was shown that the damping of wave-induced longshore current is more than 80% and the contribution of waveinduced current to the total velocity can be more than 70%. Of course, both of the above was specific to the bathymetry, mangrove properties and hydraulic conditions specified within current study. Furthermore, it was shown that bed slope and mangrove density affect wave-induced longshore current within the mangrove forest. It was also found that current model setup has its limitations.","Wave-Induced Longshore Current; Delft3D; Mangroves; Wave hydrodynamics; Numerical Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

This habitat is meant to be a stepping stone in their integration process, in which they learn about Dutch culture, language and prepare to be fully adopted in Dutch society. <br/> The location of this centre is in the Europoint-towers in Rotterdam. The open floor plan and good connectivity make it a great location. The towers, which are now partially occupied to house offices, also have a growing amount of vacant space. This vacant space is believed to increase significantly in the near future, possibly resulting in the towers to be completely unused. The goal is to give a new purpose to these towers. The main purpose of the habitat is to help immigrants integrate into Dutch society. The programme will therefore include, study/meeting spaces, lecture halls and an information centre. To bring the immigrants in contact with Dutch citizens, the building is designed to stimulate and make possible interaction between them.<br/> Because the refugees only live in the habitat for a short time (up to a year), the amounts of people living in it will constantly change. Combined with the many compositions of families, like single people or families with kids, these factors will ask for an environment that is able to adapt to the changes. Dwellings should be custom configurated to fit the spatial and functional needs of each family, while providing the right amount of privacy.","Architecture; parameteric design; Mass customisation; Refugee integration; Dwelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hyperbody","51.912117, 4.430626"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Creative clusters have been a research topic for some decades; their importance for local economic growth and urban development has been discussed among many scholars in the fields of economy, geography, and urban planning. Recently attention has shifted to the role of space on the micro scale in creative clusters. Gaps in knowledge exist between the spatial features and the functioning of creative clusters. The concepts of creative clusters are evolving and new research fields are emerging. This thesis joins this evolution and focusses on the knowledge gap that exist between the role of space and the functioning of creative clusters. <br/>The concept of four meanings is a new step in better understanding the spatial elements of creative clusters. It will be used in this thesis to bridge the gap between the different knowledge fields. The four meanings of space consist of an economic, social, material, and symbolic meaning of space that all contribute to the success of a creative cluster.<br/>Based on a theoretical framework constructed around the existing literature on creative clusters, a new method is proposed: the Method for Analysing Space and Defining Potential (the MASDP). This method uses the four meanings of space to understand the current state of the space in creative clusters, ‘analysing space’. The four meanings of space are also used to image to the future state of the space in creative clusters, ‘defining potential’.<br/>This thesis provides knowledge on the context of creative clusters form theoretical perspective. This knowledge is then translated into a framework for urban designers. This framework lets them better understand the importance of the spatial elements in the functioning of the creative cluster. In doing this, the knowledge gap in the role of space in creative clusters and the gap between theory and practice will be narrowed.","creative clusters; four meanings of space; spatial elements; spatial analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The field of nanotechnology has been quickly growing over the last few decades and many different functional Nano Electro Mechanical Systems(NEMS) can now be made. <br/>To further increase the possibilities and functionality of NEMS, new materials have to be characterized. Of the new materials which become available at the nanoscale, graphene is one of the most promising. This is mainly due to the combination of its extraordinary strength, electric and thermal conductivity, and low weight.<br/>In order to be able to use graphene's full potential in future applications, the elastic properties, such as the Young's modulus and the bending rigidity, have to be known. <br/><br/>These elastic properties have been obtained following different approaches. However, the obtained values are scattered. This scattering has a few reasons. <br/>Firstly, experimental research into graphene is difficult, due to the small scale, big influence of the environment, and the difficulty of fabricating well defined graphene membranes. <br/>Secondly, graphene is a purely two-dimensional material. Therefore, continuum theory is not easily applied. The bending rigidity for example is not related to thickness as it is in a continuum plate. <br/>Finally, graphene exhibits strong mode coupling and is always vibrating due to Brownian motion, the motion which results from the stochastic excitation due to temperature. Parameters extracted from static measures may thus not match the reality or experiments. In conclusion, the elastic properties have to be obtained from the dynamic response, following a multi-modal approach.<br/><br/>As graphene, only one atom thick, is close to the atomic scale, Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to investigate its behavior. To extract parameters, these simulations are compared to an analytical continuum model. In this way, the advantages of continuum mechanics and Molecular Dynamics simulations are combined with a dynamic, multi-modal approach to extract the bending rigidity and Young's modulus of graphene. <br/><br/>In the continuum model, the equations of motion of a circular graphene plate and membrane are derived from a Lagrangian approach. The governing equations are discretized using admissible functions that satisfy boundary conditions. Furthermore, the geometric nonlinearity is included, as graphene is so thin, and is thus easily driven into the nonlinear regime. <br/><br/>The basic principle of Molecular Dynamics simulations is to solve Newton's equation of motion for every single atom of a system. The force acting on the atoms is described by a potential field. The equations of motion are then integrated over time. <br/><br/>The mode coupling in graphene is shown to be so strong that the energy in all modes is equal after some time. Therefore, the only steady state attainable is the state in which the energy in all modes is equal, which corresponds to the Brownian motion. The eigenfrequencies are obtained from the time response of the atoms in the graphene membrane, excited by Brownian motion. The obtained eigenfrequencies are compared to the values obtained from the continuum model. From this comparison the bending rigidity of graphene is extracted. This is done following an optimization approach, which minimizes the difference between the eigenfrequencies obtained from the continuum and the Molecular Dynamics model. Including multiple modes is shown to be a necessity for reaching convergence. <br/>Furthermore, the Young's modulus is obtained. This is done by comparing the geometric nonlinear behavior of graphene obtained in Molecular Dynamics with a continuum prediction of this behavior. <br/><br/>The bending rigidity and the Young's modulus thus have been obtained, independently, from the dynamic response of graphene obtained in Molecular Dynamics. <br","Molecular Dynamics; Graphene; Multi-modal; Non-linear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-13","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sefati, Mohsen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The recent advancement of the autonomous vehicle has raised the need for reliable environmental perception. This is evident, as an autonomous vehicle has to perceive and interpret its local environment in order to execute reactive and predictive control action. Object Tracking is an integral part of vehicle perception, as it enables the vehicle to estimate surrounding objects trajectories to achieve dynamic motion planning. The 3D LIDAR has been widely used in object tracking research since the mechanically compact sensor provides rich, far-reaching and real-time data of spatial information around the vehicle. On the other hand, the development of autonomous driving is heading toward its use in the urban-driving situation. In an urban situation, a robust detection and tracking algorithm is required due to increasing number of Vulnerable Road User (e.g. pedestrian and cyclist), heterogeneous terrain, inherent measurement uncertainties and limited sensor reach.<br/><br/>This thesis presents an integrated framework of multi-target<br/>object detection and tracking using 3D LIDAR geared toward urban use. The framework combines occlusion-aware detection methods, probabilistic adaptive filtering and computationally efficient heuristics logic-based filtering to handle uncertainties arising from sensing limitation of 3D LIDAR and complexity of the target object movement. The implemented framework takes a raw 3D LIDAR data as input to perform multi-target object detection while simultaneously maintaining track of the detected objects' kinematic states and dimension in robust, causal, and real-time manner.<br/><br/>Robust detection is enabled by slope-based ground removal and L-shape fitting to reliably enclose bounding box to objects of interest in the presence of sensor occlusion. The tracker utilises three combined Bayesian filters (IMM-UK-JPDAF) which simultaneously tackle association uncertainties, motion uncertainties and estimate non-linear stochastic motion model in real-time. Logic-based rule filters are also designed to augment the rest of detection and tracking based on the understanding of LIDAR sensor limitation and occlusion characteristic.<br/><br/>The evaluation results using real-world pre-recorded 3D LIDAR data show the proposed framework can achieve promising real-time tracking performance in urban situations. Diverse datasets are deliberately chosen to evaluate if the MOT system is capable of working in a varying driving scenario. The benchmark results highlight that the designed and implemented MOT system is performing on par with the state-of-art works and yield satisfying accuracy and precision in most given urban settings.","Multi-object Tracking; Vehicle Perception; 3D LIDAR; Object detection; Object tracking; Probabilistic Tracking; Autonomous driving; Machine vision; Adaptive Filtering; Heuristic Rules","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","","50.7815082,6.0463215"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Quadrotors  are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which are controlled by changing the angular speed of the four rotors. In the recent years, they have received a large  attention from the research community thanks to their  vertical take-off and landing capability, small dimension, payload, flight endurance and low price  which it has increased the interest in making them completely autonomous. In this thesis two different problems related to the autonomous quadrotor navigation field have been studied. The first one is how it is possible to drive the  quadrotor from its current pose (position and orientation) to the  desired one assuming that the quadrotor's full states measurements (position, orientation,velocity and acceleration) are available. The second problem deals with the use of visual informations either acquired by the front or bottom camera to place the quadrotor at a desired distance from a chosen static or moving object keeping the  latter centered in the acquired camera image without knowing  neither the quadrotor's pose nor the object one. To solve the first problem  a navigation controller framework able to communicate with both parrot AR. Drone 2.0 and Pixhawk autopilot has been  designed. A cascade control design made up by  seven 2DOF PID controllers divided into five different modules (horizontal position controller, vertical position controller, horizontal speed controller, vertical speed controller, yaw controller) has been developed to ensure that the navigation controller framework  is able to simultaneously track the desired yaw angle together with either the desired velocities or the positions. <br/>To solve the second problem  a vision based planner made up by three different modules (perception, image state estimator, image based visual servo) has been developed. Planar ArUco markers have been used to avoid the need of designing different specific objects' detectors. Their corners have been extracted by the ArUco detector located inside the perception module. Inside the image state estimator module a Kalman filter with velocity constant model has been designed for both estimating the corners when a detection is suddenly not available and providing to the image based visual servo module feedbacks data (estimated corners) at a specific chosen frequency. An image based visual servo algorithm  has been implemented to compute the desired quadrotor's translational velocities that the navigation controller framework has to track to minimize the error between the estimated and the desired corners where the latter are computed as a function of the desired distance between the quadrotor and the visual marker.<br/>To validate the navigation controller framework and the vision based planner a mission has been chosen in which firstly the quadrotor autonomously reaches a first predefined desired pose, secondly it  approaches up to a desired distance a static visual marker using the front camera image data, thirdly it reaches a  second predefined desired pose and finally it  autonomously lands using the bottom camera image information either on a static or moving visual marker. The mission has been tested in real flight with Parrot AR. Drone 2.0 and in simulation using Gazebo simulator in combination with PX4 Software-In-The-Loop.<br/>Both the navigation controller framework and the vision based planner have been developed using ROS as a software framework to guarantee system communication and all the algorithms have been coded using C++ as a programming language. <br","Quadrotor; vision based control; autonomous navigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Visitors and exhibitors interact with the data in this system through two products: a personal device worn by all visitors and a stand device present at each exhibitor. These two products allow visitors to leave their profile (personal interests and objectives) at interesting exhibitors by scanning their personal device at their stand devices similar to the way ants leave their pheromones at interesting food sources. Stand devices then use this collected data to find potentially interested visitors by transmitting it to the personal devices of those who are in close proximity, which then nudge their user towards the exhibitor whose previous visitors best match his/her profile. Furthermore, this design allows exhibitors to visually acquire information about a visitor’s profile by simply reading their badges. This allows them to be more efficient in their work by focusing their effort on visitors they expect to be a good match based on their interests and objectives.","Biomimicry; Ants; Pheromone; Data; Design; Trade fair","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Their movements become uncoordinated with errors in speed and accuracy. To quantify the level of impairment, this paper proposes a preview tracking task. Such a task assesses and quantifies eye-hand coordination skills. <br/>A preview experiment on a touch-screen has been conducted with four cerebellar patients, four age-matched healthy control subjects, and a group of 26 young adults. Age-matched control subjects and young adults performed eight runs of the preview task, with the dominant hand only. Patients performed eight runs with each hand to make a distinction between the hand affected by the lesion and the unaffected hand. During the experiment, both eye- and hand movements were recorded. Results were obtained with system identification techniques. A model of the human controller in preview tasks was fitted to the estimated frequency response of the subject. The resulting control parameters revealed the tracking behaviour of the subjects. Patients show significantly higher visual time delays, neuromuscular damping ratios and lead time constants than age-matched control subjects. Consequently, patients engage in a more cautious control strategy than age-matched control subjects.<br/>Overall, the proposed task is found to be capable of detecting visuo-motor impairment in cerebellar patients. It could be used to quantify impairment as a result of neurological disorders, and monitor improvement during the revalidation phase and afterwards.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-09","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For tasks such as area surveillance or maintaining a communication network, the deployment of multi-agent systems is required. In these scenarios, it often is necessary for the robot teams to navigate in formation while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. In situations, where team keeping is not crucial it can be beneficial to split and merge robot teams. This could be the case, if multiple targets are supposed to be tracked, or due to obstacle avoidance in order to improve goal progress and help avoiding deadlocks. <br/><br/>Within this thesis a novel approach for splitting and merging of robot teams moving in formation is developed. The method extends an existing geometric method for local formation control, which uses the approximation of typically non-convex workspaces by obstacle free convex regions. The regions are used to constrain a non-linear cost function, which is minimized through Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). This determines the references position for the robots and furthermore allows for the adjustment of the formation shape according to the environment. This thesis presents a goal directed version of the obstacle-free convex regions. These regions are used to determine team splitting and merging based on region intersections. The method takes into account limited sensing and communication range of the agents. Furthermore computations are done in a distributed manner to allow for better scaling with the number of team members.<br/><br/>The presented method is validated through simulations in various scenarios. Furthermore, an experimental framework is recreated and experiments with up to four quadrotor UAVs of the type Parrot Bebop 2 are conducted. The approach shows sufficient real-time capabilities in static and dynamic environments, while maintaining safe navigation of the drones.","Formation Control; Splitting of Formations; Merging of Formations; Quadrotor UAVs; Dynamic Environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-08","","","","","",""

The city centre of Bucharest provides a multitude of mesmerizing examples of such spaces where the theory of motion, play and desires merged with a fascination of parkour as a ‘derivious’ contemporary practise transgressing control and conventional reading of the city.

Simultaneously, the project manifests as an endless labyrinth of corridors, modest and monumental, warm and cold, reflective and absorbing, transparent, semi-enclosed or even dark spaces all intertwining with each other and inducing a ‘derivious’ spatial exploration. Modular assemblage and possibility for disassembling the project interprets the understanding of flexibility as a reuse and repurpose under different contexts.

However, with path tracing being a Monte Carlo method, a large amount of light paths must be sampled to reduce image noise to acceptable levels. Although a wide variety of acceleration and importance sampling techniques have been developed to reduce the cost of individual samples and reduce the number of required samples, path tracing remains a very computationally expensive approach. Monte Carlo error estimation and reconstruction approaches the problem from a signal processing perspective by reducing the sampling budget and instead applying image denoising filters to lower noise levels. Although these image denoising filters can be successfully applied to post-process images into near ground truth results, estimating the right parameters to use remains an open problem. We propose that limitations of automatic parameter estimation can be overcome by taking advantage of the ground truth image in the mind of artists. To that end we introduce a workflow and associated user interface to let artists locally tune and apply filters to noisy Monte Carlo images. The interface lets users explore the high dimensional parameter spaces of filters through an image navigation paradigm, which means that users pick the right filter and settings by choosing the end result they want. We organize a case study to evaluate the efficacy of interactive filter tuning and to compare the efficiency of slider-based parameter choice with the image navigation paradigm. With the results from the case study we show that our workflow allows even novice users with no prior image processing experience to quickly select appropriate filters. Users are able to produce higher quality results using our local parameter painting approach compared to global optimization in the same time span. Users also prefer the image navigation interface for filter choice and tuning to sliders, but we are only able to quantify the benefits on images that require filters with a high dimensional parameter space.","path; tracing; monte; carlo; noise; filter; error; reconstruction; global; illumination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-09","","","","Computer Science | Computer Graphics","",""

Frequency synthesizers are required during this frequency translation process. Though the upcoming commercial communication (e.g., 5G) is continuing to propel the semiconductor market, the Internet of things (IoT) aimed at health monitoring, intelligent agriculture and environmental sensing, home automation and security sensing is gaining more and more momentum in recent years.

Frequency synthesizers typically take up considerable silicon area and are one of most power-hungry blocks of these transceivers.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to design a clock generation digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard for IoT applications.

A phase noise improvement technique is proposed to reduce the in-band phase noise of the DPLL by around 6dB. Furthermore, a fast reference calibration loop is implemented to mitigate the reference spur effectively. A prototype is fabricated in the TSMC LP 40nm CMOS process. Measurements show that the proposed RO-based fractional-N DPLL achieves 1.6ps integrated jitter, -45.8dBc fractional spur, -43.6dBc reference spur and 1.8-2.7GHz tuning range while consuming only 1.33mW power.

Shallow dimples have inherent advantages over traditional flow control techniques that require heavy active systems to be installed or pose maintenance problems. Proven drag-reducing mechanisms show reduced turbulent properties, like a reduced Reynolds shear stress, reduced turbulent intensity and an upwards shift of the logarithmic layer leading to a lower skin-friction coefficient. Dimpled surfaces will encounter varying pressure gradients in applications like airfoils, and thus the effect of both a favorable and adverse pressure gradient on the drag-reducing potential of a dimpled surface is explored in an experimental investigation. An experimental set-up is devised that utilizes a planar diffuser to induce a pressure gradient. A novel flexure-based drag balance is used to measure the total drag difference between a dimpled and flat surface in a direct force measurement campaign. To investigate if the drag reduction is attained by manipulation of the turbulent properties, particle image velocimetry technique and hot-wire anemometry technique to quantify the boundary layer properties. After confirming good repeatability of the drag balance, a drag reduction is observed from the direct force measurements for the dimpled surface in the zero pressure gradient (ZPG) configuration. A preliminary drag increase is observed followed up by an increasing drag reduction with increasing Reynolds number, yielding a maximum drag reduction of 0.8%, however no significant changes are found in the turbulent properties. For the favorable pressure gradient a drag reduction is observed from the upwards shift of the logarithmic layer and this drag reduction is also found from the force measurements, however with considerable uncertainty.

A preliminary feasibility test was performed from which it can be concluded that the altitude display has potential to improve safety in air traffic control and to reduce the complexity within the sector, but that some more attention should be put on making sure the aircraft leave the sector within the constraints linked to their exit waypoint.

The holes may form a potential risk for the stability of surrounding riverbanks, dikes, bridges, tunnels and buildings. A scour hole can mostly be the result of two conditions: local changes in hydrodynamical conditions or local changes in erosive capacity of the bed. Heterogeneity of the subsoil in the Rhine-Meuse Delta causes differences in erosive capacity, resulting the formation of deep scour holes.<br/><br/>A distinct method to predict the development of scour holes in heterogeneous subsoil is not found yet. In this research a numerical model that simulates the hydrodynamics in a scour hole is used to gain more insight in the flow processes that are present in such a hole. The dependencies of the flow processes on the upstream water depth, upstream flow velocity and depth of the scour hole are investigated by changing these parameters systematically in the model simulations. The processes that are included in the analysis are the flow separation and recirculation zone, the contraction of flow, the horseshoe vortex and the vortices downstream of the hole.<br/><br/>Changes in the depth of the scour hole showed some interesting phenomena. It is found that three-dimensional processes suppress the formation of the recirculation zone, as flow separation happened for milder slopes and shallower holes in two-dimensional simulations. The contraction of flow is not necessarily stronger for larger holes, which was hypothesized.<br/><br/>The analysis of the bed shear stress in the model results shows a constant upstream slope angle, as the critical value for bed shear stress is not reached. In the downstream half of the hole, this value is reached and therefore erosion and sedimentation are expected. The bed shear stress in the model results shows strips of zero bed shear stress with large gradients at both sides of the hole. These strips have an angle of 1:8, which is also found in the laboratory experiments by Koopmans (2017). The downstream expansion of the scour hole with a poorly erodible top layer had the same widening angle.","scour; holes; heterogeneous; subsoil; numerical; hydrodynamical processes; poorly; erodible; top layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The increasing dynamics of globalization have also made its way to The Hague, where urban competitiveness is increasingly considered to be an important aspect for the city’s future. In an attempt to reach high levels of urban competitiveness, the municipality of The Hague has recently announced its plans for the development of an innovation district. <br/><br/>Objective: The objective of this research is to intensively analyse a specific case (the innovation district in The Hague) and, in doing so, add to the scientific literature concerning innovation districts. By performing an empirical analysis about the demands of different groups in an innovation district and the ambitions and policies on the steering side, this research attempts to clarify what the physical needs are of specific groups of actors within the context of the innovation district in The Hague. What is more, it attempts to draw conclusions regarding the relationship between physical interventions and the development of innovation districts. <br/><br/>Methods: This thesis is divided into five main components: an introduction, a theoretical framework, a case analysis, the conclusions and recommendations and a reflection. The methods that have been used in this research are a literature review, interviews and a questionnaire. The quantitative data of the questionnaire has been statistically analysed by calculating the median and the inter-quartile range of each variable. What is more, frequency tables have been developed to create a more detailed image of the results of each variable. Pearson’s r and Pearson’s chi-square method have finally been used to discover significant differences and correlations. <br/><br/>Results: The results of the case study indicate several aspects that have high levels of importance to specific groups within the district, while others show lower levels of importance. The results of the levels of satisfaction of the different aspects within the district also show varying results for different sub-areas. The analysis of the 22@ district in Barcelona has also revealed a number of physical interventions related to the development of the district. <br/><br/>Conclusion: This research has resulted in a number of conclusions relating to the development of innovation districts. First, municipal leadership appears to be key in the early stages of a top-down initiated innovation district. Then, it has become apparent that the needs of the users of innovation districts go beyond sheer accessibility. Walkability, bike-ability and the presence of hospitality services are nearly equally important. However, user groups also have specific needs that other groups do not have. Therefore, when the vision is to create a mixed environment, it is important to consider these needs, otherwise innovation districts run the risk of having dispersed user groups. Another conclusion is that physical proximity does not guarantee learning (there is a need for common ground) and that physical conditions alone are not sufficient for innovation to take place. Finally, the cases studied in this research have shown that the brand ‘innovation district’ is being used by cities as a model to strive for, rather than a label that corresponds with the physical and economic situation at hand. <br","Innovation; Innovation Districts; Urban Planning; Case Study; The Hague","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In January of 2017, the new water law enforces a change in the assessment of primary water defences. The water law requests a probability of flooding when assessing the safety requirements. The studies of VNK1 and 2 are based on this new safety approach and provide background information and a basis for the new water law. A failure probability and explicit uncertainties provide an increase of reliability in the safety judgement of primary water defences and more specifically hydraulic structures. The aim of a more reliable assessment procedure is to some extent limited by the tools prescribed by the water law. The assessment tool Riskeer does not allow the engineers to have transparency in calculations results, which prevents insight into the model behaviour and contribution to the failure probability. To investigate the mechanics contributing to the overall failure probability for hydraulic structures, analysis of the limit states, failure mechanisms and Riskeer software were performed. The results of the analysis were incorporated into a reference model to validate the suspected mechanics. The input for the reference model was a sensitivity analysis and case study, which cover the assessment tracks of Non-Closure and Strength and Stability for hydraulic structures. The aim of this reference model was not to replace the Riskeer software but describe the mechanics in the correct way. Analysis of the schematisation manual and previous assessment software (Ring toets) provided the incorporated failure mechanisms and the specific model that was used to obtain the limit state. Additionally, a fault tree defined how the different failure mechanisms are related. The knowledge of the fault trees combined with sensitivity analysis provided information about the largest contributors to the overall failure probability, regarding resistance and solicitation variables. The dominant solicitation factor in all failure mechanisms was the water level difference. The resistance factor was dominated by the failure probability of Non-Closure in the gate and the strength of a gate element. In the comparison of the reference model with the Riskeer software, the results were similar but not accurate enough to replace one with another. The reference model was significantly influenced by the approximation in the hydraulic boundary condition, which is formed by assuming a distribution for the water level, wave height and wave period. In the testing of the Riskeer software, the software results showed a difference between two levels of the fault tree. The lower level describes the fault tree including all mechanisms and sub-mechanisms. The top level shows the top probability of the fault tree on which extra simulations of scenarios are executed. The Riskeer software showed the top level as the final result, however, the reference model only describes the lower level. The extra simulations work in a conservative capacity and cannot be assessed by the reference model. The main processes in the fault trees were validated by the reference model, as is shown by their characteristics in the sensitivity analysis. Together with the temporary calculation results, a rough validation of the input parameters was feasible in the lower level. In contrast to the top level, where numerous scenarios were simulated without any transparency to what these values entail. The sensitivity analysis also showed the difference of the two levels over the different variables, which is a (almost constant) significant difference.","Riskeer; WBI2017; Hydraulic structures; PCRing","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has abundant natural surroundings which are very suitable for both leisure and more formal events.<br/>Furthermore, the concept and program of the building were researched to provide a basis for assessment of suitable design strategies. The building comprises three main parts, which are a restaurant, a conference area and a museum. An extensive list of passive design strategies is composed to fit the project. Three of these strategies were studied in more depth to receive some feedback on how they would perform in the chosen building and its context. These three strategies were applicable in the project, and eventually used in the design.","Passive design; vernacular approach; Texel; Wadden; Local materials; climate design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","de Kastelein - Passive design strategies in the dune landscape of Texel",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","This thesis focuses on the collaboration of two innovative materials - Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP) and structural glass – in the design of a (hybrid) footbridge with a 30 meter span. The choice of subject is led by a rising popularity of these materials in bridge design and strengthened by positive recent developments in conceptual small-scale FRP &amp; glass hybrid structures. This research will try to take previous research one step further and will combine the advantages of both materials to reach a structurally efficient bridge design. The research question is as follows: “Can a hybrid pedestrian bridge with a loadbearing structure of FRP and structural glass be designed while making optimal use of the material properties of both materials?”. The design by research process is divided in multiple steps. First of all a theoretical framework is created, with state-of-the-art information about the material properties of glass and FRP. This theoretical framework resulted - via design rules - in several preliminary design variants of which the structurally most efficient, most transparent and safest variant is chosen and subsequently elaborated on. The chosen variant is optimized by using a form-finding and geometric optimization process powered by the Grasshopper plugin Kangaroo and Finite Element software DIANA. The research shows - via its design rules – that a hybrid facetted shell bridge, consisting of glass facets and FRP joints is the most efficient variant. A concave shape is chosen for its “natural” parapet and relatively low share of bending stress in the total stress, while still measuring up to the bridges’ requirements. The concave shape is tessellated with triangular panels due to problems with the – in theory – more efficient hexagonal panels. By shortening the length of connections along each side of a triangular panel, the behavior of hexagonal panels is approximated. Several topologically different triangular tessellation variants have been analyzed using DIANA. The topological variant based on a combination of the equilateral and isosceles triangle proved to result in the lowest stress and deformation values under NEN-based loads and is therefore the most efficient variant. By adding more curvature to the base of the bridge, better shell behavior is achieved, resulting in even lower stress and deformation values. The connection between the panels is made using an FRP embedded sheet, which results in a higher axial stiffness and ultimately also a higher critical load of the bridge. The ideal thickness of this sheet is determined with FEM analysis. A clamped double-pin joint is chosen for its uniformity and adaptability. Finally, an uncertainty analysis is performed to investigate the influence of tolerance related production flaws on stress levels in the joint, which resulted in no issues.","architecture; pedestrian bridge; plate shell; glass; gfrp; form-finding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

This thesis work aims at provide sufficiently accurate models which are able to estimate the temperature, humidity and Carbon Dioxide dynamics in an occupied room.

The ability of a vehicle to make robust decisions on its own by predicting and assessing future consequences is what makes it intelligent. This task of decision making becomes even more complex due to the fact that the real world is uncertain, continuous and vehicles interact with each other. Sensors that perceive the real world and measure quantities such as position and speed of other traffic objects are inherently noisy and are further susceptible to external conditions. On the other hand, the road users’ intentions are stochastic and not measurable, and the presence of partial or complete vision based occlusions can make any measurements obtained useless. The decision making unit thus has to be aware of these issues and use the limited knowledge available to anticipate future situations that could unfold in an infinite number of ways to then maximize a reward (or minimize a cost).<br/><br/>In this thesis, a method to make automated longitudinal decisions along a predetermined path for autonomous vehicles in unsignalized urban scenarios is proposed. The decision mak- ing problem is formulated as a continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a discrete Bayesian Network estimating the behavior of other traffic objects. The future evolution of states are predicted using a multi-model Trajectory Estimator along with the digital map of the current driving area. Since continuous spaces make the belief space infinitely large, calculation of the value function for this problem becomes computa- tionally intractable. The presented solver algorithm approximates the value function instead of computing it directly, and additional optimizations reduce the belief space exploration area in order to improve performance. The results show that this single generalized framework is able to handle all the tested urban scenarios with a good safety margin in scenes with multiple traffic objects, even under zero visibility of the other traffic objects due to the presence of occlusions.","Autonomous driving; Decision making; Uncertainty; POMDP; Bayesian networks; Occlusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The role of self-organisation for refugee integration is promising because it has a deep understanding of the spatial context and responds to the local needs. Research about integration policies on the one hand and self-organisation and spatial planning on the other hand puts forward the relevance of spatial planning to complement integration policies with self-organisation, because spatial planning is a way of planning that strives for policy integration and incorporation of the spatial context. Spatial planning has a competence to provide supportive organisational and spatial conditions, although literature research about those conditions for the role of self-organisation in integration policies in particular is hardly present yet. This research investigates organisational and spatial conditions in the context of Rotterdam in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>First, this thesis gives a theoretical understanding of refugee integration, integration policies and spatial planning and self-organisation. Then, it explores the complementarities between integration policies and self-organisation by a case-study analysis for Rotterdam. The case-study analysis consists of an analysis of integration policies, of a thematic analysis that analyses common patterns and characteristics of eleven existing self-organised initiatives in Randstad municipalities and of an in-depth case analysis that goes more deeply into the development processes of three initiatives in Rotterdam. Finally, the thesis proposes general principles to enhance the interrelations between integration policies and self-organisation, which are illustrated by a spatial planning strategy for Rotterdam.<br/><br/>The results show that integration of refugees takes place in multiple domains simultaneously that require tailor-made support and distinct approaches per domain. The design principles propose that planners define either a policy or a self-organisation approach per domain of integration, in which planners play a collaborating role in the first and a facilitating role in the latter. Accordingly, the principles propose that municipalities coordinate the provision of tailor-made organisational support to self-organisation actors on multiple levels and in multiple domains. Furthermore, the principles propose to provide a network of buildings for self-organisation, consisting of three keystone buildings where initiatives cluster and typical buildings for self-organisation in all neighbourhoods. By deciding on strategic locations where integration is challenging or where relevant actors are located, planners can encourage the emergence and development of self-organisation at desired locations.","Self-organisation; Integration policies; Refugee integration; Strategic spatial planning; Spatial and organisational conditions; Policy integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The St Lucia Estuary is connected upstream to Lake St Lucia and downstream it flows into the Indian Ocean. The St Lucia Estuary is located at a wave dominated coast and experiences a micro-tidal regime. Along the coast of South Africa about 70% of the estuaries do not have a permanently open link to the sea, i.e. they are temporarily open/closed estuaries, which are mainly regulated by the amount of river flow entering the estuary. Anthropogenic impacts and fresh water reductions have altered the natural system. The mouth of the St Lucia Estuary is unstable and has been closed for longer periods in the last century. The drought period ranging from 2002 has drastically affected the St Lucia System as a whole with the desiccation of 90% of the lakes, reaching the all-time low. The management authorities had to take action and research supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which started in 2009 showed re-linkage of the Mfolozi River is the preferred solution to bring fresh water to the St Lucia System. This MSc study was initiated to investigate the effects of re-linkage of the Mfolozi River and dredge spoil removal from the estuary on the tidal inlet. The main focus is on the closure times of the inlet, the transition between an open – and closed inlet, and the multi-year morphological development of the inlet. The process-based model Delft3D is used to simulate various scenarios. The model is calibrated quantitatively on hydrodynamics and qualitatively regarding morphodynamics. The results from this study show that the re-linkage of the Mfolozi River leads to an inlet that remains open for majority of the time leading to a connection between the St Lucia Estuary and the Indian Ocean. This can make the St Lucia Estuary and Lake System a breeding ground for many marine species as it was before. The removal of dredge spoil however does not seem to be very effective. The closure times of the inlet barely change and the inlet re-imports most of the sediments. It is advised to limit the amount of dredge spoil removal, because the estuary will return to its equilibrium state.","St Lucia Estuary; Delft3D; Mfolozi River; tidal inlet system; Morphodynamics; Process-based modelling; Dredge spoil removal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-28.384899, 32.424138"

Formations of limestones and marls have been deposited over a time span of approximately 80 Ma from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous, which can be classified into eight distinct formations. This was followed by two phases of deformation. First, the counter-clockwise rotation of Iberia into Europe inducing S-N compression in this area.

The cross sections and geological map from this fieldwork were revised where necessary. Three new cross-sections were constructed along the north, east, and west boundaries of the area for more coverage. All cross-sections were digitized using the Move software package. To check whether these were geologically feasible, they were restored to their pre-deformation state by removing the effect of faulting and folding. These cross-sections form the basis for a 1:25 000 scale three-dimensional model. Horizon surfaces were created between cross-section horizons using spline interpolation and fault surfaces using linear interpolation<br/>Fauld displacements are removed and an unfolding is performed on the 3D model, in an attempt to reconstruct a balanced pre-deformational setting. The result is a viable model, with some inaccuracies such as gaps and overlaps between formation surfaces and slight variation s in layer thickness. The aim of this 3D model is to aid the understanding of the configuration of rocks and of the structural evolution of the area. The average shortening due to deformation for cross-sections was found to be 14.71 %. The surface reduction value of the area is found to be 8.2 푘푚 or 14.3 %.<br/>The direction of shortening is primarily in the S-N, due to the Iberian collision, and to lesser extent in the E-W direction, due to the Adriatic collision.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

As a result, there is a growing number of people in need, whereas limited resources to help these people are available. It is therefore important to effectively and efficiently prioritize the most vulnerable people in the preparedness phase, and the most affected people in the response phase of humanitarian action. Data-driven models have the potential to help in doing so. However, to be able to apply these models in a country, a certain level of data preparedness is required. Therefore, there is a need to understand how to facilitate, stimulate and coordinate data-sharing between humanitarian actors. To realize this, a generic governance structure is needed that can facilitate the achievement of this level of data preparedness on a large scale. This thesis aims to develop this generic governance structure using a data ecosystem perspective, by providing insight in the success criteria for establishing a ‘humanitarian data ecosystem’. As no scientific literature exists on this topic, as a first step, a general framework with data ecosystem governance success criteria is developed by means of a systematic literature review. Subsequently, the applicability of this framework in the humanitarian sector is assessed through a case study on the ‘Community Risk Assessment and Prioritization toolbox developed by 510 Global, the data team of the Netherlands Red Cross. It is found that the data ecosystem approach provides a suitable framework for assessing the criteria to be addressed when aiming to establish a successful humanitarian data ecosystem. Moreover, the empirical findings resulting from the case study led to the creation of a generic governance structure to be used when determining on the approach to adopt when rolling out the Community Risk Assessment and Prioritization toolbox in a new country.","Humanitarian data; natural disasters; data-driven aid prioritization; data ecosystem; governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The design is theoretically validated for stiffness using finite element analysis. The simulations showed an improvement in stiffness compared to original swingarms.<br/>The complete upgrade was validated with the build of a prototype and test rides. Building the prototype showed what the upgrade exactly means for the company. Test rides proved that the driving characteristics improved substantially and the subjects were sincerely surprised with the experience.<br/>How the design should exactly be implemented, is not yet fully defined but recommendations are given.<br","motorcycles; custom; suspension; swingarm; parametric; handling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The main objective of this research is to lay the foundation for a map that effectively disseminate noise information and facilitates well-informed decision making concerning the impact and assessment of outdoor music events. A noise map disseminates noise level information and is a common tool for environmental noise caused by roads or industries. The research question is: can a noise map be a valid tool for predicting noise nuisance from outdoor music events in the built environment?<br/>This master thesis is an exploration whether subjective opinions that are the result of a realworld event can be predicted by spatial analysis. Sound is a phenomenon with a spatial attribute and the knowledge of sound propagation is applied frequently in many different industries. In practice noise level prediction is an important instrument to decide by authorities whether an event can take place or not, therefore a study to better understand the relationship between complaints and noise level prediction is valuable. <br/>Noise measurements have been made at several events in the surrounding area of Amsterdam. The noise measurements have been used to investigate the accuracy of the current noise level prediction methodology. Spatial data and noise measurements were gathered from actual noise nuisance complaints to gain insight into the relation between the noise levels and nuisance complaints. Finally recommendations are made to help the municipality and event-producers better assess the possible impact of an outdoor music event.","Noise prediction; Noise nuisance; Geomatics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

This requires larger foundations. The predominant foundation type is the steel monopile, typically consisting of two large diameter pipes, the monopile (MP) and the transition piece (TP). The Wedge Connection is a new type of connection between these components which is investigated and designed in this thesis. The core of the wedge connection is a dowel with an inclined plane on one end. A large number of these dowels is placed around the circumference in a flange fitted to the TP. Holes with an inclined plane matching the dowel are machined into an MP flange. During installation, the TP is placed on top of the MP and the holes and dowels are aligned. The dowels are displaced horizontally with a hydraulic system. The hydraulic pressure is converted into a vertical preload through the inclined plane. <br/><br/><br/>In a comparison of connection concepts the strengths and weaknesses of the wedge connection with regards to other concepts are found. Two options are currently on the market, grouting and bolted flanges. Grouted connections have proven susceptible to long-term degradation, while bolted flanges have limited scalability and can be applied above the waterline only. The main benefits of the wedge connection are the option to apply it under water and the fact that no significant overlap is required. This makes the wedge connection a commercially attractive option. <br/><br/><br/>The fundamental principle of the wedge connection is a vertical preload generated through an inclined plane. In a set of analytical equations the sensitivity to the wedge angle and friction coefficient is investigated. Based on these equations and the shear strength of the dowel, a preliminary design is drafted for a hypothetical foundation with 10 m diameter. <br/><br/><br/>This design is modelled using ANSYS APDL.

The addition of a flushing basin behind a tidal harbour channel is meant to affect the sediment regime in the channel from a flood-dominant towards an ebb-dominant regime. With a one-dimensional model of a schematized reference situation, the role of three parameters: the sluice width, the horizontal area of the flushing basin and the ratio between the tidal amplitude and the channel depth, in the tide-residual sediment transport is investigated for the flushing basin system. Three conditions need to be met simultaneously to create ebb dominance along the total length of the channel: a sufficiently large flushing basin area, a small sluice width, compared to the channel width and a relatively deep channel compared to the tidal amplitude.","Noordpolderzijl; Basin; Harbour siltation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","53.43228, 6.58276"

The desaturation of nonwetting fluids from porous media is often described using capillary numbers which are a ratio of viscous forces over the capillary forces between the wetting and the nonwetting fluids. Twodimensional microfluidic devices (micromodels) play an important role as they allow for the visualization of the two phase flow in porous media. Even though the existing definitions for capillary numbers work fine for describing the mobilization of the trapped nonwetting phase in geological rock, problems arise when applying these definitions for capillary numbers on micromodels. The conventional definition of the capillary numbers do not allow to visualize the desaturation of nonwetting phases in different micromodels on a single trend. This research presents the derivation of a new definition of a capillary number that can be used to better analyze the mobilization of trapped nonwetting ganglions inside micromodels. The new capillary number is based on a force balance on a trapped ganglion and the corresponding mobilization criteria of the trapped nonwetting phase. The new definition of the capillary number consists of the conventional definition of the capillary number and a geometric term that accounts for the geometry of the micromodel, including the sizes of the pore bodies and throats as well as the ganglion length. The functionality of similar definitions of the capillary number for roughened fractures has previously been published by Al Quaimi and Rossen (2017). The functionally of the new capillary number has been tested by analyzing published desaturation data for various micromodels, each using different wetting and nonwetting phase combinations using both the conventional and the new definition of the capillary number. It is found that the new definition allows for better analysis of the mobilization of the trapped nonwetting fluid inside micromodels, as the desaturation curves for different models can now be visualized by a single trend. Also, it is suggested that the geometrical parameters of the new equation are more significant for describing the mobilization of the trapped nonwetting phase than the of the medium and the interfacial properties of the wetting and nonwetting phases.","Petroleum; micromodels; capillary; number; definition; new; literature study","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efficient pumping is a subject with increasing interest due to a required use of 20% green energy by 2020 set by the government. In 2010, the energy requirements already exceeded 175 GWh per year. For optimal control, water level predictions are important. However, they are uncertain due to errors in model structure, parameter estimation, initial states and observed forcing data. Especially the rainfall was found to contribute to water level prediction uncertainty. The uncorrected radar rainfall forcing data available in real time underestimate the corrected radar rainfall measurement over 100%, worsening with increasing rainfall intensities. <br/><br/> The aim of the research was to asses whether data assimilation can reduce the uncertainty on the water level predictions in a Delfland polder. The polder is modelled with a conceptual rainfall-runoff model in Sobek RR, while the data assimilation is implemented as an ensemble Kalman filter in OpenDA. <br/> In order to manipulate the states in Sobek RR for data assimilation, the model was extended by a black-box wrapper that was newly created in Java for this research. <br/> <br/> To asses the theoretical applicability of data assimilation in a polder area, four twin experiments were carried out, which differed only in the model components to which noise was applied. The four set-ups included the use of a rainfall multiplier, additive noise on the model states, additive noise on the groundwater state and a single multiplier for all states. The results were compared visually and objectively through the probabilistic Nash Sutcliffe, a model efficiency coefficient.<br/> <br/> All set ups for the twin experiment generated good results for the assimilated water level, mimicking the observed water levels closely with probabilistic Nash Sutcliffe values ranging between 0.92 to 0.97. However, only the set up with the rainfall multiplier exhibited good score measures for the hidden states, with an average of 0.6, showing a significant improvement over the case without assimilation. The other twin experiments failed to represent the hidden states, with average score measures below zero. <br/> <br/> The data assimilation set-up with the rainfall multiplier was then applied using water level observations from Tedingerbroek polder. The pump pattern and magnitude of water levels of the modelled and observed water level differed significantly. The influence of the different model components on the modelled water level was assessed, from which was concluded that these could not account for the difference in modelled and observed values. Possible explanations are due to a non-representative measurement point in the polder or additional unknown water fluxes coming into the polder. <br/> <br/> Recommended further research should focus on creating a larger observation network; implementing multiple water level observation locations, collecting pump discharges and taking measurements of the storage in greenhouse basins. The last could give a method to validate the assimilation of the hidden states, whereas the pump discharges should be used as additional observation in the data assimilation. <br/> <br","Data assimilation; Operational water management; Ensemble Kalman filter; water management; polder; Delfland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this project was to create a new design for a 3d printed forearm brace. Implementing this new design could promote the radical move in fracture treatment from traditional plaster casting to 3d printed braces.<br/><br/>Background <br/>Plaster casting has been the preferred treatment method for fractured bones since the 19th century, mainly because it’s cheap and effective. However practical, casting still has its flaws. Problems arise in terms of user-friendliness and hygiene (e.g. the smell, the feeling of being trapped and of course the endless itching). Today, almost two centuries later, new production methods provide the opportunity for a radical change in fracture treatment. 3D printing in combination with 3d scanning allows for the fabrication of a personalized and open structured cast, relieving the patient of some of the problems that arise with traditional casting. However, despite their potential there are still certain problems with these new braces which prevent practitioners from choosing them over traditional plaster casts.<br/><br/>Problem area<br/>One of the main problem areas in both traditional casting and 3d printed braces turned out to be coping with swelling. For the current generation of 3d printed braces this swelling leads to ‘window edema’, which renders the brace useless during a large part of the healing process. These braces can only be used during the last stage of the healing process. In this stage the advantage of creating a perfect fit to the form arm which is possible through 3d scanning is lost. Additionally, there are already plenty of alternatives to casts in this stage in the form of ‘pre-manufactured braces’. <br/><br/>Solution<br/>This design builds on the current generation of 3d printed braces and aims to prevent swelling from pushing through the open structure of the brace by attaching fabric on the inside of the brace. This design shows a new production technique which allows for fast and precise attachment of the fabric to the inside of the brace. More specifically, the advantage of 3d printing is to quickly create highly customized products. This design integrates the cutting and sizing of the fabric in such a way that it perfectly fits the customized brace.","3d printing; medical brace; 3d scanning; window edema","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

With the current developments in the aerospace field, travelling to neighboring planets have never been more possible. On the top of the agendas of numerous organizations today is the exploration of the Red Planet. However, there are many factors that complicate travelling to and building habitats on Mars. First and foremost constraint is the fragile human health that can not withstand the biological effects of ionizing space radiation. Following is the costliness and difficulty of carrying materials to Mars in hopes for building habitations. Last but not the least, the 22 minutes transmission delay between Earth and Mars, which makes it impossible to run and control operations on Mars surface in real time, and arises the necessity that majority of the operations has to run autonomously. All these limitations brings about one question that this thesis tries to answer; how to autonomously construct a radiation shielding habitat on Mars.<br/>In order to come up with a methodology, it was necessary to take a step back and start the project from selecting a mission among those defined in DRA 5.0 by NASA, as the mission characteristics limit the construction tools and methods for building on Mars. After mission details are set and landing site is chosen, the study started defining the construction methodology by choosing the appropriate material for radiation shielding. This material, water, is the core to the construction of the habitation and due to transportation limitations, in-situ materials on the Martian surface were evaluated. The regolith, in other words the Martian soil, and water were two potential candidates due to their presence on the surface. Water was chosen as a better shield for space radiation due to its highly hydrogenated structure. The water on Mars is encapsulated in four types of reserves; regolith, glacier ice, poly-hydrated sulfate minerals, and phyllosilicate minerals. Without rover missions and on-site data collection, it is not possible to confirm the presence of the remaining three reserves except from regolith at the landing site. Therefore, regolith was selected as the main reserve for water extraction, which brought about the question of energy requirements for such a process. Two possible energy generation systems including solar and fission power were then analysed, and a simultaneous use of both was deemed to be the most beneficial approach. Although fission power systems work with high efficiency, this type of generators can not be the sole source of energy due to their biological effects on human health and must be positioned at least a kilometer away from the habitat. In order to protect the crew, the solar energy systems that provide clean energy is selected to support the habitation while the fission powered systems are firstly tasked with generating energy for the return vehicles, then to the habitat from a far distance. After all these details on material selection, extraction and energy generation are determined, the project moved on to the construction steps.<br/>The construction process starts when one inflatable habitat module, which is pre-manufactured on Earth, is sent to the surface of Mars. The envelope around the module consists of water/ice bags that will then be filled with the water, extracted from the regolith, via a robotic arm. The water has been ISRU derived by processing the regolith with microwave technologies, which was deemed as the most efficient way of extracting water from regolith. In order to transport regolith to the ISRU plants 4 rassors will employed. These rassors will also play a vital role in the previous construction steps.<br/>At the end of this autonomous construction, the habitat is planned to accommodate a crew of six, for 539 days on the surface of the Mars. The habitat was designed with an aim of keeping the crew members’ total equivalent dose of radiation exposure within 0.40-0.50 Sievert range inside the habitat.","mars; habitat; in-situ; radiation; Space architecture; space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

For example, new regulations require insurance companies to value their position on a 1-year horizon. Insurance companies issue guarantees that need to be valued according to market expectations, instead of historical data. By calibrating option pricing models to market prices or equivalently, the implied volatility surface, one obtains market consistent values for these guarantees. Currently, it is common practice to assume that the parameters of these option pricing models are constant, i.e. the calibrated parameters from time t = 0 are used, as the option prices at t = 1 are unknown. However, empirical data shows that the parameters are not constant and depend on the state of the market. In this research, we propose regression models that predict the calibrated parameters, given a set of market variables such as the VIX index and risk-free interest rates. When these market variables are included in the real-world simulation, one is able to predict the calibrated parameters and consequently the option prices which are in line with the simulated state of the market. By performing a regression we are able to predict the out-of-sample implied volatility surfaces accurately. Moreover, the impact on the Solvency Capital Requirement has been evaluated for different points in time. The impact depends on the initial state of the market and varies from -46% to +52%.","Option Pricing; risk-management; recalibration; implied volatility surface; Heston","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

To deal with this, the Dutch power system requires a higher amount of flexibility in the future. Demand response with heat pumps is one of the options with a high potential to provide flexibility, because it offers the potential to store energy close to demand. In this thesis, the potential for electricity cost reduction with demand response with heat pumps for space heating by using the thermal inertia of buildings in the Netherlands is investigated. The effect of different heat load profiles, seasonality, and different comfort requirements on the economic potential demand response with heat pumps is analysed. An existing Matlab model is revised and expanded to perform simulations with different cluster types, seasons and predefined comfort limits. The model simulates the DR algorithm, R.E.X., and shifts the load of clusters based upon their thermal demand and the EPEX market prices within the predefined technical and consumer flexibility constraints, to analyse the potential of operational cost reductions of DR with heat pumps. Therefore, the key input parameters of the model are: (1) the thermal demand, (2) electricity market prices, and (3) the flexibility constraints. The key output parameters are: (1) the operational savings in euro, (2) the operational savings in percentage, and (3) the amount of shifted load. The model design, behaviour and results are validated with an expert validation.<br/>It is concluded, that DR with heat pumps can facilitate flexible balancing of supply and demand by aggregators in the Netherlands. The potential of DR with heat pumps for different stakeholders can increase depending upon the penetration of RES-E, heat pumps and EVs. Current obstacles for the development of DR of heat pumps are the high share of fixed energy taxes and the reduced efficiency and lifetime of the heat pump when DR is used. Designing flexible tariffs and a focus on flexibility in the re-design of heat pumps can take these obstacles away.","Flexibility; Demand Response; Heat pumps; Heat load profiles; Seasonality; comfort requirements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

It is believed good interface management is contributing to the success of infrastructure projects. The research has been executed at Heijmans, a major contractor in the Netherlands. The purpose of this research is to explore which organizational interfaces are related to project success, from a contractor's perspective, and how this can be improved. In order to assess which organizational interfaces are present on infrastructure projects an exploratory case study of four road infrastructure projects with integrated contracts, has been performed. Current literature shows that the definition of project success is different for each stakeholder on the project. Clients are mainly interested in indicators related to the outcome of the project. End users find a project successful when it meets their expecations. Contractors continue to value indicators related to costs, time and quality, most important. The research identified a number of organizational interfaces present on road infrastructure projects with integrated contracts at Heijmans, namely internal relations within Heijmans, the relation with the client and the relations with subcontractors. The case study has revealed there is a difference with respect to client type. In general, projects in cooperation with Rijkswaterstaat were more successful in comparison to projects with lower government organizations. The root cause for this difference in relationship is the level of knowledge and experience from the client. This difference results in controlling behaviour from the client which frustrates the process for the contractor, resulting in less control and lower project success. A good relationship between client and contractor is essential for project success.","Interface management; Contractor; Infrastructure; Road construction; Project management; Case study; Perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Recently landmarks have gotten a renewed interest in the field of LBS , although already a quite old phenomenon. In both the outdoor and indoor environment they are being used to enrich existing services such as navigation, but not used as the basis for a technique or service.<br/><br/>The indoor environment relies heavily on building specific and less-scalable sensor-based localisation techniques (such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), alternatives to sensor-based are becoming a necessity and would be a welcome addition. The exploration and development of landmark-based approaches for indoor localisation is something that can extend the field of geomatics and \ac{lbs}.<br/>This research investigates if a pure landmark-based approach works for indoor localisation and which characteristics of landmarks can be exploited. This is achieved by developing a conceptual framework that explores how a landmark-based indoor localisation would work from an artificial point of view. A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is implemented to evaluate if a landmark-based approach works and what needs to be improved or considered in future studies<br/><br/>Starting from an artificial test case, the MVP to achieve indoor localisation is implementing and evaluated using a manually digitised real-world and more complex test case. The fundamental principle of landmark-based localisation is that through the observation of landmarks within the (indoor) environment a user’s location is obtained because the visibility and location of landmarks are known. The workflow to go from an observation to a location is by 1) calculating the visibility/isovist area of each landmark, 2) interpret the observations into a combination of landmarks, 3) intersect the visibility of all landmarks in the observation, 4) refine the location based on relative landmark constellations, and 5) follow-up with questions on potentially visible landmarks to improve location further<br/><br/>One of the key giveaways of this research is that approach for indoor localisation a landmark-based is feasible, principles and techniques exist (or are being developed), it is only a matter of setting them up in the right order and format them to work, and connect input with the researched process and use them for LBS driven applications.<br/>Future work on the subject of landmark-based localisation and LBS is connecting with existing spatial standards, extend the principles into the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimension, and integrate more aspects of landmark salience.","Landmarks; indoor environment; location-based services; localisation; SQL; PostGIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

During Hurricane Harvey (August 25 - August 30, 2017), the precipitation reached a new record of 910 mm [36.2 inches] in a 4 day period in Houston. The gates of Addicks and Barker Reservoirs were opened during the night of 27-28 August which led to major damages due to downstream ﬂooding. Besides, non-government owned land upstream was ﬂooded due to high water levels in the reservoirs.<br/>In this report, new design water levels for Addicks and Barker Reservoir are calculated based on inﬂowing discharge into the reservoirs and precipitation directly onto the reservoirs, including data of Hurricane Harvey. These calculated design water levels are compared with the critical water levels calculated based on the failure mechanisms of the dams. This study shows that the original design water level of the dams, based on the Probable Maximum Flood, are 2.83 m and 1.01 m higher than the critical water level for which failure of the dams can occur due to piping for Addicks and Barker Reservoir. However, the maximum allowed water level which is currently maintained by the United State Army Corps of Engineers, is 2.19 m and 2.46 m below the calculated critical water level. During Hurricane Harvey, these maximum allowed water levels were exceeded with 3.46 m and 1.93 m.<br/>The damage of residential properties upstream and downstream of the reservoirs are minimized based on the distribution of excess volume from the inﬂow of creeks and precipitation onto the reservoirs. The ratio of the amount of volume which should remain upstream of the dams and the volume discharged into the Buffalo Bayou is calculated for every considered event with its duration and return period. The ratio of Addicks Reservoir is the dominant ratio, which should be used for both reservoirs. Run-off alone already produces damage, especially for the 12h and 24h precipitation, so the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs should not release discharge into the Buffalo Bayou for small durations. For events with a longer duration, it would cause less damage to open the outlets of the reservoirs than to keep them closed. However, if the water level in the reservoir exceeds the critical water level for piping, it is advised to discharge more to the downstream area to prevent breaching of the dams. Since the critical water level is reached for approximately 25% of the events at Addicks Reservoir, mitigations against piping should be taken to improve the minimization of damage. For Barker Reservoir, the critical water level is not reached in the optimization. During big events, people living upstream will be more affected by the ﬂooding than people living downstream since this optimization is based on the damage minimization of residential properties.<br","dam failure; design water level; flooding; damage; optimization; hurricane Harvey","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP225","29.71, -95.40"

(mentor); van der Spek, S.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Cities are on a constant move. People hurry from home to work, from business meetings to sports clubs, or from shopping tours back home. Cars, trucks, bicycles and scooters are rolling along streets, bringing people and goods to their destinations. But sometimes this never-ending movement staggers, and with it the dynamism that is the trademark of cities. <br/>Streets are lined with parked cars and trucks, congestions are clocking streets, the noise of horns are sometimes deafening, and smog levels are on a dangerous level for citizens. Cities are facing major challenges when it comes to one of the fundamentals of sustainable, prospering and liveable cities: the transportation of people and goods.<br/>More and more people will live in cities and enter the middle class. By 2030, 60 percent of the global population will live in urban areas. With entering the middle-class people also want to buy cars. Automotive analysts forecast that the current worldwide car fleet of 1.2 billion cars could double by 2030 (Shannon Bouton, 2015). <br/>The existing urban infrastructure cannot cope with such an increase of road vehicles in the future. Traffic jams are already in many cities unbearable and jeopardies the economic prosperity of countries. Los of time, wasted fuel, and increased cost of doing business are lowering nations GDP by around 2-4 percent. The world health organization estimates seven million premature deaths due to air pollution, occurred by urban transportation (WHO, 2014). Therefore, the current urban transportation has to be rethought to contribute to the future of liveable and sustainable cities. <br/>But most of the research on urban transportation focuses on developing sustainable passenger transport solutions. The debate focuses on the effects of car traffic in urban regions and not on the problems generated by freight movements (Philippe Lebeau, 2014). Urban freight transportation is the transportation of consumer goods, waste, raw materials and related services. <br/>Looking at the impact of urban freight transportation on cities, it can be considered as a major challenge for sustainable urban development. A study illustrates that 17 percent of the total road movements is related to deliveries and collections in the city of London and will rise in the coming years up to 25 percent (Hendy, 2011). In Brussels 25 percent of the CO2 emissions, 33 percent of particular matter and 32 percent of PM10 are produced by heavy duty vehicles (Philippe Lebeau, 2014). The stated numbers are general numbers for all urban freight movements. There are no specific numbers available about the share of the different freight flows on the negative impact on the city environment. But it can be expected that each flow has a significant share on the negative impacts. Therefore, the development of sustainable urban freight transport solutions should be anticipated by different professions. <br/>For the following research consumer good transportation is taken, due to the complexity of each freight flow. Consumer good transportation is the transportation of perishable goods (food, beverages, etc.) and non-perishable goods (electronics, clothes, furniture, parcels). <br/>The following research tests an alternative consumer good transport system and its necessary spatial implications for the city of Amsterdam, by utilizing alternative transport vehicles. <br/>Alternative transport vehicles, like drones, autonomous vehicles, cargo bikes, cargo trams etc. are an alternative to transport goods without trucks or vans. It could lead towards a more sustainable urban freight transportation. But these vehicles have specific spatial and infrastructural requirements as well as specific transport capacities. <br/>But there is no research about, how to apply spatially a different transport system with alternative transport vehicles to a specific urban context. This would be an important step to illustrate municipalities, residents and companies the positive and negative impacts on a city of a different transport system. It could help to steer decision maker towards sustainable urban freight transport solutions. Therefore, it is very important as spatial designer to contribute to the discussion on sustainable urban freight transportation with spatial solutions for a different transport system.<br/>To do so the following steps were taken. First the urban freight transport system of Amsterdam is analysed and the occurred negative impacts, congestions, noise pollution and air pollution are mapped. These problems will increase in the coming years even more, because of the growing e-commerce sector and population. <br/>New transport technologies, like autonomous vehicles, drones, shared mobility, or drones are promising to cope with the growing demand on deliveries and reduce the negative impacts of urban freight transportation on cities. <br/>To test the sustainable potentials and spatial effects of alternative transport vehicles a vision, Truck-Free Amsterdam, is formulated. It suggests banning all delivery trucks and vans from the inner A10 ring by 2040. To transport the demanded goods to the city three alternative transport vehicles are chosen. The analysis of alternative transport vehicles concludes, that cargo trams, boats and bikes are the most promising to reduce the negative impacts of the current transport system in the context of Amsterdam. <br/>To test the potentials of cargo trams, boats and bikes four test sites are chosen with different land use and existing infrastructure. The design strategy follows the GeoDesign approach by Carl Steinitz. Afterwards a conceptual city strategy is developed with the findings of the test sites. <br/>In conclusion can be said that the suggested alternative transport system is capable of transporting the same volume as the current system, by reducing the negative impacts of congestions, noise pollution and air pollution. The spatial implications are minor changes in the urban fabric and could give opportunities to develop additional public spaces. Further some streets in residential neighbourhoods could be developed into traffic calmed streets.<br/>However, with the suggested transport system some challenges will come. Not all products can be transported with the new transport system. Bulky, frozen and dangerous goods have to be transported by a different transport solution. Around the located large city distribution centres a high frequency of traffic will occur, which could lead to congestions and a disturbing noise level in the surroundings. Because of the demanded security fences, they will be separated islands of the surroundings and are hard to combine with other functions. Around the inner-city transport stops road traffic disturbances, a disturbing noise level and limited mobility of people through the fenced transport stops is likely to happen. This could lead to a relocation of specific functions and lowering the real estate price of the surrounding buildings. Another difficulty of the suggested transport system is to find mutual agreements on developing the new transport system with all delivery companies, which are now highly competitive. <br/><br/>With the growing urban population and the rising demand for home deliveries the current system will come to its limits. The suggested research suggests an alternative transport system and applies it to the city of Amsterdam. It is shows that the transport capacity is the same by reducing the negative impacts. The constrains of the new transport system should be taken into consideration if cities want to develop sustainable urban freight transport solutions.","Sustainable Urban Freight Transportation, Urban Metabolism, Sustainable Urban Development, Urban Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Urban Metabolism & Smart Cities","52.371649, 4.891163"

In mission architectures the habitat is considered a sub-system in the overall mission’s system architecture. In current mission engineering, the crew’s psychology is barely considered in the design of the mission. In aerospace engineering, one refers to Human Factors Engineering or Human Systems Integration. NASA did acknowledge the need of designing for habitability. (Connors et al., 1985). However, a method to address or assess this has not been found. It is thought that designing for habitability in the architectural design of the habitat is likely to decrease stresses on the crew and will therefore improve the crew’s performance.<br/><br/>The architect has to synthesise quantitative constraints, concerning the constructibility of the habitat as a sub-system, and qualitative requirements, related to the habitability of the architectural program organization, into one integrated design. For a mission to Mars, it was found that the mission architecture forms the baseline for the design parameters that the architect has to consider. The mission architecture, or concept of operations, will result in several baseline assumptions. Based on these assumptions the criteria for constructibility of the surface habitat can be quantified. In addition, the characteristics of the crew and their psychological and physical needs can be defined. These requirements will then form the driving parameters for the space architect’s design of the surface habitat.<br/><br/>During habitat development a continuous design iteration will be necessary between the architect and mission engineers as well as space psychology experts. The architect will develop the habitat’s configuration of system elements and organization of functional activities. In turn, the other experts will evaluate the proposal based on the constructability and habitability of the habitat system, therefore qualifying the design in terms of its feasibility. <br/><br/>Some preliminary criteria for the design evaluation of the surface habitat have been defined. The criteria related to constructability enhold, but are not limited to, fitting the budgets of mass, power, volume and the schedule as well as having the chosen sub-systems to meet the required Technology Readiness Levels and the building construction to meet the requirements for technical performance based on characteristics of the chosen location. The criteria related to habitability enhold, but are not limited to, meeting the physiological needs and safety measures for psychological well-being, facilitating privacy, engagement opportunities and autonomy, as well as a creating a positive perception of the enclosed space.<br/><br/>Finally, a design exercise was conducted to test application of the framework. The result of the preliminary design revealed insight in the complexity of the design task at hand and the need for a continuous interdisciplinary design iteration between experts from both mission engineering and space psychology. These iterations will be of vital importance in order to come to a final habitat design which will be feasible in terms of constructibility and habitability. The defined framework will form a starting point for shaping this design process, thus resulting in an evolvable design strategy.","Mars; Habitability; EDL; Space architecture; Design strategy; Architectural engineering; integrated design; Space psychology; ICE architecture; Human mission to Mars; Mission design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Rezaei, J. (graduation committee); Duinkerken, M.B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The rapidly growing market for online grocery shopping requires improvement of operations and remaining ahead of the competition. The online supermarket is a relatively new market and has other challenges than regular warehouses due to order sizes and the products it handles; both fresh and preserved, but also fragile products. This influences several processes in the warehouse, of which order picking is the most expensive part of the operation. Therefore, ways to improve the order picking performance have been examined, resulting in the following research question:<br/>How can the overall manual picking performance, from a human perspective, in a warehouse be measured and improved?<br/>There are six decision factors for order picking in a warehouse that influence the performance: layout design, storage assignment, zoning, batching, routing and technical equipment selection. Next, the following three types of human factors play a large role in the order picking performance: physical, cognitive and organizational factors. All these factors have been researched individually, but seldom in combination with each other. Therefore, the focus of this research is on the influence of technical equipment on the physical and cognitive factors.<br/>In the warehouse of Picnic, the picking process is a manual procedure, where order pickers walk around with (mainly) pick carts with totes on it. They receive order lines on the scanner which is attached to their wrist. There are significant differences in picking speed between different order pickers. The picking speed depends on experience, but also on the ease of performing a certain action like scanning a product or grabbing a product. The biggest challenges for Picnic are the reduction of the most time-consuming components of the pick process. The duration of each of these components can be measured with a time and motion study. <br/>A Predetermine Time and Motion Study is used to carry out the time and motion study. Order pickers walked their order pick rounds with an action camera attached to their heads to make recordings of the pick process. This footage is analysed by labelling the actions an order picker performs when picking an order line: looking at the scanner, grabbing the product, scanning the product, putting the product in the tote, scanning the tote, walking with the pick cart, walking without the pick cart, walking with the product, inputting the quantity into the scanner, searching for the product, making a mistake, talking to other pickers. The analysed footage is used to determine the times spent on each of the actions. After determination of the times spent per action, they were compared to the Methods Time Measurement (MTM-1) required times to determine the points of improvement. <br/>The relationship between the human factors and the actions of an order pick round have been determined. The order pickers can be divided into three groups; slow, medium and fast. The slow pickers take more time per action, they take more time walking, reading their scanner and picking the product. Fast pickers tend to combine more actions and therewith reduce time. The study also showed that there is more variance within the groups of the slow and medium pickers. The faster pickers are more experienced pickers. <br/>The most time-consuming actions when picking an order pick line are looking at the scanner (±15%) and walking (±25%). Looking at the scanner takes slow pickers almost twice as much time as medium or fast pickers. The slow pickers also spend more of their time walking with their pick cart than the medium and fast pickers. Next, the slow pickers walk slower than faster pickers. This results in more walking time for the slow pickers.<br/>Five alternatives to decrease the time spent on looking at the scanner and walking have been determined: <br/>1. Change the scanner interface, in the current interface the letters are too small and there is too much information displayed<br/>2. Optical head-mounted display, the removal of the action to lift and tilt the arm to be able to read the scanner will decrease the time to read the scanner<br/>3. More totes per pick cart, an increase in pick cart size results in shorter distances between consecutive picks and therewith reducing the total time spent on walking<br/>4. Automated pick carts, when pickers do not have to pull the pick carts anymore, they can walk faster<br/>5. Batching, batching products to totes and totes to pick carts based on location in the pick circuit, makes it possible to make short-cuts and thus reducing the time spent on walking<br/>The interest of both pickers and Picnic are taken into account to determine the best alternative. The human factors of the pickers, like physical inconvenience and learning curve, should be as low as possible. These are determined by comparing the alternatives to the current situation. The costs of implementing the alternative should also be as low as possible. The order lines per hour should increase as much as possible; the number of order lines per hour is determined by using a discrete event simulation model. <br/>The interest of the picker and of Picnic is determined for each of the alternatives. Trade-offs have been made between the human factors, costs and order lines per hour, resulting in quick-wins and long-term alternatives. The quick-wins are the improvement of the scanner interface and the increase of the number of totes per pick cart. The long-term alternatives are the optical head-mounted display and the use of automated pick carts. <br/>The two quick-wins have been implemented in the warehouse and the first results are promising, the increase of the number of totes per pick cart size seems to lead to a decrease in time per order line of 18%. However, this is based on a single pick round so no conclusions can be drawn yet. Also, the implementation of the improved scanner interface seems to work out well, the first reactions of the order pickers are that they can more easily read the scanners. However, also no conclusions can be drawn here since this has not been researched extensively. <br/>The picking performance is measured by determining the time spent on each element of an order line for an order picker. The most promising alternatives improve the picking performance in a warehouse where the operation is not completely automated. The future solutions are the use of automated pick carts and the use of optical head-mounted displays. <br","order picking performance; warehouse; time and motion study; Simio; online supermarket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Different representations have been used to create 3D reconstructions for AR and VR. Point clouds are one such representation that are characterized by their simplicity and versatility making them suitable for real time applications. However point clouds are unorganized and identifying redundancies to use for compressing them is challenging. For the compression of time varying or dynamic sequences it is critical to identify temporal redundancies that can be used to describe predictors and further compress streams of point clouds. <br/><br/>Most of the previous research into point cloud compression relies on the octree data structure. However this approach was used on relatively sparse datasets. Recently, new dense photorealistic point cloud datasets have become available with the ongoing standardization activities on point cloud compression. To compress them using existing octree based codecs is computationally expensive as the tree depth required to achieve a reasonable level of detail is much higher than what was used previously. We propose a point cloud codec that terminates the octree at a fixed level of detail and encodes additional information in an enhancement layer. We also add inter prediction to the enhancement layer in order to gain further bit rate savings. We validate our codec by evaluating it in the framework set up by standardization organizations such as MPEG. We then demonstrate an improvement over the current MPEG anchor codec.","Point clouds; Augmented Reality; Virtual Reality; 3D compression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This influx will be the most present in the Center and South districts of the city, districts that are known for their pre-war buildings. These buildings often lack mobility and accessibility needs for this target group. Suitable alternatives for people over the age of 65 with financial means that are currently living in the city center in canal houses are almost none existing. Therefor a new alternative for these ‘golden agers’ is desired. The project site is situated on the boundary of the old city center in a transition zone between the canal belt and 19th century expansion. The site, also know as the Applemarket, is a rare void in a dense city center area in which renewal of the current buildings almost never takes place. Therefor it makes it a great location for dwellings that suit the needs of this target group. Due to the lack of recreational green in the city center of Amsterdam and to counter the ambition of Amsterdam to densify the city, the site is approached as an open green space in which three buildings ‘land’. The Breaburn Ensemble is a composition of three buildings that occupy a small portion of this green space. Each building incorporates the green character of the site in a distinct way so it becomes part of the living quality of the individual dwellings. Also, public health &amp; care related functions on the ground floor of each building are integrated. Carefully designed floorplans offer the resident a level of luxury and living space they were used to and feature state of the art technical elements for comfort. The Breaburn Ensemble is an all in one concept for golden agers set in familiar surroundings in a new green heart of the city.","dwelling; amsterdam; elderly; luxury; housing; ensemble; floorplan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.369308, 4.876997"

Although this seems a positive development, the number of seriously injured cyclists due to bicycle crashes without motor vehicles increased rapidly in recent years. Within these crashes the infrastructure seems to play an important role and research towards the contribution of infrastructure characteristics to bicycle crashes without motor vehicles is needed because this is limited and especially research on more detailed infrastructure characteristics (e.g. bicycle path width) has not been done yet. This study aims to fill in parts of the knowledge gap between the safety problem and the lack of research done on the contribution of infrastructure characteristics. This study was done by using data from a survey held by VeiligheidNL. In total, 3146 cyclists that were treated at an emergency department responded to the survey and provided information on the crash location and the trip origin. A case-control method was applied in this study which compared infrastructure characteristics of case (crash) and control locations (no crash). The control locations were selected from the route of a bicycle crash victim. The design of the method included basic steps for the selection of the controls and four measures to lower the bias in the method and increasing the statistical power of the results. With the application of the case-control method to the data several results were found: First, the width of streets contributes to riding off the road crashes and handlebar collisions, whereas the width of bicycle paths next to bollards contributes to crashes with these objects. Secondly, the presence of intersections decreases the likelihood of kerb collisions. Thirdly, two-directional bicycle paths are more likely to induce bicycle-bicycle crashes and they possibly induce more severe crashes because frontal collisions were found more severe than same direction bicycle-bicycle crashes. And finally, the placement of bollards increases the severity of the injuries caused by the corresponding crashes. These findings could be used to further increase the quality of bicycle design guidelines such that future bicycle infrastructure could be designed safer.","Bicycle crashes; Road factors; Infrastructure; Case-control method; Single-bicycle crashes; Bicycle-bicycle crashes; Traffic safety; Bollard; Kerb; Injury severity; Bicycle path","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Schmehl, R. (graduation committee); van Hemert, Bernard (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is a field of engineering that utilizes tethered aircraft for the generation of electrical power. The potential for the application of AWE in deep-water offshore environments on top of floating foundations is enormous. Where conventional wind turbines would require a very stable platform to reduce motions at the nacelle, AWE requires just enough stability to survive extreme conditions, take-off and land horizontally, and not negatively affect cross-wind performance. The requirements scale well with increasing capacity of AWE systems, which mostly influences the mooring configuration instead of the steel structure. That is why Ampyx Power started an investigative study into the floating offshore application of AWE in collaboration with Mocean Offshore, MARIN and ECN.<br/>A driving factor in the design of the floating foundations is the maximum allowed motions in different sea states. The objective of this research is to determine the relative magnitude of the effect of platform motions on the landing performance. This will result in more clearly defined design requirements for both the floating platform and the aircraft. The method used in this research can be extended to more advanced numerical models at a later stage of the design to obtain quantified motion constraints or operational limits. <br/>It is assumed that standard deviations of several parameters at the end of the landing approach serve as good indicators of successful landings. A numerical model of a tethered aircraft (RPA) making a horizontal landing in time domain is developed to determine these parameters in a multitude of wind conditions. By performing a Monte-Carlo analysis, the standard deviations of these parameters can be acquired. Especially symmetric motions (X, Z and RY) are expected to affect landing performance, which is why a 3DOF model is used. Then harmonic platform motions are included in the model in order to investigate what type of platform motions are most critical. Finally, the platform designed by Mocean Offshore is examined. By combining the motion response of this platform with metocean data at a reference location, the standard deviation of critical parameters is obtained in comparison to an onshore application. The motion response of the platform is determined using a numerical model that combines potential theory with semi-empirical drag formulations. This model is validated with basin tests at MARIN.<br/>Simulations with harmonic platform motions indicate that both frequency and amplitude of platform motions are critical for the landing performance. The landing performance appear to be mainly related to the platform motion velocities. Therefore, increasing damping and added mass of the platform will both have a positive effect on the landing of the RPA.<br/>When looking further at the results of the simulations with platform motions based on metocean data and the hydrodynamic, numerical model, it was found that the current design of the floating platform by Mocean Offshore leads to an expected decrease in landing performance compared to the onshore application. The performance decrease is not insurmountable, and multiple methods of reducing the negative effects on landing performance are presented.<br","airborne wind energy; aircraft landing; hydrodynamics; aerodynamics; AWES; floating structures; renewable energy; Floating Wind Turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-02","","","","","",""

The Fairplayer is one of the J-class vessels that is capable of performing offshore installation work. The two 900 ton Huisman cranes can lift up to 1800 ton combined, but the insufficient static stability of the Fairplayer results in a maximum lifting capacity of 1000 ton in offshore conditions. This limited lifting capacity in offshore conditions is a missed opportunity to make use of the Fairplayer in a wider segment of the offshore installation market. In this research, the increase of static stability is obtained by the use of a sponson. A sponson is an extension of the hull, which can be seen as a local widening on the side of the Fairplayer. This sponson is expected to result in an increase of the total resistance. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the influence of the position and shape of a sponson on the Fairplayer with respect to the resistance. The influence of the position and shape of a sponson is analysed by the variation of the longitudinal position, the vertical position and the length over width ratio of the sponson. A combination of the Holtrop-Mennen method and the potential flow program RAPID is used to give an estimation of the increase in resistance. RAPID is used to calculate the influence of the wave-making resistance of the Fairplayer, whereas the frictional resistance is calculated according to the ITTC-57 flat plate friction formula and a form factor. It can be concluded that the position of the sponson turned out to have a significant influence on the wave pattern and therefore on the wave-making resistance of the vessel. The sponson can be positioned in a way that the wave system generated by the sponson interferes with the wave systems generated by the vessel. With this combination of the Holtrop-Mennen method and RAPID, a position of the sponson is found where the increase of the total resistance is minimized to 7%.","Jumbo Maritime; Sponson; Ship resistance; Dual draft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-02","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The thesis explores the necessity of change for the building stock of Amsterdam driven by the cities climate and densification targets, to develop a design of a retrofit for a building typology that maximizes the areas ability to reach these objectives. The area analysed for the retrofit design was a defined region in Amsterdam Nieuw-west, a current hotbed of developments that aim to regenerate the urban environment. The first demand explored is the need to reduce energy consumption in a building stock primarily made up of post-war buildings to achieve the drastic C02 reductions targets; a necessity which applies<br/>to all existing pre-energy-regulation buildings. Secondly, the demand to densify the city, as the population of Amsterdam continues to grow at a constant rate, fuelling the demand for accommodation and leaving it unmet by supply. The thesis sought to organize and quantify both these needs to identify a building typology that provided the best opportunity for retrofitting for both energysaving and densification, which formulated the following research question:<br/>How can the design of a retrofit measure offer integrated solutions to energy reduction and densification for a suitable residential building typology in the housing stock of Nieuw-West Amsterdam?<br/>The first part of the research question required identifying the suitable building typology, which was done by collecting available data to categorize and quantify the characteristics of the building typologies present in the area, including their energy demand, the ownership status, type of roof, etc. Together with densification strategies and benchmark energy-saving measures for each building typology a suitable typology approach was developed which identified the 1950’s Portiekflat, owned by social housing corporations, as the typology to base the retrofit design on, using top-up as the main densification strategy and replace and wrap principles for the energy aspect of the retrofit. Moreover, the final results for the most suitable typology showed an estimated C02 emission reduction of 19200 tons and an added capacity of 31900m2, which represents a potential C02 emission reduction of 5.8% and 2.5% increase in densification of the whole existing building stock in the area.<br/>The second part focuses on systematically formulating the design of the retrofit measure to understand the central design decisions for choosing different design solutions to form an overall design strategy. Together with the literature<br/>results, the main design aspects of the retrofit measure are identified that serve as elements of the design strategy.<br/>These include energy performance, accessibility, structure, and housing quality, to which individual approaches are developed for the widespread application of the building typology together with the packaged decision paths that lead to them. The resulting combinations of approaches provide the design strategy which integrates the design aspects of the retrofit measure together and provides the basis for the final retrofit design. At this stage, the design explores the technical solutions of the chosen design strategy for a case-study building, including the application of retrofit measures, construction, and the building services. However, the primary relevance and answer to the research question is provided by the design process, manifested by three final products, the retrofit for energy-reduction and topping up the toolbox, the design decision tool and design strategy brief, which provides the different integrations between design aspects given the design decisions. In conclusion, the final research at its core aims to offer a more significant incentive to social housing corporations by aligning Amsterdam’s need to densify with the need to energy-retrofit. In other words, densification can be used as fuel to power and accelerate an almost stagnant energy-retrofit rate which is missing the opportunity to tap into huge energy-saving potentials.","Retrofit; Densification; Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","City-zen","52.378450, 4.804316"

Blockchain technology could enable the commercial real estate industry to address these inefficiencies and inaccuracies.<br/><br/>This research focusses on exploring the different possibilities for integrating blockchain technology in the real estate management process. By analyzing the current real estate management process and gaining knowledge about the implementation of blockchain technology, the objective of this research is exploring in which phases of the real estate management process the process can benefit from the use of blockchain technology.<br/><br/>The research findings contribute to the knowledge of opportunities for broad implementation of blockchain technology in the real estate management process by providing a scientific based research document. It provides a broad overview of different opportunities and constraints for using blockchain technology in the process. It increases awareness for the disruption this technology might bring. This research provides scientific arguments for possibilities of implementing blockchain technology in the real estate management process and will function as a trigger for continuation of research into this topic.<br/><br","Real Estate Management; Blockchain; Blockchain technology; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data are available for the evaluation of training schedules, but a sound scientific<br/>method of accomplishing this does not yet exist. The biggest hurdle in developing such a method for cycling<br/>is the absence of an objective performance metric. This report uses the data of six cyclists in order to introduce<br/>and analyze a new performance metric: the cycled critical power. Subsequently, this metric is used to fit<br/>the parameters of the Fitness-Fatigue model; a model that is successfully applied in other sports to model the<br/>performance of an athlete. Several training attributes are included in the analysis, such as duration, intensity,<br/>and load; with which the performance of the cyclists is modeled. The model, applied to the data, leads to<br/>correlations for the six cyclists with R2-values within the range of 0.13 - 0.56. Compared to other scientific<br/>research, this range indicates that the Fitness-Fatigue model could be a valuable tool for elite cyclists and<br/>coaches when constructing their training schedules, but further research into the performance metric and<br/>the application of the Fitness-Fatigue model is still required.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The main cause of the erosion of the coastline, which is at some places as high as 1.5 km of land, is the deforestation of the green belt of mangroves for the purpose of building fishponds. This has disturbed the delicate sediment balance in the area drastically. The BioManCO project aims to develop a bio-morphodynamic model for mangrove mudcoasts like the coast of Demak, which will eventually be used to identify the conditions under which restoration of the sediment balance may lead to autonomous reforestation of a sustainable mangrove green belt and thus the natural coastal protection. A measure to restore this sediment balance that is already being implemented in the area is the construction of semi-permeable dams. It is not clear yet however, why some of these dams work as intended and why some do not. In an earlier study a 2DH model has been set up to better understand and optimise the design of these structures using the large-scale morphodynamics of the area. A large obstacle that the development of this model and the BioManCO model faces however, is the scarcity of data in these areas. The flow patterns around these semi-permeable dams have been identified in the model, but cannot yet be verified. <br/>The aim of this thesis is to visualise flow patterns around and the permeability of a selected dam in the field to be able to get a better understanding of the hydrodynamics of the area. As the coastal area of Demak is quite remote, low-tech drifters will be used for this purpose, made only of locally available, inexpensive materials. They will be released at different locations at different moments in the tidal cycle. Data acquisition will take place by visual observation and by a camera attached to a drone. An algorithm will be developed to process the data digitally. It will automatically detect the drifters in the images taken by the drone. Using several Ground Control Points, of which the GPS-coordinates are known, the images can be rectified, so that the relation between the pixels in every image and their location in the real world is known. Using this information and the pixel-coordinates of the detected drifters, the paths of the drifters can be extracted from the images in real-world coordinates. From these paths, flow velocites can be deduced. The permeability of the dam will be assessed by releasing milk into the flow in several configurations during which data will be acquired by means of a GoPro camera mounted above the semi-permeable dam. <br/>The results show, that tide is the main driving force behind the flow patterns around the dam focused<br/>on in this research. During falling tide, a circulation pattern can be seen, which is caused by a combination of the local bathymetry and a wind driven mass transport over the plot. The flow patterns however do not resemble the patterns found in earlier model runs of the area. The cause of this is<br/>thought to be the combination of simplifications in the model and the permeability of the dams, which is not taken into account by the model, but is shown to be influential by the permeability tests. These<br/>tests show that there is definitely mass transport through the dam considered, but also that this may not be universally applicable to all semi-permeable dams in the area, depended on their location. The drifter paths found by the developed algorithm resemble the visual observations convincingly. The found velocities are difficult to interpret, because of the large scatter on the found drifter paths. The scatter is believed to be a result of errors in the rectification process, which should be improved in the future if this technique is to be used more frequently. Also the design of the drifters and the flight plan of the drone should be revisited to increase the detected amount of drifters in the images. All in all, the technique does show great promise to acquire more data in this remote area, but needs further refinement before it can be used for scientific purposes.","Building with Nature; drifters; drone; image rectification; mangroves; mud coast; erosion; hybrid dam; permeable dam; current pattern; visualisation; BioManCO","en","student report","","","","","","Additional thesis.","","","","","","","BioManCO","-6.901509, 110.503917"

Though this role is often mentioned in articles, it has not been defined due to a gap in literature and a gap in practical knowledge on the subject. This research tries to reduce that gap, by understanding the municipal roles, goals, measures and means to steer urban area development projects better and by conceptualising the facilitating role. This is done by answering the main research question: ‘What does the role of a facilitating municipality in the urban area development process in the Netherlands entail?’. An extensive literature study and a case study with five embedded cases provide valuable information to answer that question. The facilitating role is part of a framework of four municipal roles to steer urban area development projects: shaping plans, regulating markets, stimulating markets and facilitating the process. The facilitating role is supported by three measures: acquiring market information and knowledge, managing market rooted networks and organising the municipal project team. These measures are supported by a set of means and pre-conditions. The facilitating role is about facilitating the process of urban area development and does not mean ‘letting go’, ‘laissez-fair’ or facilitate only market party stakeholders. The facilitating role can be played by the municipality in all phases of the life-cycle of an urban area and regardless of the form of public-private co-operation.","urban area development; Rotterdam; The Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this, a serious game was specifically designed to influence factors that have shown to influence student retention in other MOOCs. A randomized post-test only control group experimental design was used, in which the impact of the serious game on student retention was evaluated with quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires and the edX MOOC platform. While it was found that the serious game had a negative impact on the intrinsic motivation of students, it appeared that intrinsic motivation did not influence student retention in this MOOC, therewith explaining why no difference in student retention was observed between the control group and game group. This shows that in order to improve student retention in MOOCs with serious games, further research on factors affecting student retention in MOOCs is required first.","Serious games; MOOCs; Student retention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

Many resources are allocated towards ensuring its sustainable progress while one of the biggest uncertainties encountered lays in the offshore wind turbine's (OWT) foundations. In Europe, monopiles are the most widely adopted solution to found such structures in the subsoil. Owing to their large diameter and small L/D ratios, the response of these stocky monopiles remains unexplored. <br/><br/>This work is exploiting the merits of 3D finite element (FE) modeling to shed light into the dynamic response of such structures. A detailed design of an 8MW OWT is implemented while soil description is achieved by employing a state of the art constitutive model which encompasses the critical state theory of soils. Long time-histories (10mins) followed by rotor stop tests provide critical insight on the dynamic response of large OWTs. The transient evolution of frequency content of the OWTs response, the evolution of pore pressures during storm events, the role of permeability and the contribution of soil in system damping are some of the issues that are addressed in detail. <br/><br/>The effect of placing the monopile on soils of different capacity is examined by modeling sands of different relative density (DR=80%, 60%, 40%). Results show considerable dependence on the state of sand while for the loosest sand case, compliance of the structure to the exerted loads is recorded accompanied with a severe non-linear response. Furthermore, results indicate that permeability may have a non-negligible impact on the soil's contribution to damping at low loading conditions.","offshore wind turbine; monopile; sand; cyclic loading; hydro-mechanical coupling; bounding surface; dynamic analysis; natural frequency; permeability effects; soil damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-01","","","","","",""

During this period the social and economic development in the north and east of the country was disrupted. Due to this disruption a development opportunity for this region is the expansion of the fishery industry. In 2016, the Sri Lankan government proposed the Northern Province Sustainable Fisheries Development Project, in which the construction of a harbour at Point Pedro in the Jaffna District is included. This harbour should become the second largest fishery harbour in Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>This report covers the design study of the Point Pedro harbour project, the goal of this study is to design a safe, economically efficient and socially accepted harbour at Point Pedro. To achieve this goal, the following research question “How can safety, economic efficiency and environmental impact be combined optimally in a harbour design for Point Pedro in the Jaffna District?” is answered.<br/><br/>In figure XX, the final design of the harbour can be seen. This design is focused on the optimal combination between safety, economic efficiency and environmental impact. Because these criteria are conflicting, they are prioritized as follows: (1) safety, (2) economic efficiency and (3) environmental impact. Safety is provided by constructing breakwaters around the harbour, providing sheltered water conditions in the harbour basin. Also, the harbour entrance is constructed in a way that monsoon waves cannot directly intrude into the basin. Economic efficiency is accounted for by constructing the quay wall close to the central located fish processing facilities. This optimizes the supply chain, resulting in a smaller loss in the fish production (compared to the current situation). The costs are optimized by reusing all dredged material inside the breakwater or for land reclamation. Additionally, the location of the harbour entrance is minimizing the sailing routes as much as possible, without creating safety issues due to wave intrusion. Finally, the negative effects of social impact are limited by involving local fishermen and residents during the entire development process. Because these stakeholders are potential blockers of the project, it is important to include their opinions in the design. This can also be done by broadening the scope, in which touristic facilities and accommodations can be included in the project. Other negative impacts of the harbour can be either mitigated or minimized. However, because the environmental impact is determined as the least important criteria, it is not able to solve every issue. <br/><br/>This design is considered to be the most optimal combination for the harbour design of Point Pedro, regarding the criteria of safety, economic efficiency and environmental impact. It is recommended to EML Consultants that three characteristics of the proposed design should be implemented in their final design for Point Pedro: (1) apply building on the reef for land reclamation inside the harbour, (2) cluster the fish processing facilities near the unloading quay walls, because it optimizes the fish supply chain and reduces fish loss, and (3) construct the jetties for large boats (in the east of the harbour) as proposed, because it optimizes manoeuverability inside the harbour using minimal space. The final recommendation is to perform additional research to make a more accurate design, as the main limitation of the report is the limited amount of available data. Additional research should be done in the fields of; wave data, ground conditions over the entire harbour basin, cost estimation and sedimentation. <br","Fishery harbour; EML Consultants; Sri Lanka; Jaffna; Point Pedro; Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development","en","student report","","","","","","This report is made on behalf of EML Consultants in Colombo, Sri Lanka.","","","","","","","MDP 236","9.816667, 80.233333"
