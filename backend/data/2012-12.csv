(mentor); Van Lint, J.W.C. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); Van der Leek, C.W. (mentor)","2012","The increased transportation air movements in the past years has raised questions at the department of Airside Operations of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) regarding the safety, robustness, reliability and utilization of the airside traffic system. To get more insight to this future situation, the current situation is analyzed first. Rather limited information about the current traffic system was known, besides the fact it consists of the main artery the ‘Rinse-Hofstra road’ and the connecting roads towards the airplane stands. Another observation within the area of AAS is the fact that the research is performed in a complex multi-level actor environment, involving many different stakeholders. Also the variety in vehicles on the airside is very large. The four aforementioned aspects are analyzed in detail and resulted into different improvement possibility proposals. Regarding the safety aspect, several specific analyses are performed; using the black spot methodology, all unilateral and two-sided collisions of the past 8 years are analyzed. This methodology indicated that the main problem areas regarding safety are located at the beginning of the piers. Another analysis estimated an average damage costs of 1612.99 euro per collision, which indicated the fact that a reduction of collisions will directly result in (large) financial savings. Finally, it appears that ‘human errors’ are the most frequent causes for collisions. The second aspect of which the traffic system is analyzed is robustness: “the ability to fulfill the function of which the (traffic) system is designed for, even in non-regular situations which differ (strongly) from regular user conditions“ (Snelder, Immers, & Wilmink, 2004). It appears, using this definition, that the viaducts crossing the A4 highway, the tunnels and the beginning of the piers are not very robust for several reasons; this aspect resulted in mostly infrastructural related improvement possibilities, to make it possible to overtake other vehicles more easily and being able to reroute traffic more easily in case of an accident. The reliability of travel times is the third aspect the traffic system is assessed on, by performing travel time measurements with and without viaducts on the routes. It appears that the F-pier could be reached in the same travel time using the viaducts, coming from the tunnel, although these measurements result in slightly more constant travel times using the ‘viaduct-route’. With the additional proposed improvement possibility of increasing the speed on the viaducts from 30 to 50 km/h, the F-pier can be reached faster by the ‘viaducts-route’ and now the E-pier can be reached in equal time by both routes. Increasing the speed on the viaducts will result in an increased use of the viaducts, which will lead to an increased utilization; this is the fourth aspect in this research. To get more insight in the number of vehicles using the viaducts and other strategic locations within the system, traffic volume measurements are performed by placing three cameras on the airside. It appears that an increased traffic volume of almost 40% of the viaducts can be realized in this way, and so reduction of the same amount on the other route, resulting in an improved utilization. Concluding, a total of 15 different improvement possibilities, with corresponding implementation strategies, are proposed within this research, of which 5 improvement possibilities are resulted as the best improvement possibilities regarding costs, effectiveness (regarding the four aspects) and stakeholder support. These four improvement possibilities are: rerouting traffic over the viaducts to maximize the utilization of the network, increase the cooperation between stakeholders (mostly Airside Support and Airport Authority), add an extra (safety related) training component for new users, remove the current green pedestrian crossings and reduce the number of traffic signs to create a more clear overview.","optimization study; traffic system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

It protects the central Netherlands from the effects of the North Sea. It was constructed between 1927 and 1933, and runs from Den Oever on Wieringen to the village of Zurich in Friesland. It is 32 km long and 90 meters wide, rising to 7.25 meters above sea-level, with an incline of 25% on each side. At the location along the Afsluitdijk where the final water passage was closed (‘De Vlieter’), a lookout tower known as ‘The Monument’ was built in 1933. It was presented by the Zuiderzee Works Construction Company and designed by architect W.M. Dudok. The site has a statue of a “Steenzetter”, and also marks the inscription ‘A living nation builds for its future’. A statue of Cornelis Lely has also been erected near Den Oever on the Barrier Dam itself. The Afsluitdijk with The Monument are currently managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (“The client”). There is a restaurant at The Monument where the client has sublet it for private operator to manage it. With the anticipation of increase storm intensity and sea level rise in the future, the client had previously engaged a consultant to analyze the existing design of Afsluitdijk for a design storm of 1:10,000 years. According to the client, the result of the study concluded that the standard cross-section of Afsluitdijk is not sufficient to withstand the design storm of 1:10,000 years, hence, modifications of it are required. The study also found that during the design storm, there is a significant overtopping over the dike. The client is concerned about the significant overtopping found from the previous study may have adverse impact on the non-standard cross-section of the dike where The Monument is located. Therefore, the client has requested our design team to look into the dike section at The Monument location.","afsluitdijk; overtopping; sea defence","en","student report","TU Delft - Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This led to the development of the Footprint. A concept which utilizes contemporary 3D printing technology in an altered state to fabricate shoes on a non planar build surface. To prove the feasibility of the concept a functional prototype was created from a modified 3D printer. A custom control system for the creation of tool paths and machine code for Curved Layer Fused Deposition Modeling (CLFDM) was created and successfully applied to print shoes on a rotating abstraction of a last-shape, which was mounted in the printer. With further development, the technology could be applied for the fabrication of functional footwear. Superior material properties because of controlled material directions, proven in research done by other institutions, suggest the technique can be applied to a variety of other high-end product categories.","footwear; shoe; 3D print; 3D printer; additive; digital fabrication; custom; customization; footprint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","A continuous population growth and increasing energy demand combined with depleting traditional energy reserves puts a pressure on conventional methods of electricity generation. The desire and ambition to create a more sustainable society paves the way for the ‘renewables’. Hydropower or Hydroelectricity already plays a significant role in global energy production, especially the large hydropower plants with giant reservoir lakes. The contribution of small and micro hydropower however is not really clear. Smaller hydropower plants have some advantages compared to larger plants in terms of sustainability, local benefits and electricity supply in remote areas. The exact location of potential hydropower plants is mostly unknown and the total potential of all combined hydropower capacities for a certain region has not been evaluated as well. This research aims to give insight in the potential of hydropower for a specific region and distinguishes micro, small and large hydropower. In order to evaluate the global hydropower potential a systematical method has been developed to simulate input data and check whether there is hydropower at a specific location. The approach is based on a distributed model and raster data. The world is divided into cells with a 3” (three seconds or 92m near the equator) resolution. For each and every cell the hydropower capacity is systematically determined. In order to do this the two basic components for hydropower, head and discharge need to be evaluated for each cell. The discharge is calculated with help of the HydroSHEDS’ DEM and DIR datasets combined with the GRDC Runoff fields’ dataset. Based on the Flow Direction, derived by HydroSHEDS a ‘runoff weighted’ flow accumulation was executed to obtain the accumulated runoff for each cell which is converted into discharge. The head is calculated with the cell size and slope within each cell. The slope was derived from a global 3” DEM which has been modified with the discharge map to obtain a RiverDEM which forms the basis for the slope calculation. Hydropower is calculated within each cell using the Input Variables ‘turbine efficiency’, ‘minimum discharge’ and ‘minimum head’. The results are filtered into micro, small and large hydropower locations. To give insight in the total hydropower capacity for a specific region the total hydropower is accumulated per category for a region of 0,50 degree times 0,50 degree (about 50 km2). The final output is a global map of accumulated hydropower per category with a resolution of 0,50 degree. It is computed that the total gross theoretical hydropower capacity potential is about 20TW with Asia as the largest contributor. Large hydropower accounts for over 80% of this potential while micro hydropower only accounts for 2% of the total potential capacity. This paper demonstrates new, insightful images on spatial hydropower distribution, showing that Colombia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Madagascar are examples of areas with extensive hydropower potential. Overall this study provides a consistent global modeling approach that allows both a quick comparison of hydropower potential between regions as detailed information on a specific hydropower location.","hydropower; runoff; digital elevation model; discharge simulation; flow accumulation; flow direction; hydropower potential; hydropower capacity; head; slope; raster; cell; energy; sustainable; DEM; DIR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2012","The staggering advances in mobile phone industry and wireless technologies have led to abundance of wireless and cellular standards over the past few years. Most of the emerging radio standards (such as 4G LTE and WiMax) require flexible RF transceivers capable of handling various bandwidths and modulation scheme. Meanwhile, the demand by manufacturers for miniaturization, power and cost reduction have compelled further integration of RF transceivers by juxtaposing multiple RF SoC cores on a single silicon die. The prominent challenge in multi-radio chips is blocker interference. Blocker constraint in cellular radios is very stringent, requiring external SAW filters or high performance duplexers. However, SAW filters are bulky and expensive; plus, they reduce the receiver flexibility and degrade the RX sensitivity by a few dB. To circumvent these issues, “true SAW-less” receivers (by removing the SAW filter at the input of the RX) have been proposed in the literature. To achieve the ultimate flexible and multi-core radio operation, wide-band RX RF front-ends robust against interference, in excess of the requirements usually specified by a radio standard, are required. In this work, a highly selective, very linear LNTA capable of large-signal handling for current-mode RX front-ends is proposed and implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology. It is shown that by combining the on-chip high-Q bandpass filters with a push/pull class-AB common-gate stage, a large desensitization point (B1dB) and large-signal IIP3 of +8 dBm and +20 dBm, respectively, can be achieved, with 1.5 V supply voltages and 7.5 mA current consumption. Meanwhile, by applying noise cancellation technique, via an auxiliary push/pull class-AB common-source stage, a moderate NF of 5.9 dB is possible, which is a very competitive number for such value of B1dB.","LNTA; large-signal hanldling LNTA; common-gate; RF receiver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Serdijn, W.A. (mentor)","2012","Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a method for treating diseases like Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and various other movement disorders. An Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) is placed in the chest and wires are run through the neck to provide electrical pulses to a certain target in the brain via an electrode. Results with this treatment are good but today’s stimulators are bulky and last only three to five years. Furthermore the electrode and pulse generator are often placed in two different surgeries. The device should be miniaturized so that it can be placed in the skull while inserting the electrode. This reduces the number of placement surgeries and eliminates lead failures. The size of the device is dominated by the battery volume, however no compromises on battery life can be made since battery replacement requires, again, surgery. Switching to a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery that can be recharged through the skin is a way to reduce battery size without compromising the lifetime of the device. Lithium-Ion batteries are, however, delicate devices and should be charged and discharged with care. The classic method to ensuring safe charging of these types of batteries is the Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) method. Here a fixed current is pushed into the battery until the battery reaches its maximum voltage. After this the voltage is kept constant and the current slowly decreases to a small fraction of the initial current. Although this method ensures safe and complete charging of Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries it also has some downsides. The abrupt switch from constant current to a constant voltage might introduce stability issues. Furthermore, characteristics of a battery vary depending on their state of charge and this is not taken into account by this algorithm. In this research a possible new algorithm that smoothly regulates charge current is investigated. It turns out that this algorithm is slightly less efficient and slower than the classical CCCV method. The best method to charge the battery of an implantable device is via the CCCV method. An implementation of this method is proposed where both Constant Current (CC) and Constant Voltage (CV) phases are controlled by the same control loop and the transition between the two phases is a smooth hyperbolic tangent function. An inductively powered system was designed that reaches an average efficiency, in circuit simulation, of 87.36% from antenna output to battery. For this implementation, the rectifier is the only part in series with the inductive link and the battery. The efficiency is therefore mostly limited by the diodes used for the AC to DC rectifier. An prototype of the designed system was built and the correct operation of the system was verified by wirelessly charging a 160mAh Li-Ion battery. The results of the performed measurements showed that the inductive link had a poor power transfer efficiency. Mismatch between the resonance capacitor value and coil inductances caused the resonance frequency to deviate from the desired value. The efficiency of the charger was, as expected, mostly determined by losses in the rectifier. Further research should be done in optimization of the inductive link to provide good efficiency even when the device is poorly aligned with the charger. Furthermore the parameters of the system should be tuned to a medical grade battery and the possibility of combining the power transfer with data communication can be investigated.","Li-Ion Charger; DBS; CCCV; wireless charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Biomedical Electronics Group, Electronics Research Laboratory","","BioMedical Engineering, Biomedical Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Van der Duin, P.A. (mentor); De Bruijne, M. (mentor); Waffenschmidt, S. (mentor)","2012","To deal with external changes and the current position of Rheinmetall Air Defence (RAD), it was decided that RAD’s current business model should be modified such that RAD will become a systems integrator. This research examined the potential transition towards this new business model with a focus on the involvement of external partners and the potential problems associated with this change. To analyze this, extensive research is needed due to the complexity of the proposed new situation and the difficulties associated with the transition to this situation, such as the resulting interactions within the firm and with external partners. This research examined the transition using a practice-oriented case study where all factors that play a role were studied in detail. The outcomes of this research are relevant for both RAD and for other firms similar to RAD that are undergoing this transition. If some influencing features of RAD are kept in mind; RAD is a defence contractor, and produces small numbers of products to customer order. The main focus of this research is the transition of RAD’s current business model to that of a systems integrator with a special focus on the involvement of external partners in the development process. The current situation is analyzed first, after which the potential problems and consequences for RAD of the desired business model are analyzed. There are many expected problems as the change in business models is quite significant. The resulting research question is: “What problems could RAD face by changing the business model to become a systems integrator?” To analyze this question the cyclic innovation model (CIM), a fourth generation innovation model, combined with the transaction cost theory is used. This combination was chosen because every contact between the stakeholders in the CIM can be seen as a transaction with the resulting costs in the transaction cost theory. The aim of this combination was to explain the cycles of the CIM. This research shows that the CIM is able to analyze the change and point out important differences between the current and the desired future business model of RAD. The transaction cost theory proved to be less useful as decisions in the current situation are not influenced by the transaction costs, but by the firm culture, and there is no influence at all from the external partners. The analysis of the current situation showed that there are several problems with the timing and collaboration of external partner involvement, and with the low inter-department collaboration within RAD. RAD being a defence contractor also has a very large influence on the involvement of external partners. This limits the number of external partners, especially as governments are the only customers, and there are they impose restrictions and have request with regard to knowledge sharing. Also, RAD is a project based firm, and all of the products are adapted to specific client needs and only small series are produced. Therefore, the transaction costs and other nonrecurring costs are more important. The use of CIM showed that there are major differences between the current situation and RAD’s view of the future. The most important change for RAD is the change in responsibility; they become a prime contractor toward the client. This means that RAD will have to advise their clients on how they can best solve their air defence problems and provide lifetime support for the chosen systems. RAD will have to translate these problems into requirements for components. These components are then produced by external partners as well as by RAD itself, and integrated by RAD into working systems. This new approach is completely different form the way RAD previously worked, where almost everything was developed and produced in-house. After evaluating the situations with the described models, there are several recommendations to aid in the transition process. First of all, RAD should ensure that a systems integrator model is the right approach and that it is supported by the external partners. If ultimately the decision is made to change the strategy, the internal capabilities and external connections should be changed to support this. Some of the capabilities that have to be obtained are the capability to develop a base platform and the capability to work and communicate with external partners. This already starts with improved internal collaboration and overcoming the existing internal problems. RAD should also take the time to work out how to best transition to the new business model, and to define the new business model in more detail so that it can be used in the daily operations. This change should be gradual so that the current operations are not disturbed. The main issue is that this change will take time and is not without risk of failure. During the planning, attention must be paid to the outlined potential problems in order to avoid or mitigate them as much as possible. The most important cause of problems is that a major change process is required to reach the desired future situation; this also requires a change of culture within RAD which could prove to be quite difficult. More importantly, there are current internal problems that must be addressed. The internal situation must be rectified in order for the transition to the new business model to be successful, and for greater involvement of external partners to occur. Currently the main problems are related to inter departmental communication and collaboration and the current timing of the involvement of external partners. RAD should not try to change to quickly, and must first solve these internal problems before external partners are able to become involved. Once this occurs, the external partners must accept RAD's new role as systems integrator for the future situation to be successful. For the change to be successful is RAD also dependent on the external partners in as far as that they have to accept RAD in the new role as systems integrator. Even when a change strategy and new business model are carefully planned and developed, it is not possible to determine if the end result will be positive. RAD should confirm that a system integrator business strategy is the best option by considering all the possible problems that might occur. If RAD decides to move ahead with the change, it must be well planned, and a close eye has to be kept on potential problems in order for them to be resolved as quickly and as efficiently as possible.","new product development; external partners; collaboration; Cyclic Innovation Model (CIM); transaction cost theory; open innovation; system integrator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Section of Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Boersema, T. (mentor)","2012","This thesis describes the development of the redesign of the ZappoTV smart phone app. ZappoTV is a mobile media center for TV. With the app the user can select video, music and photos from various sources and play it on UPnP/DLNA enabled devices, like smart TV’s and set-top boxes. The current ZappoTV has issues concerning usability and user experience. These aspects are underdeveloped, since the focus up to now has been on functionality: simply making it work turned out to be hard enough. The ambition os ZappoTV Inc. is to make the app very successful. The aim is to realize a big user base through a new interaction model for the functional base that is established. Therefore, the main goal of the assignment is: ""Identify factors influencing the success of mobile Apps comparable with the ZappoTV App. Assess these success factors in terms of the following aspects: User-Product Interaction (user flow, usability and ergonomics), User Experience, Emotions and Attractiveness (beauty, look and feel)."" In the Analysis section various topics are studied: the current ZappoTV app, the company, the market and the target group. The market of smart TV’s is growing and smart phone usage is increasing. Services in the fuzzy domain between TV and smart devices, broadcasting and online content are emerging quickly. The success factors are addressed by analysing competitors and other successful apps. Various app guidelines and good practices are used to assess what make these apps so successful. Then, the step to a practical implementation is made: the Problem Definition and the Programme of Requirements for the future ZappoTV are composed. The Problem Definition is concluded with the Design Goal: ""Design a Smart Phone app with which the user is able to manage his/her media and play it on a Smart TV. The interaction should be empowering and engaging to the user."" The Synthesis section starts off with the establishment of the Vision for ZappoTV. The Interaction Vision is: ""Explore a City"" First, a functional structure and information structure is presented. Functions were grouped under stages, e.g. Play and Select. The most important stages should have emphasis in the design. Then the creative part is started: numerous sketches of views, buttons, icons, colours and arrangements of elements were created and are discussed. The result is the Final Concept. The biggest innovation is derived from the Interaction Vision: the content selection is done through navigating and exploring a map. The Discover stage as it is called provides a adventurous experience, much like zapping. In the Simulation & Evaluation section first the creation of prototypes is discussed. Several paper prototypes and three digital prototype were created. The digital prototypes are websites adapted for mobile devices and could be tested on a mobile device. Especially interesting to simulate and test was the user’s interaction with the Discover stage. The evaluation consists of subjecting the final digital prototype to User Testing and consulting a group of expert app users about it. Both groups were positive, curious and enthusiastic about the design. They liked the visual language and ease of use of the interface. Some possible improvements were mentioned and are processed in the Final Design. Ultimately, the Final Design is presented. All stages are treated in detail. The basis for the stage lay outs is a visual language. This language will be defined and explained in the Style Guide. This document provides guidance for future design decisions for the app, but also to make other channels like the website consistent with the app. A lot of effort has been put into making the new ZappoTV interface consistent, clear, attractive, empowering and engaging. This was achieved to a high extent, but some further steps have to be taken before the redesign can be implemented. These steps are discussed in Recommendations.","app; zappotv; media management; upnp; dlna; interface; usability; user experience; style guide; mobile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-12-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

At the same time Schiphol research has indicated, that departing passengers want to be relieved from stress and baggage hassle in an early phase of their journey towards Schiphol. Combining both the need for terminal capacity pressure relief and the need for an increased quality of the passengers ground travel process to Schiphol, Schiphol has chosen to research the possibilities for implementing remote check-in (CI) and baggage drop-off (BD) processes at off-terminal locations. Therefore the objective of this research is: To develop a framework, that can decide on remote check-in & baggage drop-off location suitability and can state location design choices that have to be made, in order to make a remote check-in & baggage drop-off location service design, from which an estimation of potential quality increase and potential terminal capacity relief can be extracted. Furthermore, the service design should satisfy security legislation, be financially feasible and should take future developments into account. Approach An extensive literature study has been done on remote CI and BD, in order to formulate 4 success criteria. These criteria are derived from theory and practical experiences. Recent and past literature on remote CI and BD, literature on transportation services and customer needs, and literature on check in and baggage drop-off functionality are combined with documented practical Schiphol remote CI and BD experiences. These success criteria with associated requirements were then used to develop the framework. This framework consists of three parts. The first part estimates location feasibility according to five steps, the second part states location design choices that are needed for the service design and from the third part a functional process design is used for detailed remote CI and BD service design. Then this framework is applied to 4 potential remote CI and BD services. From the application of the framework a detailed location design is extracted. Success criteria four criteria for the success of remote CI and BD design are stated. Passenger usage, airline industry cooperation and support, check-in and baggage drop-off functionality and availability of space. Passenger usage is related to the quality of use, the quantity of use and the service cost. The airline industry cooperation and support is related to requirements several stakeholders have, before participating in a remote CI and BD service. CI and BD functionality is related to all the functional requirements that must be fulfilled to facilitate CI and BD . Finally, the availability of space is related to the crucial types of space that are needed for a remote CI and BD service. Conclusion With the application of the framework, it became clear that the WestCord Fashion Hotel is the most feasible location for remote CI and BD, if common use can be applied. The main reason for this is, that the estimated quality gain, due to the lack of a direct public transportation connection to the airport is expected to be large. Due to this large quality gain, passengers are more likely to be willing to pay for the service. And if passengers are more willing to pay for the service, the chance of a closing business case is largest. A closing business case is needed for the participation of all relevant stakeholders needed for setting-up a remote CI and BD service. The train service was estimated to not have a sufficiently large budget for a remote CI and BD service. A service for all potential long term parkers at P3 is found unfeasible, due to the lack of the estimated passenger’s unwillingness to pay for the service. This is caused by the insufficient quality increase that is expected. The Home pick-up service can be feasible only if mobile CI and BD devices can be connected to an airlines Departure Control System and passenger and baggage transport are offered to the passenger.","Schiphol; remote check-in; remote baggage drop-off; airport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""

(mentor); Van der Ven, F.H.M. (mentor); Brolsma, R. (mentor); Kleerekooper, L. (mentor); De Jong, S.A.P. (mentor)","2012","Urban areas are confronted with higher temperatures compared to rural areas during summer. Buildings, roads and paved surfaces store the heat during the day and then release it slowly during the evening keeping urban lands hotter than surrounding areas. This phenomenon is called Urban Heat Island effect and the differences can be up to 8°C. A rise in mortality and decrease of work productivity are only some of the consequences. To see if and how vegetation, and water can mitigate this urban heat island effect, measurements are done in the city of Rotterdam, using temperature sensors, sap flow measurements and DTS by fiber optic cables. Measurement results of the temperature sensors show that temperature differences between an urban area and a small park within this urban area can be 3°C, when air temperatures are 25°C. Under these circumstances, temperature in the park is equal to the temperature measured outside the city, meaning that the urban heat island effect is abolished in the park. The results also shows that the urban heat island intensity for the city of Rotterdam is the largest during the night and can be up to 7°C. Trees can help mitigate the UHI by evaporating sap which is transported through the trunk to the leaves. The measurements show an increase of sap flow going further in the growing season, starting from about 10 liter per day towards over 500 liters a day. When this amount of water is divided by the surface area of the tree crown, the considered trees can evaporate 4.5 mm/day. The cooling effect of surface water is hard to measure, mainly because it is not possible to compare the temperature just above the water surface with temperatures above paved surface at the same time. It can be seen that water is a good mitigation measure, because DTS measurements show that a minimum of 14% of daily incoming solar energy is absorbed by surface water. DTS show also that the cooling effect of trees can be up to 5°C, partly by providing shade and partly by evaporation of water through the leaves. The same measurements show that the cooling effect by shade of trees is larger compared to the cooling effect by shade of buildings. When water evaporates form a paved surface this results in a decrease of air temperature. The measurements show that this decrease can be 2°C close to the ground when 1 mm of water evaporates and up to 6°C close to the ground when an infinite amount of water is available. Towards a height of 2 meter, the cooling effect decreases to 1°C and 2°C respectively. The directly measureable cooling effect of vegetation is larger than the cooling effect of water. This is mainly caused by the fact that a large part of the cooling effect of trees is provided by shade, which is of course absent with water. Nevertheless, water is a good mitigating factor of the UHI. Surface water is very use full to absorb incoming solar energy.","Urban Heat Island","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2012","Research over the past several years has identified a convergence of the technology trends mobile computing and cloud computing into mobile cloud computing. While the term ‘mobile cloud computing‘ is often used to refer to the complementary benefits of mobile cloud based services, some translate the cloud vision from access to remote cloud resources in large data centers to local shared and pooled cloud resources consisting of mobile devices. Technical literature has showed the technical feasibility of this approach, however literature fails to show the practical viability of the local cloud approach for mobile business services that could be exploited to create value for organizations. This study evaluates the feasibility and viability of mobile business services enabled by mobile cloud computing that can be exploited by business enterprises. The research approach was design oriented and exploratory in nature. A literature review was conducted in order to identify technological opportunities and enabling capabilities of mobile cloud computing for mobile business services were. In addition, based on business model literature a framework was constructed that provides a blueprint of the process from the identification of a potential business service idea to business exploitation within an organization. This framework was applied to the business model outline of a potential local cloud based mobile business service. The results of this study indicate that the feasibility and viability of mobile business services enabled by mobile cloud computing is influenced by four aspects. First of all, the feasibility and viability depends on depends on the approach to mobile cloud computing. Secondly, the feasibility and viability is negatively influenced by security, privacy and trust issues, limitations regarding performance, reliability and scalability, and compatibility issues. Thirdly, the feasibility and viability seems to be negatively influenced by a lack of knowledge of how the technology should be designed in order to realize potential local cloud based business services. Fourthly, the feasibility and viability seems to be negatively influenced by the mismatch between technology and market need. The suitability of the technological opportunities and enabling capabilities of local cloud approach to mobile cloud computing are very context dependent and are not driven by solving business problems. All four aspects impact the feasibility and viability of mobile business services enabled by mobile cloud computing that can be exploited by business enterprises. With regard to the future of mobile cloud computing it can be suggested that organizations should be more involved in the development phase for identifying and matching customer needs and for the development of potential mobile cloud service concepts. It is expected that this will drive the development and diffusion of mobile cloud computing concepts in the future.","mobile cloud computing; mobile business services; business models; mobile service innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-20","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Van de Weerd, A. (mentor)","2012","Goal of this project was to get a better understanding of the producing formations in the two doublets in the Van den Bosch Geothermal energy concession in Bleiswijk. It can be concluded based on the GR logs in VDB-04, the lithologs, End Of Well reports, a Biostrat log in VDB-04 and the seismic interpretation that the first doublet (VDB-01 & VDB-02) produces from a combination of the Rijswijk Member and another aggradational stacked sand formation. The second doublet (VDB-03 & VDB-04) produces from the Delft Sandstone. It is expected that producer and injector in each doublet have good communication and interference between the doublets is absent because the reservoirs are separated by the Rodenrijs Shale and production pressures and rates are constant for years. A regional well log correlation based on Maximum Flooding Surfaces is carried out to put the interpretation of the reservoir sands into a regional context with the surrounding oil fields. Using seismic interpretation the thickness and lateral extension of the Rijswijk and Delft reservoirs is determined. With these interpretations a static model is built of the reservoirs of the two doublets. In the second part of the project, field data from the past four years of production is analysed. The data consists of production rates, pump pressures and a well test in VDB-01. Using a Monte Carlo simulation ranges of the average permeability are calculated. The ranges of the average permeability are 200-500 mD in the Rijswijk and 300-600 in the Delft Sandstone. The main uncertainties in these estimated ranges are the Flowing Bottom Hole Pressure (FBHP) calculations, the skin and the thickness of the formation. In a history match exercise, production is simulated in a Dynamic model in Eclipse 100. The tuning parameter is the average horizontal permeability. In addition the influence on the simulation results of the vertical permeability, the skin and the fluvial shape factors is investigated. Resulting ranges of the average horizontal permeability are similar to those calculated with the radial inflow Monte Carlo simulation: 100-300 mD for the Rijswijk and 300-400 mD for the Delft Sandstone. Simulations show that the vertical permeability has a large influence on the reservoir performance and is therefore an important uncertainty. An initial estimation of the Rijswijk kvertical is 70% of Khorizontal and 22/386*khorizontal in the Delft Sandstone. This is based on earlier studies. Especially in the Rijswijk situation, the estimate may be too large. If the vertical permeability decreases, the horizontal permeability should increase to compensate in the history match. In that case the average permeability range approaches the results from the radial inflow equation analysis more. The well test was plagued by wellbore effects and a too short build-up period. Therefore no reliable parameters could be derived and compared to the radial inflow analysis and history match results. However the analysis showed that a well performed well test could give insight in skin, average permeability and flow boundaries.","geothermal energy; static reservoir model; lower cretaceous","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The needle penetrometer is a device which gives an indication of the Uniaxial Compressive Strength(UCS) by pushing a needle in a rock and measuring both the penetration depth and the applied force. More specific; research has been done to different needle types, the upper strength limit of the needle penetrometer, the effect of saturation and the relation between the force and the penetration depth. These limits were tested and found with multiple different needles and on multiple different samples. As far as the needles concerned, the Chenille 22 needle is a very good replacement for the Maruto needle. The upper strength limit of the needle penetrometer depends on the needle that is used and the strength of the rock. The average upper limit is around 10 MPa. The cause of this is that there are deviations at the upper strength limit. These deviations make the results of harder rocks less reliable, such as a non-linear penetration rate when gradually putting more pressure on the needle . Saturated rocks are weaker than their dry counterparts. The last conclusion in this study is that the needle penetrometer isn`t the right tool to acquire the data necessary to conclude anything meaningful about the F/d relation, other than that the relation seems to be linear.

(mentor)","2012","Dredge plumes and ecology have become increasingly intertwined in recent history; one of the more prominent reasons behind this is the influence of clouds of fine sediments released in the open water due to dredging (`dredge plumes') on for `sensitive receivers' such as coral, seagrass and mangroves. An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in combination with a cost-benefit analysis could be a valuable instrument for deciding on ecological impact. When dealing with ecology, it is important to realize that nature is not a harmonious, calm state: in fact, it could be considered to be at best only approximately in equilibrium, where small scale changes could lead to a completely new equilibrium. In the case of dredging operations and ecological effects, this is even more relevant because ecological effects occur constantly; not just due to dredging. An ERA consists of a description of the system and its components, hazard identification, effects assessment, exposure assessment, risk characterization and an evaluation which provides feedback for a possibly updated system description. Globally following the steps in an ERA, exposures are looked at first. Relevant dredging exposures are suspended sediment concentrations and sedimentation. The source of this is the dredging equipment, which spills fine sediments in the open water. These sources lead to dynamic plume, which consists of interacting, complex three-dimensional fluid motions: sediment characteristics, bathymetry and dredging equipment type are just a few of the influencing factors. Because there motions are often still too complicated to model, the dynamic phase is captured in conservative estimates. These estimates serve as a source term for the passive plume phase. During the passive plume phase, advection and diffusion are dominant processes which are well understood processes. MIKE 21/3 or Delft3D, both hydrodynamic and transport models, can be used to schematize the passive plume. Once a passive plume reaches a sensitive receiver, in this document assumed to be coral, seagrass or mangroves, effects can occur. It is important to realize that these effects do not have to be induced solely by dredging: other background effects can also provoke effects in sensitive receivers. Effects can be classified in discrete classes, ranging from growth to mortality. To which extent a receiver exhibits a certain effect depends on the receiver characteristics, the shape of a temporal variable exposure and the type of exposure. In an attempt to properly catch the effect of temporal variable exposures, several models are discussed with most prominent being two originally toxicological models. Given their background these models appear to be limited to exposures which mimic a toxic exposure, although they are relatively easy to implement. At the other end of the spectrum are the energy budget models: models which try to describe important processes which together form an individual. While this is a more complete and holistic approach, there is concern regarding the uncertainty of the final answer given the large number of parameters (relative to the toxicological models) and the attributed uncertainties. Combining these exposure and effect models in dredging practice and explicitly stating their (combined) uncertainties leads to a risk assessment for dredging practice. A part of this risk assessment was applied to field data regarding coral cover for a number of coral reefs, but the field data showed no strong correlation between exposure and changes in coral cover. Nonetheless, for a quantitative assessment of ecological risks, a probabilistic analysis is invaluable. This can lead to a proper valuation of the risk of effects, which in turn can be used in a cost-benefit analysis to properly weigh these risks if they are acceptable or not when compared to the benefits.","dredge plume; ecological risk assessment; probabilistic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Boons, F.A.A. (mentor); Ghorbani, A. (mentor)","2012","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology. The horticulture sector in the Netherlands is facing economic difficulties, which have become more severe since the crisis of 2008. The innovation strategies the growers select to stimulate their organizations, are identified as part of the problem. The dominant presence of some innovation strategies, mainly cost-reducing and volume-increasing strategies, bring down the cost price of products, but fail to bring the organizations prolonged benefits. Due to mechanisms in the market, the financial benefits are of short duration: the product prices drop when the innovation spreads quickly in the sector and the organizations sell their products for even lower prices as a result of the fierce price competition central to ‘cost leadership’ segments. Other innovation strategies, aimed at increasing the value of products or extending the activities are less popular in the sector, despite their potential to counteract the downward spiraling prices. This thesis explores the innovation practices in the Westland horticulture sector to obtain an understanding on how these patterns in innovation emerge and are maintained. It shows how the dominant use of cost-reducing and volume-increase innovations can be explained from a social perspective. Is it therefore not the innovation itself that is studied, but the innovation practice of growers. Insights are provided on the ways growers innovate, how they make decisions, deal with institutions (rules, norms and shared strategies) and come to an investment. The hypothesis supporting this approach is that the organizations and innovation practices are socially embedded, and can be studies as such. The central subject of this study is the effects social institutions have on innovation practices in the Westland. To study this relation between the institutions and individuals, the bathtub model of Coleman on social action is used. The model provides in this thesis the frame to study innovation practices at the interaction of macro-level (system) and micro-level (individual), addressing the questions 'how social institutions affect individual growers?', 'how do individuals assimilate institutional power when deciding on investments?', and 'how can system-level patterns and dynamics be explained as the emergent result of actions and interactions of individuals?' Ethnographic fieldwork was used to obtain an understanding on innovation in the sector. The use of participatory observation, interviews and group discussions provided insights on innovation practices, producing a rich body of data on the actors studied. The use of ethnography has the special benefit of gaining an inside-perspective in the sector, studying both patterns in practices, as well as variation and exceptions amongst growers. Explanations on social action are based on social mechanisms, clarifying patterns in the data with existing theory, which is called ‘grounded theory’ in social science. The set-up of the methodologies suits the exploratory approach of this research on social institutions and innovation practices in the sector, placing innovation in the horticulture sector in a new daylight. A second objective was to complete the analysis so that the results can be used to underpin an agent-based model of grower society and horticulture ecosystem development. The MAIA model is used for this purpose, using its metamodel to describe the system. The study on institutions revealed that several formal institutions and informal institutions support innovation practices based on cost-reduction and volume-increase, providing thereby social explanations on the dominance of those innovation strategies. Several important organizations were identified, being the bank, the EU, the municipality, LTO Glaskracht, and sales organizations. The exploration on the impact of the formal institutions involving horticulture organizations (as contracts, regulations and official agreements) revealed that the set of institutions have a substantial impact on the type of innovations used. The regulations of the NMA forbids production and price agreements, thereby creating barriers for the grower community to develop self-organizing mechanisms to counteract the supply chain imbalances and harmful low prices. The prohibition to develop joined strategies, makes it hard for growers to jointly address price fluctuations and supply chain issues; the institutions stimulate the fierce competition on cost prices of horticulture organizations instead. The regulations of the municipality do not prioritize innovation strategies, but do prescribe regulations on safety, environment, energy and water use, etc. These regulations are in general aimed at the physical greenhouse, prescribing adaptations to the processes of greenhouses. Growers may have to spend their money to comply with (new) regulations, leaving less for other purposes, as marketing and product-extension. Some other formal institutions are written in contracts, as in the case of a loan from the bank or GMO subsidy from the EU. The study showed that growers are trading off options, in which the availability of financial means is a central element. A grower may: a) not apply for finances, thereby staying free from those contracts, or b) apply for finances - having more financial means, but agreeing to rules stated by the organization. Either of these decisions may have a huge impact, as even the smallest differences between organizations and in cost prices may distinguish an organization’s success from failure. The pressure resulting from the fierce competition on cost price intensifies the power these institutions have on them. In the case of GMO, a grower receives the subsidy when he invests in a (mainly physical) novelty, accepting that he has to sell via one of the larger sales cooperations, abandoning all individual marketing strategies. In the case of the bank, loans are only given for assets, that function as premises to the bank in case the organization cannot pay back the loan. LTO Glaskracht acknowledges the need for marketing, but since the organization is a union, the wish of the mass is taken as the input for lobbying activities. This means in practice, that the message may be quite conservative – or at least not explicitly supporting the innovative frontrunners. An important finding in the study, is that many actors and organizations recognize the problems as identified in this thesis, but at the same time, support the social institutions prioritizing process-aimed investments. Efforts to stimulate marketing and other non-process innovations are taken, but often as a side-projects, rather than reconsidering the more central institutions of organizations that are of large influence. After, the stories of five growers were used to explore innovation practices on individual level, providing more insights in the decision making processes. The stories show the variety of actors and strategies in the sector, by illustrating quite different organizations, growers and strategies. The ethnographic descriptions gave insights on the people involved in the greenhouses and innovation practices, portraying realistic actors. The study showed how choices are dependent on the personal believes, shared norms and strategies, incidents, and values of growers, and the way they deal with social institutions. The sections of the growers active in bulk products using mainly process-innovations, showed how their activities are supported by informal as well as formal institutions. In contrast, the growers managing greenhouses based on differentiation strategies, have to overcome more institutional difficulties. It tells us that the innovation practices are socially embedded, and in order to change innovation practices, growers have to deal with or overcome both formal as informal social institutions. Stated differently, new innovation practices based on value-increasing and activity-extending strategies, requires some level of social innovation, as new ideas, norms, practices and believes should be adopted – as the institutional contacts in general supports process-aimed innovation. The five stories showed how inviduals deal with these structures and arrive at investment decisions; some conform the norms and some displaying innovative ideas and actions. These activities were used in the the succeeding chapter to explain system phenomena. Three system dynamics identified as problematic were discussed: the process of homogenization of organizations, the occurrence of overproduction, the spiral of decreasing product values of bulk crops. With the use of transformative mechanisms, the emergence of the system phenomena from individual actions and interactions could be illuminated. The study showed that actions of individual growers are rational from their perspective, but altogether give rise to system patterns that are undesirable for all. The five categories of social errors (Immediate interest, Errors and self-defeating prophecy, Basic values and Ignorance) as discussed by Merton provided explanations on the occurrence of unintended outcomes of rational actors aiming for success. This provides us an insight on how system level problems can be understood, taking inividual action as the subject of study. Chapter seven showed that short-term benefits may override long-term benefits, as short-term requirements seem more urgent and are easier to understand and calculate, creating the error of immediate interest. The explanation of the error, implying the ´incorrect analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation’ relates well to the deeply embedded routines of growers to focus on production issues, not dealing with market concerns nowadays. The inability to set a higher price level without a self-governing mechanisms may lie in the tragedy of the commons, which is often defined as ‘the dilemma arising from the situation in which multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen’. The social mechanism in the tragedy of the commons does give a good explanation on the actions of individuals: the individuals are pursuing their own interest, following their independent rationality of their situation, altogether causing issues as macro level, as the increasingly lowering of product prices. Taking the just discussed approach, this thesis relates to several fields of science. First, it continued the ‘structure-agency’ debate, central to sociology, addressing the effects social institutions have on individuals. The Coleman bathtub model allowed to study the power that institutions have on people, as well as gives includes the freedom of individual choice. This study had the aim to present a balanced perspective on innovation practices in which both the individual as structures in the sector are included. Second, it addressed the social embedding of organizations, acknowledging the individuals actors and their decisions. This perspective on industries is relevant for the field of Industrial Ecology, as it reveals the social workings supporting organizations, materials flows, energy use and emissions. And third, it provided insights for the fields of cultural anthropology and modeling on how the methodologies of ethnographic fieldwork and agent-based modeling may be jointly used in a research project. A suggestion for further research is to take a closer look at the formal social institutions in the sector, and explore ways to improve the ‘rules of the game’ for innovation practices and sustainability improvements. Especially the social institutions observed by the EU (GMO subsidy) and the regulations by the NMA may provide an interesting subject, as their impact was described as very high in this study. A second suggestion for further research is on the effects of sustainability activities in perishable bulk products, as most crops in the horticulture sector. The issue seems to lie in that activities improving the efficiency of processes, and therewith reducing the environmental impact of products, do not increase the value of products, but rather reduces it. The mechanisms that are at work in agricultural sectors and cost-leadership segments, have the effect that the costs reduction through efficiency improvements lead automatically to lower prices. The more efficient produces products are worth less. Perhaps new marking innovations or supply chain adaptations may contribute to this matter. The last recommendation is to finalize the agent-based-model, after which it may be used to study the system dynamics. In specific, the comparison of the outcomes of the outcomes of the model and the social analysis on transformative mechanisms may be compares, studying the emergence of system phenomena with different methodologies. Further insights could be obtained on the combined use of ethnography and agent-based modeling.","innovation; westland; greenhouses; social innovation; social institutions; cultural anthropology; ethography; agent-based modelling; MAIA; IAD framework; bathtub model; social mechanisms; emergence; horticulture; economic cluster; social context; culture; innovation system; industrial ecology; sustainable development; sustainable innovation; micro economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-09","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor)","2012","This thesis focuses on wave overtopping at rubble mound breakwaters with a non-reshaping berm. The research was aimed at gaining insight into the influence of a permeable berm on the overtopping behaviour. Moreover it was desired to validate existing prediction methods for the spatial distribution of overtopping for breakwaters with a non-reshaping berm. Wave overtopping was investigated by means of a physical model. The breakwater scale model was divided into 8 collection bins. Overtopped volumes were collected and pumped into floating tanks further down the flume. After the experiment the mass of the floating tanks was measured and the mean overtopping discharge could be determined for 8 horizontal positions on the breakwater. The measured total overtopping discharges cannot be predicted accurately by existing prediction methods. On the basis of experimental data a new prediction method was proposed that achieves an excellent fit for total overtopping. The crest freeboard definition was adjusted to account for the permeability of the crest. The reduction factor accounting for slope roughness was made dependent on the Iribarren number. For Iribarren numbers higher than 6, this method calculates no reduction of overtopping due to slope roughness. The effect of a permeable berm on total overtopping was found to be remarkably different from the effect of an impermeable berm. Permeable berms below Still Water Level (SWL) lead to less reduction of overtopping than impermeable berms below SWL. Berms above SWL lead to wave breaking on the slope in front of the berm. Contrarily to impermeable berms above SWL, a permeable berm above SWL leads to significant reduction of overtopping. The measured spatial distribution of overtopping is associated with a lot of seemingly random behaviour. Large differences were found with the experimental data of Lioutas (2010). It is suspected that the used experiment setup gives rise to significant model effects for the spatial distribution of overtopping. An experiment setup was recommended that is expected to more accurately model the behaviour of the prototype situation. Data on the spatial distribution of overtopping could not accurately be predicted by existing prediction methods. In some cases existing prediction methods provided an upper limit for overtopping (Juul Jensen, 1984) but none led to a good fit with the experimental data. A new reduction factor was found that reduces the amount of scatter and provides a conservative prediction of the experimental data.","wave overtopping; rubble mound breakwaters; non-reshaping permeable berm; physical experiments; prediction method; spatial distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Henze, L.A.R. (mentor)","2012","This report shows the development of a tool, which will enable designers to start collaborative design projects. The project is executed at the company Veeel, a design agency in Amsterdam. Veeel has brought together a large pool of designers on their online platform Designrider, which gives them access to a wealth of technical knowledge, experience, skills and creativity. The designers can enrol for projects provided by Veeel on Designrider. However, the designers wait until a project is placed, they do not interact with each other in the meantime. This can lead to missed opportunities. It is important for designers to build a strong network, which they can use in their search for projects. A dynamic network will aid them in achieving larger projects, which is difficult for an individual designer and enables the designer to do what they do best. Therefore, designers should be supported in becoming more active on Designrider to start collaborative design projects. These findings have lead to developing a tool that changes the wait and see attitude of the designers in Designrider. In the analysis phase, social networks, communities and the importance of building trust among each other before sharing information with new connections are investigated. The insights from this literature study are used as a base to research and understand the current situation of Veeel, Designrider and the designers. It became clear that it is not only about providing design projects but designers are searching for something else as well. Designrider is lacking three needs to strengthen the ties in ones network, namely projects, triggers and social communication. The outcomes of the analysis were transformed into a design vision. The design vision suggests that the designers need to feel confident enough to show their potential and should help each other during their design process. These insights were translated into an interaction vision, which explains the intended interaction of the to be developed tool. The design vision forms a framework for the conceptualization part of the project where all the gained information is translated into different ideas. The generated ideas were tested in two different user studies both offline and online. The insights of the user studies have led to the development of a concept idea for the tool. The tool supports designers to share their process with other designers in different steps. A designer can start up a new project; others can become interested and start following the project after being accepted. They will be more involved in the project. Updates of the project will keep the rest of the designers involved. When the designer who started a new project needs help, he or she can turn to his followers or an expert. The final result will be visible for all the designers of Designrider when a project is finished. When the project is really interesting, Veeel could invite a designer for the event DesignerDrinks. At this event, the invited designer can present his or her project. The others can become interested, inspired and during a drink they can get more connected to each other. Although further research is needed, it can be concluded that the designers will feel more confident showing their potential if they can control who sees their process. This will change the wait and see attitude of the designers. The new tool supports the three needs: projects, triggers and social communication, both online and offline. The triggers are initiated by the start of a new project. The new project and its updates initiate conversations and enables starting collaboration. Due to the collaborative design projects, weak ties become strong. This will build trust, connections will appear and information streams will be possible. Finally, a recommendation to Veeel is made. As a start, Veeel should change the proposition of Designrider. Instead of providing a platform where designers can find projects it should be “Expose, share, start collaborative design projects and become part of a dedicated community of designers.”","collaboration; networks; communities; tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Therefore, as one of the most important factors that create a person’s image, clothing becomes very important for modern people. For business men, clothing is even more important as they need a good professional personal image to convince others that they are qualified for each business opportunities. Considering the high market potential, this project mainly focused on helping the Chinese high net worth business men aged 28 to 45 to select suitable garments, in particular the dress shirt, tie and pants. By doing this, this particular group of business men is expected to be able to appropriately manage their personal images in different business contexts. To achieve this expectation, the project objective is to design an intelligent personal image consulting appliance which provides users with highly personalized advice for selecting and matching garments, by considering the complexities following from both social context and wearer’s personal context. An explorative research & analysis were conducted to acquire insights from consumers, trends and the current market. By doing this, the final target users, detailed problems to be solved, possible market opportunities and relevant design insights were acquired. Then, by synthesizing these outcomes, a clear design statement was generated. On the basis of this, vision statements and design requirements corresponding to specific problems were identified and considered as guidelines to design the future appliance. During the conceptualization phase, following the design requirements, the future appliance was designed. In this report the design is explained in great detail by presenting the future appliance’s infrastructure, function structure as well as principle solutions. A design evaluation study of technological feasibility and usability was conducted. By the study of the technological feasibility, specific technologies which could be used to support the implementation of the future appliance were identified. Then, the final design was improved according to the updated insights and ideas acquired from users, by means of usability test. Based on the principle solutions designed in this project, further recommendations, representing the possible functions that could also be developed for the future appliance, are given. During this graduation project, I have learned a lot, not just about the subject itself but also about my soft skills regarding project management and communication, as well as team cooperation. In the end of the report, a self reflection presents some of the important things I have learned.","intelligent mobile appliance; personal image management; in-store fashion shopping and dressing; personalized suggestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bakker, T.W. (mentor)","2012","Recently the oil and gas industry is looking at the Posidonia shale in the Dutch subsurface for production of the unconventional shale gas. This is a form of gas production originating from the U.S.A. After the initial success this gas has become a major energy source in the United States. Shale gas can be present in extremely low permeable shales with high organic content. Through use of hydraulically induced fractures along a horizontal well it is possible to economically produce from these almost impermeable shale formations. Many different completions and techniques have been developed to increase production and enhance profitability. This work presents a survey of the experiences in hydraulic fracturing in the U.S.A., including completions and operations to optimize production. We first review the most important completions, and we identify a number of operations frequently carried out by North American operators to increase production from gas shales. Secondly we identify desirable attributes for shale gas fields, against which a potential project can be scored. Upon review of Posidonia attributes the shale is indeed identified as a potential play, and comparison with three successful American fields provides potentially successful completion and fracturing options. Furthermore this work proposes a reservoir model for the Posidonia shale. Herein the influence of the fracturing parameters fracture density, half-length and conductivity is investigated to determine if common U.S. operations will also be effective in the Netherlands. Based on the simulations we perform an economic evaluation for a Posidonia well in the Netherlands.","Shale; Hydraulic Fracturing; Eclipse; Adsorbed Gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2012","Introduction: This report describes a graduation project performed at Getinge. Getinge provides complete solutions for, among others disinfection and sterilization departments of hospitals (Chapter 1. Background). The assignment was to build an application that supports their complete service process. This service aims at minimizing or preventing a washer-disinfector or sterilizer from breaking down. A breakdown could cause the cancelation of surgeries relatively quickly, because the necessary instruments are still contaminated. The complete service process was studied during the analysis phase. However due to the tight time schedule of this project, the choice was made to continue only with reactive service. In this type of service, an acute breakdown has to be repaired. Problem: The aim of reactive service is to get a machine back up and running as quickly as possible, therefore the downtime should be minimized as much as possible. However currently there are delays in the repair process (Chapter 2. Analysis). First of all a service rep can only diagnose a problem on site. To do this he has a to run a complete wash (or sterilization) program to regenerate the error. Next he has access to a large amount of data to diagnose an error. He could see the error messages, read manuals, review the service history, see process graphs and data and look up updates. However these resources lack any form of structure, so he has to figure out what is related. Furthermore he has only a limited amount of spare parts in his service van, so when he has diagnosed a cause, it could be that the needed spare part has to be ordered. This could take two to three days. Process changes: Due to the problems mentioned above, it became necessary to change the approach on reactive service (Chapter 3. The idea). All data deriving from the machines can be viewed at the back office, because they are connected to the Internet. Additionally all other resources needed to diagnose an error, are being digitalized at the moment, so it is possible to make a preliminary diagnosis at a distance. This makes it possible to nightly ship the possibly needed spare parts to the service rep and send him the next day to diagnose the error further and subsequently repair the cause. Design process: A flow diagram has been designed in which all resources are connected to each other (Paragraph 3.2). This flow diagram shows that resources can be filtered based on the module. This module belongs to the error message that the user selects as cause. The error message is the reason why a (wash or sterilization) process has been rejected by a machine. The next step was to divide the flow diagram in pieces that are manageable for a user to be displayed in one screen. There are different ways to structure information on a screen. The choice is made to put all parts of the flow diagram with the same meaning together in one screen. Thereafter these “screens” needed to be ordered in a sequence to structure the diagnostics process. This would enable service reps to perform each other’s work faster and more easily. The last step was to design workflows for each screen. These workflows envision the use of the screens. They show what the application needs to do and what input is required from the user. These workflows have been made to understand what each screen should do and to ensure that the user has the final decision. Service reps have the knowledge and experience to perform service and therefore it is demanded that they have the final decision. Graphics: Next the basic layout of the application has been designed (Chapter 4. Graphics). This ensures that the layout is consistent throughout the complete application, which will make it easier for users to learn to use the application. The grid is divided into two parts. The left part will list items of a resource and clicking one item will show its details in the right part. The selected item and its details are visually connected by the use of the same colour and symbol. This colour is the opposite colour in the colour wheel of the other used colours and therefore stands out. The other used colours are grey and blue, colours that derive from Getinge’s logo and are generally used for Getinge’s applications. The “Summary” is added on the right-hand side of the screen. This screens slides out when clicking on it and shows the user his previous findings. In this way the user can easily compare his findings with what he is currently looking at. The previously mentioned workflows are used together with this basic layout to build each screen (Chapter 5. Concept). Evaluation: A prototype has been built in Adobe Flash to test the usability of the design. This has been done in observational research (Chapter 6. Evaluation). Here the five experienced service reps had to imagine a breakdown and use the application to diagnose it. During the study several problems were found. It occurred that the participants could not find functions and missed information. However they were impressed by the application and mentioned some recommendations for further improvements. Ideas haves been created based on these recommendations and the found problems (Chapter 7. Recommendations). These ideas will take the application to the next level. Also recommendations to continue the development after the graduation project ended are given.","Graphical User Interface (GUI); Usability test; Observational Research; Diagnostics; Service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-12-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

A new steerable catheter with two deflectable segments may benefit the procedure by reducing the number of device exchanges while speeding up the process. The new catheter is designed for navigation to the arteries in the legs. Currently, multiple selective catheters are used consuctively to first cross the aortic bifurcation and then navigate down the leg. The new steerable catheter is designed to three commonly used selective catheters. A handle is also designed to actuate the two deflectable segments. A prototype is built and experimentally evaluated. The catheter has the required axial and rotational stiffness, but lacks the required bending elasticity. The deflectable segments can successfully be actuated into the desired geometries. However, the bending elasticity must be improved before conclusive evidence can be found that the catheter can replace the selected conventional catheters.

This was done by taking the settling velocity log-contrast of a non-spherical particle and an equivalent spherical particle. This log-contrast should be the logarithmic function of a certain shape factor. Settling data of several shapes were taken from previous authors and with those data several existing and new shape factors were tested to form a single relation. Recently a simple equation was developed which can explicitly predict the settling velocity of spherical particles for any Reynolds number. This equation was tested to be fairly accurate for spherical data. However, the spherical data showed a systematic error which needs to be resolved for the equation to be perfectly accurate. The equation also showed to be fairly accurate for non-spherical sieve diameter data. However sieve diameter data cannot be used to define the shape of a particle as there is no direct relation between sieve diameter and actual particle size and shape. In order to find a relation between particle settling velocity and shape, a correct shape factor must be found. For that matter several shape factors from previous authors were tested on data directly available from previous authors. The existing shape factors were proved to not be able to combine all investigated shapes into a single relation for settling velocity and a new shape factor was found with which a single relation might be formed. This new equation is a generalization of the Corey Shape Factor, the Boekhout Shape Factor: BSF=D_s/(?D_l?^n D_i^(1-n) ). However due to the small amount of data, important data gaps exist so that nothing can be concluded with certainty. Therefore more settling experiments should be done over a large range of Reynolds numbers to be able to conclude whether the Boekhout Shape Factor is the correct link between particle settling velocity and shape.","settling velocity; particle shape","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); De Vlugt, E. (mentor)","2012","Introduction: Obstetric Brachial Plexus Lesion (OBPL) is characterized by diminished motor and sensory function. These may be worsened by misrouted nerve fibres and faulty formation of central motor programmes. The latter is treated with triceps injections of botulinum toxins, which is aimed at inactivating misrouted nerve fibres in the triceps, which increases biceps function. Increased biceps use is believed to lead to better formation of the central motor programmes. However, the current electrical stimulation brachial plexus (ESBP) method for measurement of co-contraction has four major shortcomings preventing it from use in the clinical setting to determine whether an OBPL patient would benefit from the injections or not. Therefore, the new method for the measurement of co-contraction should fulfil the following requirements: 1. is able to quantify motor misrouting 2. is able to quantify sensory misrouting and 3. quantifies misrouting at different voluntary force levels, and 4. is easily applicable in clinical practice. In this study we investigated whether measuring short-range-stiffness (SRS) at the elbow level fulfils these requirements. SRS is the stiffness induced by a fast stretch and which lasts for a certain stretch distance (the elastic limit), varies proportionally with muscle force and is likely attributed to the elastic elongation of attached cross-bridges. Methods: Seven controls (2 men, median (25th – 75th) age 28y (21 - 52)) and five OBPL patients (1 man, median (25th – 75th) age 31y (24 - 50)) were investigated. The OBPL patients were further divided in two groups according to the ESBP method for measurement of biceps misrouting: a group of two OBPL patients without misrouting and a group of three OBPL patients with misrouting. Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant elbow torque in flexion direction at different levels (0, 2.1, 4.3 and 6.4 Nm). The elbow was suddenly and quickly extended and SRS was estimated from the resulting torque responses using a mechanical model for the elbow joint. The rotation stimulus (t = 0 ms) was used for two purposes: 1) to estimate SRS as a measure for motor misrouting and 2) to induce a stretch reflex. The elbow was returned to its original angle by an opposite displacement (shortening stimulus) and SRS was again estimated from the shorting torque response. SRS during that shortening stimulus should reflect the effect of the stretch reflex and was therefore taken as a measure for sensory misrouting. The timing of the shortening stimulus was varied (t = 130, 150, 180 and 200 ms) to search for the expected peak in the stretch reflex response. Similar stimuli but in the opposite direction were used during elbow extension torque. Activation ratios (AR) were calculated from the EMG measurements of the biceps and triceps to quantify the relative participation of agonist and antagonist in performing the task. The Kruskal-Willis test was used to compare SRS and AR between controls, patients without misrouting and patients with misrouting. The biceps motor misrouting according to the ESBP method was plotted in a scatter plot against SRS for flexion torque 6.4 Nm. Results: VAF were high and parameter SEM were low for the SRS measurement of the first flank (t = 0 ms). High VAF and SEM values indicted the model was adequate and the parameters were reliable. Median SRS was higher in patients with misrouting than in controls. ARs for the biceps and the triceps were lower in patients with misrouting than in controls. Kruskal-Willis test of SRS and AR did not show a significant difference between the groups. The scatter plot of the SRS for flexion torque 6.4 Nm and the biceps misrouting according to the ESBP method showed that SRS is not able to discern between the patients and control subjects on the individual level. VAF were high and parameter SEM were low overall for the second stimulus SRS measurement (t = 130, 150, 180 and 200 ms) except for t = 130 ms during flexion. Median SRS is not consistently higher or lower in patients with misrouting compared to controls during either flexion or extension and the Kruskal-Willis test shows no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: With the SRS method it is possible to quantify motor misrouting for different voluntary force levels on a group level, and it is easily applicable in clinical practice. The higher median SRS and lower AR in patients compared to control subjects for the same torques suggest there is motor misrouting in patients. Though, the method should be improved before it can be applied on the individual level: The great spread of the data may be reduced by more repetitions of the SRS measurement. It is unclear whether sensory misrouting was present or not, though if present, we were able to measure its effect reliably and we found that it did not have an effect on SRS and thus probably does not lead to an apparent decrease of function in this OBPL patient population.

(mentor); Bruens, G. (mentor)","2012","The design process of this graduation project is inspired on the “Model of the Product Innovation Process” (Buijs and Valkenburg, 2005). The five-stage product innovation model consists of product use, strategy formulation, design brief formulation, product development and product launch. This project covers the first four stages of the innovation model. The fifth stage is the actual product launch, which has not taken place yet, but hopefully this will be the case after publication of this report. This report envelopes the expedition to what the next product of flux could be, should be and will be, including the embodiment design and presentation of the final product. Flux® is a young company with a small product line, a so-called single product company. The flux® chair is their core product, around which several closely related products have been launched. Their designs are available in the best interior and design stores worldwide. In order to compete in this market, flux’s core product alone will not suffice. To innovate their business, products and services, an analysis of their present business is performed. Flux is in need of a product that could benefit from their current retail network and is an opportunity in a new market. Lounge areas are an upcoming trend in the event business. In the retail stores a current garden trend is lounge furniture, instead of the common dinner table, with seats. Adding a foldable function to this trend of lounge furniture in makes it possible to store the furniture. The final design goal therefore will be a lounge product aiming for the event market. The product should be a foldable passive seating device. Market development, technological possibilities and product development concluded that a sofa for two people had the most potential. The primary function of the sofa is sitting in a relaxed and layback position, while talking to your neighbour lounger. The research investigated what the best proportions are for a passive seating device to supporting the human body in a relaxed posture, from a scientific and ergonomic point of view. Sitting creates a lot of back muscle and spinal pains. The best way to sit is to change your posture and with a reclined back. A reclining seat and back will shift weight to the occupant’s back. This is comfortable, because it is reducing weight on the seat area. In general, if the occupant is supposed to sit for a long time, weight needs to be taken off the seat area and thus lounge chairs intended for long periods of sitting are generally reclined. The ideal measurements of the passive seating device are approached by literature research of scientific papers. The angle of the back and the angle of the seat together define the sitting angle. The sitting angle of the product will be 135 degrees. The seat will recline with 10 degrees and the backrest will be 45 degrees with reference to the horizontal plane. The seat depth is 47 cm, the seat height is 38 cm, the backrest is 65 cm, and the width of the sofa is 120 cm. The final design of the foldable sofa is a combination of functionality and form. It uses affective storage space, which also makes it feasible for distribution. It can be optimally produced with CNC milling, which is the current technique flux uses for their newest products. It is user friendly to fold and unfold and matches with the current portfolio and form language of flux. The consumer price will be about 8 times the production costs. The production costs are estimated on 60,- The consumer price will be about 480,-.","design; sitting; innovation; lounging; events","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management & Design Aesthetics","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Depth-contours are an essential part of any hydrographic chart—a map of a waterbody intended for safe ship navigation. Traditionally these were manually drawn by skilled hydrographers from a limited set of surveyed depth measurements. Nowadays this process of map making is shifted towards the digital domain, not in the last place because of the huge amounts of data resulting from modern surveying techniques. Furthermore, the task of automating the process of cartographic generalization that depends on subjective criteria is challenging. The produced depth-contours should comply with the four hydrographic generalization constraints of safety, legibility (smoothness), topology and waterbody morphology. I show that grid-based approaches to generalize depth contours that are currently used in practice do not always comply with those fundamental generalization constraints. Most notably, the safety constraint, that ensures that a map never indicates an area as being shallower than measured, is often violated. But also the legibility and morphology constraints are not always optimally respected. Furthermore, heterogeneous datasets (that contain a transition of very sparse to very dense data), can lead to unwished interpolation artifacts, when the popular Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) spatial interpolation method is used. Part of this problem is the non-adaptive nature of IDW, that requires the user to re-set the interpolation parameters when the spatial distribution of the input point changes. I present and prototype a novel surface-based approach for the generalization of hydrographic depth-contours that is based on the Voronoi Diagram (VD) and performs generalization on the surface that defines the contours, rather on the contour lines individually. Through the VD, a fully adaptive, automatic and smooth spatial interpolation method known as the Laplace interpolant is coupled with a Delaunay Triangulation (DT) data structure that contains all data points with their exact planimetric coordinates. Using this concept a number of operators is defined that are able to perform the relevant cartographic generalization operations for hydrographic contours: simplification, smoothing, aggregation, omission and enlargement. The significance of the proposed approach lies herein that it honors all four hydrographic generalization constraints, most notably: it is guaranteed to be safe. As opposed to current automated approaches, it does therefore not require any form of manual safety verification. And, because all of the employed algorithms are local, it is also well scalable to big datasets in principle.","Voronoi; hydrography; contour; GIS; triangulation; generalization; natural neighbours","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-17","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","Geomatics","",""

Study on Elicitation of Pride in Human-Product Interaction for People with Dementia.","Owusu, I.A.","Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor); Anderiesen, H. (mentor); Moshagen, M. (mentor); Sorokin, L. (mentor)","2012","To date, there are only few scientifically comprehensive studies that investigate the conceptual description of emotion elicitation processes by design with actually applying them. The present interdisciplinary thesis project aimed at applying a design process resulting in an interactive prototype that provides empirical evidence for targeted emotional aspects in the user experience. With the design, people with dementia were addressed, a specific user group of relevance to society. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, a set of symptoms that includes loss of memory, mood changes, and problems with communication and reasoning. Alleviating those symptoms is crucial not only to the patients, but also to all their formal and informal caretakers. However, instead of taking a problem focused attitude of decreasing the negative emotions of patients, enabling the experience of positive emotions in everyday life is an approach which has shown to have meaningful consequences for wellbeing. Exceeding the general spectrum of positive versus negative emotions, this thesis broaches the issue of pride, a distinct complex emotion related to achievements. Applied to people with dementia, pride may not only have positive effects in a momentary human product interaction but could also improve their wellbeing and even mental state in the long term. Literature gives only little information about the emotion of pride. To learn more about manifestations of pride in daily life, qualitative interviews were conducted in a first preliminary study. Due to the limitations in abstract thinking of people with dementia, 11 young healthy people were first sensitized with workbooks and then interviewed. An ideation workshop with designers followed and resulted in the conclusion that it was still very difficult to generate satisfiable pride-eliciting product concepts. Therefore, “pride opportunities” taking the time aspect of user experiences into account, were defined, based on the data from the first preliminary study. How generalisable these found pride opportunities were for the target group of the later design was investigated through a second preliminary study, involving the target users. A combination of interviews and observations over six weeks of 11 people with dementia, interviews with family members and care professionals as well as with scientific experts on dementia, resulted in identifying three pride opportunities especially relevant for the target user group. The pride opportunities were practically applied in a design process focussing on the elicitation of pride for people with dementia. After developing a design goal and principles, a design vision was formulated. Based on this vision, design concepts were generated of which one turned out to be the strongest due to its tight relation to the research findings and its applicability in the chosen context, daycare centres for elderly people. A prototyping phase with iterative testing with people with dementia followed, until a final working interactive prototype was built. In order to empirically test how a human product interaction incorporates the attributes that evoke pride in the target user group, an evaluation study was conducted with 20 participants in the Netherlands and in Germany. Two kinds of data sources assessed the emotion-expressions for pride, joy, sadness and embarrassment of the participants. Two trained raters used a standardized emotion measure while reviewing video material and care professionals present took notes during and were interviewed after the interaction itself. The evaluation proved the design process to be successful in eliciting an emotional user experience, as not only significantly pride, but even stronger joy was measured in the participants. The “how” of emotion elicitation was answered by the research and design process of this thesis. Limitations are discussed and recommendations for further development of the resulting interactive prototype “Recordis” are made. Finally, guidelines for designers are formulated who intend to design for distinct emotions for special user groups.","design for emotion; design for elderly; design for people with dementia; emotion elicitation in human-product interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-12-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Because of the bad financial situation of the train operator (High Speed Alliance, executed by NS Hispeed), the Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment was forced to find a solution for train operation on the HSL-South. After a research of the alternatives, the solution was incorporated in the Government Agreement for the new Rutte-Asscher government (2012). The solution was that the HSL-South will be combined with the concession for the main Dutch rail network for the period 2015-2024. In this report the chances of the integration and the impact for society have been researched. To this end the following research goal has been formulated: ""h Research the possibilities to integrate the High-Speed-Line South into the main rail network and design one or more plans for the period 2015-2024 to utilize the integration to maximize (societal) profits"". To reach this goal a design cycle (Roozenburg & Eekels, 1995) was used to design multiple networks and evaluate those afterwards. The design cycle started with analyzing the design environment which resulted in knowledge of the design freedoms and the criteria that are used to evaluate the designs. As a second step three different alternatives for the end stage have been designed (2024). This was done by constructing train product philosophies for the entire network, based on different forms of high speed line operations in other countries, and applying them to the Dutch situation. This train product philosophies have been improved by applying separate design elements, that have been found in the Analysis. The conclusions about the specific design elements are also applicable for short term timetable-design. The resulting alternatives have been simulated to evaluate them based on the criteria that have been found and to compare them with the assumed situation in 2024: 'Programma Hoogfrequent Spoorvervoer'. For designing the alternatives the model ‘Design Of Network Schedules’ (DONS) was used. This is a model that can be used to design line networks and timetables (basic hourly patterns) with the ability to make big changes easily. After designing the alternatives they have been simulated in ‘Toedelen van Reizigers aan NetwerkSystemen’ (TRANS), meaning: allocation of travelers to network schedules. This is done to simulate the effect on current rail travelers. To be able to estimate the growth potential of the alternatives (and with it, the financial feasibility) price and travel time elasticities have been used. The three designed alternatives are: Premium, Hybrid and Intercity. These have been compared to the Basic alternative. This basic alternative is based on PHS-3A. This is the joint future vision from NS and ProRail on Dutch timetables in 2020.","HSL-Zuid; hoofdrailnet; netwerkontwerp; dienstregelingontwerp; reizigerssimulatie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Bakker-Wu, S. (mentor)","2012","The last mile of e-commerce: the bottleneck or most inefficient part of the chain; the part that greatly determines the customer experience; the differentiator when it comes to competitive advantage; thus, a playground for innovation. The delivery of goods, purchased online, to the consumer’s home is being threatened. Emission reduction policies of local authorities prescribe decreasing numbers of large motorized vehicles that are allowed into the inner city areas. However, urban population is rising, increasing the demand for provision. This forces urban distributors to come up with innovative solutions to meet this demand. The delivery end of e-commerce is facilitated by so-called CEP companies (Courier Express and Parcel companies). Within the business to consumer market, PostNL is the main facilitator of urban parcel distribution. An average day of a deliveryman in Amsterdam concerns the delivery of around 180 parcels in 120 stops. The work is quite physically challenging. A van is well capable of transporting this daily payload, both in terms of capacity and user convenience. Introducing a bicycle as mode of transport seems rather conflicting in that perspective. However, when analyzing the context of inner city areas, a bicycle is not at all unorthodox. Especially Amsterdam can be considered as the cradle for bicycle innovation. Such cities have traditionally not been built for large vehicles; the smaller ones prevail on several grounds like penetrability and environmental impact. Many pilot projects on bicycle parcel distribution have been executed, but none appear to be viable. The goal of this project is to establish a concept that can generate profit. This is stimulated through a different approach to a smaller urban distribution vehicle: Design for usability; focus on the main user and his activities, the deliveryman. Acknowledge the CEP chain; the vehicle is the last shackle in a chain of processes. To empathize with the deliverymen, their labor was experienced first hand during field research. In order to better understand the chain, all processes were analyzed from a usability perspective in field research. Recent developments in the field of bundled transport into the inner city areas were added to improve feasibility of coping with the rising demand and to relieve the deliverymen of part of the travel distances. The user handlings that required most attention for the new design were identified and ideas were generated for each individual usability feature. The best suitable solutions were assessed based on predetermined criteria to establish an integral solution. The result is the discovery of a new modular bicycle parcel delivery system: the bicycle parcel delivery trailer. One that allows the CEP companies to implement it into their current system, without drastic changes. This allows for short term implementation. The modularity of the concept has three important benefits: 1. The concept comprises of a trailer that allows multiple types of vehicles to pull it. 2. Decoupling the trailer allows it to be stacked efficiently in bundled transport modes. 3. The production method of the trailer allows for flexible future adjustments. The concept was evaluated with both van der Veer designers and a delegation of PostNL employees, comprising of both managers and deliverymen. Both parties acknowledged the potential of the concept and requested further development into a prototype. So keep your eyes open and you just might see one on the streets in the years to come!","industrial design; last mile; e-commerce; bicycle delivery; urban distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-12-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Data analysis is a rising field of interest for computer science research due to the growing amount of information that is digitally available. This increase in data has as direct consequence that any analysis is significantly complex. By using structured representations for the data sets, like graphs, the analysis becomes feasible, but is still time-consuming. In this project, the focus is on the reduction of the computational time for data analysis, with the introduction of accelerators. Accelerators are specialized hardware components that assist the general processing unit in performing (parts of) the task at hand. In particular, we focus on the use of General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GPGPU) to help speedup the analysis. GPUs are specifically designed for representing and manipulating graphical data which invoke the processing of large chunks of data, GPUs are designed with large numbers of concurrent processing units and thus have a high potential of improving performance. In this project, we show the impact of using GPGPUs for both simple and more complex analysis, varying from small to large data sets, with the use of a programming model called OpenCL. We compare the performance of using accelerators against the traditional CPU-based implementation. Due to the inter-platform portability of the OpenCL model, such comparison can be performed without having to alter the algorithm. The use of accelerators is expected to become beneficial for analysis that require large computational power. For example, search algorithms (that require little to no computation) are not expected to profit from accelerators, while the more complex, centrality analysis is expected to have significantly more benefit from accelerators. Our results clearly shows this shift of performance improvement when algorithms further utilize the potential of accelerators, because the analysis grows in size and/ or complexity.","GPU; graph; Graph analysis; accelerators; OpenCL; parallel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Software and Computer Technology","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G. (mentor); Smulders, J. (mentor)","2012","Products impose a certain moral to the user: A speed bump forces a driver to slow down, a traffic light forces a driver to stop or go and a fence prevents bystanders to trespass. Public space belongs to everybody. There is no unambiguous organization responsible for the public space sight. This results in a cluttered public space that looks disorganized. A parking machine is part of the public space and is a product that moralizes its user. The moral that a parking machine tries to impose is something like ‘you shall pay’. Besides this forcing moral a parking machine is often hard to understand and use. A driver has to read the operation instructions before he can execute the unpopular duty. IP Parking produces off-street parking equipment and has also some on-street products in its product portfolio. IP parking wants to conquer the on-street market even further by developing an innovative parking machine. The design separates form from function: A core unit that gains parking rights to users according to a convenient and simple process. This core unit can be integrated in a streetscape, through customizing, according to the landscape architect requirements. Because areas in municipalities have different budgets for street furniture, there are several levels of parking machine customization. In total there are four: A core unit in a metal column. Colour customization only. A core unit in a metal column with a customizable surface. A core unit integrated in a light pole. This saves a power connection and pavement space. A core unit that can be built in according to the requirements of the landscape architect. Boundaries are the build in measures and a power connection. This variant ensures total design freedom for the landscape architect; the sky is the limit. The core unit consists of a 7” touch screen combined with a pinpad, cardreader, ticket printer and a RFID reader. Two methods of gaining parking rights are available in order to comply with privacy legislation, when the user inputs license plate or other sensitive information into the system. License plate registration is used often and saves costs for enforcement and thus prevents tariff increase. Without user permission privacy information cannot be linked or saved for a long period. Therefore the first parking rights gaining method is anonymous. The license plate number is saved till midnight. The driver inputs the car’s license plate number via the touch screen and prepays his parking rights. receiving a ticket is optional. This method is similar to current, hard to use, machines: staying anonymous has its price. The second method is a membership and resembles the Dutch OV-chipcard. The driver is registered in advance and has a RFID card. In the registration he accepted the link and save of his name, address, license plate number and bank account. He can start paid parking time by checking in with his card and stop parking time by checking out. This system is already developed by IP Parking. The core unit is designed as compact as possible to increase built-in possibilities. It has platonic aesthetic: timeless to fit in any streetscape. The design is an attempt to make the municipal city planning department responsible for the public space design. This is as step towards an uncluttered and organized public space. Besides that, the interaction between the user of the parking machine is improved. Easier to understand (less instructional graphics and text) and improved ergonomics combined with the integrated aesthetical design makes the ‘you shall pay‘ moral less prominent or even disappear. There are some recommendations. This project is hardware focused, but software makes the difference. A start is made in GUI design and needs more development. There must be a focus on the wants and needs of municipalities., after all they purchase the product. Municipalities want remote control of parking machines because this is cost-effective. Parking management software need to offer this functionality. Also streetscape architects must be aware of the potential of this design and get rid of their frustrations of current parking machines, not being able to control the aesthetics. This design puts the streetscape architect back in control.","Design; public space; parking machine; usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Aesthetics","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","In this thesis, a projector-based Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) system designed and developed to be applied to support physical and virtual 3D Rapid Prototyping in the field of Industrial Design Engineering is presented. The main contribution is a 3D scanner to get a virtual model of a physical model and tools to support the design of features interactively, on the object’s surface. More specifically, this work contains an approach to set the hardware to support SAR, else known as hardware calibration for SAR. Each hardware entity is calibrated with respect to a common “world”, in order to achieve effective communication. This world is set to coincide with the graphics world, and this allows us to imagine being inside the 3D graphics world while the virtual content is rendered onto the scene’s objects. In order to identify the basic ingredients that enable interaction in our SAR system, we take into account the limitations of Rapid Prototyping process, background knowledge for SAR systems and related work. Therefore, we designed the interaction components of the system according to characteristics of our setting. The SAR system was designed to perform in the peripersonal region. In this region, the user inserts input via a constructed IR tracked pen and a dynamic menu is used as interface to the system. Functionality such as selection, feedback and annotation is enabled for interacting with the SAR system. The system’s application is divided into two parts. The first part includes the use of the RGB-D camera and the IR tracker for the construction of a 3D scanner, in order to produce a virtual model of an object through sampling, segmentation, and registration of sequential point clouds. In the second part, the result of the scanning process, which is a polygonal mesh of the scanned object, is added to the SAR system’s application that enables interaction with virtual models and the ground level of the world. These two parts of the SAR system application aim to support industrial designers in the scanning of a freshly made physical prototype, and enable the design of features on the corresponding virtual model by using the SAR system during the rapid prototyping process. In order to identify the strong points and weaknesses of the current state of the SAR system application, we carried out a user evaluation. 21 students from the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering evaluated the two parts of the system’s application. The results show that the SAR system is useful and that it has great potential in the field of Industrial Design Engineering. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement and future work, in order to be fully applied in the field.","Spatial Augmented Reality; projector-based; SAR; Interaction; 3D tracking; Computer Graphics; Computer Vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Science: Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

Although, most activities in daily living require both motor and cognitive functioning like cycling (motor) while holding a conversation (cognitive). Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reduce motor deficits in advanced Parkinson?’s disease patients. However, the effectiveness of STN DBS on postural instability is less pronounced. It has been shown that bilateral STN DBS results in cognitive declines under dual-??task conditions using an upper extremity task and these declines compromise motor function. The aim of this study was to asses the effectiveness of STN DBS on cognitive-??motor performance during a lower extremity task. 15 advanced PD patients, of which seven presented PIGD symptoms, were tested under single-?? and dual-??task conditions. All patients were bilaterally implanted with STN DBS and had stable parameters as determined through typical clinical programming for at least 6 moths prior to study enrollment. Patients were assessed off anti-??parkinsonian medication under two DBS settings; Off DBS and On DBS. In each condition, patients performed a working memory task (n-??back) and a postural stability task (quiet standing). During the dual task, patients performed the working memory and postural stability tasks simultaneously. DBS was effective in improving Unified Parkinson?’s disease Rating Scale III scores relative to no stimulation. Cognitive functioning showed no difference between the two DBS conditions. Patients with PIGD symptoms were significantly less stable than patients with no PIGD symptoms for both On and Off DBS conditions. These data show that with the paradigm used in this study, PIGD symptoms continue to be refractory to DBS. Postural stability as assessed by quietly standing on a force platform may not have been challenging enough to evoke cognitive declines.","Parkinson's Disease; deep brain stimulation; postural stability; cognitive function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Talmon, A.M. (mentor)","2012","Bedforms play an important role in the sediment transport of a river. Because of their importance many experiments have been carried out to better understand bedforms. Most experiments concern transverse bedforms (with crests aligned perpendicular to the flow direction). However, bathymetry measurements show many instances of oblique dunes. Oblique bedforms induce flow and sediment transport in the transverse direction. Based on the flume experiments of Talmon [2009], Sieben & Talmon [2011] proposed formulae to determine the bed-load transport direction over oblique dunes. To apply these formulae the dune orientation has to be known. Therefore, Sieben & Talmon [2011] proposed to derive the dune angle by relating it to the relative dune migration rate along the dune crest. This was applied in the preliminary work of Weij [2012]. It was found that the current formulae give unrealistic results. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the prediction of dune orientation angle for large-scale modelling. The mechanisms involved in the formation of oblique dunes are investigated in a simplified environment. For the simplified environment we created a model based on the model created by Jerolmack & Mohrig [2005]. The model calculates the bed level change in one-dimensional slices, which are then coupled with transverse sediment transport to create a quasi 2D model. The results of show a dune orientation that eventually finds an equilibrium. Two explanations were given: (1) A gradient in transverse sediment transport can decrease or increase the dune migration rate, (2) Dune crests break up, and merge before reaching a larger angle. Based on these findings, the calculation of the dune angle is adapted in three ways: (1) The effect of transverse sediment transport on migration rate, (2) a reduced dune height for larger angles, (3) a limited dune orientation angle. The first measure is promising; it reduces the calculated dune orientation angles to more realistic values. However, the current implementation is problematic. The second measure is simple to implement and also reduces the dune orientation angle to more realistic values. However, the factor used to reduce the dune height has no physical basis. The third measure did not lead to satisfying results, but can be combined with the other measures. In the simplified environment cross-stream sediment transport was based on just the transverse slope. However, the flume experiments by Talmon [2009] show that sediment transport also depends largely on the changed flow pattern near the bed. We analysed the flume experiments carried out by Talmon [2009]. These experiments were carried out to quantify the transverse sediment transport over oblique dunes. Furthermore, we carried out detailed three-dimensional flow simulations. We used the detailed model of Nabi [2012] to carry out these flow simulations. Sieben & Talmon [2011] derived formulae for the mean sediment transport direction based on the experiments of Talmon [2009]. During our analysis of the flume experiments and three-dimensional flow simulations we found three main improvements of the formulae by Sieben & Talmon [2011]: (1) The length of the zones as proposed by Sieben & Talmon [2011] are inconsistent with the lengths seen in the flume experiments. (2) The relation between dune angle and crest parallel flow velocity appears to be exponential. (3) The near-bed flow direction on the stoss side of the dune (outside the transition zone) was assumed to be equal to the main flow direction. We found that there is a small but noticeable effect of the dune angle on the near-bed flow direction.","dunes; bedforms; bed-load transport; dune orientation; numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","River Engineering","",""

(mentor); Boersema, T. (mentor); Roefs, F. (mentor)","2012","This master thesis describes the development of a framework for wayfinding designers. The framework provides them structure and insights for applying emergency wayfinding based on human behaviour in emergency situations. The project is commissioned by Delft University of Technology and the company Mijksenaar in Amsterdam. Mijksenaar is a design agency specialized in wayfinding, more specific in the design of visual orientation, navigation and information systems to support people in finding their way. Next to wayfinding solutions for “normal” use, Mijksenaar advises more and more frequently on the design of wayfinding solutions for emergency situations. Emergency wayfinding applied today is strictly regulated and Mijksenaar wants to be able to offer their clients solutions that go beyond the straightforward application of the legal safety requirements. In an emergency situation something happens that poses a threat to the lives of the people involved, which changes their behaviour at that moment. An emergency wayfinding system should be based on this complex behaviour. Practical examples of emergencies have shown that wayfinding systems meant for evacuation are not always effective in guiding people to a place of safety in the event of an emergency. This raised the following question that became the basis for this project: Are the regulated emergency wayfinding systems applied today sufficiently effective in supporting people in finding their way to a place of safety in the event of an emergency? A thorough analysis on human behaviour in emergencies and the currently applied emergency wayfinding system show that the conventional system is built on assumptions about human escape behaviour that do not correspond to the escape behaviour people perform in practice. As a result people do not often (primarily) use the conventional emergency wayfinding system when trying to find their way to a place of safety. In addition, the current way of warning people for an emergency situation does not lead to immediate escape behaviour of people. The chance for a successful evacuation for everyone increases when people start escaping immediately. The conclusion of the analysis stage was clear; emergency wayfinding can be improved. The vision on new emergency wayfinding was phrased as follows: A new emergency wayfinding system should stimulate escape behaviour immediately after perceiving the first warning signals of an emergency and support people effectively in finding their way to a place of safety. This by taking into account people’s automatic and impulsive behaviour and by giving them the confidence they will find their way to a place of safety using this system. Emergency wayfinding that meets this vision and is applicable in different environments, cannot be fitted in one standardized system. Different environments require different emergency wayfinding implementations in order to effectively support people to safety in an emergency situation. This resulted in the following design assignment: Design a framework for wayfinding designers that provides them insights in the possibilities for emergency wayfinding based on human behaviour in emergencies for different types of environments and that takes into account actual emergency conditions. The framework brings together and presents the relations between: - environment characteristics, divided into characteristics related to the building and the users of the building - emergency wayfinding design, divided into guidance elements and locations for placement of these elements - requirements from human behaviour in emergency situations, with a subdivision into guidelines - emergency conditions (e.g. presence of smoke). The objective of the framework is to provide structure and food for thought for designers. They can explore solutions by playing with all characteristics in a structured way.","Emergency; Wayfinding design; Framework; Human behaviour; Evacuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Kroesen, M. (mentor); Urlings, T.H. (mentor)","2012","Introduction - The Dutch government wants to comply with European and global climate goals. One facet of this is reducing negative effects of car use by encouraging the use of cars that are more environmentally friendly, reducing car mileage, and increasing the use of more sustainable transport modes. Dutch policies make purchasing an environmentally friendly car more attractive, but they do not reduce the actual mileage. Therefore, these policies do not achieve the desired results of meeting the government’s environmental goals and reducing the negative effects of car usage. Company car policy - Company cars, on average, are newer and are more often equipped with diesel engines but they are also larger which makes the fuel efficiency worse than the efficiency of private cars. The use of company cars has developed from being a status symbol for board members and necessary for employees who have to travel frequently for work, to a common practice in the configuration of the salary package and are used as an incentive to attract talented people in specialized functions. The cost of a company car to the employee is fully compensated by the company regardless of his/her mileage, which could increase the private use of company cars. Employees only pay fiscal addition, which is a set amount each month. Therefore, people with a company car are insensitive to the marginal costs of car usage. With current policy, when people drive less than 500 km. privately, they do not have to pay fiscal addition. There are 260,000 people that use this option. New policy cuts this exemption and applies fiscal addition to all company cars. Commuter compensation policy - In case no company car is provided, commuter compensation can be provided by companies to cover an employee’s travel expenses to and from his/her work place. In the Netherlands, this benefit is exempt from tax up to 19 cents/km. Newly proposed policy suggests this compensation be no longer exempt from tax so that it will be added to the employee’s taxable income. Knowledge gaps - This research will focus on the following: comparing Dutch company car and commuter compensation policy to that of other countries (1); analyzing the effects of company cars and commuter compensation on mobility behavior (2); analyzing the effects of the mobility behavior of a household head on that of his/her partner and the other way around (3); analyzing the effects of company cars on the use of other modalities and substitution effects between those modalities (4); and analyzing what type of trips are affected by having a company car (5). Research overview - Based on literature research, the current and newly proposed Dutch policy regarding company cars and commuter compensation are compared to those of other countries. An overview of wanted and unwanted effects is presented per country, and best practices are selected. Furthermore, a conceptual model is constructed to form the theoretical basis to explain the findings from the explorative analyses. The analyses are done with multiple regression and structural equation modeling. We look at the effects of company cars and commuter compensation on mobility behavior in general, and on car usage in specific. This information is obtained by analyzing three datasets: one from the Netherlands in 1989, one from Germany in 2009, and one from the Netherlands in 2010. We look at people on a personal level, at the effects of men’s mobility behavior on that of women and the other way around, and finally at substitution effects between different modes of transport. Sub conclusion: policy comparison - The policy comparison indicates that both the current Dutch company car policy as the newly proposed company car policy incentivize people to purchase cleaner cars. The newly proposed policy affects all people, whereas current policy gives a break to people that stay below the threshold of 500 kilometers private usage of the company car. However, the marginal costs are still not paid by the company car users which remains a problem. This still means that people’s mobility behavior will not change dramatically. However, the negative effects of company car usage can be reduced because people are incentivized to take a cleaner car as company car. Combined with the taxation of commuter compensation, which should reduce the commuting mileage, the newly proposed Dutch policy seems to be more in line with the Dutch government’s goals of reducing emissions. By focusing the tax of commuter compensation on cars, the use of other modes can be stimulated. Sub conclusion: effects of having company cars on mobility behavior - The conclusion that can be drawn from analyzing all three datasets is that having a company car is related to more mobility. In the Dutch 1989 data we find that men with a company car make about 58% more car trips, and women with a company car about 44% more. If we look at generic data, which only has people with a job and a driver’s license in it, we find that having a company car is related to 70% more car trips. In addition, for this latter group, having a company car is related to 156% more commuting trips. In Germany we do not see a significant effect on the number of total trips, nor in the number of car trips if someone has a company car. We do, however, see more total travel time and total travel distance, as well as travel time by car and travel distance by car. Perhaps people in Germany use the company car to make longer trips. This could mean that people in Germany that have to travel further to work, or drive more for their work, get a company car. Most effects of company cars changed mobility behavior over a longer period of time prior to 2008. The Dutch data from 2010 also shows that having a company car is related to 26% more car trips and 45% more total travel time. Sub conclusion: effects of receiving commuter compensation on mobility behavior - When we look at the effects of commuter compensation in the generic Dutch data from 1989, we see that receiving compensation is related to 25% more commuting trips and 16% more car trips. A higher compensation amount is even related to 0.3% more car trips per extra euro of compensation. However, when we look at the household split data, we find that men receiving commuter compensation is related to 14% fewer total trips, and 83% fewer commuting trips for men. In addition, men receiving compensation is related to women making almost 5% fewer total trips per week. Sub conclusion: effects between men’s and women’s mobility behavior - The results from the Dutch 1989 data show that there were no significant effects from women’s mobility behavior on men’s mobility behavior. We do see that each trip that men make is related to women making 1.5% more trips. This was expected because men and women might make trips together. It is interesting that the effect does not appear the other way around. The German dataset, however, shows that there appears to be an enhanced effect between men and women regarding their generic mobility behavior. Each trip made by men is related to women making 1.1% more trips. Each trip made by women is related to men making 1.5% more trips. The German data shows that there is competition between men and women for car usage. Sub conclusion: other effects on mobility behavior - The most important other results are that the number of cars in a household and the education level have a positive correlation with mobility behavior. People with a higher education level are likely to have a higher income and thus more cars. These effects can probably be influenced by increasing car and/or road taxes because then every car becomes more expensive. Sub conclusion: substitution effects between modalities - If we look at Dutch and German results for substitution effects between different modalities, we find that company cars in The Netherlands are related to a higher number of car trips and a lower number of trips by all other modalities other than walking. In Germany there are no significant effects of having a company car. This confirms our expectations that a company car makes it less appealing to take other modes of transport than the car in The Netherlands. It is interesting to see that this same effect is not found in Germany. The fact that walking trips are not affected by having a company car makes sense, because sometimes taking the car for short distances is irrational. For both countries, we see that all other modalities form a substitution for car trips, and the other way around. The number of car trips increases is negatively correlated to the number of trips by all other modes. Furthermore, the number of train trips is negatively correlated to the number of car trips in both data sets, and that the Dutch 2010 data shows that bicycle trips are also a substitute for train trips. The number of bicycle trips has a negative correlation to the number of car and bus trips in both data sets. However, the Dutch 2010 data also show that train trips are a substitute for bicycle trips. Perhaps the bicycle is a suitable alternative for the train in The Netherlands, but not so much in Germany. Finally, car trips are the only substitute for walking. Sub conclusion: purpose of trips - Having a company car is positively related to the number of trips for work, and the number of transport-related trips. Having a company car is related to a lower number of shopping trips. Policy implications - The fact that proposals are being written to reduce the negative effects of cars is a good thing. In The Netherlands, current and newly proposed company car policies stimulate buying cleaner cars, but they need to incorporate an incentive for the user to reduce car mileage. A personal contribution to the marginal costs seems like a good way to do this. This makes company car users more aware of the costs and it is a financial incentive for them to reduce their mileage. The commuter compensation taxation should reduce mobility behavior. However, the tax is planned to also be levied on public transport modalities. By focusing the tax on cars, car mileage can be reduced because people would have a financial incentive to travel with other modes of transport. Making it less attractive to own multiple cars is also something that could reduce mileage. This can be done by increasing the road and/or car taxes but also in a new way like taxing second cars more than first cars, as is done with houses. The fact that the new policy is dismissed in the fall of 2012 is hopefully but a bump in the road for the way to a more sustainable future of road transport.","mobility behavior; company car; commuter compensation; fringe benefit; tax policy; substitution effect; multiple regression; structural equation modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-13","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport & Logistics","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2012","This master thesis describes the design of an elderly community platform for YoooM, a touchscreen telepresence device that is currently being put on the market. The objective of YoooM is to allow users the best possible contact over distance. To enable this, the system is equipped with two large screens and two cameras that give a life-sized panorama view of both upper and lower body of the conversation partner. This allows for communication through body language, which is essential for good contact. As the product enables users with small social networks or immobility problems to engage in social interactions, elderly are considered the main target group. The aim of this graduation project is to design a fitting interface that allows for optimal interaction between elderly within a virtual community environment. EXPLORATION From explorations it was found that the current YoooM interface lacks the option of meeting new people. As one of the main aims of YoooM is to reduce loneliness among elderly, this is an essential missing part. From this insight the following design vision was established: “Provide inviting opportunities to meet new peers via YoooM, facilitate casual social (group) interaction and encourage creating friendships.” Literature research and interviews with the target group then resulted in the following six main guidelines that should be taken into account when designing an elderly community platform to meet new people.  Provide a ticket-to-talk - i.e. create legitimate circumstances which provide an excuse or a basis for opening a conversation  Be perceived as senior friendly - concerning elderly’s age related impairments and moral values  Take into account elderly’s privacy concerns - regarding interaction with unfamiliar persons through a computer  Trigger self-disclosure and reciprocity - i.e. sharing personal thoughts and experiences  Help finding common grounds - regarding similar interests and type of person  Provide a community feeling The target group was set as elderly (70+), who experience a sense of loneliness and are looking for casual friendships. They are limited in mobility, have little experience with computers and find it difficult to use mainstream applications. CREATIVE PROCESS Brainstorming and creating user scenarios led to four main concept directions: 1. user profiles combined with a list of all online participants 2. a world with live video images of users 3. clubs of specific interests 4. a concept based on forced encounters User evaluations were used to assess each concept direction and guidelines were constructed based on the feedback. It was established to incorporate the following aspects in a concept design.  An open space in which one can move around freely  Live video images of users  Visible user profiles with personal information  Method to filter on interests  Options for blocking persons and private conversations  A bulletin board This preliminary concept contained the following features. The world is visualized as a park where the user is shown in the center. Moving around is possible by pressing anywhere on the screen and sound intensity of users is proximity based; in a radial manner. The layout of the interface is as follows. The bottom of the lower YoooM screen shows six main menu buttons which give users access to the following functions: 1. adjusting one’s interests 2. searching people 3. viewing the public bulletin board 4. correspond with one’s groups 5. get help 6. exit the program. Another user evaluation then addressed all these aspects individually. The results indicate that all main features were perceived as useful and participants could see themselves using the concept. FINAL DESIGN After improving and further detailing the concept, usage scenarios were made to describe the envisioned use. The Wizard of Oz research method was then used to evaluate the usability of the menu functions in combination with giving specific tasks. The results show that a good balance has been found between keeping a low threshold for new users and giving more experienced users the possibility to attain a high level of interaction. Even though not all assignments were executed completely as intended, the users did indicate that by reading some more or getting some guidance, they could have found the right solution. This was also clearly related to the level of computer experience and age. Overall, the graphics were found to be clear as well as the design of text and buttons. Alternatives for the background of the park were also investigated. Key aspects were found to be an environment that feels personal, looks friendly, cheerful and is not too abstract. From the eight alternatives the park background was found to be most attractive together with a background showing a map of the Netherlands. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS The final concept fits the target group and offers features to meet all of the set design guidelines. Elderly that participated in the user tests were content with the design, including its appearance, user friendliness and usefulness. The concept fulfils both parts of the design vision that was set, by giving users the possibility to overhear conversations and allowing users to form groups and write messages to each other. This namely creates and open, casual and trustworthy environment that stimulates regular meetings. Throughout the design process, the concept has been tailored for YoooM to ensure that the concept fits well with the YoooM device itself. Moreover, the concept could not be implemented on just another device; it is especially designed to utilize the core features of YoooM. In order to make statements about implementation, the concept requires further detailing and validation through additional “live” research. The most important design recommendation is to alter the ‘extra options’ menu that appears when pressing on a user in the park. This is important as the procedure of touching someone is currently not understood to be linked to all functions of this menu. The current research results do indicate feasibility which leads to believe that the devised concept can be turned into a successful product. The concept is believed to be of added value and to be a good step forward in tackling the overall issue of reducing loneliness among elderly.","elderly telepresence interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-12-13","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Analysis of the company (Optelec), the target group, trends, developments and competition shows a business potential for a product that increases the awareness of the VIP. Being more aware of the environment leads to an improved feeling of safety and certainty, two of the most important values of the target group.

The match annotation enables a coach to lookup and to evaluate single moments of the match but doesn't provide a coach insight in the tactic. Tactic doesn't relate to single event but to a sequence of events. Currently it is not possible to evaluate the tactic. Because the match annotation contains information about the events, which includes the time and the location it is spatial-temporal dataset. To lookup a tactical pattern a coach it is required to express a tactical pattern on the spatial-temporal dataset. To enable a coach to incorporate his view of the game the flexibility is important.

Coaches active at the top national and international level provided input for the system and participated in the evaluation of the prototype. The designed system provides a useful method to evaluate tactics by a coach. The system enables the expression of a tactical pattern by a coach in a flexible manner. This thesis presents the requirements for a system to analyze tactics. It also presents an approach to model and express a tactical pattern using a domain specific language. To create a tactical pattern a visual query interface is presented. The visual interface also offers the possibility to interpret the result of a query.","domain specific language; spatial-temporal querying; visual query interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology, Web Information systems","","Information Architecture","",""

In recent fifteen years, China’s rapid economic development with environmental issues is becoming increasingly important. Until China’s 12th Five Year plan in 2010, it explicitly pointed out to promote green energy and develop energy-efficient economy to keep the country’s economic growth. However, unlike the developed countries, low capacity of market surveillance and low-profit products output plus lacks of management experience which push China’s green industrial development had encountered a bottleneck for most of companies. State owned enterprises, large sized companies and small and medium sized companies (SMEs) have different attitudes regarding to develop green industry. State owned enterprises and large sized companies have its financial capability to cope with the development of green industry, SMEs have to face with the financial capacity, industry structure, as well as management issues in order to respond the new regulations. Therefore the international environmental service company CRS which engages in reprocess service in China is belonging to SMEs that face not only the same problems mentioned above, but also doing business in Chinese business environment. The company is the sole sponsor for the project. The purpose of the research is providing the possible operating contexts as well as the possible future in Chinese green market. Hereby the research is formulated as: How do institutional relationships promote the development of green industry in China? To answer the research questions, there are mainly three methodologies applied into the project, namely literature review, scenario analysis and interviews.","Chinese green industry; institutional relationships; scenario analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-13","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis Department","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Ieder vliegveld beschikt over een bagage afhandelingproces, meestal ondersteunt door een geautomatiseerde system. Het proces transporteert de ruim bagage vanaf de check-in of bagdropoff punten tot de locatie waar de bagage in karren of containers (verder verwezen als laad unit) wordt geladen. Dit laden van bagage wordt het bouwen of de make-up van bagage genoemd. De uiteindelijk gevulde laad units worden naar het vliegtuig getransporteerd, waar de bagage dan wel los of in containers wordt geladen. Ook het proces van het uitladen van de laad units en het transporteren van deze bagage naar het reclaim gebied is onderdeel van het bagage afhandelingproces. De meeste functies van het afhandelingproces zijn geautomatiseerd. Daarentegen, is de make-up van bagage meestal uitgevoerd door de bagage afhandelaars. De afhandelaars zijn verantwoordelijk voor het laden van de bagage in de laad units. In dit onderzoek is aangenomen dat een afhandelaar twee bagage stukken per minuut laadt. Er is een grote variatie in het gewicht van de ruimbagage, maar in het geval van de grote Europese luchthavens is het gemiddelde gewicht 18 kg (Vanderlande Industries, 2012). Het gewicht en de frequentie waarmee bagage geladen wordt, zorgt voor een zwaar en daarbij een ergonomische onverantwoorde arbeidsplaats. Dit wordt gereflecteerd in het grote ziekteverzuim (10-15%) onder de bagage afhandelaars (Koelewijn & Opdam, 2007). Ook wordt de wetgeving betreffende de werk condities steeds meer aangescherpt, op dit moment voornamelijk nog in de westerse landen. Daarbij, is er een groei waar te nemen in het aantal passagiers, wat resulteert in een verhoogde pressie op de oplossingen voor bagage afhandeling. Daarvoor is er vraag naar een nieuwe visie betreffende het make-up proces, gevisualiseerd in een ontwerp. In dit ontwerp is een nieuwe manier van het laden van bagage en de daarbij behorende bagage processen en systemen ontwikkeld. Deze visie heeft als doel om een ergonomisch verantwoorde baan te ontwikkelen, die acht uur per dag kan worden uitgevoerd. De behoefte voor deze visie resulteert in de volgende onderzoekvraag en subvragen. Hoe kan het toekomstige bagage afhandeling make-up proces ontworpen worden, voornamelijk rekeninghoudend met de capaciteiten en beperking van de gebruiker, in dit geval de bagage afhandelaar? I. Hoe zijn het make-up proces en de bijbehorende systemen op dit moment ontworpen en hoe kunnen deze stappen geclassificeerd worden? II. Wat zijn de karakteristieken van de producten die ingrijpen in het bagage afhandeling systeem? III. Wat zijn de ergonomische aspecten die beschouwd moeten worden? IV. Wat zijn de harde en zachte eisen voor het toekomstige make-up proces V. Wat zijn haalbare conceptuele ontwerpen voor het toekomstige make-up proces? VI.

Om deze melkstromen te blijven verwerken tot hoogwaardige producten heeft FrieslandCampina het volgende speerpunt opgesteld: Versterking van marktposities in kindervoeding wereldwijd, zowel in ingrediënten als eindproducten. Dit heeft tot diverse projecten geleid om extra productiecapaciteit voor kindervoedings-ingrediënten te realiseren. Een van deze ingrediënten is lactose, dat een van de producten is van de fabriek FrieslandCampina DOMO Borculo (Borculo). In Borculo wordt de samenhang van de verschillende processen om lactose te produceren door velen als complex ervaren. Momenteel is deze complexiteit beheersbaar door de fabriek in stukjes op te delen waar elke operator verantwoordelijk is voor een bepaalde functie.

(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor)","2012","Abnormal neuromuscular control (NMC) has been suggested as a cause or effect of a-specific low back pain. This study aimed to gain more insight into the stabilization of the low back during postural control by developing a method to study the intrinsic and reflexive components of NMC. Inertial loading of the trunk by perturbation of subjects on a movable platform was used to induce force disturbances during posture maintenance without modulation due to manipulator contact to the upper body and pre-loading. Experimental conditions included variations in perturbation frequency content (low, mid and high bandwidth), visual feedback (eyes open/eyes closed) and task instructions (relax/resist). Frequency response functions (FRFs) were obtained for internal low back displacement (bending) and reflexes. Task instruction resulted in 49% (p=0.018) lower internal displacement gains below 1Hz during resist tasks, indicating good task compliance. Reflexive FRFs were not significantly influenced. Decreasing the perturbation frequency content from high to low bandwidth resulted in a 25% lower internal displacement gain (p=0.044) below 1 Hz. The presence of visual feedback reduced displacement gains with 9% (p=0.040) and the reflexive gain decreased by 64% (P=0.036) in the eyes open condition, EMG RMS increased indicating increased co-contraction. A physiologically-based model including intrinsic damping and stiffness as well as muscle spindle (position and velocity) and Golgi tendon organ (force) feedback was fitted to the full bandwidth data without visual feedback. This model accounted for 72% of the variance in displacement and 42% of the variance in reflexes. Analysis using this model showed that co-contraction as well as reflexes were modulated in reaction to experimental task. Analysis of the contribution of different model parts to the system behavior during resist tasks showed that the reflexive model part increased low back displacement. This shows that reflexes in this case decrease low back stiffness, due to inhibitory GTO reflexes.","system identification; low-back; postural control; inertial loading; muscle spindles; golgi tendon organs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

In this thesis an increased understanding of the physical and modeling considerations required for a better aero-elastic design of a blade is sought. To this end, an aero-structural model is developed and placed in an optimization procedure, where the mechanisms driving the optimizer can be analyzed. The model consists of a Blade Element Momentum analysis of the flow; and a process that dimensions the internal structure of a blade for a set of aerodynamic loads and design requirements. The optimizations use Genetic Algorithms and are done in a parametric way, increasing the design space and changing the objective function step by step. The studied parameters are the chord and twist distributions and the airfoil thickness of the outboard half of the blade. The optimizations are carried out with the objective of improving the design of the DOWEC reference turbine for power performance, blade mass and a combination of the two. The results of the optimizations show the mechanisms that must be taken into account when doing the preliminary aero-structural design of a wind turbine blade. In particular, one of the results indicates that the mechanisms for an enhanced power performance design and reduced blade mass are not always counteracting and can actually, with a good understanding of the physical phenomena, be used for an improved design in both aspects.","wind turbine blade; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","DUWIND","","","",""

(mentor); Bruens, G.N. (mentor); Liao, H. (mentor); Lu, M. (mentor)","2012","Gusto is a start up Taiwanese bicycle brand, who builds carbon fiber bicycles. It wants to enhance the brand awareness and strengthen the brand image by introducing an innovative urban bicycle for next generation which does contribute to environmental sustainability. ‘Design of a Bicycle for the Metropolitan White-collar Workers for Urban Mobility Use in Greater China Region of 2020’ is the topic of this project. Predicting what the target users’ needs for urban mobility in 2020 is the main task before designing the bicycle itself. After a series of researches, it shows that current Gusto’s product lines are away from its brand vision. To achieve the brand vision, a new extra line should be developed. According to the researches, the target group wants an urban mobility with the following characters: ‘Dry & clean’, ‘Low physical effort moving’ and ‘Easy & Comfortable & Speedy.’ Thus, Gusto should propose an E-bike to the consumers to fulfill all of the characters what they need. Helping metropolitans to enjoy comfortable and unrestricted cycling experiences in their daily life is the goal of the design. Once, while they are appreciating this easy personal urban mobility, they DO contribute to environmental sustainability. The result of the design is a full-size folding E-bike. The metropolitans can use it for commutes between home and office, with less effort. After works, it can be used for exercises and social activities as well. It provides comfortable and unrestricted cycling experiences to metropolitans' daily life, which is inspired from the freely swimming of an Orcinus Orca in the ocean. With it, the users can move in the city in the most easy, clean, safe and speedy way. The hidden electronic system and slender shape is appealing to those who are reluctant to ride common E-bikes due to their bulky shapes. The Smart System of it builds a BRIDGE for social networks between the users and the dynamic city environments. Smartphone integration plays as a key role in this system. The user can get connected easily with others and the city contexts. It is just like an orca, a highly social animal. Other details are designed as well to fulfill the design requirements. At the end of the project, a 1:1 scale rapid prototype was built to test the designed mechanisms, and to demonstrate the concepts. The evaluation results from the target users are positive, which is the first successful step to achieve the mission statement. A roadmap is proposed at last stage of this project. It indicates what Gusto has to do to continue this long-term project to have mass production of this E-bike or to apply features on to other Gusto bikes.","urban mobility; bicycle; future","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design & Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2012","Characterization of the geological and geo-chemical footprint of the Koolhoven gold deposit, Suriname. IAMGold operates Rosebel N.V. Gold Mines in Suriname, South America. The producing deposits are characterized to be Archaen greenstone hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposits. Regional exploration projects are located in rainforest environment. Geologists are therefore confronted with difficult access, few outcrops and deep weathering. Efficient exploration is crucial and for this reason a profound understanding of the local geology, gold depositional mechanism and signature is required. There is a hypothesis that a temperature gradient resulting from the flow of hydrothermal fluids through the shear and tension veins will have caused alteration halos to be formed around the gold deposit. Specific element enrichment and depletion are also expected near the gold deposition as a result of changing pressure/temperature regime and fluid characteristics. Recognizing and understanding alteration halos will increase the target area in an exploration campaign. To test this hypothesis 28 boreholes with a maximum downhole depth of 230 meters were sampled across the producing Koolhoven pit on the Rosebel concession. 85 Samples were analysed for trace element and major element content in a laboratory. 904 Samples were analysed using an X-50 Mobile XRF device for element content. 1573 Spectral measurements were obtained using a Hi-Res Terraspec and 40 thin sections were analysed using a conventional polarization microscope and electron microprobe. The petrographic analysis reveals the presence of quartz, carbonate, chlorite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, magnetite, hematite, rutile, clay mineral and feldspar including plagioclase. Bleached veins selvages are associated with high concentrations of carbonate and sericite, pyrite porphyroblasts and are devoid of chlorite. The sulfide mineral content does not exceed 5%. The conglomerate clasts are identified to be of volcanic origin mainly, hereby supporting the major element results. The veins contain quartz, carbonate, chlorite and the accessory minerals white-mica and tourmaline. Due to the low degree of deformation the veins are concluded to be of late timing compared to the main deformation. The use of major element analysis has resulted in the effective differentiation of lithologies present in the Koolhoven pit. Siltstone/mudstone, two types of greywacke (A and B), sandstone, conglomerate and volcanic rock ranging from mafic to felsic have been recognized. Greywacke B and conglomerate are spatially related and their major-element content resembles that of the volcanic rock. The use of log-ratios to analyse the trace element data suggests the presence of correlations between specific element ratios and gold concentrations. The best results were obtained by analysing one borehole a time. Different correlations are suggested in the different boreholes. It therefore remains uncertain to use the presented results for the entire deposit. The visible and near infrared spectral analysis reveals that paragonite, Fe-chlorite and carbonate are the dominant minerals encountered. No direct link has been found between specific minerals, mineral crystallinity and relative mineral proportions to gold concentrations. Volcanic rock is devoid of muscovite. The presented results of the identified lithologies are in accordance with the regional geological evolution. The alteration characteristics determined are to be considered as the proximal alteration zone of the Koolhoven deposit. Up to a distance of 500 to 1 km away from the gold mineralization no alteration halo has been found except from the small scale bleaching near veins. Since the characteristics described in this report represent the proximal alteration, they may be used in exploration campaigns to define if hydrothermal fluids have been flowing in the area and hence there is a chance of gold deposition.","gold; alteration; XRF; Suriname","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

The last decades a global concern for the environment emerged. Thus the reduction of packaging material waste in enterprises results in an enhancement of both operational efficiency and environmental performance. However, there exists a knowledge gap with regard to the usage of lean manufacturing to reduce packaging material waste. A framework was established based on available literature to provide a guideline for enterprises to realize comprehensive packaging material waste management through lean manufacturing implementation. The suitability of the lean manufacturing approach to minimize packaging material waste , as proposed by the framework, was assessed through execution of a case study performed at the Heineken Zoeterwoude brewery. The case study results show lean manufacturing is a suitable approach to minimize packaging material waste. However, as manufacturing enterprises achieve high efficiency levels the opportunities for further improvement though lean manufacturing are obstructed by several organisational and technological requirements. Conventional improvement methods and tools are left powerless due to this phenomenon. It can be concluded the lean manufacturing approach currently does not facilitate guidelines to tackle this problem. To ensure further development of lean manufacturing, future research is recommended with regard to implementation of the proposed framework in practice and packaging material waste management in other organisations.","lean manufacturing; packaging material; information; waste; environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-12-10","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analisis and Management","",""

Recently, Veran-Tissoires et al. presented new research in the study of the precipitation of salt at the surface of an unconsolidated porous medium (known as efflorescence), as a consequence of evaporation of brine from within this porous medium. It is observed that the distribution of the efflorescence is not homogenous. The preferential locations for precipitation have a stronger velocity field within the porous medium, as a result of evaporation flux, heterogeneity in the porous medium and the pumping effect of the efflorescence structures. This study expands on the research of Veran-Tissoires et al. by examining the efflorescence patterns on consolidated porous media. The efflorescence behavior is found to be similar as that of unconsolidated porous media, except that the efflorescence structure of a natural sandstone is more compact. In addition, a method for tracking the efflorescence in three dimensions using microCT imaging is introduced.","","","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P. (mentor)","2012","This short summary helps to grasp the motive behind the research, its objectives and to find out what is presented on the following pages of the report. It offers a condensed, one page recapitulation of its contents and intentions and suggests who might be interested to read it. CONTEXT Map generalisation is a tedious task, requiring skilled cartographers to work for long periods of time. Experience shows that compiling a map can take several months. It is the common wisdom that such labour?intensive tasks should be consigned to computers and thus be accomplished more uniformly, more precisely, more rapidly, and at much reduced cost (Buttenfield & McMaster, 1991). The benefits of automatic generalisation could aid hydrographic offices (HOs) in their ENC creation. OBJECTIVES The aim of the project is to create ‘hard knowledge’ specifications that could be subsequently used to create/use with tools for automatic generalisation of ENCs. The research compiles requirements of various HOs with the recommendations of S?4 and knowledge in model and cartographic generalisation of topographic charts to create computer translatable rules that allow creating a smaller scale/usage ENCs from a higher scale/usage ENC / S?57 data without or with minimum human interference. DELIVERABLES AND THEIR IMPACT The final report present a set of specifications, rules and tools that allow going from one compilation scale (Approach) to another (Coastal) without or with minimum human interference. It also discusses shortcomings and rate of success of such approach. The study mainly bases on the existing generalisation operators available in the literature, but where it is just? points out scarceness of the choice and proposes new solutions. As a result, an IHO standard could be created for the generalisation of charts (ENCs) and tools implemented in the software used for chart creation. WHO SHOULD READ THIS REPORT? This report might be found interesting by the GIS community, especially when interested in advancements in digital cartography and ENCs. The main recipients, however, are the hydrographic community, mainly Hydrographic Offices, and hydrographic software vendors.

(mentor); Ludema, M.W. (mentor); Scholten, D. (mentor); Desaeger, M. (mentor); Waltniel, T. (mentor)","2012","Since 1990, this energy consumption in transport has been increasing at an average annual growth rate of approximately 1.6%. Freight transport activity, as one of the main contributors to this growth, is forecasted to increase by 50% by 2020. As a result, a number of policy issues have been raised, which can be summarized as follows: - Congestion in the European transport system is having a negative impact on cost and time of transport and is increasing fuel consumption. - Freight transport needs to be in line with EU’s climate change targets. - Freight transport is highly dependent on fossil fuel which is not in line with EU’s oil independence policies. Following these concerns, the White Paper on Transport: Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area was published on 28 March 2011 by the European Commission. In this document, it was evident that the EU, for the first time, directly targeted the European freight industry and expected a reduction of CO2 emissions and a shift away from road freight to alternative modes. After noticing the shift of EUs attention towards freight, Toyota Motor Europe, raised the question concerning the effect this shift will have on its European supply chain operations. This concern initiated a study which calumniated in the formation of this Master thesis document. The study focuses on the possible effects the EU initiatives will have on European freight and subsequently Toyota’s freight activities. The research resulted in the construction of a model which was used to forecast the future modal split and CO2 emissions of Toyota’s freight activities. In order to support the initiated study, a research objective was developed and its scope was defined. The main objective was to study the effects of EU policies on the EU freight industry with regards to developments in “freight costs” and “CO2 emissions factors” and to further on, analyze the subsequent influence on the business of Toyota Motor Europe concerning its “modal split” and “total CO2 emissions”. Based on the defined research objective and the scope, the main research question was defined as: “How will the targets, outlined in the EU White Paper, change European freight and to what extent and effect will Toyota Motor Europe’s freight activities, with regards to modal split and total CO2 emissions, be affected by the changes?” In order to answer the research question, the research methodology was designed and the methods which were to be used were selected. The methods were the following: - Literature Review - Direct Observations - Stakeholder Analysis - Qualitative interviews and Stated Preference Surveys - Spread Sheet Modeling The modeling technique which was decided to be used for the study was spreadsheet modeling. The tools which were to be utilized during the development of the model were subsequently identified as follows: 1. Scenario Development; 2. Value of Time Analysis (VoT); 3. Constant Elasticity of Substitution Analysis (CES).","White Paper on Transport; EU Freight; Freight Modal Split; Freight CO2 Emissions; Freight Cost; Spreadsheet Modeling; Value of Time; Stated Preference Survey; Constant Elasticity of Substitution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Management of Technology/Transport and Logistics","",""

(mentor); De Reuver, G.A. (mentor); Lobbezoo, M. (mentor)","2012","Many knowledge intensive small and medium size organizations have already implemented knowledge management tools and approaches, but often in an unstructured and intuitive fashion. This makes managing knowledge processes difficult, may hinder adoption by support workers, and reduces the effects on organizational performance. Observations at the support department of Adyen, combined with recent literature, yield success factors relevant for medium size SaaS companies to implement effective knowledge processes. Firstly, knowledge processes should be embedded in the business processes. Secondly, double-loop learning is supported by descriptive knowledge which is required for challenging the standing assumptions about the business process. A ticket issue categorization tool adhered to these two success factors. Based on the lessons of this research this categorization tool has been re-embedded, and therefore readopted. Thirdly, knowledge process interventions should be participative, incremental, and continuous. This research implemented one, and quantitatively evaluated two such interventions. The data for evaluation has been gathered using a continuous time-series design with heterogeneous groups. Knowledge capturing, storing, organizing, and sharing provided the insights needed to perform both interventions. The first intervention – performed by the knowledge workers of Adyen support – resulted in a 70% improvement of the number of shoppers that got to hear the right information in the call menu. This improves the support department’s performance through more accurate classification of the shopper issues, and provides important lessons for future improvements. The second intervention was performed at the sales department, in cooperation with an expert support worker. As a result, the amount of captured sales leads at the sales department almost doubled. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that there is an indirect positive effect of descriptive embedded knowledge processes on organizational performance in medium size SaaS companies. The business process intervenes between knowledge processes and organizational performance, because this is where customer value is created.","Organizational Performance; Knowledge Process; Double-loop Learning; Tickets; Small Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-12-07","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Policy and Management Innovation Systems","","Section Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor); Kamp, I. (mentor)","2012","This project is done for the design studio of Andrew Winch Designs and Vitters Shipyard, a shipyard for large custom sailing yachts. Most often, yachts above 30 metres are custom built, which means the yacht is specifically designed for a single client. The size of a sailing yacht with a length over 30 metres creates large open spaces. Especially for children, there is more difficulty to move around while the yacht is moving. Also, having a tall owner conflicts with the wishes for a sleek exterior profile. The assignment was to design a new deckhouse and cockpit area for a 43-metre sailing yacht. The client desired an experience that increases pleasure and safety for his two young children (age 4-9) and the yacht must be able to accommodate very tall people (up to 2050mm). As a starting point for this project the hull and layout of an existing 43-metre sailing yacht were used, except for the cockpit and salon/deckhouse. To analyse the current product, the layouts, salons and cockpits of all sloops between 40 and 46 metres that were delivered from 2002 to 2012 were compared. The comparison showed that most of the layouts are very similar. The cockpits are even more alike, but the salons differ in the amounts and sizes of functional spaces. By analysing technical equipment of the yacht upon which this project was based, it turned out the fan coils units, navigation equipment, engine room ventilation and captive winches need to be taken into account, since they influence the design of the salon. Also, interviews were done with people who have experience with sailing with young children and literature research \ was done to gain knowledge about the development of children. Current yachts are not designed for children as, for example, some doors are too heavy for them to hold when heeling. Also, children grow up and they change quite rapidly in behavior, so their ergonomics and needs change. Most of the time they play video games, especially during longer crossings. After defining a domain and finding context factors that shape the future, a vision was defined. With a very comfortable and flexible environment for the children to play games and be educated, children would be able to pass the time during longer crossing in an excellent way. Also, because they visit amazing places in the world, a way would be created to save these memories. With requirements that were derived from the analysis and vision, the idea generation was started. It was split into four layers: exterior, salon & cockpit layout, children’s area and details. For the exterior, an idea was chosen where a sleek profile line hides a larger volume inside to provide enough headroom. A layout was chosen with a special area for the children to play in. This area contains a trophy wall for collectables as a way to save their memories and two flexible seats for the children to play in. These ideas were further developed in the concept and design development phase, where the technical equipment in the salon was arranged, following the assumptions from the technical analysis. In the end, the design was evaluated. It could, for example, form a base for future client requests with similar design briefs, with only minor changes to the clients taste. Or in case a client would be found and the design fits his taste perfectly, the next step would be to adapt the rest of the layout to the requirements of him and his children.","yacht; sailing; interior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Advanced Automotive","",""

(mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Van Maren, D.S. (mentor); Bai, W. (mentor)","2012","The objective of this project is to assess the influence of suspended sediment on hydrodynamic properties in the study area from tidal damping aspect. Firstly, through conducting tidal amplification factor analysis based on real time measured data, seasonal variation in sloping tendency has been observed. The difference in sloping tendency revealed in tidal amplification factor analysis is a result of flow velocity and water depth interaction. In wet season, the sloping tendency in analysis result suggests that tide with higher amplitude experiences less damping as the tidal wave travels upstream than which with lower amplitude; in dry season, tide with higher amplitude experiences more damping than which with lower amplitude. Secondly, a two dimensional clear water flow model has been set up. By comparing the tidal amplification factor analysis result based on model result and with which based on measured data, a disagreement in sloping tendency has been observed in wet season, which indicates that the pattern of flow velocity and water depth interaction in clear water flow is different from which in the reality. Through extensive sensitivity analyses, the disagreement in sloping tendency in tidal amplification factor analysis result persists. Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn as follows: the suspended sediment which has not been considered in the model does have an influence over the hydrodynamic properties. By performing analysis over tidal amplitude and effective Chezy coefficient, the result reveals that the value of effective Chezy coefficient has a high correlation with the tidal amplitude, as higher tidal amplitude associates with higher value of Chezy coefficient and vice versa. In addition, the analysis result suggests that the value of effective Chezy coefficient for this study area should fall in between 60 for neap tide period to 70 for spring tide period. This finding conforms to the explanation proposed from buoyancy destruction aspect: higher tidal amplitude associates with higher suspended sediment concentration and better mixing, which would induce more buoyancy destruction effect and result in a lower bed roughness. Therefore, through analyses conducted in this project, the buoyancy destruction theory has been indirectly supported. I addition, since insufficient sediment information is obtained, this project fails in predict the future situation in a detailed manner. However, as which has been reported in previous literatures, the concentration of suspended sediment would decrease in the future. Some primitive estimation can still be done. As the sediment concentration drops, the hydrodynamic properties in the study area would be more prone to the clear water flow as presented in the model, such that tide with higher amplitude would experience more damping in Jiangyin-Xuliujing reach and less damping in Zhenjiang-Jiangyin reach.","suspended sediment; tidal damping; hydraulic roughness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","NUS-TUD Double Degree Program","",""

(mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Berg, A. (mentor)","2012","Breakwaters are used for reducing wave height in harbours or divert sediment. One of the types of breakwaters is the rubble mound breakwater. These structures are constructed with smaller quarry rock as core and larger quarry rock as outer layer. For economical reasons, the design allows some damage to the armour layer. The amount of damage is objectively and quantitative determined by damage parameters. There are several different damage parameters which describe all different unique characteristics of the erosion hole. For a straight slope with a constant cross section, extensive research is executed for reliable design values of some of these parameters. For a 3D geometry such as a roundhead such design values are not formulated. This thesis is about roundhead model tests, executed at Deltares research institute. Four tests with increasing wave height are executed to eight identical roundheads. The roundheads weren’t repaired in between test so progressive damage occurred. The damage was analysed with the use of digital stereo photography (DSP), this high-resolution measurement technique creates a computer model of the physical model with a resolution of one mm. By subtracting the computer models of before and after a test, the erosion and deposition is accurately represented. The damage level is quantitatively determined by comparing different damage parameters. The compared parameters consider all different aspects of the erosion, the number of displaced stones (damage percentage Nd), the number of displaced stones per stone width (Nod), eroded area (van der Meer damage parameter S), nominal erosion length (L) & the nominal erosion depth (E). Before the results are being analysed, the data gathered from the DSP must be processed to smooth the individual stones but keep the erosion profile intact. The optimal smoothing process is based on a convolution or moving average principle. The size of the optimal smooth factor is two times the median nominal stone size (Dn50). The results show three erosion holes at the roundhead, the first erosion hole between 0~10° from the incident wave direction, the second between 60~70° from the incident wave direction and the third between 105~115° from the incident wave direction. The most damage was observed at the first and third erosion hole. The damage in the third erosion hole was slightly higher and more variable between the eight realizations compared with the first erosion hole. By comparing the different damage parameters it appears that only the erosion depth E, is representing the realizations correctly; the highest values in the third erosion hole with the largest deviation. Therefore design values of this damage parameter are proposed for roundheads with a slope of 1:2 and an armour layer thickness of two times Dn50. Initial damage: E = 0.2 ~ 0.3 Intermediate damage: E = 0.5 ~ 0.6 Failure: E = 1.0 ~ 1.1 Collapse: E = 1.5 ~ 1.6 To come to a generic damage parameter further research is necessary to validate the proposed design values for roundheads with different configurations, such as different slopes and different radius.","breakwater; roundhead; damage; Digital stereo photography; erosion depth; rubble mound","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","55 years have passed since the launch of the first man-made space vehicle, Sputnik 1. While spaceflight has changed significantly in many ways, further improvement in rocket technology is still being pursued. Launch-assist systems, which give the launch vehicle a combination of initial velocity and initial altitude, could create such an improvement. There are two factors that come into play when determining if this might be true. Firstly, the cost of building and operating both the assist platform and the launch vehicle and secondly, the total system performance. This thesis focuses on the performance of the entire system. The definition of the performance of a system utilizing the assisted launch technique was chosen to be the payload mass-to-initial mass ratio of the launcher. This was maximized by optimizing various parameters of the launch vehicle and the launch trajectory using a differential evolution algorithm. Optimization was performed for launchers using either kerolox propellant or hydrolox propellant using a variety of initial altitude and initial velocity combinations. To show continuous trends of the vehicle design parameters through the whole range of simulated launchers, all launchers consist of only one stage. The end result of the thesis provides insight of the relationships between the performance, the launch vehicle design, the trajectory profile and the magnitude and type of the assist. It also provides a comparison between the performance of launchers using low specific impulse and high density propellant, such as kerolox, and high specific impulse and low density propellant, such as hydrolox. The results are intended to be used as a tool to base design decisions on during future concept studies.","spaceflight; launch systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-20","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

Although the overall (electrical & heat) efficiency of these systems is quite high, the electrical efficiency is still a lot lower than what can be achieved with today’s piston engines. A possible way to increase the electrical efficiency could be to use a part of the waste heat from the microturbine to generate steam. This steam is subsequently injected back into the microturbine’s combustion chamber. The accompanying rise in mass flow and specific heat of the flue gas entering the turbine leads to a rise in power output and efficiency. A microturbine operating under these conditions is said to be in ‘wet cycle operation’. The goal of the present project is to investigate the effects of wet cycle operation on the performance of a 100 kWe microturbine-based combined heat and power system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); De Smit, B. (mentor)","2012","During the last decade, the development of technologies is changing the meaning of technology in our daily life. The development of intelligent products immerses us in technology and therefore it no longer stands in the background. This ubiquitous technology and new smart computing systems interact with humans and become more than just context alone; they become part of us. This raises many questions about the integration of such a system in society, but it also offers opportunities to address societal needs that have not been addressed before. One of these societal needs is the support and education of children who have sensory processing disorders. Children with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) experience difficulties with the neurological processing of incoming sensory signals. Due to this disorder, these children encounter social, communicational and educational problems in stressful situations where they are oversensitive to the sensory input. The goal of this project was to develop a wearable appliance that supports children with SPD (8 to 14 years old) during SPD-related stressful situations in order to reduce the intensity of the stress. The principle of Deep Pressure Therapy was combined with sensor- and actuator technology to develop a smart system that (1) recognizes stressful situations, (2) applies pressure to remove stress symptoms and (3) evaluates and adapts the treatment to the user. The concept that was developed uses a heart rate and a respiration rate sensor to determine when the child experiences stress. The child wears an inflatable vest, which is inflated when the heart rate and respiration rate increase (i.e. a stressful situation). This inflation provides deep pressure - a strong tactile stimulus - to the upper part of the torso of the child, which organizes the signal processing in the child’s brain. A prototype was constructed, which consists of an inflatable vest and a sweatshirt that contains the pump, the microcontroller and the electronics that connect the different elements of the system. The Squease Vest, provided by Squeasewear, contains air compartments that can be inflated to apply pressure to the torso of the user. The respiration belt consists of a stretchable conducting rubber cord, whose resistance changes when it is stretched. A heart rate sensor is located around the left index finger of the user, which responds to the changing colour of the skin when blood passes through the veins. A photodiode detects the colour difference skin in order to determine the heart rate. The Arduino microcontroller takes care of the signal processing between the different components of the system. It receives the signals from the heart rate sensor and the respiration rate sensor as input, and it determines the output signal for the pump. The prototype was tested among children with SPD, autism and ADHD. The usability tests have shown that the automatic application of deep pressure during stressful moments had a positive effect on the behaviour and the attention regulation of children with SPD (4 out of 5 test cases). However, the functionality test of the prototype showed that the heart rate and respiration rate sensors were too inaccurate for long-term testing. The project concludes with a proposition for technical, usability and market implementation aspects for a full-scale product. The proposed product keeps the overall price (400 Euro), weight (400 grams) and power consumption (58 mAh) within its boundaries. Overall it can be concluded that this project made a promising start in the development of a smart appliance for children with SPD, but that additional research, testing and development are required in order to develop a full-scale implementation of the appliance.","inflatable vest; autism; Sensory Processing Disorder; ADHD; respiration rate; breathing rate; deep pressure therapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Computer-Aided Design Engineering","","","",""

The beaches have names of hotels situated at the beach. The hotel owners describe large scale erosion at the beaches over the years. Throughout the years groups of students from Delft have measured the waterline (by GPS) and the cross sections. The beaches are strongly influenced by the waves, because there is insignificant tidal motion. This wave domination is variable over the seasons (winter versus summer). For Azalea Beach only the waterlines were measured and the waterline was comparable to 2010. So, the erosion mentioned in 2010 is not monitored anymore. The waterline of Sirius beach shows erosion patterns in the north which has stabilized over the years. And the accretion in the south (mentioned in 2010 and 2011) has stopped. The cross section measurements show the same trends as the waterline measurements. Though it is hard to draw conclusions from the data. The seasonal variablility and the lacking accuracy of the measurements are the biggest problems. What is more, at Sirius Beach the test measurements of the wave pressure meter took place. This meter is used for the first time in de Bulgaria fieldwork series. The test close to the water line show breaking of waves, which is obvious in the coastal zone. At the end, the meter would be used in the water in front of Asparuhovo Beach. Asparuhovo Beach is a beach South of the city centre of Varna. It is a populair place in the summer as it is close to the city. At the Asparhovo Beach the interest goes to the development of the beach and the possible erosion. The measurements for this beach include the waterline measurements with GPS, the cross section measerements and the wave measurements. Except for the lateral measurement, the measurements of this year have been compared to the measurements of the previous two years. From these comparisons the conlusion can be drawn that the North side of the Asparuhovo Beach is hardly changed in the last three years. The South side of the beach does show significant change in the bathymetry and the waterline. Due to the large change in the waterline it is unclear if these changes are due to season variabiblity. In the coming years it would be recommended to take extra measurements in this area.","Fieldwork; Varna; Asparuhovo; Bulgaria","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","Campus only","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
