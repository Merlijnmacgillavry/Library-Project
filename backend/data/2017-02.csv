(mentor); Henselmans, P.W.J. (mentor)","2017","Background: Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) gained increasing support in the surgical community over the last decades. Due to the rigid tip of current used rigid instruments the maneuverability is limited during a procedure. To increase maneuverability steerable instruments have been developed. However current handheld steerable instruments contain low bending stiffness, which is one of the reasons that these instruments are hardly used in clinical practice. This study aims to design and evaluate a new stiff steerable mechanism with 2 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) for use in a handheld MIS instrument. Methods: Characteristics of the steering mechanisms were described and analyzed. The most suited approach for creating a stiff steerable mechanism was selected. Multiple 2 DOF stiff concepts were designed. Of these, three concept prototypes (scaled 10ùëöùëö) were engineered and manufactured (3D printing). The ability to steer and the stiffness of the prototypes was evaluated. In addition, the most promising mechanism was redesigned to fit the required 5ùëöùëö dimensions. It‚Äôs robustness was verified using Finite Element Method (FEM) techniques. Results: Eight different mechanisms were described and analyzed. The most suited approach is a mechanism that consists of solid rods and universal joints to guide steering forces from handle to tip and external forces from tip to handle. Five concepts were designed that enable a parallel motion of which three were developed further in 10ùëöùëö scale prototypes. Preliminary results showed an increase in stiffness of a factor 2,7 compared to existing instruments. The real scale implementation study resulted in a 5ùëöùëö version of the mechanism that is capable of guiding the forces required to drive all the functionalities of a MIS instrument (steering, grasping). Conclusion: It can be concluded that a 5ùëöùëö steerable MIS instrument with a stiff tip is feasible. The mechanism contains a cardan mechanism and axially moving rods that slide over a special constructed surface. The scaled prototype provided at least 2,7 times higher stiffness compared to existing instruments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Chandra Mouli, G.R. (mentor); Izadkhast, S. (mentor)","2017","As the state of the environment deteriorates due to the large energy consumption in the world, the importance of green technologies like photovoltaic (PV) generators and electric vehicles (EVs) increases. Both are making their appearance as common technologies in the modern life. However, separately these technologies can have bad influences on distribution networks. Fortunately, PV and EV have a natural synergy: when the PV energy is stored directly in the EV batteries, the currents to and from the grid can be kept within limits. To enable this synergy, the EVs should be charged during the peak hours of the sun and the EVs should be connected directly to the PV panels. This thesis presents different strategies of charging EVs at an office with PV arrays, in order to integrate large amounts of PV and EV without causing any grid violations. A general framework for the different strategies is developed, containing an aggregator, the EV charging stations and a grid monitoring system. Three different ways of mitigating grid violations when they would appear are defined, and each of these start charging either at maximum charging power or average charging power. The strategies make real-time choices based on the state of the EVs and the grid. In this way, the EVs will be fully charged upon departure (typical constant current/constant voltage mode charging for lithium-ion batteries included) while keeping the transformer power, the line currents and the node voltages within the limits. The first charging strategy shares the violation mitigation among all EVs: the charging power of all available EVs are adjusted in low extend in order to create more balance in the power flows. The second charging strategy makes use of location-dependent violation mitigation: only the EVs at the location with the most impact are adjusted. In this way, the violation will be mitigated as effective as possible, so by adjusting the least amount of aggregated charging power. The third charging strategy ranks the EVs based in their energy demand, remaining connection time and their location. Then the most flexible EVs are adjusted as much as they can in order to mitigate grid violations. In this case there is not a large fleet in which all EVs have to adjust in low extend, but there are a few EV that have to adjust in large extend. In this way, the least EVs are affected by the violation mitigation. The results show that charging at average charging power has many more benefits than charging at maximum charging power, especially in case of a lot of solar power generation. Besides, it is found that fair sharing of grid violation mitigation results in the least losses because of the flat current profiles they cause. Unfair sharing results in large current peaks, more losses and current violations besides the voltage violations. Adjusting less EVs in larger extend is more effective than adjusting many EVs in small extend, because it takes the EV parameters into account: in this way the least flexible EVs are spared and will not cause any problems at the end of the day.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","",""

(mentor); Bozzon, A. (mentor); Langedoen, K.G. (mentor)","2017","The advances of the information and communication technology (ICT) brought changes in the energy distribution domain, introducing the Smart Grid (SG). In SG, generators, distributors, and consumers communicate in a bidirectional way. SGs are envisaged to include micro-grids (MG) consisting of distributed control networks of consumers, prosumers, and the power grid. Two-way communication in MGs allows allocating the produced energy inside a community of consumers, to decentralize the energy flow. However, challenges arise regarding energy sharing, namely: (i) how to balance the demand and supply inside communities; (ii) are there policies that prioritize among the consumers while distributing the producers‚Äô excess of energy; and (iii) how to balance the economic benefit ‚Äìunder a policy‚Äì for everyone who participates. In this thesis, we propose energy allocation strategies (EAS) for MG communities consisting of households that use renewable sources of energy (RSEs). Our objective is to maximize the energy usage and the cost reduction, under certain priority policies. Through an in-depth analysis of energy and socioeconomic data of the community, we form groups of households that share similar characteristics, and we channelize the energy flow at will. We present seven, simple and optimized, EASs and several consumer priority policies (CPPs). Our EASs and CPPs are scalable and can meet the specific needs of an MG community. We evaluate our algorithms and techniques using real data, acquired from a community of 443 households over a year. We show that the groups of households that we prioritize cover their needs of energy, sometimes completely, in periods of high energy production. We compare on economic basis trading energy within the MG and requesting energy form the grid (classic way). The expenses for prioritized groups of consumers under our EASs are decreased, up to 50% in certain cases. Further, it is shown that even the non-prioritized consumers are benefited economically by allocating the excess of energy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); Oberdorf, J.E. (mentor)","2017","The goal of this project is to develop a concept for the next generation of Greentom products that is more sustainable than their current product line by applying Circular Economy. The result will be a child buggy, which is optimised to be produced, assembled, re-used, repaired, refurbished and recycled in Europe by Greentom. In other words: can Greentom develop a buggy that closes its own loops locally, and thus has a minimum impact on the environment? Developing a whole new buggy as graduation assignment was deemed not desirable. Thus the focus of this project is on the foldability, usability, safety, stability, strength, stiffness and sustainability of the buggy frame in relation to the whole buggy. In the analysis phase the company, the competitors, the target group, the material, the production, the regulations, the ergonomics and the sustainability aspects of the future buggy are analysed in order to create a guiding program of requirements for the frame. The vision to develop a buggy that ‚Äòenables the target group to happily use the product to transport their child‚Äô was created to ensure a result that is able to stand out in the market. Happiness requires the experience of a satisfactory current state whilst using the product and working to a desirable future state to occur. A good basic product for the child as well as the parent is required to create the satisfactory current state. A safe and sustainable product ensures the possibility to achieve the desirable future state. Ideas were generated based on this vision and requirements to develop a buggy-frame that is able to facilitate a safe and responsible transportation of children with a minimised environmental impact through no-nonsense, minimalistic design strong enough to survive intensive use. The most promising ideas were further developed into concepts from which the ‚ÄòHoneycomb concept‚Äô was chosen to be further developed. The idea of the ‚ÄòHoneycomb concept‚Äô is to create a shell based buggy that can be produced in three main injection moulded parts of the same recycled material, which is reinforced where needed by adding nature inspired structures. This concept was further developed resulting in the final concept of chapter 16, the Greentom Nova. The buggy is estimated to pass the stability, strength and safety standards of the EN 1888 norm, even though not all frame related strength tests can be proven with simulations. Based on the results it is estimated that a prototype will be able to pass the tests with some extra adaptions. Design for (dis)assembly strategies are applied to make the buggy easy to assemble, repair, refurbish and recycle. The buggy is also adapted to be as much Greentom compatible as possible. This means that this buggy concept uses the same front wheels as, for example, the current Greentom line to make part exchange possible. Finally a more organic shape style is proposed to communicate the sustainability of the buggy by creating a visual link with nature. Based on literature analysis, tests, calculations and simulations it is estimated that it should be possible for Greentom to create the next level sustainable buggy. However further developments are required to work out the Greentom Nova into a product that makes Greentom‚Äôs future customers happy.","Design; Sustainability; Buggy; Circular Economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Agile project management is a method to meet the ever-changing needs and requirements throughout a project. An agile approach requires small multi-disciplinary development teams, working iteratively and in close collaboration with the client. This project management approach is developed in the information technology (IT) industry in the 1990‚Äôs. Since then, agile gets more and more attention from different industries; the construction industry is no exception. More and more guidelines and tools appear in literature to manage projects in an agile manner. Yet, contractual guidelines suited for an agile approach in construction industry are currently missing. Ample research has been conducted on contracts for projects that use conventional project management, like the ‚Äòwaterfall approach‚Äô. But due to a different management style, agile project management may not be compatible with these existing construction contracts. This gap in knowledge resulted in the following research question. How to effectively enable agile project management through construction contracts? The scope of this research is the front-end development phase of construction projects between client ‚Äì engineer, consultant or architect (hereafter referred to as supplier).

(mentor)","2017","Augmented reality has been studied as a navigational aid in the maritime sector. Little research was found on its value for simulation-based training. From a broad perspective, the research examined the potential of augmented reality for training purposes. Specifically, we studied the feasibility of learning ship manoeuvring. A crossover study was made with 24 people performing a ship manoeuvre in three experimental conditions to compare depth perception in each. Participants were asked to keep a vessel stationary in rough weather conditions with only a visual stimulus for reference. The different stimuli were - a maritime simulator displaying a 3D object, a see-through head-mounted display showing a 3D object, and a 2D object. The difference in performance between the simulator and head-mounted display showing a 3D object was not found to be statistically significant. It was significantly worse in the condition with a 2D object in the head-mounted display. It can be concluded from the findings that depth cues were just as well perceived in the head-mounted display showing a 3D object compared to the monitor-based display of a ship simulator. The conclusion provides a basis for further research on a method to learn on-board ship manoeuvring set in augmented reality. It can form an alternative training method besides on-the-job training and the maritime simulator. Future work should evaluate the effectiveness of training in scenarios requiring visual stimuli in better detail. The value of new generation see-through head-mounted displays should be assessed in light of newer stereoscopic 3D display technology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-02-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Computer Science, Media and Knowledge Engineering Track","IN5000",""

(mentor); Turteltaub, S.R. (mentor)","2017","Many composite failure criteria suffer from serious flaws related to prediction accuracy and the number of tests required to apply them, as found for example during the World Wide Failure Exercises. In 2001, Jon Gosse of Boeing Phantom Works developed a new criterion for matrix failure. Initially known as Strain Invariant Failure Theory (SIFT), it was soon extended through collaboration with John Hart-Smith to also include fiber failure. During this process, it was also renamed to Onset Theory. Onset Theory predicts failure using micromechanically obtained strain invariants in the constituents of a composite. As a physics-based criterion, it is claimed to be applicable to all types of loading, boundary conditions, geometries, and layups. However, it has yet to see widespread application. In this thesis, a consistent approach to Onset Theory has been developed. This addresses and resolves the contradictions found in literature regarding the exact details of the application of Onset Theory. In addition to that, failure envelopes are generated for comparison with laminate test data. Previously, finite element models were required for each specimen and state of strain. In this thesis, the entire process has been automated for ease and speed of applicability. Using the consistent, automated approach, Onset Theory is shown to quite accurately predict failure in composite laminates under biaxial strains. This includes non-catastrophic matrix cracking preceding ultimate failure, without the necessity of performing a progressive failure analysis. Onset Theory also correctly captures trends in the difference between lamina and laminate failure. Most importantly, it only requires a single set of critical strain invariants (three in total), regardless of loading condition or stacking sequence. This means that extensive and expensive testing can be reduced significantly.","Composite failure; Onset Theory; Strain Invariant Failure Theory (SIFT); Consistent approach; Failure envelope generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-27","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","At present ship-helicopter qualification testing is an expensive process, both in terms of time consumed (months) and costs (> hundred-thousand euros). The Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) has developed a more effective means for qualification testing - reducing the costs up to 50% and cutting the time required. The key of this process is the so called ‚Äôcandidate flight envelope‚Äô (CFE), which is a preliminary polar graph that displays the ‚Äôcandidate‚Äô operational limits of the helicopter for the specific helicopter-ship combination. The candidate operational limits are derived using a combination of the ship‚Äôs airwake characteristics and the land-based helicopter margins. The airwake characteristics are described using flow variables cv, œá and œÜ, which are a derivative of the velocity vector and are determined using the wind tunnel (at present). The CFE is then validated using shortened sea-trials. The NLR has lots of experience with this methodology and is exploring the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to replace the wind tunnel. This research project assesses the fidelity of these simulated CFEs. For that purpose two different numerical solvers have been selected in consultation with the NLR. Deep Purple is a black box flow solver, which has been developed by the NLR, and HyperWorks is a commercial CFD package. Both numerical approaches are based on the RANS equations and use the SST k-œâ turbulence model. In Deep Purple two different models of the Royal Netherlands Navy Landing Platform Dock 2 (LPD-2), differing in geometrical complexity have been assessed. Of the most complex geometry two different meshes have been considered. In HyperWorks two different types of (in)flow conditions are applied to the simplified ship model. This means that in total five different simulations have been performed. Optional ‚Äôtemporal‚Äô and spatial averaging is applied to obtain flow variables cv, œá and œÜ at various measurement stations located in the flight path of the helicopter. It is shown that the flow characteristics are generally comparable to PIV measurements and show good resemblance to other studies regarding the ship‚Äôs airwake. Compared to PIV it is shown that at lower heights above the flight deck, the HyperWorks simulations show better results than the Deep Purple simulations. When validating the flow variables with the wind tunnel, it is concluded that geometrical modeling, spatial averaging and the flow conditions do not show significant differences. Temporal averaging shows better results for Deep Purple but lacks any difference in HyperWorks due to the combination of the averaging scheme and the setup of the governing equations. A thorough uncertainty analysis is required to achieve the goal of safely using a conservative simulated CFE in a real-world environment, without requiring a wind tunnel campaign. For that purpose the ratio of the simulated flow variables to the wind tunnel flow variables, on different locations in the flight path, is defined as the error ratio. Three different definitions of the error ratio distribution, known as ‚Äômethods‚Äô, are devised. To understand the influence of the error propagation during the envelope generation, the first and third quartile of the error ratio distribution are extrapolated to the CFE using these three methods. Since the generation of the CFE is a non-linear process these quartiles are extrapolated using a minimization and maximization strategy. The envelope‚Äôs inner contour is optimized in Matlab by deflecting the flow variables while adhering to an upper and lower bound specified by these quartiles. When validating the simulated CFEs with wind tunnel based CFEs, it is concluded that the most practical and easy to use method is the best method and leads to a conservative envelope in practice. This method may lead to numerical methods being the backbone of CFE generation, increasing cost-effectiveness at a minimum time required.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-02-24","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Kistemaker, S. (mentor); van Weelderen, W. (mentor)","2017","PeerPost: a peer-to-peer PostNL delivery service This graduation project, executed for PostNL, started with the need for a future proof PostNL location. The aim was to give an advice and vision on what such a location should entail. Furthermore, the elements needed to make it function were to be designed. The design brief raised the question what the future of retail in itself would look like and how postal services would fit into that vision. The final design proposal, a peer-to-peer delivery service, might sound like it lies a bit further from the initial brief. In-depth user research and a critical view on the future of both post and retail, however, showed that PeerPost is one of the most fruitful ways to go. A trend analysis pointed out that online sales are increasing rapidly. This leads to a decrease in the amount of physical stores and their surface area. A current struggle of the PostNL retail locations is the large volume of parcels. This leads to the need of more and more retail locations, while the cities are slowly getting saturated with these PostNL points. A solution to this problem would be to open PostNL locations outside of the cities‚Äô centres. Here, more and cheaper space is available. PeerPost forms the bridge between these new locations and the customer. PeerPost is a peer-to-peer delivery service. It connects anyone who would like to deliver shipments by bike to anyone who wants to send or receive something. PeerPost makes postal services available anywhere, anytime. You can either send goods to someone directly or let the courier bring it to a PostNL location. Besides, the courier is allowed to pick up your parcels at a PostNL location and deliver it to you when and where it suits you best. PeerPost consists of three main elements: an application, a striking PeerPost bag and a fitting lay-out of the retail location. PeerPost Application The PeerPost app forms the backbone of the service. It was designed in line with PostNL‚Äôs visual style. This ensures that the familiarity and reliabilty of PostNL is preserved in this new initiative. The application consists of both a courier‚Äôs and a customer‚Äôs portal. It allows couriers to, amongst other things, sign up, find tasks and get directions. The customer can register a parcel, find a courier, and track his shipment. The app takes care of payments as well. PeerPost Rollerbag Transporting the shipments needed to be both comfortable and safe. Besides, the trips take place outside, bearing the Dutch weather conditions. A sturdy bag was designed to fulfill. Furthermore, to avoid scammers, the PeerKoeriers needed to stand out. Therefore, the bag has a prominent logo and uses the striking PostNL orange. Lastly, PeerPost stimulates people to pack their shipments compactly. The three coloured blocks on the back of the bag function as a measuring tool. By placing a parcel next to them, you can determine whether it is considered an S, M, or L shipment. The top of the bag can be rolled down, to adjust the size of the bag to its contents. Advice PostNL Retail Location By making use of the tools PostNL is already developing, a PeerPost-proof retail location can be realized quickly. The concept consists of three modular blocks: the lockers, an interface module and a dropbox. The lockers work in the same way as the, already operational, PostNL Parcel Locker does: anyone can send or receive parcels through them. The courier has to scan his personal PeerPost ID Tag at the interface module in order to open a locker. This makes that the parcel is registered to his account. The dropbox module is used to hand in parcels that will go into the sorting process.

(mentor); Hermans, M.J.M. (mentor); Hu, B. (mentor); Veljkovic, M. (mentor)","2017","Research shows that the fatigue strength of a Very High Strength Steel (VHSS) can be significantly negatively effected by welds in a structure. The fatigue lifetime may be extended after cracking occurs by means of fatigue crack repair. A better insight by means of Finite ElementModelling (FEM) can help in understanding the effects of a repair procedure in awelded connectionwhich can results in the optimisation of the repairing process. The FEM model needs to be verified with experiment but measurement of residual stresses in a specimen requires either expensive or highly specialised equipment. Therefore, a more simple approach for model verification could aid in the accessibility of modelling of welding. The aim of this thesis is to establish a finite element model for a repair weld in a welded connection, and investigate to what extent the model can be verified by welding distortion. A weld repair experiment, consisting of an initial weld, segment removal and repair welding, is performed to retrieve experiment data to be used as verification and input for the FEM model. First the modelling of the initial weld is described, consisting of a thermal analysis and subsequent thermomechanical analysis. Regarding the thermal analysis, a mesh sensitivity analysis is performed as well as 2Dmodel results are compared with 3D results. The thermal analysis is performed by Goldak heat distribution and after calibration of the heat input, show a good agreement with temperature data retrieved from experiment. Regarding the thermo-mechanical analysis, an Abaqus subroutine was established to retrieve information of the weld pool during the thermal analysis. This information is used in a subroutine during the thermo-mechanical analysis to assign differentmaterial behaviour to different elements of the weld, based on thermal history. In the thermo-mechanical model distortion results show a good agreement with experiment distortion results. As a result of unexpected movement during clamping of the experiment, calibration was required of the mechanical boundary conditions in the model to find matching results. Modelling of the weld segment removal was performed, and similar trends of distortion between experiment and model results were found. However, further measurement of residual stresses is required to further evaluate the correlation between residual stress and distortion. Results of the thesis show that for a defect or faulty weld section, the measurement of the residual stresses is of great importance. Modelling of the full weld repair procedure proved to be beyond the scope of this thesis, since Finite Element work was more time consuming than initially anticipated.","Arc Welding; Residual Stress; Finite Element Method; Abaqus; Weld Distortion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Goos, T.G. (mentor)","2017","Introduction: Preterm neonates suffer frequent thermal alterations that result in increased morbidity and mortality rates. Thermal support is used to provide stability until thermal maturation is reached. The first manifestation of thermal control is peripheral vasoconstriction, estimated as the difference between central and peripheral temperatures (ŒîT). However, very little is known regarding the point in time at which this maturation occurs and what values of ŒîT characterize stability. Aim: To study the maturation of thermal control and temperature trends over time. To assess the possibility of improving the temperature settings of the neonatal incubators to minimize hypothermia and hyperthermia. To evaluate the potential of using ŒîT as an indicator of stability or marker for sepsis. Methods: Very premature neonates (< 32 weeks of gestational age) admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Erasmus Medical Center were included in the study. Peripheral and central body temperatures were recorded continuously for a maximum of 10 days were included. The temperature patterns were visually analyzed for possible trends over time. The percentage of time in which the neonates had hypothermia and hyperthermia was evaluated. The relation between adjustments in the incubator set temperature and the effects in the neonatal temperatures before and after the change were analyzed. Results: Fifteen neonates were included in the pilot study. All the neonates presented stable body temperatures for at least 72.8% of the time. No maturation of thermal control could be observed over time. ŒîT was observed to increase with gestational age. Extreme premature neonates kept a consistent ŒîT < 2¬∞C, with slightly altered values in cases with sepsis (20% of the neonates). Temperatures of the neonates were mostly outside the stable range before an adjustment in the set temperature was made. Conclusions: ŒîT might have the potential to help distinguishing between periods of stability, episodes of sepsis or hyperthermia. Preventive actions regarding adjustments of incubator set temperature could help minimizing episodes of hypothermia and hyperthermia.","Preterm; Thermal Alterations; Nursing Environment; Thermal Control; Sepsis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Rots, J.G. (mentor); van Eck, S.R.G. (mentor)","2017","The near future is challenging: depletion of non-renewable energy depletion, electricity shortage and sustainability give the need of developing renewable energy technology. The solar updraft tower power generation technology using solar and wind generates a reasonable amount of electricity with zero carbon footprint during operation. The working principle is rather simple: the heated air underneath a large transparent roof (air collector) is sucked into a central vertical chimney; the driven wind generates electricity by wind turbines. The solar updraft towers are mainly suitable for high power output, which also requires a large scale structure. The solar updraft tower in this research project is a 1000m reinforced concrete tall tower stiffened by ten stiffening rings every 100m. The wind load is the most hazardous action for ultra-high ultra-thin SUT shells. The constitutive behavior of the reinforced concrete structure will give nonlinear responses under a certain wind loading level, which requires a careful study. Additionally, the SUT structural design under large wind load treated in a linear elastic stage could be costly. The dimensions of the reinforcement calculated by linear-elastic analysis can be improved by nonlinear analysis. It gives a real structural behavior including the stress redistribution caused by concrete cracking, crushing and reinforcement yielding. Nonlinear analysis can achieve a more economic design while maintaining sufficient safety. This main thesis objective is to perform a physical nonlinear analysis of the SUT under static wind action to acquire realistic structural behavior and conduct a further optimization. A finite element model is built and a linear analysis is done for the model verification. Then a detailed linear model is built to determine the necessity of detailing the stiffening rings. The analysis shows that by detailed modeling the stiffening rings provide a higher stiffness compared to modeling the simplified way, hence improving the overall structural behavior of the Solar Updraft Tower. A discussion about the feasibility of the chosen nonlinear material models has been done. The total strain crack rotating model is chosen whose crack is rotating continuously with the direction of principal stress. The simple working principle gives the model a robust and stable behavior. For concrete tensile behavior, a linear ultimate strain based stress-strain relation is used including the tension stiffening effect. A nonlinear stress-strain behavior is adopted for concrete in compression, considering effects of lateral crack and lateral confinement. For the reinforcement steel, elastoplastic material modeling is used with strain hardening. Few models according to the original design of Kr√§tzig & Partner have been built. The shell walls have a one layer reinforcement grid located at the mid-surface of the shell walls with minimum reinforcement ratio both in the meridional and the circumferential directions. The difference between these models is the way of modeling the stiffening rings: one is modeled by 3D beam elements with 1% reinforcement ratio modeled in the longitudinal direction, and the other is modeled by curved shell elements with 1% reinforcement ratio modeled both in the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction. Both models experienced a large ovalization failure mechanism at the upper cone at the serviceability limit state. This is caused by 1) the low reinforcement ratio which provides a low stiffness to the stiffening rings; 2) The eccentricity of the stiffening rings which generates a large bending moment, thus weakening the ring-wall connections. The model with beam elements showed weaker structural response than the model with curved shell elements because the beam elements do not take the transverse stiffness into consideration. The model using curved shell elements is adopted for further nonlinear analysis. Models with increasing reinforcement ratio in two directions up to 3% on the stiffening rings are built to improve the structural behavior. The stiffness of the Solar Updraft Tower has improved, which gives less ovalization deformation. However, all models experienced the ovalization failure mechanism at a certain loading stage. Unfortunately, the concrete crushing and reinforcement yielding still occur, even with the maximum reinforcement ratio on the stiffening rings. It is because the large bending crack at the ring-wall connection caused by the eccentricity of the stiffening rings decreases the contribution of the stiffening ring to the overall structural behavior. Several models are built using the same reinforcement ratio in two directions on the stiffening rings with increasing tension stiffening effect. The nonlinear result shows that the influence of tension stiffening rings is high at a low loading level and is decreasing at a higher loading level. One possibility of removing the bending failure at the ring-wall connection is to move the mass center of the cross-section of the stiffening rings to the mid-surface of the shell walls. Two re-centered models with increasing reinforcement ratio are built. With 1% reinforcement ratio, the model with re-centered stiffening ring gives a similar structural response as the original design model with a reinforcement ratio of 2%. The re-centered model with 2% reinforcement ratio gives an almost linear behavior of the structure without ovalization failure mechanism at the upper cone. No cracking is found both at the ring-wall connection and the concrete shell wall, no concrete crushing occurs and also no reinforcement is yielding. A maximum deflection around 1m meets the requirement of the maximum allowable displacement in the serviceability limit state. However, a large crack width of 1.1mm is found in the stiffening rings which should be further improved by modeling the structure using two layer reinforcement or by prestressing. Last but not least, the effect of moving the stiffening rings inside the airflow on the power output should be further investigated. But re-centering geometry gives a triple time of improvement on the structural behavior, and eventually saved a high amount of material use.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Our linear consumption and production patterns are depleting our planet‚Äôs resources, polluting our environment and changing our climate. As a proposed solution to this problem, a circular economic model is designed to reduce the flow of non-renewable energy and resources in the ever growing global markets. This MSc. thesis explores the possibilities of applying the principles of this economic model to a growing market in consumer electronics. In a case study focussing on a robot vacuum cleaner, the objective of this thesis is to ‚Äúdesign the ultimate updatable robot vacuum cleaner in a case study, aimed at finding different ways to make products last in the transition towards a circular economy.‚Äù Parallel to the rapid development of the technology in robot vacuum cleaners, user expectations of the product regarding autonomy and high cleaning performance are becoming increasingly demanding. This causes products to become functionally obsolete sooner than desired. In combination with product failure, the functional irrelevance poses a problem for the robot‚Äôs initial lifetime. The proposed solution is the Pioneer, a product-service system that sets you up for lasting robot vacuum cleaner performance, driven by proactive maintenance, updates and repairs. Lasting performance extends the user‚Äòs freedom and provides peace of mind. With the Pioneer you can trust that your robot vacuum cleaner is essentially ‚ÄòForever Better‚Äô, a direct extension of Miele‚Äôs design philosophy. Based on a lease-to-own business model, the Pioneer is available to users by subscription and - after minimally 2 years - purchase. During the lease period the user‚Äôs Pioneer proactively provides them with maintenance, updates and repairs. The device guides users through the steps they need to take, providing the necessary tool, module(s) and instructions to maintain, update or repair their device in a matter of minutes. The product design is built up out of a core and multiple modules; a navigation-, brush-, fan -, battery - and dustbin module. Updated modules get returned to Miele and can enter a secondary product lifecycle. As a result the robot‚Äôs initial lifecycle is extended and a secondary lifecycle is introduced; increasing the potential of the material and energy. Among robot vacuum cleaner users this concept is received with mixed, but mostly positive reactions. In interviews it became apparent that some current robot vacuum cleaner users are hesitant to switch to a lease-to-ownership model, implying a preference for a hybrid business model (where the Pioneer and its updates are both sold separately or in bundles). It is recommended to further investigate the users acceptance among people considering buying robot vacuum cleaners. Although it is expected that this concept contributes positively to reduce flow of non-renewable energy and resources, results can allow more definitive conclusions on the Pioneer‚Äôs sustainability and business viability.","Circular product design; Robot vacuum cleaner; Design for updatability; Product lifetime extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master programme Integrated Product Design","",""

Secondly an extension to variable amplitude loading is proposed based on a modified rainflow counting scheme. Effective load cycles are defined using the global energy release rate. Qualitatively the results are similar to experimental data, however, a quantitative comparison shows significant differences. Finally, a method is proposed to reduce computational effort by defining a load range in which linear elastic fracture mechanics is applicable. In this region, the crack growth can be predicted without solving the complete system of equations thereby reducing the computational costs. Both material non-linearities and non-linearities due to contact limit the load range in which reduction is possible. Especially the amount of contact is found to be critical for the success of the reduction strategy.","Fatigue; Load sequence effects; Fracture Mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Solid en Fluid Mechanics","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The design of the ordinary bicycle has barely changed since the end of the 19th century. Until then it evolved to a well ridable machine with no need for further drastic modifications. However, around 2011 it was shown that, just like an ordinary bicycle, strange appearing designs could also be stable. One of these designs was a bicycle that steers with the rear wheel instead of the conventional front wheel steering. This was contrary to the popular believe that such a bicycle is inherently unstable. Although it was seen that such a bicycle could be stable, both from a theoretical as well as an experimental point of view, it was not yet revealed why and how this occurs. Now, a thorough study on the stability of rear wheel steered bicycles is conducted to fill up this knowledge gap. The history of research on rear wheel steered bicycles varying from simple trial-and-error studies, to theoretical researches based on models, is researched and documented. This makes clear where the knowledge on the subject can still be increased and which methods could be used to do that. Subsequently, these deficiencies in the knowledge on rear wheel steering for bicycles are investigated. With the Whipple bicycle model, a quantitative kinematic steer-side definition is found and rear wheel steering is dynamically compared to front wheel steering on bicycles. In this process differences and similarities between the lateral dynamics of different vehicles like bicycles, cars or unicycles are mentioned. Finally, the process of modeling, designing, constructing and validating a self-stable rear wheel steered bicycle is revealed.","bicycle; bike; rear; steer; kinematics; dynamics; lateral; stability; self-stable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","In oil supply chains, crude oil needs to be transported from oil fields to refineries, and refined products need to be transported from refineries to regional depots. On land, pipelines are the preferred mode for long-distance oil transportation, because they are safe, efficient, silent, and cheap compared to other modes of transport. Pipelines are often part of large networks, in which they connect multiple supply and demand locations. Multi-product pipelines transport batches of different products, such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Pipeline networks should be operated such that temporal and spatial differences between supply and demand are balanced, operational limitations are satisfied, and costs are minimized. This is a rather complicated task, due to the size and complexity of pipeline networks, limited capacities of tanks and pipelines, and the existence of transportation times of several days. Because batches are pushed through pipelines, transportation times of current batches depend on injections of future batches, which is a distinctive feature of the pipeline scheduling problem. The minimization of operational cost is mainly related to transmix volumes, i.e. contaminated volumes that emerge between consecutive batches, and pumping energy. In this thesis, we propose a novel pipeline scheduling method for solving the pipeline scheduling problem. It consists of a planning and a scheduling phase that are coupled in a hierarchical decomposition scheme. In the planning phase, global day-to-day transportation volumes are determined for each pipeline. In the scheduling phase, we use the planning output to generate complete schedules. Both phases contain a discrete-time Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The MILP planning problem is solved with truncated branch and bound. The MILP scheduling problem is further decomposed using a rolling-horizon approach; the resulting subproblems are solved with branch and bound. The pipeline scheduling method has been successfully tested on two case studies involving up to 4 products, 8 pipelines, 8 tank farms, 2 supply locations, and 5 demand locations. The proposed method is flexible in terms of network configurations, intermediate supply and demand requirements, and cost structures. Complete schedules for 30-day horizons are obtained within 3 to 4 minutes of computation time. With respect to current industry practice, the novel pipeline scheduling method can greatly reduce the time required to generate schedules. Compared to current spreadsheet approaches, the proposed method is generic and less error-prone. Moreover, the obtained schedules are significantly better in terms of transmix and pumping costs.","Pipeline scheduling; Batch Scheduling; Multi-product; Refined oil; Pipeline network; Hierarchical decomposition; Rolling horizon; Discrete-time representation; Mixed Integer Linear Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The coastal protection system of the Dutch low-lying hinterland is under increasing pressure due to growing population and high economic value combined with climate change and a rising sea level. Supplying sand to dunes, beach and shoreface by means of nourishments is a widely applied technique to increase coastal safety. Climate change and a rising sea level lead to higher water levels and higher and longer waves at the North Sea. These increased loads cause a heavier impact on the Dutch coast and therefore, wave boundary conditions have been revised by the Dutch Government. After a reassessment of the coastal protection system in 2003, several parts of the Dutch coast did not comply with the safety standards and were appointed 'Weak Links'. The Hondsbossche and Pettemer sea defence was one of the weak links. The Hondsbossche Dunes nourishment provided the desired solution to improve coastal safety and at the same time maintain, and where possible, improve environmental quality. The design of the nourishment is of a magnitude that is unprecedented. It covers a stretch of approximately twelve kilometres of coast. In contrast to traditional nourishments that typically consist of about 1-2 million m3 of sand, the Hondsbossche Dunes nourishment contains a volume of 35.6 million m3 of sand. The implementation of nourishments modifies the topography of the bed and impacts the nearshore coastal regime. After the nourishment is constructed, the cross-shore profile evolves towards an equilibrium shape, and the shoreline planform adjusts via alongshore spreading. As a result, increased erosion rates are often observed in the first period after completion of nourishments. To improve the design of future nourishments, it is essential to understand and quantify the processes that govern the initial morphological evolution of recently completed nourishment projects. Twelve months after completion of the nourishment, sand losses at the Hondsbossche Dunes nourishment appeared to be large. This study focuses on understanding the processes that govern these large initial volume losses. Bathymetric data obtained from monthly monitoring surveys during and after construction, combined with wave forcing data are used to analyse morphological evolution and hydrodynamic forcing. Furthermore, a process-based cross-shore sediment transport model is applied to assess the relative contribution of several hydro- and morphodynamic factors on the initial morphological development of the nourishment in more detail. The results show that after twelve months 2.5% of the initially nourished sediment volume is lost from the project area. The high losses are mainly due to energetic wave forcing in the first twelve months after construction, with an average net northward transport potential that is 2.5 times higher compared to the long term yearly average. Morphological response is an event-driven process, such that large morphological changes coincide with months with energetic waves. About 60-80% of the volume changes occur over a period of only three months, during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Compared to long term natural variation in wave forcing, relatively more and higher waves approach from South-Western direction during the first year after construction. This results in severe erosion at the southern shoulder of the nourishment and considerable accretion at the northern transition zone with the adjacent coastline. The adaptation of steep cross-shore profiles on similar timescales as the volume changes, suggests a relation between steep slopes and volume losses. However, the interaction with other morphological parameters (e.g. alongshore gradients and variations in grain size) and the presence of subtidal bars prevent the establishment of a direct relation. These insights can provide guidance for other large-scale sandy strategies. The findings indicate that wave forcing dominates the initial morphological response of a recently completed mega nourishment. The stochastic character of temporal wave forcing implies that a considerable uncertainty bandwidth is introduced in the design of nourishments. The effect of other parameters, such as profile shape and sediment size, is less pronounced in morphological development. Also these parameters are more controllable, and as a result they introduce relatively less uncertainty in the prediction of initial sediment losses at recently completed nourishments.","mega nourishment; Hondsbossche Zeewering; Petten; initial development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-23","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.71000, 4.67000"

The challenge in this filtering problem lies in the limited and low-quality sensor measurements combined with the high-dynamic player motion consisting of rapid orientation changes and sensed impacts in every step. Being able to overcome these challenges paves the way for injury prevention, saving sports clubs, teams and players a lot of misery. To estimate player motion from the measurements by the tracking device, four sensor fusion algorithms are developed. For estimating rotational motion, the quaternion-based Unscented Kalman filter as described by Kraft and the Madgwick filter are devised. For estimating translational motion, a traditional linear Kalman filter and an Unscented Kalman filter are designed. These filters are combined to solve the sensor fusion problem. On simulated data, it is shown that the Madgwick filter outperforms Kraft‚Äôs quaternion-based unscented Kalman filter in both estimation accuracy and computational load. In estimating translational motion, the simulations show that the UKF and the linear Kalman filter achieve similar estimation accuracy. Subsequently the filters are tested on real data in different experiments. It is shown that, due to the on-chip filtering operation of the GPS sensor, position estimates do not benefit from sensor fusion. Furthermore, it is shown that the filters in their current state are unable to accurately estimate player accelerations from the sensors in the JOHAN Sports tracking device.","Motion tracking; IMU; GPS; GNSS; magnetometer; inertial navigation; sensor fusion; Unscented Kalman filter; Madgwick filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Systems & Control","SCP4530-30",""

Previous research has shown that different motion cueing error types can be distinguished, at least some of which are rated differently by humans for equal error magnitude. Optimizing a motion simulation for both error magnitude and error type requires a method to objectively identify the presence of different motion cueing error types from simulation input and output traces. This paper presents a wavelet-based motion cueing error detection algorithm that exploits the time and frequency characteristics of these error types. A simulator experiment is presented through which parameters of the algorithm are determined. It is shown that motion cueing errors can be detected by the algorithm without prior knowledge of the MCA used. The need for the algorithm is demonstrated by showing that motion cueing error types can be divided in clusters of severity. Additionally, it is shown that in curve driving, given a reference of unity gain, the lateral specific force can be scaled down to 70% and up to at least 130% before subjects indicate motion to be too weak or too strong. A required input and output coherence of 0.7 is found for simulator input and output to be considered coherent. The motion cueing error detection algorithm can be used to improve motion cueing algorithms in the future.","Motion simulation; motion cueing; motion perception; error detection; algorithm; wavelets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2017","Erosion is a phenomenon present in several industrial processes. In dredging, the jetting of sand in drag heads erodes the sand bed. In construction of offshore infrastructure such as wind turbines, oil and gas production units, marine pipelines, erosion of material near the foundations can put the stability of structures at stake. Furthermore, rivers or even tsunamis are some of the natural phenomena that can be the cause of erosion. C. van Rhee, 2007 and Bisschop et al., 2015, distinguished two regimes for the erosion of sand dependent on the fluid velocity. On one hand, for low flow velocities, 0.5-1m/s, the erosion process is dependent on the size and the density of the sand grains. On the other, for flow velocities >1.5 m/s, the upper layers of sand are sheared. Densely packed sand has a dilatant behaviour to shearing (see image). This dilatant behaviour leads to a drop of pressure in the interior of the sand-bed, creating a hydraulic gradient and forcing water to flow towards the interior of the sand-bed to fill the voids. The hydraulic gradient caused by the drop in pressure acts against the eroding forces adding resistance to the erosion process. This regime is defined as hindered erosion. The improvements in computing power have led to a spread in the use of numerical modelling for industrial purposes. The aim of this thesis is to develop a numerical solver able to model the behaviour of sand-water mixtures with an emphasis on the erosive process. The numerical model was developed in C++ using the Foam-extend 3.2 framework. The sand is modelled using 2 different approaches. It is modelled as a continuum when in suspension and, through the morphological updating routine when settled in a sand-bed. The fluid motion is modelled by a transient incompressible fluid solver (P.I.S.O) using a collocated arrangement of the unknowns. The momentum exchange between suspended sand grains and the fluid is approached by the Boussinesq approximation of the density. The transport of suspended sand is modelled by an advection-diffusion relation, including the hindered settlement effect. The turbulence model is a standard k-Œµ model. The erosion process is here modelled using the pick-up flux approach (van Rijn, 1984), with a modified stability criterion (Œ∏_cr). X. Lui, 2008 and N. Jacobsen, 2011, corrected the stability criterion calculated from the sand grain properties (Œ∏_(cr,0)) to include the slope effect (Œ∏_slope). For this work, and following the formulation proposed by van Rhee, 2007, the stability criterion will be corrected to include the resistance due to the dilatant behaviour presented previously in this abstract (Œ∏_vR). Œ∏_cr=Œ∏_(cr,0) (Œ∏_slope+Œ∏_vR ) The solver developed was used in two test cases. First, a settling test, with an initial concentration of sand of c=0.3. For this model, the solver shows a good behavior modeling the settling of sediment, nevertheless, the settling velocity is slightly higher than the one seen in the test. In the high speed erosion test, the velocity above the bed varies from 0-6 m/s. The fitting parameter of this model is the bed roughness; which for this test is 1.05 cm. The bed roughness (ks) was fitted to have the same erosion time. The calculated sand-bed height has values similar to the experimental results. The conservation of sediment presents satisfactory results as the error is lower than 1%, for the settling and the erosion test case. The automatic mesh motion presents certain limitations in this specific application. In the settling case an important shrinking of the mesh will lead to instabilities in the calculations of other fields. In the erosion test, the upper row of cells is greatly deformed sacrificing accuracy near the upper boundary. The mesh deformation should be explored more in depth in further studies.","Automated mesh motion; Computation Fluid Dynamics; OpenFOAM; Erosion; Settling; Sedimentation; C++; Boundary layer; Finite Volume Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Gielen, M.A. (mentor)","2017","This report is an account of the graduation project executed by Thomas Latcham for the Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis (WKZ) in Utrecht, concluding his master degree in Design for Interaction at the Delft University of Technology. The goal of the project was to design a new garment for the pediatric patients in the hospital to wear when undergoing surgery by involving these patients throughout the design process. The initial design goal was to design a new garment that was comfortable, fashionable and privacy-respecting, while remaining functionally operable for the hospital staff, in occurrence with all the stakeholders demands and wishes. Internal and external analyses were done to identify the trends in the domain of healthcare, the legal aspects relating to the matter, the current garments and the competitors and alternatives, and the strengths and weaknesses of the WKZ. These analyses showed that designing a new product for the field was indeed viable. A stakeholder analysis within the hospital showed the complexity of the domain and confirmed two user groups: the patients: wearing the garments, and the staff: confronted with the garments. In observations and interviews, the staff‚Äôs functional requirements were pinpointed. In a first generative session with children, an elaborate patient journey and a clear problem statement regarding the current garments were formulated. Furthermore, most importantly, the patients‚Äô emotional needs were identified, resulting in a more specific design goal: design an outfit that gives the patients a sense of control, ownership, safety and assurance, while meeting the staff‚Äôs functional requirements. In a second round of generative sessions, children in and outside of the hospital were asked to make garments in 2D and 3D to meet this new design goal. The output of this session served as input for the first sketches. These sketches were combined and clustered resulting in three concepts, which were evaluated by the patients in a third generative session. The three concepts were attempts to answer the emotional needs of the patients, and they were combined to form a new concept after the third session. There was however no physical design of a garment yet to underline the concepts. Therefore, the staff was involved in a series of feedback sessions, in which they were shown early prototypes and ideas for garments and asked to provide feedback. This resulted in a design matching the staff‚Äôs functional requirements as well as the combined concept, that answered the patients‚Äô emotional needs. In a fourth round of generative sessions, the combined concept and an early prototype of the physical design were evaluated by the patients. The outcomes of this round of sessions provided input for the modification and detailing of the concept as a whole, resulting in the final design. This final design was user tested in a fifth round of user involvement, in which the final design was evaluated on the patients‚Äô emotional needs as well as the staff‚Äôs functional requirements. In a final, sixth session, all identified stakeholders were invited to a presentation of the new design in the WKZ. The outcomes of the fifth and sixth sessions were used to evaluate the final design and the co-design process and to formulate recommendations for the final design, towards implementation in the future.","Co-Design; Participatory Design; Children; Hospital; Clothing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design Conceptualization and Communication","",""

Additionally, we support a variety of controls, such as a non-linear depth mapping, a steering mechanism for the diffusion (e.g., directionality, emphasis, or reduction of the influence of image cues), and besides absolute, we also support relative, depth indications.

(mentor)","2017","Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is a course designed for unlimited participation and can be accessed by anyone through the Web. As a promising education form, it has attracted lots of attentions from institutions, learners and employers. However, the effectiveness and fairness of MOOC have been encroaching by academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty is defined as using dishonest means to gain an undeserved reward or to get rid of an embarrassing situation in relation to an academic exercise. It is a widespread occurrence in different levels of education and various education forms. In this thesis, we focus on a cheating strategy, Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online (CAMEO), in MOOCs. The strategy involves learners who use fake accounts for harvesting solutions that they later submit in different accounts. On the basis of user logs, we identify potential CAMEO users in 10 MOOCs provided by Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) on edX with three different detection methods. Besides, we analyze the characteristics of the detected users. Our results reveal that among the 8171 certificates issued in the 10 MOOCs, an estimated 2% of the certificates are earned by CAMEO users. We find that the CAMEO users are more likely to cheat at the midterm of a MOOC than the other periods of the course. The research makes contributions to understanding the popularity of cheating especially CAMEO in MOOCs and getting the knowledge of cheaters‚Äô behaviors preferences in MOOCs. With the knowledge, at the end of the thesis, targeting at CAMEO, we purpose preventions to MOOC platforms and instructors to defend the effectiveness of MOOCs and the value of MOOC certificates.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

Both crack propagation rate and direction are investigated. Fatigue tests are performed with a constant cyclic load and single edge notch specimens. Ten unique types of specimens were tested by combining five different build orientation (0¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞, 60¬∞ and 90¬∞) with two different heat treatments (Stress relieved and Hot Isostatic Pressing). In the end, similar crack propagation rates were measured for all specimens. Although, small differences were seen in the microstructure and DIC analysis, they did not seem to change the crack propagation rate. This observation led to the conclusion that the crack propagation rate is not influenced by a change in build orientation or a change in heat treatment. On the other hand, the measured crack paths showed some differences. Small crack deflections were found for 30¬∞ - SR and 45¬∞ & 60¬∞ - HIP, while all other specimens had cracks propagating in a direction normal to the applied stress. As only off-axis specimens showed repetitive crack deflections, it can be concluded that the anisotropic microstructure is causing this behaviour. However, no conclusive explanation could be given based on the data gathered in this experiment. It is expected that different mechanisms caused the crack deviations as it happened in both heat treatments but for different orientations. Further research in this specific field in needed to explain the measured behaviour.","Fatigue; Damage Tolerance; Ti-6Al-4V; SLM; Additive Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structures","",""

(mentor)","2017","During Abandonment and Recovery (A&R) operations, steel wire ropes (figure 1) can experience torsional deformation. This deformation is a result of the helical configuration and the tension gradient in the rope due to its self-weight. The latter is very high when the ropes are used in deep water operations. Since the static component of the torque is constant over the length of the rope, it unlays in the direction of the greater tension while winding up in the direction of the lesser tension. The torsional energy in a steel wire rope can lead to instability of the straight shape of the rope. Tension and bending stiffness of the rope will play the most important role in the process. Instability of a wire rope can lead to hockling and loop formation which, in turn, may translate into irreversible damage to the rope, delaying the A&R operation. Currently, a very low value for the bending stiffness is used to predict these failure mechanisms, leading to conservative values for the allowable tension and torsional deformation. This reduces the time window in which operations involving steel wire ropes will be allowed. To improve the understanding of wire rope instability, research into the state-dependent bending stiffness of steel wire ropes has to be performed. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to numerically model the state-dependent bending stiffness of steel wire ropes used for A&R operations. Most analytical models describe the bending stiffness to be dependent on tension and curvature of the wire rope. This bending behaviour of steel wire ropes is found to be dominated by friction between the wires. In theory, large differences are found between the theoretical minimum and maximum value for the bending stiffness. Assumptions made in these models could cause the outcome to be uncertain and could affect the large difference between these theoretical limits. Analytically generated results for simple strands and spiral ropes match those experimentally found quite well for a limited curvature range. Stranded steel wire ropes used in A&R operations (figure 1) are difficult to model analytically due to their complex configuration. Therefore, numerical modelling has to be used to describe the bending behaviour. In this thesis, a numerical model which can be used to generate the state-dependent bending stiffness of arbitrary steel wire rope configurations has been developed. The bending stiffness due to friction has been numerically modelled using the finite element programme MSC Marc. A sensitivity study has been performed to test the boundary conditions and settings of the numerical model. A practical implementation of the obtained results is carried out to develop insight into the variation of the bending stiffness along a wire rope length. A subroutine is written to implement the obtained bending stiffness into a model consisting of several beam elements which can be used to simulate steel wire ropes during, for example, A&R operations. The results for simple strands from the new numerical model match the analytically generated ones quite well. The results of larger rope configurations show less resemblance. Compared to the analytical results, the numerically generated results show a less extreme difference between minimum and maximum bending stiffness. This difference is influenced by the level of detail of the mesh. It seems likely ‚Äì but cannot be confirmed with the available data ‚Äì that the maximum bending stiffness for simple strands will match the theoretical ones if the element size will be considered infinitesimal. It is concluded that the developed modelling method generates valid results for arbitrary wire rope configurations as long as the level of detail of the mesh is sufficiently high and the correct model length is taken into account. A critical situation during an A&R operation, when high torsional deformation, low tension and a low bending stiffness occur simultaneously, is simulated. An indication is given for the likelihood of loop formation and hockling when performing an A&R operation in certain sea states. Experiments should be performed to test the validity of the numerical model. The new insights into the state-dependent bending stiffness should be used to create an experimental set-up to find the critical parameters that result in loop formation and hockling. Further studies into friction modelling in FEM are needed to reduce the computational time when wire rope complexity is increased.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Steele-Dunne, S. (mentor)","2017","This research studies different hydrological models in the catchments with various climates in the USA, and MODIS snow cover maps are introduced to assess and improve the models. In this research, assessment of the value of MODIS snow cover data in the hydrological modeling process is the main objective. Nine MOPEX catchments in the continental US are studied in this research and for each catchment three types of models are used: (1) a basic, lumped 3-box version of the HBV model, (2) a lumped version with snow reservoir, and (3) a semi-distributed formulation of HBV with snow reservoir. MODIS snow cover maps are used for assessing and improving the model snow component. In the models with snow reservoir, snow water storage is reduced to its binary information content: snow/no snow (i.e. 1 or 0), which is then directly linked with spatial pattern in MODIS snow cover data without the need for further assumptions, such as snow densities; the coincidence of snow water storage in the model and observed MODIS snow cover is used as additional calibration/evaluation metric to condition and test the realism of the respective models. In this research, daily meteorological and hydrological data (precipitation, evaporation, discharge, temperature) and maximum eight-day MODIS snow cover maps for the study catchments are used. In calibration, in each time step, the modelled maximum binary 8-day snow reservoir value is compared with MODIS snow cover data for the respective model or its sub-units (in the semi-distributed formulation). Model 03 is semi-distributed, by discretizing each study catchment into individual 200m elevation bands. The results show a large difference of model performance in the catchments with various climates. It is shown that MODIS snow cover data can be valuable to assess the degree to which spatial snow accumulation and ablation dynamics are represented in models, thereby increasing model realism, while not necessarily improving the calibrated performance of models.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","CIE5050-09",""

Literature showed promising results when a combination of mandibular advancement and position training is used. In this project, these treatments are integrated in a single product. An orthodontic appliance keeps the lower jaw forward to create upper airway volume and sound waves emitted by the appliance are conducted through teeth and skull to discretely train the patient to sleep in lateral position.","positional obstructive sleep apnea; combined treatment; mandibular advancement device; position training; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2019-02-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

As a consequence of modelling the Reynolds stresses based on the Boussinesq hypothesis, RANS simulations contain model errors.

Conflicting interrelations between them are assessed whereby eight trade-offs are encountered. This perception of these trade-offs is assessed for different business units from the organisation for two case studies.

(mentor)","2017","In deep sea mining polymetallic nodules are harvested that are found in large parts of the oceans at depths of up to 6000 metres. A deep sea mining system collects such nodules using a seabed crawler and transports them to a continuously sailing ship by pumping them via a jumper through a free-hanging riser. The position of the seabed crawler must be known for two main reasons. Firstly, object on the seabed spotted in bathymetric surveys can be avoided. Secondly, the crawler can follow optimized mining patterns depending on the seabed lay-out. Because the ability to actively respond in case of an unexpected situation is desired the crawler position must be known in real-time. Use of conventional subsea positioning techniques such as short and long baseline systems is inaccurate or expensive. Using a short baseline system leads to inaccurate results due to the large depth and surrounding noise created by the deep sea mining system, while using a long baseline system requires a vast array of subsea transponders since the crawler is constantly moving. However, the position of the crawler relative to the position of the tip of the free-hanging riser can be determined. So if the position of the tip of the free-hanging riser is known the position of the crawler can be obtained. In this thesis project a system is proposed that determines the position of the tip of the free-hanging riser. All observations are made in two dimensions to reduce computational time. An estimation of the position of the tip of the riser is made in two steps. Firstly a finite element model of the riser is made that is used to estimate the deflections of the free-hanging riser. Secondly measurements are done at the booster stations along the riser. The model estimations and measurements are combined using a Kalman filter in an attempt to increase the estimation accuracy. Combining the finite element model with measurements improves the position estimation compared to a system using only a finite element model or only measurements. A system creating a position estimation in two dimensions can do this in real-time. An optimal estimation is not reached, as a steady offset remains that cannot be filtered out. It is attempted to decrease this offset by adding temporary position measurements. Adding position measurements improves the accuracy of the estimated position, but the improvement does not last when position measurements are lost. Reducing the steady offset can be achieved by improving the estimation made by the finite element model. The results can be improved by maintaining the accurate results obtained from temporary positions measurements. This could be done using a system capable of altering the finite element model parameters. For Royal IHC, it will be important to determine a minimum position accuracy that is required to get a profitable mining operation.","Monitoring; Free-hanging; Riser; Finite Element Modelling; Kalman","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Balkenende, A.R. (mentor)","2017","Within the scope of ‚Äòcircular economy in emerging markets‚Äô the aim of this exploratory graduation project is to design a local application for educational purposes with the recycled PET filament that will be developed by Urban Mining in Colombia. A major issue in Colombia is the problem of plastic waste that often ends up in landfill as well as in the environment. This leads to a loss of the value captured in the material and damage to the environment. An informal waste sector exists in which poor residents collect and separate waste and receive an income by selling the waste to the recycling industry. Working conditions are unsafe and unhealthy due to the informality of the market and non-existence of agreements or cooperation with authorities. Urban Mining recognizes these challenges and wants to explore the potential of implementing their concept in Colombia. Filament (the ‚Äòink‚Äô for 3D printing) from post-consumer PET bottles is regarded as an interesting product. The purpose with the recycled PET filament is twofold: for export and for a local application that generates a positive impact for the community. This graduation project focuses on the latter and focuses on educational purposes. Through an analysis in the areas of recycling PET, 3D printing and education, the design vision is defined as: ‚ÄúI want to design a playful educational product-service system that supports teaching specific knowledge in secondary education in Colombia and that incorporates the unique features of 3D printing with recycled PET filament.‚Äù This results in the final concept for the product-service system ‚ÄúJuega la abeja‚Äù: an interactive educational game for secondary school students to practice knowledge in class (product component) and an online platform that involves the teachers in the development of the product by creating questions and answers (service component). The meaning of ‚ÄúJuega la abeja‚Äù is literally ‚ÄúPlay the bee‚Äù. In Colombia ‚Äúabeja‚Äù has still another meaning, it is a synonym for a smart and intelligent person. The game is based on the interactive use of lights, on which blocks are placed that incorporate the translucent characteristic as unique feature of the recycled PET filament and customizability as unique feature of 3D printing. In this concept the game ‚ÄúGather your honey‚Äù is developed; this is a multiplayer game with the aim to ‚Äòwin‚Äô the most blocks by answering the questions correctly. User tests in Colombian schools validate the concept of ‚ÄúJuega la abeja‚Äù. A prototype is made that serves as a proof of concept for the functionality and production of the product. Through a material processing research insights were gained on the light transmission and readability of text on the blocks, both are important elements for playing the game. These insights contribute to a general understanding of the possibilities, characteristics and behaviour of the recycled PET filament. Before ‚ÄúJuega la abeja‚Äù can be further developed, several preceding steps need to be undertaken. The outcome of the project is regarded as a first step to explore and initiate the business case of Urban Mining in Colombia.","Circular economy in emerging markets; upcycling plastic waste; Colombia; recycled PET filament; 3D printing; education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","Technology in Sustainable Development",""

(mentor)","2017","Renewable energy is becoming more and more important in today's society. Wind energy plays an important role in the production of renewable energy. Due to economic advantages, wind turbines are often sited close together, creating wind farms. As a result, the wind turbines in the farm become interconnected due to the wakes of the turbines. In conventional wind farm control, this interconnection is ignored, and wind turbines are operated at their own local optimum. This control strategy is referred to as greedy con- trol. In the wake of a turbine, the wind speed is reduced. As a result, the power production of a wind turbine that is situated in a wake is also significantly lower. The greedy control strategy may therefore not be optimal for wind farm control, which subsequently has been receiving an increasing amount of attention recently. Most research on wind farm control focusses on steady- state optimization, i.e., finding the optimal steady-state given certain con- stant conditions. Since wind flow is always subject to change, the potential gain of this procedure is limited. In this thesis, a closed-loop dynamic wind farm controller is presented us- ing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control objective is to maximize the power production of the wind farm, resulting in an eco- nomic MPC problem. As the optimal input is time-dependent, the number of control inputs and states involved increase as the prediction horizon of the MPC problem increases, resulting in a more complex problem than the steady-state optimization problem. As a model, WFSim is used, which is based on 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. This results in a high-dimensional problem from which the opti- mum is unknown. The adjoint method is applied to determine the gradient of the objective function in a time-efficient manner. The controller developed in this thesis increases the power production of a wind farm with respect to the conventional greedy control stategy, and is able to adapt to changes in the atmospheric conditions. The adjoint-based MPC algorithm therefore shows real potential to perform real-time dynamic control on wind farms.","dynamic control; wind farm control; model predictive control; adjoint method; power optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor)","2017","Inhabitants and ecosystems in delta areas are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of subsidence, triggered both by natural causes and anthropogenic causes. Yangon is a city in the Irrawaddy delta in Myanmar where little is known about the true extent of this hazard, while its effects can potentially harm millions of its inhabitants. The aim of this research was, therefore, to assess if any subsidence is occurring, and to determine if groundwater extraction could be the cause of it. The city Yangon has a large urban extent and is expanding rapidly towards the north, west and east. In the current water supply system, nearly half of the domestic water use is supplied from reservoirs managed by the city council while the other half is obtained by other means. From the latter group, close to 80% extracts this water from aquifers beneath their home. This amounts to two million inhabitants of Yangon extracting their domestic water from the subsoil, that is excluding industrial water use. To assess if subsidence is occurring, surface deformation measurements were performed using Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) with data from the recently launched Sentinel-1. This technique relies on the calculation of phase differences between two imaging radar acquisitions which were ultimately related to differences in surface motion on an interval scale. The direct derivation of surface deformation from two radar acquisitions was limited by noise interference from atmospheric signals and the measuring of temporally-unstable land surface. To overcome these limitations, a persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) algorithm was used that selects stable scattering pixels with low noise contributors from a stack of interferograms through which deformation could be extracted. Resulting from the InSAR and PSI analysis, this thesis presents remotely sensed surface-level displacement using InSAR with Sentinel-1 data. Ascending and descending SAR image stacks over Yangon were processed into interferograms with the InSAR processing software, Doris, and next, the time series and line-of-sight velocities of phase stable pixels were extracted using the PSI algorithm StaMPS. The line-of-sight velocities that were decomposed into vertical and horizontal motion, reveal that parts of the city are subsiding at rates over 9 cm/y. Currently, these values cannot be validated due to the unavailability of ground-based measurements, but the consistency in the independent acquisition tracks supports their quality. To relate the surface deformation with subsidence, the domestic extraction of groundwater was mapped on the townships of Yangon. This involved combining various data sources among which a survey on water demand which was performed specifically for the benefit of this research. Although the relation between subsidence and groundwater extraction is more complex than simply their co-occurrence, this method was chosen to get a first order estimate of their causal relation. Additionally, there was not enough information available to employ a more extensive or complex approach. Through mapping water extractions onto the townships of Yangon, extraction rates up to 9mm/y were found. The spatial patterns of measured subsidence and estimated groundwater extraction do not correlate and therefore no indication for a causal relation between the two could be established. Future research should first be directed at identification of the mechanisms involved causing surface deformation. An extension on this research could be done with the suggested improvements on the extraction estimation, but assessing subsidence caused by groundwater pumping through a more extensive approach might be required. Though a relation between surface deformation and groundwater extraction is not established in this thesis, a recommendation is given to mitigate negative effects caused by groundwater pumping.","Irrawaddy; InSAR; Sentinel-1; Subsidence; PSI; Dons; StaMPS; Groundwater; Yangon; Myanmar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Resources","","NUS-TUD, Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources","Management double degree programme","16.8661, 96.1951"

Vibe is a wearable device which provides the user with meaningful and more intuitive feedback based on data gathered by the RunKeeper app on the users smartphone. Vibe is especially designed for the recreational runner. This target group will most likely not buy an expensive running watch and gets all the needed information about their run from an app like RunKeeper. However, Vibe can give them real time feedback about their performance, and helps them to run with a healthy rhythm. Vibe can be seen as an extension of the RunKeeper app and will be an accessible and low cost wearable. Vibe uses vibrotactile feedback as well as visual feedback by showing different lightpatterns and colors. Increasing the running cadence is one of the simplest yet unknown ways to prevent common running injuries. Vibe supports runners in achieving a higher cadence by cueing them with vibrotactile and visual feedback. Without showing any data about their performance, these forms of feedback can cue the runner to run better in a more natural and intuitive way.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-02-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This master thesis presents the development of a 12-lead electrocardiographic system for home use. The project focusses on the product design aspects of this system. By doing thorough context and user research it is aimed to an accessible product service system for the patient as well as the healthcare professional. Two cardiologists from the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam noticed that for diagnosing arrhythmias and infarctions at an early stage, it is needed to enable patients themselves to make 12-lead ECGs anywhere and anytime symptoms occur. Patients with arrhythmias often have symptoms for a short period of time. Fast diagnosis is hindered, because symptoms often do not occur at the time that ECGs are made in the hospital. Besides, patients who are about to have an infarction are in many cases warned by episodes of chest pain. This pain is often ignored for some time, whereas the patient has to act quickly to minimize damage. Based on an analysis of these problems, a design vision for this project was formed. In this design vision is stated that the new product service system should enable patients to make a reliable 12-lead ECGs at home. The patient should be involved in the diagnostic process by creating an easy-to-use product-service system to empower them to record essential data for diagnosing arrhythmias and ischemia. The design vision formed the start of the conceptualization phase. Several concepts were created and the main aspects of the final design were determined. It was chosen to create an ECG belt with four limb straps and integrated electrodes. The product contains ten wet electrodes that are placed at the standard locations according to the general procedure of making a rest ECG in the hospital. The product can be worn by people with different shapes and sizes, since the belt stretches and the electrodes automatically move to the right locations relative to each other. In this way, right placement of the electrodes is facilitated. The product is controlled by the smartphone of the user. Via an application, the user can record the ECGs and send them, together with a description of the complaints, to the hospital. The cardiologist will interpret the results and will send a message with an advice to the patient. The product was designed in detail in the embodiment phase of the project. Besides, a service blueprint was made. Since cardiologists will be more aware of the advantages of this product, it will be their task to create awareness among the potential users. The product will be handed to the user via hospitals. In this way, it can be controlled who is going to use the device and send ECGs to the cardiologist. To evaluate the feasibility and ease-of-use, a final prototype of the belt was made. An existing ECG system was connected to the belt and it was found that the electrodes made good contact to the skin and the ECGs were very similar to the ECGs that were made with a standard ECG system from the hospital. Besides, it was found that, although participants of the user test felt not very confident about using the product for the first time, all participants could put on the product in the right way with the help of some supporting visualizations. It has been concluded that a feasible proposal was made. The product is more user-friendly than the current hospital ECG systems and on the other hand the new system records more reliable and suitable data than current ECG solutions for home use. The system has great potential to be incorporated in clinical practice, so that arrhythmias and ischemia can be diagnosed faster.","Design for Healthcare; ECG system; Electrocardiography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","","","","",""

Shoreline erosion has been reported in the lee of submerged breakwaters in several field observations and therefore a better understanding of the characteristics of the shoreline response to submerged breakwaters is required. In this thesis insight is gained in the hydrodynamic patterns and the associated morphological response around a constructed submerged breakwater at the frequently monitored field site Anmok beach and in general the capability to reliably simulate coastal morphological response to submerged breakwaters is developed. In addition better understanding on modelling severe wave conditions in Delft3D has led to new possibilities with this model.","Morphodynamics; Submerged breakwater; Delft3D; hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","37.772832, 128.949450"

Department: Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics. Disruptions in public transport, if not properly addressed, can have consequent impacts on passengers, but also on public transport operators, translating into revenue loss. Yet so far, both operators and researchers have mainly focused on the supply side first (timetable, crews and rolling stock), before passengers. In this study, an assessment framework allowing for multiple service control strategies to be assessed and then compared for one given disruption from a passenger perspective is developed. It focuses on the incident phase, i.e. the phase from the start of the incident until the cause of the disruption is resolved. A case study in the metro of Rotterdam, operated by the RET, is used to test the framework. It reveals that there is room for improvement at the traffic control centre of the RET. On a yearly basis, savings in terms of societal costs could amount to approximately 900 K‚Ç¨, if every disruption similar to the case study is handled like in the best case scenario, deemed reasonably implementable by experts at the RET. There are two main takeaways for public transport operators. First, during the incident phase, a regularity paradigm benefits best passengers than a punctuality paradigm, thus impacting the way traffic controllers work. Second, pre-planned service control strategies in urban, rail-bound public transport systems need to have a variant for peak hours. The framework was thus successfully developed and can be used by other operators. In order to be more comprehensive, the next step could be to integrate some non-passenger-related impacts to the assessment.","disruption management; urban public transport; rail; passenger perspective; ARENA; discrete-event simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","51.92440, 4.47770"

(mentor)","2017","A novel multiscale method for discrete fracture modeling on unstructured grids (MS-DFM) is developed. To this end, the DFM fine-scale discrete system is constructed using unstructured conforming cells for the matrix with lower-dimensional fracture elements placed at their interfaces. On this unstructured fine grid, MS-DFM imposes independent unstructured coarse grids for the fracture and matrix domains. While the conservative coarse-scale system is solved over these coarse-grid cells, overlapping dual-coarse blocks are also formed in order to provide local supports for the multiscale basis functions. To increase the accuracy, but maintaining the computational efficiency, fracture-matrix coupling is considered only for the basis functions inside the matrix domain. This results in additional (enriching) fracture basis functions in the matrix. By construction, basis functions form the partition of unity for both fracture and matrix sub-domains. Furthermore, to enable error reduction to any desired level, a convergent iterative strategy is developed, where MS-DFM is employed along with a fine-scale smoother in order to resolve low- and high-frequency modes in the error. The performance of MS-DFM is assessed for several 2D and 3D test cases. Specially, the method proves accurate for many test cases without any iterations. MS-DFM is the first of its kind, and extends the application of multiscale methods to unstructured discrete fracture models. As such, it provides a promising framework for real-field application of unstructured DFM.","multiscale finite volume; unstructured grids; discrete fracture modeling; flow in fractured porous media; algebraic multiscale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Jacobsen, N.G. (mentor); McCall, R.T. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Weij, D. (mentor)","2017","After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, oil was released into the Gulf of Mexico and partly reached the shorelines. Here, it mixed with sand in the surf zone to form sand and oil agglomerates (SOAs). These cm-sized particles are heavier than water and are therefore found on the seabed. Years after the initial formation of these particles, they keep appearing on the beaches, despite earlier clean-up. Several studies to the formation and transport of these particles have been conducted, but traditional shear-stress based formula, which are generally used for sediment transport, do not predict the mobility of SOAs well. This study focuses on the incipient motion of SOAs and aims to propose an improved method of predicting SOA mobility under waves. Sliding and rotation are found to be the two governing mechanisms of incipient motion of SOAs. For both mechanisms and two particle shapes, spherical and disc-shaped, a mobility parameter is defined. A critical value of this parameter is derived from a force balance and moment of force balance and is a function of several parameters: the drag coefficient CD, the inertia coefficient CM, the lift coefficient CL, the location of the resulting forces relative to the point of rotation, the Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC), the friction coefficient and the relative distance of the point of rotation to the point of gravity. When the mobility number exceeds the critical value, initiation of motion of SOAs is expected. The forces on the object are simulated in 2DV with the CFD package OpenFOAM. The results of the numerical simulations indicate that the critical mobility parameter strongly correlates with the KC-number. For low KC-numbers, the inertia force has a significant contribution to the horizontal force and reduces the stability of the particles, so less hydrodynamic forcing is required for incipient motion. Sliding is the governing mechanism of incipient motion for disc-shaped particles, whereas rotation is expected for spherical particles. Burial reduces the mobility of the particle, as a smaller part of the particle disturbs the flow and soil pressures act as an additional stabilizing force. The results of this study can be applied to predict incipient motion of SOAs on a fixed bed. Due to the sensitivity of the mobility to SOA shape, density and diameter, a probabilistic method is recommended for predicting mobility of a collection of SOAs instead of a single particle.","OpenFOAM; Sand- and oil agglomerates; Incipient motion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The starting point of this research is to asses possible shortcomings of the combined operation of a Dynamic Positioning (DP) vessel and a motion compensation system, with respect to the amount of energy that is used. The motion compensation system is used to allow a safe transfer from the vessel to a static offshore structure. Both systems have the objective to track a fixed reference position. In the current situation these two systems are controlled independently, raising the idea that they could counteract each other. For a DP vessel operating on its own the ultimate goal is to track the reference position as close as possible using a reasonable amount of energy. However, for the combined operation the vessel just needs to stay close enough to the reference point so that the motion compensation system can do the rest. It is assumed that the latter needs less energy than the vessel to overpass the same distance. The goal of this thesis is to investigate options to adjust the existing or build a new DP controller containing a certain variable that can be used to make a trade-off. The maximum displacement of the vessel from the reference point can be weighed against the energy consumption. Simulation models of a DP vessel and of a motion compensation system are built in Simulink. Next to this, models for the energy consumption are derived for both systems. The proposed methods for energy consumption reduction are: using the integrated velocity as an estimation of the position of the vessel, the use of a reference circle instead of a reference point, the tuning of the thrust allocation optimization, and the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC). After Simulating two different scenarios it can be concluded that all methods yield energy consumption reductions, and taking into account some more preferences, overall MPC gives the best results.","Dynamic Positioning; motion compensation platform; AMPL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems & Control","SCP4530-45",""

(mentor)","2017","An important step in the design process of breakwaters is the laboratorial tests which show the performance of the breakwater. One of the important aspects in the performance is the stability of the armour layer. A common methodology for breakwater testing is a method in which the design wave conditions are simulated in four steps of 1000 or more waves. These steps start at 60% of the design conditions and every step the severity is increased. This test methodology is already applied for many years, but never has it been verified. Also in this methodology damage the evolution of a storm is not taken into account. In this MSc thesis research laboratory tests are conducted with a rubble mound breakwater structure with an armour layer of randomly placed cubes. A storm that was measured at the coast of Spain has been chosen to use and test on the breakwater structure. With a theoretical model a theoretical storm was calculated which based on literature should induce the same damage evolution as the measured storm, this theoretical storm is also tested on the breakwater structure. And the explained methodology is conducted on the same breakwater structure. The target of the tests was to judge the performance of the methodology, to indicate if the theoretical model produces correct theoretical storms and if based on the theoretical storm and the characteristics of a storm at which damage happens, recommendations can be given to improve/replace the methodology. The storms showed that mainly damage happened around the peak of the storm and in the build-up, but the tail of the storm (when the wave height is only decreasing) is of no importance for the damage development. An interesting aspect is that the build-up of a storm seems to be very important for the stability. The testing methodology performed really well, but the duration of the 100% step is an important consideration since a longer duration will cause more damage. Also was found that the safety factors that are used in the design of cubic armoured breakwaters are quite conservative. Finally the damage evolution due to the theoretical storm was not comparable compared to the damage evolution due to the simulated real storm, both in final damage as in the incremental damage. This led to the conclusion that the theoretical model describe by the literature was not a correct model to produce a theoretical storm for this chosen storm. As a general conclusion it can be said that the methodology that is already used for many years is performing well, but improvement is possible by considering durations of storms which at the moment is not done in the design process.","Breakwater; Cubes; Stability; flume; laboratory tests; Damage development; Theoretical models; physical experiments; Damage; Testing methodologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Winterwerp, J.C. (mentor); van Prooijen, B.C. (mentor); Cleveringa, J. (mentor)","2017","The fairway connecting Holwerd and Nes forms the main transport route between Friesland and Ameland (the Dutch Wadden Sea). It consists of several tidal channels that funnel the majority of the tidal currents propagating through the tidal basin. Over the past decades, several channel bends have expanded leading to a fairway length-increase of about 1 km, and the channel in front of Holwerd has become subject to sedimentation. Since 1990 this channel was dredged and the volume of dredged material has increased exponentially. A relation between dredging activities, channel migration and frequent delays of the ferry has been suggested. The main goal of this thesis is therefore to explain the difference in evolution between the non-natural (intervened) and natural tidal meanders in the Ameland basin. To achieve this goal, the evolution of geographic channel dimensions are analyzed by assessing bathymetric data and the outcome is linked to the physics by means of hydrodynamic modeling. Channels have been classified based on their locations and dimensions. Three meandering stages have been identified that describe the basic channel behavior. The first meandering stage is the developed meander, characterized by a clear sinusoidal shape and with flood chutes. In this stage, the depth at a cross-over is approximately two times smaller than at the channel section with a maximum curvature (the channel top), where the width profile is funnel shaped. The developed, variable meander has similar characteristics, but differs by a lower correlation in width and depth, and closer to the tidal watershed the ebb channel location varies more in time. The third stage is the undeveloped meander, which is characterized by small and relatively straight channels, the absence of flood chutes, and a rather constant width- and depth-profile along the channel. In this study, the channels are evaluated that have similar meandering features and distance from the Ameland inlet as the dredged channels. In general, the examined channels showed a width reduction that dominates over the bed level decrease. An irregularity in the width and/or depth profile is an indicator for the development of a bifurcation or flood chute. Numerical modeling of the tidal currents revealed a correlation between the depth averaged velocity and the funnel shaped channel top. From the depth averaged velocities it is found that flow accelerates around the channel tops, where flood dominance prevails and flood chutes (are able to) develop. During ebb, a similar acceleration occurs towards the point of inflection, where ebb dominance prevails. Increasing meanders correspond to a shift towards ebb dominance in both natural and non-natural channels. By evaluating the secondary flow velocities along the channels, an eastward shift of the cross-over location is observed. Whether the shift corresponds to the channel migration, or that it strengthens the potential for channel splitting is not proven. However, an indication is found that a correlation exists between the distance between channel tops and the cross-over location shift. When the meanders develop, the distance between the tops increases, enabling a larger area over which the direction of the secondary flow can change. Furthermore, the orientation of the currents over the tidal flats and the angle under which they flow into the channel seems to be correlated. Also the importance of flood chutes to the meandering development is brought forward. The development of a chute increases the flow area and reduces the flow velocities in the ebb channel adjacent to the flood chute, which thereafter becomes shallower. After a flood chute is established, and it obtained a more west-east orientation, the flood currents over the tidal flat are deflected towards the ebb channel. As a consequence flow velocities increase in the ebb channel, resulting in a westward migration of the ebb channel. Comparing the natural and non-natural channels, the meandering extent (average sinuosity) is approximately 10\% larger for the non-natural channels. This sinuosity also increases over time in the natural channels, but to a lesser extent. By dredging, the irregularities in width and depth are flattened out and the flow through the ebb channel was maintained. This resulted in the non-natural development of the eastern Kikkertgat-bend and the stagnation of the flood chute development. Therefore it is concluded that a non-natural tidal meander in the Ameland basin is distinguished by developing meanders, where the flood chutes are not restricting the development of the meandering ebb channels.","tidal meanders; tidal channels; tidal basins; wadden sea; Ameland; secondary flow; channel classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Jonkers, H.M. (mentor); Pacejka, H.E. (mentor)","2017","The first quay walls were constructed in 2400 BC and were constructed with bricks. Since then, the quay walls have developed a lot. The quay walls nowadays are constructed out of steel, concrete or a combination of both materials. An upcoming material in the field of hydraulic engineering is fibre reinforced polymer (FRP). FRP has several advantages such as the low weight to strength ratio. Bridges and lock gates have already been constructed out of FRP. This thesis is a feasibility study to an FRP quay wall. An FRP quay wall is designed based on a reference project provided by the engineering bureau of Gemeente Rotterdam. CUR96 has been applied as a design guideline. The focus of this feasibility study is the retaining wall. The anchors and superstructure are not included in this study. A variant study has been conducted concerning 4 types of quay walls. The cantilever quay wall, an anchored quay wall, an L-wall and a caisson. For each of the variants a preliminary design has been made. As a result of the variant study the anchored quay wall is proven to be the most suitable type of quay wall. The maximum allowable deformation is based on the heeling angle and draught of the governing vessel as well as the distance between the moored vessel and quay wall. The quay wall from the case study has been modelled with the program ‚ÄòD sheet Piling‚Äô. The stiffness of the quay wall has been lowered until the deformation of the quay wall was more or less equal to the maximum deformation. The Young‚Äôs modulus of FRP is a static variable while the moment of inertia is a dynamic variable. The moment of inertia depends on the cross section of the quay wall profile. The cross section of the FRP quay wall is similar to Z-profiles used for steel sheet piling. The FRP quay wall consists out of 2 skin laminates, web laminates which connect the skin laminates with one another and foam that fills the space between the skins when no web is present. The foam has no significant mechanical properties and will therefore be neglected. The skin laminate has been designed as an anisotropic laminate while the web laminate has been designed as a quasi-isotropic laminate. The laminates are designed with the programs ‚ÄòeLamX2‚Äô and ‚ÄòKolibri‚Äô. According to CUR96 the strain in the laminates may not be higher than 0,27%. With a hand calculation, a 2D model in ‚ÄòSCIA‚Äô and a 3D FEM model in ‚ÄòSCIA‚Äô the strains in the laminates have been calculated for the governing loading combination. The skin and web laminates have been checked for the following failure mechanisms: buckling, interlaminar shear stress, wrinkling and shear stress between the laminates. From these checks it can be concluded that neither the skin nor the web laminate is sensitive to these failure mechanisms. Common checks related to quay walls have been performed as well. The anchor capacity, overall stability, bearing capacity and deadweight of the quay wall have been checked. The joints of the FRP quay wall have been discussed theoretically. This concerns the joints between 2 Z-profiles as well as the connection between the skin and web laminate. It is stated in design guidelines that the design of the joint between the skin and web laminate has to be verified with testing and a numerical calculation with a FEM. Literature shows that FRP is already being applied as shoring equipment but with a limited retaining height. The type of connection used in the shoring equipment is similar to the connections used with steel sheet piling. The required installation technique for a FRP quay wall has been researched as well. Driving, vibrating and pressing the FRP quay wall to the required depth is not feasible. A diaphragm wall installation technique is therefore assumed to be the best alternative. An LCA has been performed for the steel combi wall from the case study as well as for the FRP quay wall. The carbon footprint and environmental impact has been calculated for both quay walls and are compared to one another. The results are the same, the impact of the FRP quay wall is way bigger than the impact of the steel combi wall. The LCA has been performed for a running meter quay wall. The FRP quay wall has been compared to the steel combi wall based on the LCA. Both structures have also been compared to one another based on a cost estimation for a running meter quay wall. The result of this estimation is that the FRP quay wall is far more expensive than the steel combi wall. The conclusion of this feasibility study is that an FRP quay wall is technically feasible.","Glass fibre; FRP; Quay wall; Fibre Reinforced Polymer; Polyester Resin; LCA; Life Cycle Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Civil Engineering","","51.847354, 4.666211"

Observations show that sandbars move onshore during mild wave conditions. Literature describes different potential sediment mechanisms that cause this onshore migration, but the dominant cause is still under debate. The goal of the present study is to determine the dominant sediment mechanism in wave driven onshore sandbar migration. The study uses data collected in a mobile-bed wave flume. The study consists of two parts: (1) calculating sediment transport based on PIV data and (2) analysing wave driven sediment transport in the wave bottom boundary layer. The analysis distinguishes three transport mechanisms: current related, long wave related and short wave related sediment transport. The study further distinguishes wave properties corresponding to different intra-wave processes within the short wave related sediment transport. The findings show that short wave related sediment transport is dominant. The wave shape changes towards the bottom: asymmetry is transformed into skewness, which results in strongly skewed and backward pitched waves close to the bottom. Additionally, the results seem to indicate that the short wave related sediment transport mainly depends on near-bed skewness and not or slightly on the asymmetric pressure gradient. The implication is that sediment transport calculations should focus on short wave related transport, near-bed skewness and should include the wave shape development in the wave bottom boundary layer. In addition, the study shows that PIV data have potential to determine sediment transport without additional concentration measurements. Three essential steps in the method are: (1) placement of the PIV laser in front of the wave flume instead of the common position on top to illuminate both the flow and bottom sediment, (2) calibrate the intensity and concentration based on the mean bed and mean water intensity and (3) multiply the PIV sediment velocities with the concentration to obtain sediment transport. The results of this study contribute to improve the accuracy of coastal morphology predictions and the efficiency of beach nourishments and other coastal protection measures.","Sandbar; onshore; PIV; non-linear waves; nearshore; sediment transport; wave bottom boundary layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Fluid mechanics & Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van der Horst, R. (mentor)","2017","A design intervention was performed, to reshape the accessory portfolio of BeSafe to achieve brand coherency and expand market share. Over the past decades BeSafe has positioned itself as a premium brand offering mainly rearfacing child restraining systems (car seats) of the highest quality. The company‚Äôs strong vision on safety, innovation and design is visible in all the car seats. It makes there positioning in the market strong as a sincere, meaningful and sophisticated brand. However, with most resources going into car seat development the accessory portfolio has fallen behind. Today BeSafe‚Äôs accessory portfolio misses consistency, contains products that contradict the vision on safety and are of low quality. As a result of this the brand is unable to generate brand resonance through its accessories. Rather the accessories undermine the brand experience as they communicate low quality, difficult to use products and a misleading message. In a market that is slowly shifting from being forward-facing oriented to rear-facing oriented, BeSafe faces a challenge. BeSafe needs to be in optimal form to become the rear-facing partner consumers are needing. To do this a simple re-design of every accessory is insufficient. Consumers will still be little engaged with the accessories and will not favor the brand over competitors. Rather a redesign of the entire accessory portfolio is needed in terms of vision, direction and coherence. This vision should be clear-cut and strong, as consumers are in need of a logical story. The accessories should start to build on- and enrich the brand experience. Boiling down a brand-, company- & market analyses with insights from all relevant stakeholders, a new vision for the BeSafe accessory portfolio was established, namely: ‚ÄúConfident rear-facing transport and mobility‚Äù. Positioning BeSafe as a confident partner is unique within the rear-facing market. And allows BeSafe to build an accessory portfolio that is focused and hard to imitate. A twofold challenge was identified to implement the vision. Firstly, how can we ensure focus in future innovations once the current products have been analyze. And secondly, what could be a first showcase BeSafe accessory to endorse this new strategic direction? To tackle these challenges two parallel design efforts were made, one for making the portfolio accessory guidebook, the second a more traditional design process to come to a new accessory. Before making a tool to ensure the accessory portfolio remains future proof, the current accessories are categorized under ‚Äòkeepers‚Äô, ‚Äòpremiumizers‚Äô, ‚Äòupgraders‚Äô, ‚Äògradual terminators‚Äô and ‚Äòterminators‚Äô, based on their fit with the new portfolio vision. This advice is substantiated by the sales numbers of each accessory, which showed a steep decline for each accessory labeled as ‚Äò(gradual) discontinuers‚Äô. Then with the input of all relevant design and business stakeholders an accessory portfolio guidebook is put together. A tool that helps people understand the vision, agree upon it and use it as an object for discussion so employees can make the vision ‚Äòtheir own‚Äô. As such, the accessory portfolio guidebook starts off with a short explanation of the change in strategy and why it fits so well with BeSafe. Next a short recap on the core brand values will be given. Then by providing people with a dynamic functionality flowchart, new ideas can be assessed on their fit with the vision and put on different horizons of the roadmap. Next, a dynamic moodboard is used to help people give body to their ideas, both design and communication wise. The guidebook is a working document, and during bi-annual sessions lead by ‚Äòthe accessory portfolio manager‚Äô everyone in the NPD team has the ability to bring forward interesting content (criteria, inspiration and ideas). Generative research with parents and children was conducted to find out what is needed to take them along in BeSafe‚Äôs confident rear-facing story. This research showed that parents find it hard to feel confident as their children have a lack of autonomy and parents have no means to control this. A design challenge was distilled from all research that will lead to a first show case accessory that truly makes parents feel confident: ‚ÄúHelp parents with toddlers between 9 months and 4 years gain controlled autonomy during their travels, as to facilitate an ongoing feeling of confidence that results in parents transporting their children rear-facing longer.‚Äù Researching interesting portfolio gaps and using the design challenge, a process of ideation and conceptualization is started in the direction of a tablet and protective cover. This direction is found to be most suitable for a show-case accessory as it allows for the re-design of an existing product labelled as ‚Äòupgrader‚Äô, and opens up a new product category which has not been introduced by any other company. Three concept are presented: Mesh, a backrest protecting cover with an integrated tablet pocket. Omnia, being a full back seat protecting cover in two pieces that grows with the child over the years. The detachable tablet pocket also functions for in home use. And thirdly Liberty, a retractable tablet cover to give children full interaction with the tablet in a safe way. A combination of Mesh and Omnia is proposed for further development based on feasibility, viability and desirability as this offers BeSafe a product that is innovative, offers the highest safety and user friendliness. The concept embodiment results in the BeSafe Switch, a tablet & protective cover. Which consists of a separable top and bottom piece, which are to be connected in rear-facing use and disconnected in forward facing use. As such the bottom part remains on the back seat to protect the upholstery form indentation and dirt. The top piece helps to protect the back seat from dirty feet in the first years, before it moves along to the front seat with the growing child. To give parents a sense of full control, they are recommended the use of a white labelled application called ArkMC. This allows them to fully control the media played on the tablet from the front seat, which is crucial for a completely confident user experience of the Switch. Parents are enlightened with the product as they explain it is a product they wished for already in so many situations. Many state this would make transporting their children rear-facing much easier as it provides them with a peaceful drive and they do not have to worry about their car getting dirty any longer. The insights from the final user test are translated into a final design of the product and as a result of this the product presented in this thesis is close to finished for production. Lastly a marketing and business case reveal the most effective way of putting the BeSafe Switch in the market. Making optimal use of the limited resources for display and advertisement by retailers, a new way of presenting the product in the existing shop-in-shop experience is advised, besides this a concept packaging is presented, redesigning the way in which a product‚Äôs most important values are communicated to the user. With a cost price of a little over ‚Ç¨11,- and a reasonable salesprice of ‚Ç¨60,- the product has great upside potential and requires a reasonable and low risk investment. As such it offers BeSafe a very valuable addition to the new accessory portfolio.","car seat accessories; portfolio reshaping; brand driven innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-02-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Flooding is the most common and one of the most damaging natural hazards globally. It has severe societal, economic and environmental consequences. Damages from floods are expected to worsen with changing climate and increasing population andwealthworldwide. Within the last decades, advances in computational power and increases in the number of global databases have enabled the development of global flood risk models (GFRMs). These are valuable tools for agencies, practitioners and stakeholders to learn, communicate and plan effective flood risk mitigation strategies. However, the current limitations of GFRMs directly affect their usefulness for concrete applications. They often only capture riverine flooding for major world catchments which renders them of limited use and accuracy for smaller catchment scales or in coastal areas. The drivers of floods are diverse and their co-occurrence can significantly exacerbate the severity of the flood hazard. Finally, the complex structure of conventional flood hazard models is often computationally very expensive. This thesis focuses on improving flood risk characterization by applying stochastic models for flood hazard quantification. The use of stochastic models, such as Bayesian Network (BN) models, is a possible alternative to conventional GFRM approaches because they substantially reduce computational time and are flexible in structure. In this thesis, the dependence structure in the BN is represented by the Gaussian copula. The research was divided into two parts: global- and local-scale applications. First, a Global BN model is developed to derive discharge for the contiguous United States (US). This continental-scale riverine flood hazard model is considered to be global because of the geographic and climatological diversity of the US. Second, a Local BN model is developed to represent the interaction between riverine and coastal flooding at the catchment scale. The local-scale model is coupled with a simple one-dimensional (1D) steady state process-based hydraulicmodel to derive water surface elevations. The Global BN model is a hydrologic model, a non-parametric Bayesian Network, based on the work of Paprotny andMorales N√°poles [2016] for Europe. Annual maximumdaily river discharge,Q, is collected at 4765US stations and 1841 European stations. The statistical dependencies between Q and seven variables, based on catchment area, steepness, climate and land use, are derived from global databases and used to build the Global BN. The model is sampled to infer the conditional probability distribution of Q, which is used to perform frequency analysis using a log-logistic distribution for different return periods in the US. The performance of themodel is measured based on the coefficient of determination, R2, and theNash- Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, NSE. The mean discharge, QMAMX , obtained from the model for all US stations is compared to the equivalent discharge obtained from historical observations. Overall, the model shows a moderate performance (R2=0.86, NSE=0.76). Spatial representation of the ratio of the modeled to the observed mean discharge, the relative error e, shows distinct regional patterns. Stations located inwarmtemperate climate regions are modeled the best (R2=0.91, NSE=0.77), and in arid regions the worst (R2=0.69, NSE=-0.12). Similarly, stations with large catchment areas, i.e. larger than 10000 km2, exhibit much higher performance results than others (R2=0.91, NSE=0.75). It is understood that these two factors drive the overall performance. While the model performed worse when compared to the BN-approach applied to Europe (R2=0.92, NSE=0.92), the Global BN still captures betterQMAMX than another global flood hazard model developed by Smith et al. [2015]. The Local BN model is build to capture the statistical dependencies between mean daily discharges in the Buffalo Bayou River catchment and the maximum daily residual height at the tide gauge Galveston Pier 21 (GP21) in southeast Texas. In coastal catchments, an elevated downstream water level, resulting from high tide and/or storm surge, impedes drainage creating a backwater effect that may exacerbate flooding in the riverine environment. However, conventional flood hazard studies do not explicitly model this interaction. In this study, the Local BN model is sampled to infer boundary conditions (discharges at six stations) for the river reach and explicitly include their dependence. The surge height at the Lynchburg Landing site (LL), the downstream boundary of the hydraulic model, is calculated as the conditional expectation given the residual at GP21. Stochastic boundary conditions corresponding to selected bivariate return periods, 50- to 1000-year, are modeled. Marginal distributions of mean daily river discharges and maximum daily residuals are parametrized using a Generalized Extreme Value distribution and a Gaussian mixture model, respectively. The water levels in the river reach are modeled using a 1D hydraulic model to obtain water surface profiles (WSPs) for the modeled stochastic boundary conditions. The modeled WSPs show a higher difference in water surface elevations in the upstream section of the river reach (8.12m for the 100-year return period WSPs) than downstream at LL (0.96m). The selected design 100-year WSP is compared to the 100-year WSP used in the FEMA model [FEMA,2017]. The water surface elevation obtained in this study at LL is 2.23m-NAVD88 and a total discharge of 8685m3/s, against 4.85m-NAVD88 and 6749m3/s for FEMA. Since water levels in the lower reach are particularly sensitive to the imposed downstream boundary condition, the design WSP is lower than what would be obtained using the water levels reported by FEMA in the selected reach. However, the model results show that the mid- and upper reaches are particularly sensitive to the backwater effects caused by the interaction between high river discharges and storm surge. This suggests that conventional methods may underestimate the flood hazard associated with compound flooding in the riverine environment and that such interactions should be carefully investigated in future coastal flood hazard studies. This research shows that BN-based models are an useful addition to conventional flood hazardmodels. Their flexible structure can simply and intuitively represent complex flood hazards while explicitly including dependencies between variables. Future studies further investigating the sensitivity and appropriate simplification of flood mechanisms will strengthen the accuracy and applicability of probabilistic models both at global- and local-scales.","copulas; Bayesian Network; flood risk; flood hazard; global flood model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","29.719880, -95.240008"

(mentor); Rutten, M.M. (mentor)","2017","A 2Dnumericalmodel is set-up for the tidal bore in the Sittaung River. This model is used to analyse the effect of the bottom friction, bathymetry, tidal range and river discharge on the propagation of the tidal bore. To obtain information about the tidal bore the Sittaung River is visited two times. During the second visit, depth measurements were carried out. It became clear that the tidal bore occurs only a few days after full and new moon at the village Kyaik Ka Thar. The tidal bore is also observed near Kyaik Ka Thar as an undular bore with a height of ¬± 0.3 m. Downstream in the estuary the tidal bore is larger and occurs 5 till 7 days after full and new moon. A numerical model is set-up for the region from Madauk till the Gulf of Marteban. The bathymetry is based on various datasets. Only a few cross-sectional profiles were available for the upper part of the model. The SRTMmap was used to determine the bottom slope of the river, whereas the cross-sections were used to determine the cross-sectional profile. From the depth measurements the initial depth for the bottom slope was obtained. The Navioncs webapp is used for the lower part of the domain (Gulf of Martaban). Both parts of the bathymetry were connected by using linear interpolation. From the Landat pictures the locations of the intertidal areas were obtained. As an upstream boundary a river discharge is set. A tidal signal is used as the downstream boundary. This downstream signal consists of two components: a daily double high water signal (D2) and a daily quarter high water signal (D4). The calibration is based on the propagation of the tidal bore. When the water level changes are larger than 0.2 m within 2.5 minute it is assumed that the tidal bore has propagate through a grid cell. On this way, the model results could be calibrated with data obtained from the field. For verification the relation between the cross-sectional area and the tidal prism was checked. For the sensitivity analyse the bottom friction, tidal range, bathymetry and river discharge were varied in various simulations. From these results can be concluded that the river discharge has no influence on the tidal bore, whereas the other parameters has a significant effect on the tidal bore. This implies that damming the Sittaung River, resulting in a change of the discharge, will not affect the tidal bore. Thus, changes of the propagation are only caused by the geometry and bathymetry of the estuary. Secondly the variety of the tidal bore is only caused by the tidal range, because this is the only parameter which change throughout the year. At least the effect of the tidal bore on the erosion is checked, but it is very difficult to relate the tidal bore to the erosion due to the lack of data. Upstream in the estuary the tidal bore is a small undular bore, which will not cause must erosion. Downstream of the estuary the tidal bore is larger and could have much more effect on the erosion.","Delft3D; Myanmar; Tidal bore","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","17.116011,96.972761"

This makes it hard to define where policy objectives are of importance in an urban network. Also comprehensive evaluation of transport policy is lacking in most cities. Therefore, this research aims to develop a generic approach for policy makers in Dutch cities to make urban transport policy more specific and measurable on the network level. Based on a case study of some steps of the GGB+ method, of which the results are validated by expert interviews, it can be stated that urban transport policy can be made more tangible by priority maps and function maps. To create these maps, links are prioritized based on policy principles and route choice behaviour and sorted by a traffic engineering classification. Subsequently, this classification can be matched with transport policy objectives by a translation into indicators and assignment of corresponding factors to the classification. Afterwards, these maps can be used to select important evaluation locations and appropriate data collection methods that take the restrictions of an urban network that influences data quality into account. This thesis points out that further research can be done to the accuracy of data sources for slow modes, valuable combinations of data fusion and to indicators that express policy goals in a network for several modes at the same time.","evaluation; urban transport policy; network vision; indicators; data collection methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","In the Netherlands almost 17.500 kilometers of primary flood defenses protect the flood prone areas from inundation. These flood defenses are designed and periodically assessed according to certain design standards which require an average probability of exceedance of 1/1.250 or 1/10.000 per year. From the results of recent assessments, it was found that a lot of dike sections could not be assessed due to the presence of Non-Water retaining Objects (NWOs), such as buildings Non-Water retaining objects are structures which are not part of a flood defense, such as buildings. The current methods only consider a 2D cross sectional profile to assess the safety against an instability. In case a building is present in the dike, this is neglected by assuming it to be absent. This limitation led to the subject for this research thesis was formed: ‚ÄúWhat is the local influence of a building on the reliability of the inner slope stability of a dike section?‚Äù Current developments with computational models provide an opportunity to implement a dike section containing a building in the 3D Finite Element Method. Based on the amount of time such a computation takes and the limitations of the model choices, first some analytical calculations were performed. The important sensitivities which were found were the dimensions of the building, the position of the building (both depth and distance from crest), the weight of the building, the stiffness of the walls and the tensile strength of the masonry building. From both the analytical calculations the following overall conclusions were found. - The increase in soil pressure against the building from the dike will be limited during the initiation of an instability - The stability of the dike is not influenced by the stiffness of a building, although deformations for the different stiffness‚Äôs are different - The pressure on the soil retaining wall does show different values, however it does not show an increase during instability w.r.t. the normative conditions. For a building with common dimensions and loads which can be used to schematize a building it has been found that a local instability will almost never occur. In case extreme loads or unfavorable positions of a building over a larger length are present, the local instability can occur (think of high rise buildings on top of the crest for example). - A local instability will be compensated by the more stable boundary effects It can be questioned whether the increased 3D stability will result in an attraction of larger loads towards the building. In case the building would be subjected to higher loads (from the soil), the structural safety could become critical. In case the building collapses, a different type of sliding plane will occur. This can endanger the overall dike stability. In case a building remains intact during extreme conditions, it can be stated that the influence of an (intact) building on the stability should be considered. In such scenarios the assumption of a hole in the dike at the location where the building is situated is a conservative image of the actual stability. It is noted that this thesis is very deterministic. Uncertainties in soil and structural properties have only been considered by performing some sensitivity analyses. It is therefore suggested to analyze the uncertainty in the soil and building in a more detailed or probabilistic research. Current models such as the heterogeneous dike profile analyses using the Random FEM could be looked into. Such models may also give a more realistic view on the local influences such as uneven deformations and local soil disturbances.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The building sector accounts for 30% of the total energy consumption worldwide, which has a large potential for improvement in energy demand (OECD/IEA, 2015). In the Netherlands a large part of the building stock are existing houses and that eventually need to be transformed to become energy neutral. The scale of the neighbourhood makes it possible to bring inhabitants, the city and building level together. Not only electricity, heating and cooling demand is considered in this research, also transport is regarded as an important energy consumer of households. Energy demand can be reduced by improving energy performance of the buildings with measures such as insulation. Modern technologies such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, make it possible to move away from petrol and gas, which could decrease the annual energy demand significantly. Most of the current electricity is centrally produced in a power plant. Energy from renewable sources can be produced on‚Äêsite. Due to the intermittent character of local renewable energy generation, the stress on the grid could increase (Koch, Girard, & McKoen, 2012). Local grid problems can be prevented by introducing a microgrid (Ustun, Ozansoy, & Zayegh, 2011). A microgrid makes it possible to match distributed energy generation with local demands. The electrification of technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles can cause increasing peak demands on the electricity grid. This will result in more interconnection between the heating, transport and electricity sector among other things. Using an integral approach, the relationship between the built environment and energy sector was explored in this research. It was shown that the primary energy demand in the case study neighbourhood in Rotterdam could be reduced with 45% with measures such as strong insulation, heat pumps, solar panels and electric vehicles. In the worst case scenario this would lead to an increase in peak demand of 4.1 times the current situation. By improving the physical design variables in the built environment, this peak demand was reduced with 40%, which is 2.6 times the peak demand of the current situation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Due to their small size, when compared to the wing, a highly refined mesh is required to accurately simulate the flow behaviour downstream the VG location. As a consequence, the computational time required for a high fidelity 3D computational simulations is very large. In recent years, there have been efforts to create models that allow the computation of the VGs effect without grid them. Reducing this way the computational effort. During this thesis a semi-empirical model, the Wendt model, was implemented in OpenFOAM and later analysed and compared with gridded VG simulations. The Wendt model is used to predict the vortex circulation and peak vorticity. These entities are then used to calculate the vortex velocity profile at a certain position downstream the VG location. In this projects besides the predictive capabilities of the model, it was tested the hypothesis that to mimic the flow behaviour of a gridded VG simulation, it is enough to impose a vortex velocity profile at a certain position downstream the VG location. It was seen that the Wendt model is able to predict reasonably well peak vorticity and circulation on the tested parameter range, but for higher values of freestream velocities and lower values of height-to-boundary-layer-thickness-ratio and aspect ratio. Furthermore it was seen that, although the implemented model produce inconsistent flow results, the implementation made can be used for that propose. With the correct vortex circulation, peak vorticity and vortex position inputs, it is possible to mimic the correct vortex development as well as the correct flow behaviour, but only far from the VG location, where the influence of the vanes in the streamwise velocity is no longer relevant.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor)","2017","The repeatability of precision positioning systems can be improved by reducing the effects of stick-slip in the system. Stick-slip effects introduce a spontaneous jerking motion when overcoming the static friction coefficient, creating accelerations that are hard to predict. Contactless bearing types, such as magnetic levitation or fluid bearings, can be used to prevent stick-slip effects from occurring. Ferrofluid bearings provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional contactless bearing systems. The bearing is created by applying ferrofluid to a permanent magnet. The fluid gathers at the highest magnetic field intensity, resulting in a load-bearing ring at the edges of the magnet. Due to the uncertainty in the modelling of the in-plane friction behaviour of a ferrofluid bearing, the expected friction force is multiplied with a safety factor during design. In this research the model for the in-plane friction behaviour of a ferrofluid bearing is experimentally validated. The experimental validation will be performed on a modified version of the six degrees of freedom demonstrator stage of Cafe(2014). This stage is well-suited for ferrofluid research due to its high accuracy and versatility as a result of the actuation and control in six degrees of freedom.","Ferrofluid; Bearing; Mechatronics; Precision; Positioning; Validation; Friction; behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Mechatronic System Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","The west part of the Netherlands is built in a river delta area. The ground in this area consist of sediment which is deposited by the rivers over the years. This soft soil is not stable enough to support simple foundations for structures, so for centuries people have used timber foundation piles to support structures on the stronger sand layers below the weak soil. However these piles start to degrade when they are no longer fully submerged resulting in high cost for home owners and uncertainties about the structural safety of buildings. Goal of this thesis is to find a prediction method to be able to predict the remaining strength of timber foundation piles. This is done by answering the main research question: ‚ÄúWhat is the state of the timber foundations regarding the residual strength in the dedicated foundation risk areas of Rotterdam, can there be made more accurate estimates using certain parameters and measurement methods?‚Äù In Rotterdam it is very specific which foundations are heavily degraded and failing in their function of carrying the above structures. Timber piles which are just meters apart can have different levels of degradations. For this reason the foundation risk areas as defined by the municipality of Rotterdam can only be used as a map were timber foundations occur. The risks as defined in this map are not accurate. It is just an indexation of were troubles with timber foundations have occurred and how many of the total timber foundations in these areas have failed. A better method is to constantly monitor the sag of the structures. This is possible nowadays and is already done by Rotterdam with the help of satellites. If the sag of the foundations becomes unacceptable, for instance to the extent of structural damage, the municipality has to intervene. At this point a foundation inspection has to be done which can be done with the F3O standardised method. In this thesis this method is updated with a different procedure to determine the remaining timber strength of the foundation piles. To update the standardised method of F3O at first the theoretical background of the subject is set. The different parameters contributing to the failure are investigated for the different parts of a pile foundation. The parts which are investigated are the upper structure, the kesp, the pile head, pile shaft and pile tip. After this background research actual experiments on timber piles are done. For this thesis tests were done on 7 timber pile heads which have been in use since 1902. Goal was to find a method to determine the residual strength of the pile head. Visual inspection, probing, CT-Scanning and IML-Resi measurements have been done to determine the most reliable procedure for estimating remaining strength. It is found that a combination of methods leads to the best prediction of the strength. All methods have their own pros and cons and by combining them the most efficient procedure can be determined. The IML-Resi measurements can detect the degradation pattern as it occurs in timber piles in an accurate way. However basic inspections like probing and visual inspection have to be used to determine the location of the IML-Resi measurements. Nowadays the Pilodyn is used to determine the degradation of in use piles. This method only provides information of the outer layer of the timber pile. With the use of the IML-Resi the total cross section of the timber pile is tested. Which leads to detailed information into the total pile degradation pattern. Making it possible to determine whether or not the pile follows a uniform or non-uniform degradation pattern, which is not possible with a Pilodyn test. The resistance the IML-Resi measures when penetrating the timber can be related well to the remaining strength of the timber piles. Making the use of adjusted safety factors when dealing with timber piles foundation unnecessary. The tested piles showed timber properties which are comparable with new timber. This all making it possible to accurately determine the extent of degradation and the remaining strength of a timber pile at any specific moment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The MRI scanner with an ultrahigh magnetic field of 7T not only increases the image resolution but it also increases the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of the patient. In other words, the body temperature of the patient increases due to the absorption of heat produced by the 7T MRI scanner. This is dangerous for the health of the patient. In order to ensure that the SAR level of the patient does not exceed the acceptable limit, the body temperature of the patient should be monitored during the scan with a spatial resolution as small as possible. This way safety measures can be taken immediately if the body temperature increases. In order to monitor the temperature during the MRI scan, fiber optic sensors (FOS) can be used. The fiber optic sensors (FOS) are immune from electromagnetic interference and there is no electrical connection to the patient and thus it is safe to monitor the temperature during an MRI scan by using FOS [1]. However, the FOS may have a spatial resolution which is not acceptable for medical purposes. This study focuses on methods to increase the spatial resolution of an existing fiber optic temperature sensing system of a 7T MRI scanner. To increase the spatial resolution of the existing temperature sensing system two methods are evaluated, namely the total variation deconvolution method and the blind deconvolution method. This study shows that the total variation deconvolution method gives the best results for the input temperature estimate. The blind deconvolution method strongly depends on the initial guess of the impulse response of the temperature sensing system, which is difficult to find. Therefore the results of the input temperature and the impulse response are less reliable when using the blind deconvolution method. Also it is shown that the machine resolution gets worse when increasing the spatial resolution by interpolating the input temperature in the Fourier domain.","SAR; temperature; resolution; resolution; MRI; Raman spectroscopy; FOS; safety; deconvolution; monitor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","Today‚Äôs climate warming is unequivocal. Evidence from observations and satellite records show that Arctic Ocean is losing its summer sea ice cover with a rapid pace and is dominated by young and thinner ice. The ice loss has already caused heating of the overlying atmosphere. At the same time, the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) surface mass balance decreases, due to increased surface melt and runoff. These changes have an impact on global climate and sea levels. This study investigates the role of Arctic sea ice changes on GIS surface energy and mass balance, with a global climate model the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The model includes component models with 1¬∞ horizontal resolution, for the atmosphere the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM4), for the land the Community Land Model (CLM4), for the sea ice the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE4) and for the ocean the Parallel Ocean Programme (POP2). A number of simulations that have contributed to the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is available to the public. The analysis in this study is mainly based on the first of the five ensemble members from the twenty-first-century simulations for the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and the twentieth-century all forcing simulations, by which the summer anomalies of sea ice, climate of Greenland and Arctic Ocean and GIS mass balance in the period 2080-2099 with respect to the 1980-1999 reference period are analysed. All five simulations project a nearly ice-free Arctic ocean in September around 2060 (mean value). The simulated 2080-2099 annual and summer mean near-surface air temperature over the Arctic increase by 7.7 K and 4.5 K respectively, with respect to 1980-1999 and summer warming is strongest in the areas of reduced sea ice. The decline in sea ice area causes open water formation with lower albedo and higher solar radiation absorption that enhances melting and heating. In addition, summer cloud cover and water vapour increase and together with the temperature increase lead to an increase in longwave downwelling radiation and a decrease in shortwave downwelling radiation. Over GIS the summer mean of the first increases by 20 W/m¬≤ and the second decreases by 14 W/m¬≤ in 2080-2099 with respect to 1980-1999. For the same period the net radiation increases by 5 W/m¬≤, snowfall by 7%, precipitation by 29% and mean summer snow melt by 31%. Although a direct local or temporal connection of sea ice retreat and GIS regional climate change and surface melt was not found, sea ice changes influence Arctic climate and consequently GIS.","sea ice retreat; Greenland Ice Sheet; Arctic sea ice; climate change; melting","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geosciences and Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Because of its proven beneficial material properties, Alloy 617 is the most promising material for the use in pressurised steam boiler components subject to cyclic loads and temperatures that are increasing due to an improved process efficiency. The result of this research project is the successful expression of the material properties of Alloy 617 into temperature-stress-time-dependent equations and the formulation of damage accumulation by all relevant damage mechanisms. All considerations and assumptions for the compilation of the equations have been discussed and concluded, which grants an unconditional use of these equations up to 800 oC. The accumulation of damage is maximised by the limits of the ASME design code. A material model is created in FE software program ANSYS based on the material property equations. Also, the damage accumulation equations and most design code‚Äôs limits are built into this material model. Simulations have been run and the results are as expected and satisfactory. A Toolbox is constructed that provides a fast and accurate one-page overview of the calculated material properties, damage accumulation and fulfilment of the design code‚Äôs requirements. For several reasons, analysis of design calculations can be done in the Toolbox rather than in ANSYS. This Toolbox is validated using the FE simulations and can easily be extended with other materials next to Alloy 617.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Laminated bamboo could be a promising material when it comes to large span roofing structures where often truss structures are adopted. It is assumed that connection design used for timber trusses can also be applied in laminated bamboo trusses. For this research truss nodes with slotted-in steel plates are considered. This research will focus itself on the effect of using multiple fasteners in a row in laminated bamboo connections with a single slotted-in steel plate. As a starting point, the possible failure modes and methods for predicting the load-bearing capacity of a single fastener timber connection are assumed to be also applicable to laminated bamboo. Timber can show ductile and brittle failure modes. Ductile failure modes are described by the European Yield Model (EYM) which was first published by Johansen in 1949. Three different failure modes can be distinguished in the EYM, where mode 1 represents pure embedment failure, mode 2 is failure due to one plastic hinge in the fastener per shear plane and mode 3 shows two plastic hinges per shear plane. The brittle failure modes that can be distinguished are splitting, shear plug, tension failure of the net section and group tear-out. The capacity of a multiple fastener connection might not equal the capacity of a single fastener connection multiplied by the number of fasteners. The main parameters that might influence the load-carrying capacity of multiple fastener joints are the inaccuracies in manufacturing, fastener spacing and end distances, dowel slenderness ratio and the plastic behaviour of the fastener. The testing methods for determining the strength en deformation characteristics of laterally loaded connections with dowels in load-bearing timber structures are used for this research. The objective is to study the influence of the number of fasteners in one row on the load carrying capacity of a steel to laminated bamboo connection. The design of the test pieces is based on the European Yield Model (EYM) where three different failure modes can be distinguished. In order to accomplish this, 9 test series are performed with a variation in the number of fasteners in one row (i.e. 1, 2 and 3) and a variation in thickness of the laminated bamboo members (i.e. 15 mm, 43 mm and 90 mm). The test results show that laminated bamboo connections with a slotted-in steel plate and thin bamboo members have limited deformation capacity and tend to show premature brittle failure due to a shear plug. A clear plastic branch in the load slip diagram of the test series where a single fastener and a member thickness of 15 mm is used, indicates that there is some amount of embedment prior to fracture. In case of two dowels in a row this plastic branch shortens and in case of three dowels in a row no plastic behaviour was observed. The limited deformation capacity of these type of joints (especially when multiple dowels in a row are used) makes the applicability of the EYM for a laminated bamboo connection where failure mode 1 is governing questionable. Plastic hinges did develop in the dowels in the test variants where failure mode 2 and 3 was expected. the EYM can quite accurately predict the capacity of a double shear laminated bamboo joint with a central steel plate where the dowel slenderness ratio is sufficient to achieve failure mode 2 or 3. The effective number of fasteners in a laminated bamboo connection was found to be higher than predicted with the equation given in EC5 irrespective of the observed failure mode. It is because of the decrease in deformation capacity that the load per dowel in a multiple fastener connection is lower than in a connection with a single fastener. The nef for laminated bamboo and several wood species was found to be in the same order of magnitude for a connection with three dowels in a row. The joint stiffness per dowel of a laminated bamboo connection with a slotted-in steel plate was found to decrease with increasing number of fasteners in a row. It also seems that the joint stiffness is higher in case of failure mode 2 and 3 than in case of failure mode 1.","laminated bamboo; moso bamboo; dowel; fastener; connection; bamboo; joint; truss node; slotted-in steel plate; multiple fastener connections; European Yield Model; EYM; Eurocode 5; EC5; joint slip; effective number of fasteners; plastic hinges; joint stiffness; slip modulus; embedment; embedment strength; moisture content; density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Dur√≥, G. (mentor); Penning, E. (mentor); Yuan, J. (mentor)","2017","Over the past centuries natural riverbanks have been transformed into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles to protect them from erosion, which led to disappearance of important river features for flora and fauna. River restoration projects show that the removal of man-made bank protections may lead to the formation of bars (e.g. Van den Berghe et al., 2012; Schirmer et al., 2014). Habitat diversity in rivers may be enhanced through the formation of river bars with preferably diversity in bar height, size and location. This research aims at gaining knowledge into the effects of removing riverbank protections on bar formation to enhance habitat diversity. Mobile-bed flume experiments were performed in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. The experiments were focussed on bar formation related to three variables of a bank protection removal; length, location and flow asymmetry. Geometrical and morphodynamic characteristics were selected for the experiment having a bar mode of one to obtain a system with alternate bars (Crosato and Mosselman, 2009) and showed gravel-bed river similarity based on bankfull river characteristics of Parker (2004). The experimental flume consisted of a 6.2 metre long and 0.2 metre wide straight channel with 0.5 metre wide floodplains on the sides. On both sides of the channel, bank protection could be removed over a limited length with optionally a groyne upstream. After seven hours at the end of each test, photos of the bed topography were taken and the longitudinal bed profile was measured. Bar wavelengths and bar heights in each experimental test were determined from detrended bed profiles. The bar height was divided in two classes: low and high. The areas of low bars, high bars, floodplains and the deep channel were determined from photos of the final bed topographies. Bar types were indicated with terminology from Dur√≥ et al. (2015) as forced, free or hybrid. Removal of bank protections resulted in lateral erosion of channel banks over a limited length. The eroded bank line moved in downstream direction, which agrees with the downstream meander migration observed in field and laboratory investigations by many authors (e.g. Odgaard, 1987). Scour holes developed downstream of the widened section, due to turbulent eddies forced by the channel geometry. In the widened reach, flow decelerated which resulted in a lower sediment transport. Consequently, sediment was deposited in the widened reach and caused rising of the mean bed level along with formation of bars. In areas with higher flow velocities an increased sediment transport deepened the channel. When the riverbanks were fixed, relatively low, small, side bars were formed in the channel. In general, the total bar area and bar height increased for an increase in channel widening, due to the removal of bank protection. An increased bank protection removal length up to nine times the channel width or an upstream asymmetrical flow forcing, i.e. groyne, increased the total bar area, whereas a bank protection removal at three different locations with a total length of nine times the channel width did not significantly increased the total bar area. It is recommended to remove riverbank protections over a length of at least nine times the river width on both sides of the river with optionally a groyne upstream as a measure to enhance habitat diversity. It is also valuable to remove the bank protection on one side of the river only. It is advised to construct a groyne upstream of the bank protection removal to increase habitat diversity. This research led to results that can be used in further research. It is advised to conduct larger scale experiments and eventually move to the field.","River morphodynamics; River bar; Bank protection; River restoration; Habitat diversity; Laboratory experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Multi-storey timber buildings are becoming internationally more and more common. The thriving forces behind this trend involve the sustainable aspects of the material and the rapid development of innovative engineered timber elements. An example of an engineered timber element are crosslaminated timber (CLT) panels. CLT panels consist of cross-wise glued layers of timber to obtain panels that can be used as wall and floor elements. Another innovative trend is the modular construction method. This method is based on the prefabrication of modules as building compartments, which can be stacked on-site to form a cellular building type. Reasons for this trend, are the increased building speed and the benefits of repetitive fabrication in a controlled environment. The first application of a modular multi-storey timber building is Hotel Jakarta in Amsterdam, for which construction started in 2016. This building was the reason for this master thesis, in which the following question was formulated. What is the structural behaviour of a cross-laminated timber module system, how can it be designed and is it possible to construct a ‚Äòself-supporting‚Äô system of modules for a tall timber building? In order to answer the research question, a literature research has been done to investigate the aspects involved with tall timber buildings, modular construction, the material cross-laminated timber and the connections. Then a universally applicable module with a concrete floor slab and CLT walls and ceiling elements was specified. A design case of 8 modules in height and 8 modules in width, placed onto a concrete podium structure, has been investigated. To examine the structural behaviour of the modular assembly in terms of deformations and force distribution a 3D finite element model was made. Then, by using the obtained knowledge, resistance calculations have been made to find the critical limits for this design case. For this design case it was proven that a multi-storey modular cross-laminated timber building composition is a structurally viable solution. The limiting factors for maximum building height and maximum slenderness are, the fire situation in relation to buckling of the side wall, the connection strength of the stabilization wall and the maximum deformation due to rotation of the stabilization wall involving bending of the floor and ceiling element.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Timber Structures and Wood Technology","",""

Nowadays sustainability is an aspect we cannot deny and is logically of huge importance for this design proposal. Therefore a design strategy is chosen: emotionally durable design. With an emotionally durable design, attachment and trust will be created by the product's function and aesthetic appearance. This way the consumer will never just throw away and replace the product. With all the information gathered during the analysis a design vision is created: Create an aesthetically appealing and dynamic lighting design that provides a comforting and energizing atmosphere at the consumer‚Äôs home. Methods are used to create ideas, to create partial solutions and to choose the ideas with the most potential. It becomes clear that using warm white and cold white light in one lighting design is a good idea to accomplish the goal of providing the right light for every time of the day. The chosen idea to develop further is a concept that enables the user to turn the light direction 360 degrees and to switch between lighting temperature. Many iterations were needed to create the perfect design proposal. A detailed product proposal and visualization is created to give a clear picture of the design. For every component of the design the production is described and the costs are calculated. Four prototypes are built to perform a user test. The overall reactions on the product are very positive and it is decided to launch the product with a new brand called RAYMAKER. The name of the first product is twenty four and an implementation plan is written in the last chapter using the ‚Äúmarketing mix‚Äù strategy.","lighting design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integraded Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation method to serve the enhancement of well productivity. The fracture creates a high conductive pathway into the formation. This improves the flow performance, bypasses damage and possibly connects additional dynamic gas. In the Netherlands, 252 wells were hydraulically fractured since 1954. This constitutes less than 10\% of the amount of wells drilled in the same period. The objective of this project is to achieve more insights regarding the circumstances under which a hydraulic fracture is performed. The goal is to find a quantitative relationship that will lead to an improved performance for future fracturing campaigns. To that end, hydraulic fracturing treatments executed on vertical gas wells have been investigated through analysis of their production behavior. A repeatable method consisting of five steps has been defined. Firstly, the critical flowrate is determined by Turner's equation. This method has been selected to avoid modeling of huff 'n puff production behavior. The second step is the use of the Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) to predict a range of ultimate production volumes. It should be noted that there is often an absence of stabilized production trends within the production data. As such, Rate Transient Analysis (RTA) has been used to perform the final three stages. These stages consists of material balances, history matches and forecasts. Moreover, an economic evaluation to quantify the commercial effects of hydraulic fracturing is performed. With hydraulic fracturing typically featuring a production acceleration, the increment in net present value (NPV) is a robust measure to define the success of a fracturing treatment. In technical terms out of 38 investigated fractures, a total of 37 fractures had an increment in the productivity index (PI). An average increment factor of 2.8 has been determined after the well was fractured. Properties causing the highest increment in PI are low matrix permeability and a large fracture half length. The timing of the fracturing treatment has significant impact on the economic success. The earlier a fracture is set within a well's production life, the higher is the chance of economic success. Gas reservoirs depleted less than 35\% of their initial pressure show the highest gains. By analyzing wells that are immediately fractured, it came to light that the connected dynamic GIIP has a major influence on a positive incremental NPV. Another important factor for economic success are the fracture properties. All fracturing treatments pumped with more than 100,000 kg of proppant did yield high production gains. In addition to these effects, a relationship between half length and quantity of pumped proppant has been established. Last but not least, in the recovery factors of wells that were immediately fractured, an interesting trend has been observed.","RTA; Hydraulic Fracturing; Production Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The increasing number of solar panels mounted on roofs all over the world is a good development, but not fed by an architectural approach. The solar panels are an addition to the - by Koolhaas so-called - ""Junkspace"". Besides, somehow during the 1960s, we forgot everything we knew about the art and science of daylighting; cheap energy and air conditioning did us in. Many studies show us now the importance and benefits of daylight. Important for the best formation of roof daylight is to avoid direct light and allow diffuse light; in contrast solar panels require direct light. In this way a golden combination is found. It is important that there will be innovation towards a roof-mounted sunshading system which not combines, but integrates daylight and solar energy. A system that even allows comfortable, diffuse daylight as arranges a constant energy production. For this innovation a tracking system is an essential part. With the design for the Heros Daylight School on the Marineterrein in Amsterdam I would like to give an example how this integration of daylight and solar energy can be done in an aesthetic and eco-efficient way.","daylight; solar energy; roof system; school","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering +Technology","","Architectural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Gon√ßalves, M.G. (mentor); Sturkenboom, N. (mentor)","2017","This project explores a possible near future solution on how to improve sleep within young adults through the use of a data driven PSS (Product Service System). An extensive analysis was executed to create the necessary insights. First, the domain of sleep was explored in order to understand the physiology behind it. Next, a field research was created and executed to identify the cause for poor sleep in young adults. Then, the domain topic of PSS was explored to help in creating the data driven PSS. Finally, the Philips portfolio of solutions was explored. The analysis showed that young adults had poor sleep hygiene: usually they are on digital media during the late evening, which can hamper their sleep. Moreover, their dynamic life (i.e. career) can cause stress, which also obstructs their sleep. Poor sleep could then lead to non-optimal performance during the day, which was seen as crucial for young adults. Due to the fact that students are affluent, the focus was set on young professionals. Based on this, the following design challenge was created: ‚ÄúDesign a data driven PSS that helps young adults in the transition phase to build in a sleep preparing moment prior to going to bed ‚Äù In the synthesis, the solution space was explored. It became apparent that the environment, in particular light, should be manipulated to create a relaxing evening ritual: this is referred to as an intervention. Ideas were created to come up with ways to achieve the relaxing evening ritual. These ideas were then validated with 10 young adults. Non-pressuring, punishing or patronizing ideas were favoured by young adults. After the validation, the best ideas were evaluated. It became clear that some ideas were on another abstraction level than others, which were therefore renamed as blueprint concepts instead of interventions. These blueprints would be used as inspiration for the concepts that will be created in the conceptualization part. Next to that, the relevant data that should be gathered by the PSS is identified. The variables are divided into four categories: sleep quality, daily activity, evening activity and bedroom environment. Sleep quality contains the sleep variables that are measured during sleep. Daily and evening activity contain variables that are monitored during the corresponding times. Finally, the bedroom environment category contains variables that are measured in the bedroom environment during sleep. During the Conceptualization, two concepts were created: ‚ÄòPersonal advice‚Äô and ‚ÄòLearning from others‚Äô. The first one focuses on giving the user a personal advice based on the gathered data, while the other one incorporates a social platform that allows for people to adopt other peoples‚Äô evening ritual. These concepts were rated and ‚ÄòPersonal advice‚Äô was chosen as the most promising. This concept was elaborated and called Personal Sandman (Sleep Aiding and Data monitoring Assistant). Personal Sandman is detailed with the use of a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and a Service blueprint. It contains three products: Sandman Go (a wearable that measures sleep quality, daily and evening activities), Sandman Bedroom (a product that measures bedroom environment data) and a Philips Hue (used to execute the intervention). Alongside, a business model was created and validated with young adults to create an idea of how Personal Sandman should be sold. In the Validation part, Personal Sandman was validated in the last part of the report regarding to its usability. In order to do that, a prototype has been built to let five participants experience Personal Sandman. Due to its complexities, the data driven aspect of Personal Sandman was left out in the prototype. In general participants experienced the prototype as pleasant, yet with most participants the dimming of the lights was not noticed. On the other hand, the use of light as guidance throughout the breathing exercise, was considered as positive. This report is ended with a set of recommendations. The most important ones are the data aspect and the business model. For the data it is important to identify to what extent the data is actually important to be measured. Based on this, the system could be made less complex. The business model is also important, especially when keeping the focus on the intended target group: young adults. The system as is designed required a large amount of data to be collected, which makes the system more complex and thus more expensive. These two aspects should be accounted for in future development of Personal Sandman.","data driven PSS; Sleep; young adults","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design Aesthetics","",""

(mentor); Weaver, T. (mentor)","2017","Grounded on the design premise of the monastery type, by which circulatory elements aggregate different programmatic spaces into one autonomous collegial complex, the corporate campus is proposed as an urban generator for the residential suburbia. We live in suburbs that were designed to escape the predicament of cities and go to work in the comfortable confines of corporate space. Today, as the public man gradually falls, we as urban planners and architects are restricted to only reproducing that; either suburbia or corporate space, with no tangential moments between the two. Silicon Valley, although known for its corporate activity, is a grand example of the parallel existence of both these types of space. The mundane suburban condition is a well known one; private plots belonging to private people, on top of which repetitive prefabricated homes keep them inside. Corporate space is by default private, as it serves only the numbers of the corporation‚Äôs family. Corporate campuses have been celebrating their Edenic hortus conclusus type since their moment of their conception in the 50s; However today, inasmuch as isolation is still considered a strong stimulus for the mind of the employee, equally or more so does the communication with and input from different people. The original idea of the campus advocated for this ambivalence. Found in medieval colleges and monastic complexes, the campus utilized a different set of design tools, such as that of the cloister, the corridor and the courtyard, to clearly define the boundaries of each space, but as a part of a whole. The project rethinks the well circulated corporate model, so as to reestablish the present relationship between traditionally introvert privately owned space and the public. In the same way a city acts and reacts, a figure-ground reading of the proposal reveals the clash of an ordinary, closed suburban system of repetition with the complex geometry and receptive character of the campus. The proposed model benefits all; the company merits from leasing its space to smaller local businesses of diverse character that populate its center, and the surrounding suburbia enjoy the amenities of a city. For this to happen successfully, spaces are generic enough so as to target a wider range of possible renters, but specific enough to indicate an urban program. The position and concurrency of adjacent programs creates different topical dynamics that vary with time and are expressed and generated via the communal spaces. The urban is the only landscape complex, diverse and rich enough to spawn communication between dissimilar types of people. Ultimately, the project aims to a certain kind of eugenicism: designing the ethics of the corporate world towards its proximate environment, and by extension, the morals of the contemporary worker.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","The Berlage Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

Currently there is a wide variety of tools available of made within companies. But they commonly lack the possibility for iterating and teamwork. Furthermore many of these scripts make use of optimization. However the conditions are often not specified, which results in nontransparent decision making. The result can be used as a way to identify possibilities in the manufacturing of geometrically complex projects. It will give insight in the combination of different design considerations with a focus on engineering aspects. It will streamline the process to compare different outcomes and priorities. The specific challenges will be used to draw a more general conclusion. Approach to these challenges is a symbiosis of case studies and surveys. The results and experiences from these aspects will be combined to develop a general workflow proposal and a more specific workflow for the delegated company. The case studies come from the portfolio of Royal IHC Architectural Fabrication. The three cases have an increasingly complexity in their challenges. These cases are analyzed to distill their key opportunities for optimization. Following a parametric strategy is developed and described to measure these goals. This can be a combination of objective and subjective goals, which created the need for human consideration. The results of this analysis are then compared by recording the genome and fitness data. The data is visualized in coordinate systems, that assist in making decisions. Filters are then be applied to either the parameters or the fitness in order to find a spectrum for further assessment. The surveys were taken at a spectrum of companies related to architectural design. To create the material for the surveys, draft results of the case studies were used. The surveys takers were confronted with the results the optimizations and asked to respond in respect to the used strategy. The first survey was taken during the time of the running case studies. This way results could directly be implemented in the research. The second survey was done with the results in retrospect. A draft of the proposed workflow was presented and explained. Takers responded with their professional opinion on this strategic matter. The proposed strategy is based on a layered structure. Optimize and review using the three different categories. By clearly visualizing the date all solutions can be considered properly. Furthermore, create a workflow library that is company or project specific. Make use of this library in a structured script.

(mentor); Verbree, E. (mentor)","2017","For nearly 200 years the Netherlands‚Äô Cadastre, Land Registry and Mapping Agency ‚Äì in short ‚ÄòKadaster‚Äô has been the organization that registers and maintains all legal rights concerning property in the Netherlands. An elementary part of its activities is the spatial description of parcels that are built up by boundaries which are surveyed in the field and depicted on the Dutch cadastral map. Nowadays this is an open source digital map which provides an overview of the cadastral situation for the entire country. The map exists of unique representations of all cadastral boundaries and parcels. It must be pointed out though that these locations are only depicted by approximation, which is caused by several factors. The most precise location of a boundary still remains the original survey data in the field, which is documented on separate survey documents. In the Dutch cadastral map every parcel has its own number, which is the link to original survey documents. Relating the boundary on the map to the correct survey data happens by intuition. This is feasible when cadastral situations are documented from scratch. However the Dutch cadastral situation is dynamic; parcels can split and merge, which results in new numbers and extra survey documents. As a result searching for survey data is getting more and more complex. Additionally the Kadaster has used different survey techniques over time offering different meta data, administration and accuracy. The survey data have been stored at different locations. Also boundary reconstructions lead to extra survey documents for one boundary. All these factors together have decreased the interaction and overview of quality. This thesis presents a research to design a data model which relates all survey data directly to its boundaries in the Dutch cadastral map instead of parcel numbers. As a starting point for this data model requirements are defined, which are based on preliminary investigation of the Dutch cadastral work flow. The requirements are establishing a link between survey data and the Dutch cadastral map, incorporating all survey methods, assuming more elements in the Dutch cadastral map as entities in their own right, the maintenance of topology, the maintenance of quality and the use of ISO standards. The design of the data model uses the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) as template. This is an international standard for land administration. This data model was adjusted to the situation of the Kadaster. This is a common method applied by cadastral organizations to improve their work flow. The LADM template offers solutions for generally upcoming cadastral issues as well as a data organization that is clearer and more accessible for externals. Nevertheless there are multiple approaches to solve the issues of the Kadaster by this template. This research will discuss several options to meet the stated requirements and deliberate on the best choice. Real Dutch cadastral cases are used to demonstrate how the final data model operates. At last a comparison is made with related cadastral systems abroad to reflect on its drawbacks and benefits. The final model can support the current work flow of the Kadaster by assuming boundaries as own entities. A direct link to its related survey data saves time, labour and expert knowledge. The model places similar objects in similar classes in order to increase overview. The data model may be a starting point for improvement of the Dutch cadastral map.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

(mentor)","2017","This project lobbies for the lobby, as a generous space in corporate cities capable of reversing the trend of atomization. Originating in capitalistic societies, lobbies are oddly socialistic entrances to mundane, stratified private spaces above. Formed in the gap between the ground and a hovering tower, the lobby is a distinctly modern type, conjuring notions of transparency, coexistence, continuity, and universal hospitality. These ideals are today challenged in highly privatized cities, where commodification has fragmented space: ground floors are surrendered to retail, lobbies reduced to corridors. But as private space is increasingly compressed in dense cities, and no longer offers a comfortable refuge from the world that it once did, the lobby provides a protective atmosphere as a means of escaping the cramped, superficial enclosure of the prison cell or the dysphoria of the street. A lobbyist uses specific projects to redirect a more general discourse. This project lobbies through the design of a lobby in Hong Kong, a privatized city where space is highly fragmented, a potential template of future cities. The ground floor of several office, hotel and residential towers are cleared of all shops and corridors to form a common lobby, combining circulation and space. Making a building publicly-accessible is beyond the agency of the architect, but it is possible to offer a clearing in the city. The project uses the frame to define spaces within a continuous interior. As opposed to other public interiors such as shopping malls or atriums, which enclose to negate the world, the lobby uses frames to allow foreground and background to coexist. The design of different frames with varying proportions, lighting, proximities and apertures constitutes a spectrum of spatial configurations. It is the one moment in a private development where space is designed in cubic meters rather than floor areas. The space is captured between the floor, a continuation of urban pavement; and the ceiling, the underbelly of the high-rise above. The grid emphasizes the seriality of the building and continuity through perspectival horizon, while mimicking the facade in the depth of its members. Sound-absorbing walls, ceiling heights and elevation changes create edges while maintaining an overall consistency. The postwar avantgarde, epitomized in the Madison Avenue architecture of Mies van der Rohe and SOM, employed the machine aesthetic to create spaces of exception in dialectical opposition to the city. However, the true value of the serial is its ability to absorb superficial difference and create a subtle environment, and resist the fragmentation of cities into competing spectacles.","lobby; highrise; urban space; density; generic; figure-ground","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","The Berlage Center for Advanced Studies in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

Grote voorbeelden hiervan zijn de komst van de Industrialisatie, de woningcrisis na de WO 1 en WO 2 etc. Deze woningbouw problemen werd vaak opgelost door middel van repetitie van grootschalige massawoningbouw projecten. Echter richten hedendaagse project zich meer op hoe we deze problemen binnen het bestaand stedelijk weefsel kunnen oplossen zonder het bestaand weefsel te slopen. Als we kijken naar de cijfers valt het op dat deze groei van steden vergeleken met vroeger niet veroorzaakt wordt door de trek van gezinnen naar de steden maar voornamelijk door 1 of 2 persoonshuishoudens. Volgens het CBS nam het aantal van eenpersoonshuishouden afgelopen jaar toe met 38000 vergeleken met een toename van 17000 meerpersoonshuishouden. Dit betekent dat het aantal van eenpersoonshuishoudens 2x zo snel toeneemt vergeleken met meerpersoonshuishouden. Volgens het CBS zal dit aantal de komende jaren nog meer toenemen. Door deze sterke verandering van gezinssamenstellingen en toenemend woningprijzen en huurprijzen in grote steden ontstaat er binnen de woningbouw sector een behoefte naar andere type woningen. Daarom is de vraag ook hoe je deze nieuwe doelgroep van mensen betaalbare woningen kan aanbieden in groeiende grote steden. Door middel van het begrijpen en analyseren van het bestaande stedelijke weefsel en woningplattegrond geeft dit project een oplossing voor dit probleem. Het project reflecteert, analyseert en herontwerp de huidige standaard woningplattegrond en transformeert het in nieuw manier van wonen waar priv√© en publiek een andere dimensie en betekenis krijgen.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Dobbelsteen, A. (mentor)","2017","An increasing environmental concern and a growing interest of environmentally friendly and renewable materials is driving the growth of the bio-based composite sector. From 2010 to 2020, it is expected that the use of natural fibres as a reinforcement in composites will be doubled. Bio-based composites are already widely applied within the automotive and boat industry, as well as product design. Yet, the use of bio-based composites in architecture and building engineering is scarce. Nevertheless, the use of bio-based composites does show potential in the architecture and building engineering industry, having the 3TU bio-based pedestrian bridge project as a recent example which proves the possibilities with bio-based composites. But aside from the benefits of natural fibres as reinforcement in bio-based composites, such as renewability and high technical quality, there are challenges in the use of bio-based materials. One main concern is the long-term durability of bio-based composites, which is particularly important to understand to ensure the safety of load-bearing structures. This thesis studies the potentials and challenges of the use of bio-based composites in load-bearing structures. The major objective of this research is to define the mechanical properties of flax fibre bio-based composites and the effect of weathering on these mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of flax fibre bio-based composites were investigated through a series of mechanical testing, while the effect of weathering on the mechanical performance was researched through an accelerated weathering test. In this weathering test, the flax fibre reinforced bio-based composite has been exposed to ultraviolet light, changing temperatures and moisture. With the results of this research, it can be concluded that natural fibre reinforced composites are suitable for load-bearing structures. However, these experiments have also shown that weathering has a negative impact on the mechanical properties of bio-based composites. After being exposed to 808 hours of accelerated weathering, the tensile strength and the Young‚Äôs modules of the tested composites have decreased. Although accelerated weathering tests provide valuable knowledge about the possible weathering characteristics of bio-based composites, the translation to weathering in a real-life situation remains difficult and requires more extensive research.","accelerated weathering; Bio-based, composites; load-bearing structure; mechanical properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor); de Bruijne, M.L.C. (mentor); Elsinga, M.G. (mentor)","2017","First time buyers have an important role on the housing market. First time buyers namely determine a large proportion of the movements on the owner occupied market (Marwijk, Pellenbarg, & Ruiter, 2014, p. 7) and are necessary to create liquidity at the lower end of the owner occupied market (Neuteboom & Brounen, 2007). Currently first time buyers make limited movements , it is however unclear which factors shape preference and behaviour of first time buyers. In literature is found that household characteristics, market circumstances and policy can influence the preference and behaviour of first time buyers. The objective of this research is to investigate how factors related to household characteristics, housing market circumstances and policy interventions determine the preference and behaviour of first time buyers. The main research question is as follows: ""How do household characteristics, housing market circumstances and policy interventions drive the preference and behaviour of first time buyers on the housing market?‚Äù Housing market circumstances and policy are different per region. Therefore one region is analysed to investigate the potential influencing factors; the municipality of Rotterdam. To be able to reflect on the market and policy changes, there will be reflected upon past developments. This research makes use of the WoON data sets, which are cross-sectional household surveys conducted every three years. By using the three most recent datasets this study investigates the time period 2007-2015. During this time period there have been quite some alterations with regards to the context of the housing market. Characteristic of this time period is the starting of the housing crisis. Also the municipality of Rotterdam changed its vision on housing, and there were changes in the mortgage provision conditions. In order to gain insight into preference and behaviour of first time buyers and movers throughout these different time periods descriptive analyses and categorical logistic regressions are carried out using the WoON data sets. This quantitative analysis is focussed on the preference and choice of households between different tenure forms of dwellings; the rental or owner occupied sector. There is also focused on the preference and choice for various price classes of owner occupied dwellings. With the analyses the relations between these two aspects and the household characteristics age, income and household composition are investigated. The descriptive analysis gave the first indication of the relations between household characteristics and preference and choice. These indications are used to construct categorical binary logistic regressions. With the logistic regressions the effect size of the relation between household characteristics and preference and choice can be better estimated. The research has shown that a part of the preference and behaviour of first time buyers on the housing market can be explained based on household characteristics. In general there is found that with a higher income, age or household size preference and behaviour are more likely to move towards the owner occupied sector and higher price segments. The preference of (potential) first time buyers and movers tends to be quite continuous over the investigated time period. Apparently the changing circumstances do not severely influence the preference of a household, for behaviour there is more variation found. The logistic models show that a large fraction of the behaviour cannot be explained based on household characteristics. The context under which households develop their preference and behaviour is of large importance. The behaviour of starters and first time buyers is more shaped by market, economic and policy context than the behaviour of movers. The policy measures of the different governmental layers have different effects. Central government mostly influences the relation between income and preference and behaviour. Policy measures of the local government are more diverse than solely financial implementations; with building programmes, campaigns and other measurers, they interfere on the housing market. The municipality has the ability to steer the housing market towards their vision and ambition. However it is not clear whether this interference of the municipality leads to a shift in the preference and behaviour of certain groups or leads to movements of these groups towards other regions. The potential influence of the local policy is a potential issue for the province as it might affect the match between supply and demand. However the province does not have the instruments to intervene when such a mismatch occurs. It could be either an option to expand the instruments of the province or to change the responsibilities of the province. All these different policy but also economic and market circumstances shape behaviour and preference. Thereby the context contributes to the inability to explain the preference and behaviour of households based on household characteristics. Potential first time buyers are, when making choices on the housing market, to a large extent shaped by context.","first time buyers; housing policy; behaviour; regional governance; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Composite steel-concrete floor systems consist of a trapezoidal shaped steel deck, reinforcement and cast-in-place concrete. Depending on the span, height restrictions and application shallow or deep decks can be chosen. The shallow deck used within this thesis is the ComFlor75. Due to the low self weight, a bundle of steel decks can be lifted to the desired floor and the individual decks are placed by hand to the correct location. Shallow decks normally are placed on top of the supporting beams and one ComFlor75 can cover multiple spans. The deep deck used within this thesis is the ComFlor210, this deck type is usually integrated with the supporting beam by placing it on top of the bottom flange or a steel plate that is welded below the supporting steel beam. This allows for a bigger internal lever arm, while reducing the construction height. After reinforcement is placed in the ribs of the ComFlor75, meshes or additional reinforcement bars are placed in the top layer. This layer does continue over the support beams and creates a continuous floor system. Advantages of this composite steel-concrete floor system are: fast construction, low weight and a small construction height. At the supporting beams of this continuous floor, a hogging bending moment and vertical shear force occur. Within the Eurocode 4, the hogging bending moment and vertical shear resistance are calculated independently. The deep decks are not covered by the scope of the Eurocode 4. At a certain project (Case study: ‚Äútown hall - Almelo‚Äù) the authorities asked if the vertical shear could influence the hogging bending moment resistance as both were near the calculated resistance. This question is being answered by first looking into current researches [1; 2; 3; 4] and calculation methods. These have been used to find a suitable test setup. This test setup has been adjusted to practical values to cover the critical spans where M-V interaction could be a concern. A total of 5 experiments, 3 on deep deck (ComFlor210) and 2 on shallow decks (ComFlor75) have been conducted. In both cases first an experiment is done to determine the hogging bending moment resistance with a low vertical shear force followed by an experiment where the specimen was fully loaded by a vertical shear and a hogging bending moment. For the shallow as well as the deep decks no reduction in hogging bending moment was found. All specimens failed in bending, even though the specimens were loaded by a vertical shear force surpassing the vertical shear resistance based on the Eurocode 4 and calculations done in practice. For the deep decks a higher hogging bending moment was found compared to the calculated resistance. The steel plate underneath the integrated support beam was not included in the calculation, but did contribute. All 3 specimens failed close to the calculated resistance. It was concluded that with the maximum shear resistance V_Rd used in practice no M-V interaction was found. The actual vertical shear resistance V_U could be far greater than the conservative value of V_Rd used according to Eurocode 4 [5]. Under normal distributed load patterns other criteria will govern. Vertical shear can become critical at shorter spans, however this implies a significant high distributed force compared to common values. The question is if it therefore is of interest to know the exact V_U as it generally is not the critical criteria. There is therefore no influence of a vertical shear force on the hogging bending moment with a „ÄñV‚â§V„Äó_Rd. To get a wider statistical base more experiments are advised.","Vertical Shear; Bending Moment; Interaction; Stee; Concrete; Composite; ComFlor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel Structures","",""

Creating a new identity for the new museum was a challenge since it is located between two of Germany‚Äôs most important architectural icons of the 20th century: the Neue National Gallery from Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Das Philhermonie from Hans Scharoun. Creating another icon was tempting, just as most of todays new museums form new icons for cities to attract more visitors‚Ä¶ and generate more money. In my opinion there are enough iconic buildings at this location. Adding another icons at the centre of the Kulurforum would imbalance the relationships between the current buildings. I wanted to create a more modest building which mediates with the rectangular grid of the Neue National Gallery and keeps the dialogue possible between the Neue National Gallery and the Philharmonia possible. In search for this new identity I analyzed other national museums located in Berlin. I found out that the national museum played in German history an important role in shaping and strengthen the collective German identity. I decided that I also want to create a building that accommodates this process of strengthening the nations identity. Next to the fact that this building will bring together the collection of the 20th century art it will also bring together the diverse range of individuals that shape German society. A centre were people can socialize and discuss and grow as a community.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

Children with CP have difficulties with movement and/or a deviating posture. To increase the mobility of the child, physiotherapists use progressive resistance exercise training (PRE) to strengthen the leg muscles of the child. During this training the child has to do exercises like standing up from a chair and stepping on a block while wearing a weighted vest. When the child is making progress, the physiotherapist can add load to the vest to make the exercises a bit more difficult. Existing vests used during PRE training are unfortunately not functional: they are a hassle to put on, cannot carry enough weight, are not comfortable and children do not like wearing the vests. This project focused on the design of a user friendly weighted vest used during PRE training for children with CP.The design of the weighted vest comes in two sizes, which have a large range of adjustability to fit children between 5 to 10 years old. The vest consists out of a hipband that is hold into place with adjustable shoulder straps. The hipband is easy to adjust with Velcro. Unique of this vest is that most of the load is worn on the hips, which is closer to the center of gravity of the child making him/her more stable during the exercises. The load is attached to the vest with magnetic Fidlock connectors, which makes it really fast and easy to attach and remove load. A total of 10kg can be fitted on the largest size, which would be enough to train a child of 10 years old.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The aim of this BSc final project is to extend the charging capabilities of the station so that it can work with as many battery brands as possible, with more importance given to the more popular brands. Experiments were carried out on two types of batteries to gain an understanding of how they are charged. In order to realize a universal charger, initially a general concept was formulated, and then its subsystems were designed. Voltage and current sensors were designed to send data from a battery which is connected to the charging station to an Arduino microcontroller. This data can then be used to control a CC/CV (constant current/constant voltage) regulator and a current limiter in order to replicate a battery's original charger. In the end, not all subsystems could be implemented, and a working prototype was not realized, however much work was done that can be used in future designs. Three group members worked on this universal charger. Ron dealt with the microcontroller, the data lines and the charging protocols. Enzo was concerned with the CC/CV controller and the current sensor, as well as helped with the protocols. Bram was responsible for the CC/CV regulator, the current limiter and the voltage sensor.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor)","2017","The horizontal shear capacity of steel-concrete composite floors can only be determinedwith full scale experiments since no good theoretical model is available. Since the properties of the sheeting can change over time due to wear of the rollers, regular testing of the steel concrete slabs is therefore necessary. The last research on the ComFlor 210 is from 1993, so new research was conducted to control the results from the past and to get some new insights. In total 9 specimens where tested; three specimen with a length of 3.6 metre, three specimen with a length of 5.4 metre, 1 specimen with a length of 7.2 metre, one specimen with end anchorage and the last specimen did not have rib reinforcement, the first eight specimen did have rib reinforcement. The first objective was to determine the horizontal shear resistance of the ComFlor 210. To determine this resistance two methods where used, the first method was them¬°k method and the second method the partial shear interaction method. For the first method clear results from the experiments where obtained that can be used in practice. For the second method the values that where obtained can also be used in practice, but some assumptions are made to obtain these values. These assumptions should also be made if this method is used. The most important assumption is that the area of the sheeting that is affected by the embossments is 12.5%. In the thesis a modification is made to use the partial shear connection method in practice. The method the Eurocode prescribes is designed for shallow decks and using this would give a too large resistance. Determining the effective area of the steel sheeting was also an objective, therefore strain gauges were located on three specimens. With these strain gauges the strain could bemeasured at different locations of the specimen and an effective area of every specimen was determined. Two specimen did have 21 strain gauges and one specimen only 7 strain gauges. The specimen with 21 strain gauges did have approximately the same effective area but the specimen with 7 strain gauge did have a much larger effective area. This area is larger because the strain was measured at fewer locations whereby the maximum strain in the sheeting was not measured. With the results of the two specimen an estimation for the effective area could be made, however more research is needed for this subject. The results of this are therefore not used in other parts of this thesis. The effect of a practical detail of the end anchorage that is often used was also examined, it could be concluded that this end anchorage did increase the bending moment resistance of the slab with 18%. In the thesis is described how the effect of the end anchorage can be used in practice. Since only one experiment with end anchorage was executed, more research is needed for more statistical certainty, but it can be concluded that end anchorage does have a large positive effect on the shear length. The effect of the rib reinforcement on the bending moment capacity was also determined. In the thesis a calculation is used to determine the contribution of the reinforcement to the bending moment resistance. With this calculation the difference between the specimen with and without rib reinforcement could be explained, the determined influence of the reinforcement is a bit lower than the effect that the reinforcement does have in practice. The effect is a bit larger because the reinforcement holds the concrete together which does increase the longitudinal shear capacity. The last objective was to determine the bending moment resistance. Initially a long slab was used to determine the bending moment resistance, but the specimen with end anchorage did have a much larger bending moment at failure. With this it could be concluded that the long specimen did not fail on bending. since the cross section and properties of both specimen where essentially the same. The bending moment at failure for the specimen with end anchorage was lower than expected. This could mean that the calculation method for the bending moment capacity is incorrect or that this specimen did also not fail on pure bending.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel and Timber Constructions","",""

One is embedded in the other, yet not always present. Many complaints from architecture professionals can be heard about the power and negative impact of real estate on architecture and cities, but only few actually become involved in this issue. The building development in Czech Republic has been taken over by profit seeking real estate developers. The negative impact of the real estate development can be felt. The legislation does not provide contemporary rules to control how are buildings built. Municipality have no strategic plan, no requirements from developers. Architects have been pushed aside. Architects in present society are meant to be responsible for the environment, the built as well as the natural. Due to the lack of sufficient economic education, respectively real estate education, architects are losing battle to developers and are not equal partner on decision making process. Architects are easily dismissed in building processes. An architect with the knowledge of real estate development methods and tools is able to control, be engaged and be more equal partner in decision making processes of real estate development. Architecture with the knowledge of real estate can control the real estate market and become more useful to the built environment. Finding a balance between architecture and profit of a building can create better quality buildings with higher material and construction standards as well can create higher demand among future dwellers and contribute to higher spatial qualities of the cities.There is a wide field of possible involvement of an architect in order to influence the real estate market. The figure of the architect-developer, who is a synergy of architect and a developer in one person may be one of the next roles architects will be taking in the future. So can the architect-developer be a meaningful figure for the built environment? Can such figure help to improve the image of the built environment in the Czech Republic? Is it possible to merge high quality architecture with the economical feasibility of an architectural project?","Prague; architect; real estate developer; architect developer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

(mentor); Pijpers - van Esch, M.M.E. (mentor); De Nijs, G. (mentor)","2017","De wereldwijde verstedelijking heeft onder andere als gevolg dat er een toename is in het temperatuurverschil tussen het platteland en de binnenstad, ook wel het Urban Heat Island effect genoemd. In combinatie met de toenemende opwarming van de aarde zal het Urban Heat Island effect de komende jaren extremer worden, met onder andere als gevolg een verminderd comfort van zowel het binnen- als buitenklimaat in de steden. Uit eerder onderzoek blijkt dat PV-panelen geschikt zijn om het Urban Heat Island effect overdag met 0,4 ¬∞C (Salamanca et al., 2016) te reduceren, waarmee de gemiddelde intensiteit in Nederland overdag op maximaal 2,3 ¬∞C ligt (Steeneveld et al., 2011). Het huidige afstudeeronderzoek presenteert een rekenmodel, gekoppeld aan een beslismodel, waarmee wordt aangetoond hoe PV-panelen ingezet kunnen worden voor het reduceren van het Urban Heat Island effect in Nederland. Het rekenmodel dat is ontwikkeld om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden, bestaat uit zes gemodelleerde scenario‚Äôs voor de verandering van de totale- en piekwarmtestroom naar de stedelijke atmosfeer. Het rekenmodel is gevalideerd met behulp van meetdata uitgevoerd op een plat dak in Amsterdam. De onderzochte scenario‚Äôs bestaan uit een platte PV-paneel opstelling, schuine oost- en west PV-paneel opstelling en een schuine zuid PV-paneel opstelling. Ook is er gekeken naar een plat PV-paneel bij een minimale windsnelheid (0,2 m/s), normale windsnelheid (2,5 m/s) en maximale windsnelheid (5 m/s). Tot slot is ook een plat PV-paneel met bitumendakbedekking, betonnen dakbedekking en een schuine dakpannenbedekking geanalyseerd. Uit de rekenresultaten is gebleken dat PV-panelen de totale warmtestroom het meest reduceert bij een schuine zuid PV-paneel opstelling. Daarnaast blijkt dat voor de reductie van de piekwarmtestroom een oost- en west PV-paneel opstelling het meest effectief is. Daarbij kan een PV-paneel het best gebruikt worden op een betonnen dakbedekking bij een normale windsnelheid. In het beslismodel zijn de oppervlaktes van negen stadswijken in Amsterdam geselecteerd, geanalyseerd en vergeleken. Het bedrijventerrein Sloterdijk 1 en de woonwijk Da Costabuurt hebben de meeste potentie voor het gebruik van PV-panelen omdat er relatief weinig groen- en wateroppervlak aanwezig is, wat zorgt voor een hoge intensiteit van het Urban Heat Island Effect. Daarnaast bestaat een groot percentage van de wijk uit platte daken, het meest geschikte dakoppervlak voor de plaatsing van PV-panelen. Met behulp van de resultaten uit het rekenmodel, zijn de wijken getoetst op schaduw, zonnestraling en windsnelheid. Op basis van bovenstaande factoren kan een keuze worden gemaakt voor de meest geschikte daken waar PV-panelen op geplaatst dienen te worden, om zo het Urban Heat Island effect te reduceren. Het beslismodel met de daarin ge√Øntegreerde rekenresultaten, geeft dus de mogelijkheid om stadswijken te evalueren op de intensiteit van het Urban Heat Island en de potentie voor het gebruik van PV-panelen. Hiermee draagt dit afstudeeronderzoek bij aan een mogelijke verbetering van het klimaat in de stad. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op de toepassing van het beslismodel in andere grote steden. Gezien de potentie van het gebruik van PV-panelen boven betonnen dakbedekking, is het interessant om onderzoek te doen naar het gebruik van PV-panelen boven andere stedelijke oppervlaktes met veel massa zoals gevels en parkeerplaatsen. Tot slot kan het rekenmodel uitgebreid te worden, zodat het niet alleen de mogelijkheid heeft om een indicatie te geven van de invloed op het Urban Heat Island effect, maar de directe gevolgen van PV-panelen te modelleren.","building physics; Urban Heat Island; UHI; zonnepanelen; PV-panelen; solar panels; hitte eiland; urban design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Sustainable Design Graduation Project","AR3B025",""

(mentor)","2017","The purpose of this thesis was to find a (near-)optimal long-haul race strategy for the TU Delft Solar Boat, taking into account practical race conditions and very limited computing time. A race strategy details at what speeds the boat should sail throughout the race, and how long (if at all) it should stop to charge. Various methods have been employed to take this issue on: brute-force meth- ods (on the overall problem, and on subsets of the problem), particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and restarting simulated annealing. Smart smoothing algorithms have been adopted to make trends in the found solutions clearer, and to make found strategies more realistic. The major finding was that all good strategies proposed a rather constant speed scheme: at optimality the boat‚Äôs speed should be (near-)constant. This result led to the conclusion that the problem of finding a (near-)optimal long-haul race strategy for the TU Delft Solar Boat can be simplified to the problem of finding a constant speed and matching optimal stopping points. Good solutions to that problem can be found much faster than with the original problem, partially resolving the issue of limited computing time. Two methods have been implemented to take this simplified problem on, yielding very good results.","nonlinear optimization; solar boat; simulated annealing; restarting simulated annealing; particle swarm optimization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""
